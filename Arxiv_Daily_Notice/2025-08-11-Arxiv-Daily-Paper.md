 - **Abstract**
 We introduce CLAPP (CLASS LLM Agent for Pair Programming), an interactive AI assistant designed to support researchers working with the Einstein-Boltzmann solver CLASS. CLAPP leverages large language models (LLMs) and domain-specific retrieval to provide conversational coding support for CLASS-answering questions, generating code, debugging errors, and producing plots. Its architecture combines multi-agent LLM orchestration, semantic search across CLASS documentation, and a live Python execution environment. Deployed as a user-friendly web application, CLAPP lowers the entry barrier for scientists unfamiliar with AI tools and enables more productive human-AI collaboration in computational and numerical cosmology.

          Scaling K2 VIII: Short-Period Sub-Neptune Occurrence Rates Peak Around Early-Type M Dwarfs

 - **Abstract**
 We uniformly combined data from the NASA Kepler and K2 missions to compute planet occurrence rates across the entire FGK and M dwarf stellar range. The K2 mission, driven by targets selected by guest observers, monitored nine times more M dwarfs than the Kepler mission. Combined, Kepler and K2 observed 130 short-period ($P=1-40$ days) Earth to Neptune-sized candidate planets orbiting M dwarfs. K2 observed 3.5 times more of these planets than Kepler for host stars below 3700 K. Our planet occurrence rates show that short-period sub-Neptunes peak at $3750^{+153}_{-97}$ K and drop for cooler M dwarfs. A peak near this location was predicted by pebble accretion planet formation models and confirmed here by observations for the first time. Super-Earths continue to increase in occurrence toward cooler stars and show no clear evidence of a peak in the host star range considered here (3200 K$-$6900 K). Our observations provide critical input to further refine planet formation models. We strongly recommend further study of mid-to-late M dwarfs with TESS and soon the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope and PLATO to identify additional small planet trends.

 - **Abstract**
 Current and upcoming cosmological surveys will produce unprecedented amounts of high-dimensional data, which require complex high-fidelity forward simulations to accurately model both physical processes and systematic effects which describe the data generation process. However, validating whether our theoretical models accurately describe the observed datasets remains a fundamental challenge. An additional complexity to this task comes from choosing appropriate representations of the data which retain all the relevant cosmological information, while reducing the dimensionality of the original dataset. In this work we present a novel framework combining scale-dependent neural summary statistics with normalizing flows to detect model misspecification in cosmological simulations through Bayesian evidence estimation. By conditioning our neural network models for data compression and evidence estimation on the smoothing scale, we systematically identify where theoretical models break down in a data-driven manner. We demonstrate a first application to our approach using matter and gas density fields from three CAMELS simulation suites with different subgrid physics implementations.

 - **Abstract**
 The search for the model or ingredients that describe the current vision of our cosmos has led to the creation of a set of highly favorable experiments, and therefore a great flow of information. Due to this torrent of information and the need to analyze it exhaustively, the main aim of this paper is to introduce the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) as a complement to traditional cosmological data analysis. The PSO is one of the most representative Bio-inspired algorithms as provides excellent robustness in high-dimensional or complex problems with relative simplicity and small number of parameters during the implementation. In this work we implemented two versions of the canonical PSO algorithm: global best and local best, to explore dark energy models in the light of Type Ia Supernovae and Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations observations, in particular, DESI and DESI+Union3 datasets. The results achieved validate the performance of the PSO algorithm in finding the best-fit parameters from observational data and confirm that PSO, under certain conditions, can deliver competitive results, at a fraction of time, compared to standard MCMC methods. Finally, the PSO output can also serve as a valuable input to the MCMC methods to speed up its analysis.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the X-ray and radio polarization study of the neutron star (NS) low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) GX 13+1 using the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) and Very Large Array (VLA). Simultaneous Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) observations show that the source was in parts of the Z state during our IXPE observations, exhibiting moderate changes in the hardness intensity diagram. The source exhibits X-ray dips in the light curve along with hints of polarization swings between the dip and non-dip states. The X-ray spectro-polarimetry results suggest a source geometry comprising an accretion disk component representing the softer disk emission, along with a blackbody representing the harder emission from the boundary layer (BL) or a spreading layer (SL). We investigate the geometry of GX 13+1 by considering our X-ray and radio polarization findings.

 - **Abstract**
 The Gaia DR3 catalogue includes line-broadening (vbroad) measurements for 10,387 eclipsing binaries. In this study, we focus on a subset of 977 short-period main-sequence systems with primary radii between 1.25 and 3 solar radii, effective temperatures from 5600 to 8000 K, orbital periods between 0.3 and 3 days, vbroad values from 30 to 300 km/s, eclipse depth ratios below 0.7, and eccentricity indicators |e cos(omega)| less than 0.1. We find a clear inverse correlation between vbroad and orbital period, consistent with tidal synchronisation and spin-orbit alignment. Comparing the Gaia vbroad values with the expected rotational velocities based on stellar radii, we find that the measurements are generally consistent with rotational broadening, albeit with a systematic offset of approximately 10 percent.

          Stacked Hybrid RNN-CNN Reconstruction of X-ray Influence on 21-cm Brightness Temperature

 - **Abstract**
 The X-ray photons substantially affect the thermal and ionization states of the intergalactic medium (IGM) during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR), thereby significantly influencing the 21-cm line observables such as its sky-averaged (global) brightness temperature. Nevertheless, the complicated dependency of astrophysical processes on a broad spectrum of parameters, including X-ray efficiency, spectral characteristics, and gas dynamics, makes precisely simulating the effect of X-ray flux challenging. Traditional approaches, including N-body and hydrodynamical simulations, are computationally intensive and struggle to explore high-dimensional parameter spaces efficiently. We present a stacked hybrid model trained on a specific simulation intended to reconstruct the effect of X-ray flux on the global 21-cm brightness temperature during the EoR. Along with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), this architecture combines two substantial forms of recurrent neural networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), therefore enabling fast adaptation to several X-ray flux levels. Without demanding repeated simulations, this emulator preserves temporal and spatial dependencies and generalizes to unseen parameter combinations. This matter reduces computation time by a factor of one million while preserving excellent prediction accuracy of 99.93\%, facilitating studies on high-dimensional parameter inference and sensitivity with an error margin of less than 0.35 mK. Our LSTM-GRU-CNN emulator combines recurrent and convolutional architectures to enable a robust and scalable analysis of X-ray heating effects on the global 21-cm brightness temperature during the EoR.

 - **Abstract**
 Relations between stellar properties independent of the nuclear equation of state offer profound insights into neutron star physics and have practical applications in data analysis. Commonly, these relations are derived from utilizing various realistic nuclear cold hadronic, hyperonic, and hybrid EoS models, each of which should obey the current constraints and cover a wide range of stiffnesses. Concurrently, the field of multimessenger astronomy has been significantly enhanced by the advent of gravitational wave astronomy, which increasingly incorporates deep learning techniques and algorithms. At the same time, X-ray spectral data from NICER based on known pulsars are available, and additional observations are expected from upcoming missions. In this study, we revisit established universal relations, introduce new ones, and reassess them using a feed-forward neural network as a regression model. More specifically, we mainly propose ``deep'' EoS-insensitive hypersurface relations for rapidly rotating compact objects between several of the star's global parameters, which achieve an accuracy of within $1\%$ in most cases, with only a small fraction of investigated models exceeding this threshold. While analytical expressions can be used to represent some of these relations, the neural network approach demonstrates superior performance, particularly in complex regions of the parameter space. Furthermore, we use the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method to interpret the suggested network's predictions, since is based on a strong theoretical framework inspired by the field of cooperative Game Theory. Most importantly, these highly accurate universal relations empowered with the interpretability description could be used in efforts to constrain the high-density equation of state in neutron stars, with the potential to enhance our understanding as new observables emerge.

          Photometric study of hot Algol-type binaries with long cycles

 - **Abstract**
 Double periodic variables (DPVs) are hot Algol-type interacting binary systems with an orbital and a long photometric cycle. The origin of the latter may be related to cyclic structural changes in the accretion disc that surrounds the gainer star that are driven by a variable mass-transfer rate. If this is the case, changes in the orbital light curve would be expected throughout the long cycle. We conducted a detailed photometric analysis of the light curves of 134 Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) DPVs to investigate variations in the morphology of the orbital light curves as a function of the long-cycle phase. We separated the two photometric cycles from the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) I band light curves for the systems. We thus compared the orbital light curves at opposite long-cycle phases, investigated the stability of the long period, and analysed the residuals of the separation process to search for significant frequencies above a 1% false-alarm probability threshold. We confirm that the DPVs OGLE-LMC-DPV-097 and OGLE-BLG-ECL-157529 change most strongly in their orbital light curves throughout the long cycle. By comparison, about 50% of the sample exhibits moderate morphological variations, in particular, around orbital phase 0.5. This is likely associated with structural changes in the accretion discs. In addition, we identified 18 DPVs with variable long periods, including 10 new cases. In some of them, the long period either increases or decreases continuously over time. For the first time, we found DPV systems that alternate between the two behaviours at different epochs. Moreover, we detected frequencies in the residuals that might be directly related to changes in the morphology of the orbital curves. Finally, some previously reported frequencies disappear when a variable long period is taken into account.

 - **Abstract**
 Here we present an automated method for obtaining wavelength calibrations for one-dimensional spectra, using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). DTW is a flexible and well-understood algorithm for pattern matching, which has not been widely used in astronomy data analysis. Employing a calibrated template spectrum as a reference, DTW can recover non-linear and even discontinuous dispersion solutions without an initial guess. The algorithm is robust against differing spectral resolution between the template and sample data, and can accommodate some spurious or missing features. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DTW in an automated data reduction workflow, using both simulated and real arc lamp spectra in a Python data reduction framework. Finally, we provide a discussion on the utility and best practices with the DTW algorithm for wavelength calibration. We also introduce the PyKOSMOS data reduction toolkit, which includes our DTW calibration methods.

 - **Abstract**
 Recently, the IceCube Neutrino Observatory has reported a deviation from the single power law in the extragalactic diffuse neutrino flux. A neural network-based event selection of contained and uncontained cascade events from IceCube, in which uncontained events have interaction vertices at the edge or outside of the detector instrumentation volume, has a factor ~3 gain in effective area over the cascade events used in the novel combined tracks and cascades selection which reported the deviation. Systematic improvements and rigorously updated modeling of the atmospheric neutrino background is incorporated into this high statistics contained and uncontained cascade event selection to clarify features of the astrophysical neutrino spectrum across energies from 1 TeV up to 100 PeV.

          Absolute Parameters of Young Stars: NO Puppis

 - **Abstract**
 The southern early-type, young, eccentric-orbit eclipsing binary NO Puppis forms the A component of the multiple star Gaia DR3 552\-8147999779517568. The B component is an astrometric binary now at a separation of about 8.1 arcsec. There may be other fainter stars in this interesting but complex stellar system. We have combined several lines of evidence, including TESS data from 4 sectors, new ground-based BVR photometry, HARPS (ESO) and HERCULES (UCMJO) high-resolution spectra and astrometry of NO Pup. We derive a revised set of absolute parameters with increased precision. Alternative optimal curve-fitting programs were used in the analysis, allowing a wider view of modelling and parameter uncertainties. The main parameters are as follows: $M_{Aa} = 3.58 \pm 0.11$, $M_{Ab} = 1.68 \pm 0.09$ (M$_\odot$); $R_{Aa} = 2.17 \pm 0.03$, $R_{Ab} = 1.51 \pm 0.06$ (R$_\odot$), and $T_{\rm e Aa} = 13300 \pm 500$, $T_{\rm e Ab} = 7400 \pm 500$ (K). We estimate approximate masses of the wide companions, Ba and Bb, as $M_{Ba} = 2.0$ and $M_{Bb} = 1.8$ (M$_\odot$). The close binary's orbital separation is $a= 8.51 \pm 0.05$ (R$_\odot$); its age is approximately $20$ Myr and distance $172 \pm 1$ pc. The close binary's secondary (Ab) appears to be the source of low amplitude $ {\delta}$ Scuti-type oscillations, although the form of these oscillations is irregular and unrepetitive. Analysis of the $ \lambda$ 6678 He I profile of the primary show synchronism of the mean bodily and orbital rotations. The retention of significant orbital eccentricity, in view of the closeness of the A-system components, is unexpected and poses challenges for the explanation that we discuss.

          The tidal interaction of an orbiting giant planet with a star near the Kraft break: the excitation of $r$-modes and the retention of orbital and spin angular momenta misalignment

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper we extend the previous work of Papaloizou \& Savonije on tidal interactions between a solar mass star and a closely orbiting giant planet which is such that the orbital and stellar spin angular momentum directions are misaligned. Here we consider the situation when the central star has a mass of $1.3 M_{\odot}$ and is in the vicinity of the Kraft break. We find and determine the properties of the lowest order $r$ modes and the tidal response arising from the secular non axisymmetric forcing associated with a misaligned orbit. We find that the response of the thin convective envelope, as well as the shift of $r$ mode frequencies from the low rotation frequency, limit can be understood by adopting a vertically averaged model that is similar to the well known one governed by the Laplace tidal equation for an incompressible ocean. From our results we are able to estimate lower bounds on realignment time scales for hot Jupiter systems with orbital periods in the range $2.8-5 d$ and rotation periods in the range $5-31 d$ that indicate the process is indeed markedly less effective than for a solar type star. This is on account of there being less dissipation in a relatively smaller convective envelope as well as the generally faster rotation and hence larger spin angular momentum expected for the more massive star.

          A D/H Ratio Consistent with Earth's Water in Halley-type Comet 12P from ALMA HDO Mapping

 - **Abstract**
 Isotopic measurements of Solar System bodies provide a primary paradigm within which to understand the origins and histories of planetary materials. The D/H ratio in particular, helps reveal the relationship between (and heritage of) different H$_2$O reservoirs within the Solar System. Here we present interferometric maps of water (H$_2$O) and semiheavy water (HDO) in the gas-phase coma of a comet (Halley-type comet 12P/Pons-Brooks), obtained using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). The maps are consistent with outgassing of both H$_2$O and HDO directly from the nucleus, and imply a coma D/H ratio (for water) of $(1.71 \pm 0.44)\times10^{-4}$. This is at the lower end of the range of previously-observed values in comets, and is consistent with D/H in Earth's ocean water. Our results suggest a possible common heritage between a component of the Oort cloud's water ice reservoir, and the water that was delivered to the young Earth during the early history of the Solar System.

          Origin of Ganymede and the Galilean Moons

Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

 - **Abstract**
 Ganymede and the Galilean moons formed in a small gas disc around the gas-accreting proto-Jupiter, known as the circum-Jovian disc (CJD). The formation process of the satellites occurs in three steps: the formation of the CJD from the accreting gas onto Jupiter, the transport of solid materials from the circumstellar disc (CSD) to the CJD, and the formation of the satellites inside the CJD from the supplied materials. Recent 3D hydrodynamical simulations have revealed the basic structure of the CJD. However, the detailed structures, which influence the transport of materials and the formation of satellites, remain controversial. Specifically, for the transport of solid materials, pebbles (~cm-m) drifting from the outer region of the CSD are trapped at the gas gap created by Jupiter and cannot be directly supplied to the CJD. There are two alternative mechanisms for supplying solid material: small dust particles accrete onto the CJD together with the gas, or planetesimals, which are less affected by the gas, are captured by the CJD. The satellite formation scenarios are also divided into two groups: satellitesimal and pebble accretion. In both scenarios, the growth timescale of the satellites (~0.1-10 Myr) depends on the continuous supply of material to the CJD. How to stop the migration of forming satellites is also an important issue. The combination of inward migration and its cessation is consistent with the resonant orbits of the three innermost Galilean moons. The compositional gradient and the degree of differentiation of the moons further constrain the proposed formation scenarios. However, none of the proposed scenarios has been fully accepted, and future observations, such as those from the JUICE mission, will provide stricter constraints to define the true origin of Ganymede and the Galilean moons.

          K2-18b Does Not Meet The Standards of Evidence For Life

 - **Abstract**
 K2-18b, a temperate sub-Neptune, has garnered significant attention due to claims of possible biosignatures in its atmosphere. Low-confidence detections of dimethyl sulfide (DMS) and/or dimethyl disulfide (DMDS) have sparked considerable debate, primarily around arguments that their absorption features are not uniquely identifiable. Here, we consider a different question from the astrobiology standards of evidence framework: Have we detected an authentic signal? To answer this, we analyzed previously-published, publicly-available JWST observations of K2-18b using independent data reduction and spectral retrieval frameworks. Our comprehensive set of reductions demonstrates that the MIRI transit spectrum is highly susceptible to unresolved instrumental systematics. Applying different wavelength binning schemes yields a potpourri of planet spectra that then lead to a wide assortment of atmospheric interpretations. Consequently, we offer recommendations to help minimize this previously-underappreciated instrument systematic in future MIRI reductions of any exoplanet. While the MIRI binning scheme adopted by Madhusudhan et al. (2025) supports a tentative detection of DMS/DMDS in K2-18b, we find that 87.5% of retrievals using our favored MIRI binning scheme do not. When considering the full, 0.7 - 12 micron transit spectrum, we confirm the detection of CH4 and CO2, and find the presence of DMS and C2H4 to be interchangeable. Moreover, we find that the tentative presence of large features in the MIRI transit spectrum is in tension with the more robust, yet smaller, features observed in the near IR. We conclude that red noise -- rather than an astrophysical signal -- plagues the mid-IR data and there is, as yet, no statistically significant evidence for biosignatures in the atmosphere of K2-18b.

          First Ultra High Energy Neutrino Search with a Hybrid Phased and Traditional Detector in the Askaryan Radio Array

 - **Abstract**
 The Askaryan Radio Array (ARA) is an in-ice ultrahigh energy (UHE, >10 PeV) neutrino experiment at the South Pole, designed to detect neutrino-induced radio emission in ice. It consists of five independent stations, each featuring a cubic lattice of in-ice antenna clusters spaced ~30 m apart and buried ~200 m below the surface. The fifth ARA station (A5) is unique due to its central phased array string, which employs an interferometric trigger to enhance sensitivity to weak signals otherwise buried in noise. This low-threshold trigger makes ARA the first in-ice radio neutrino experiment to demonstrate a significant improvement in detecting low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) radio signals. We present progress toward the first UHE neutrino search utilizing A5's hybrid detection capability, incorporating advancements in data selection and background rejection. This analysis is the first to fully apply dedicated event selection to both components of ARA's hybrid detector, improving directional reconstruction and significantly enhancing background rejection compared to previous analyses. This approach paves the way for next-generation in-ice UHE neutrino experiments.

          Formation of organic hazes in CO$_2$-rich sub-Neptune atmospheres within the graphite-stability regime

 - **Abstract**
 Super-Earths and sub-Neptunes are the most common exoplanets, with a "radius valley" suggesting that super-Earths may form by shedding sub-Neptunes' gaseous envelopes. Exoplanets that lie closer to the super-Earth side of the valley are more likely to have lost a significant fraction of their original H/He envelopes and become enriched in heavier elements with CO$_2$ gaining in abundance. It remains unclear which types of haze would form in such atmospheres, potentially significantly affecting spectroscopic observations. To investigate this, we performed laboratory simulations of two CO$_2$-rich gas mixtures (with 2000 times solar metallicity at 300 K and 500 K). We found that under plasma irradiation, organic hazes were produced at both temperatures with higher haze production rate at 300 K probably because condensation occurs more readily at lower temperature. Gas-phase analysis demonstrates the formation of various hydrocarbons, oxygen- and nitrogen-containing species, including reactive gas precursors like C$_2$H$_4$, CH$_2$O, and HCN, for haze formation. The compositional analysis of the haze particles reveals various functional groups and molecular formulas in both samples. The 500 K haze sample has larger average molecular sizes, higher degree of unsaturation with more double or triple bonds presence, and higher nitrogen content incorporated as N-H, C=N bonds, indicating different haze formation pathways. These findings not only improve the haze formation theories in CO$_2$-rich exoplanet atmospheres but also offer important implications for the interpretation of future observational data.

          Impacts of Atmospheric Carbon Species and Stellar Type on Climates of Terrestrial Planets

 - **Abstract**
 The climates of terrestrial planets are largely determined by the composition of their atmospheres and spectral types of their host stars. Previous studies suggest a wide range of carbon species abundances (CO\textsubscript{2}, CO, and CH\textsubscript{4}) can result from variations in reducing fluxes and stellar spectral types which influence photochemistry. However, a systematic investigation of how varying carbon species, particularly CO, affect planetary climates across wide parameter spaces remains limited. Here, we employ a one-dimensional radiative-convective equilibrium model to examine the dependence of planetary climate on the abundances of carbon species and host star type. We find that CO, due to weak absorption of stellar radiation, induces only moderate changes in stratospheric temperature, while its effect on surface temperature is negligible. Under Earth-like $p_\mathrm{N_2}$ (where $p_\mathrm{i}$ is the partial pressure on the surface of species i), for cases with fixed $p_\mathrm{CO_2}$, increase in CO leads to surface cooling on planets orbiting Sun-like stars unless the sum of $p_\mathrm{CO_2}$ and $p_\mathrm{CH_4}$ exceeds $\sim$1 bar. Whereas it results in surface warming for planets around M-type stars. When the total pressure of carbon species is fixed, converting CO\textsubscript{2} or CH\textsubscript{4} into CO always induces cooling. These effects arise from a combination of CO Rayleigh scattering, pressure broadening of greenhouse gas absorption lines, and \textcolor{red}{varying water vapor levels}. We further discuss how CO- and CH\textsubscript{4}-driven cooling (warming) can trigger positive (negative) climate-photochemistry feedback, influencing atmospheric evolution. Additionally, we suggest CO-rich planets may be less susceptible to water loss and atmospheric oxidation due to lower stratospheric water vapor content.

 - **Abstract**
 We conducted a sensitive acceleration search using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) techniques on full-length and segmented data from 84 observations of the globular cluster M13 with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). Employing a low detection threshold (2 $\sigma$) to maximize sensitivity to faint pulsars, here we report the discovery of two binary millisecond pulsars: J1641+3627G (M13G) and J1641+3627H (M13H). Both pulsars were detected during scintillation-brightened states, revealing systems that would otherwise remain undetected. For M13G, we obtained a phase-connected timing solution spanning 6.4 years, identifying it as a black widow system with an orbital period of 0.12 days hosting an extremely low-mass companion ($\sim 9.9\times 10^{-3}~{ M}_\odot$), though no eclipses were observed. M13H, however, shows significant apparent acceleration but was detected in only 2 of 84 observations; its extremely low detection rate currently prevents constraints on orbital parameters or classification.

 Since the discovery of the binary neutron star merger GW170817 and its associated kilonova, neutron star mergers have been established as a key production channel for $r$-process elements in the Universe. However, observations of $r$-process abundances as inferred from stellar spectra of Milky Way disk stars, together with chemical evolution modeling, suggest that additional channels are needed to fully account for the $r$-process element enrichment in the Milky Way. Neutron star-black hole mergers and fast-merging binary neutron star systems are among the leading alternative candidates. In this study, we combine gravitational-wave observations from LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA with data from short gamma-ray bursts, Galactic pulsars, and Galactic [Eu/Fe] vs [Fe/H] abundance observations to assess the contribution of these mergers to $r$-process enrichment in the Galactic disk. We find that neither neutron star-black hole mergers nor fast-merging binary neutron star populations can serve as the dominant additional channel without generating strong tension with existing observations and theoretical expectations. These results constrain the viable sources of Galactic $r$-process enrichment and underscore the necessity of non-merger production channels.

 - **Abstract**
 Low-velocity large-scale shocks impacting on the ISM may efficiently shape molecular clouds and trigger star formation within them. These shocks, both driven by galactic bubbles and/or cloud-cloud collisions, leave specific signatures in the gas morphology and kinematics. Observational studies of such signatures are crucial to investigate if and how shocks affect the clouds formation process and trigger their future star formation. We have analysed the shocked and dense gas tracers SiO(2-1) and H13CO+(1-0) emission toward the IRDC G035.39-00.33, using new, larger-scale maps obtained with the 30m telescope at the Instituto de Radioastronomìa Millimétrica. We find that the dense gas is organised into a northern and a southern filament having different velocities and tilted orientation with respect to each other. The two filaments are spatially separated yet connected by a faint bridge feature also seen in a position-velocity diagram extracted across the cloud. This bridge-feature, typical of cloud-cloud collisions, also coincides with a very spectrally narrow SiO-traced emission. The northern filament is suggested to be interacting with the nearby supernova remnant G035.6-0.4. Toward the southern filament, we also report the presence of a parsec-scale, spectrally narrow SiO emission likely driven by the interaction between this filament and a nearby expanding shell. The shell is visible in the 1.3 GHz and 610 MHz continuum images and our preliminary analysis suggests it may be the relic of a supernova remnant. We conclude that the two filaments represent the densest part of two colliding clouds, pushed toward each other by nearby Supernova Remnants. We speculate that this cloud-cloud collision driven by stellar feedback may have assembled the infrared dark cloud. We also evaluate the possibility that star formation may have been triggered within G035.39-00.33 by the collision.

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxy mergers are among the most energetic astrophysical phenomena, driving intense star formation and potentially fueling cosmic ray acceleration, which can produce high energy $\gamma$-ray emission through hadronic processes. We present a targeted search for $\gamma$-ray emission from five prominent galaxy merger systems, NGC~3256, NGC~660, UGC~813/816, UGC~12914/12915, and VV~114 using 16.8 years of Fermi-LAT data in the 1--300~GeV energy range. Employing a binned maximum likelihood analysis, we model the emission with power-law spectra and derive spectral energy distributions (SEDs) to constrain $\gamma$-ray fluxes and spectral indices. Marginal detections are found for NGC~3256 (TS = 15.4, $\sim$3.51$\sigma$) and NGC~660 (TS = 8.16, $\sim$2.39$\sigma$), with photon fluxes of $(7.21 \pm 3.17) \times 10^{-11}$ and $(8.28 \pm 3.56) \times 10^{-11}$ ph cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, respectively, suggesting merger driven star formation contributes to $\gamma$-ray emission. The remaining systems yield non-detections (TS $< 5$). This is the first targeted study of $\gamma$-ray emission from these aforementioned galaxy merger systems.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an analysis of solar wind dynamics based on Doppler spectral width measurements of X-band radio signals from the Japanese Akatsuki spacecraft. The dataset includes two solar conjunction occultation experiments conducted in 2016 and 2022, capturing the transition from the descending phase of Solar Cycle 24, a period of low solar activity, to the ascending phase of Solar Cycle 25, which exhibited moderate to intense activity. Our study demonstrates the utility of this technique for estimating both slow and fast solar wind velocities across different phases of solar activity. A key focus is the 2022 experiment, which probed the solar corona near coronal holes at heliocentric distances ranging from 1.4 to 10 $R_\odot$. We also investigate the impact of electron density estimates on the accuracy of solar wind speed determinations, underscoring the need for improved electron density modeling to enhance the robustness of such measurements.

 - **Abstract**
 Radiative transfer calculations have been produced over the years for many lines and continua in the UV wavelength range of solar and cool stellar atmospheres for a variety of conditions. Despite significant improvements in computing power and availability of atomic data over time, atomic models are often still limited in size and rely on approximations for data. There have also been inconsistencies in the way photo-ionisation and radiative recombination have been treated. Here, we incorporate into the Lightweaver radiative transfer code new data and updated modelling of atomic processes for the low charge states of C, Si and S. Data are taken from the CHIANTI database and other widely-available sources for the relevant elements. We show the significant impact this has on the UV continua in the 1100-1700Å region, especially for Si. The results are in much better agreement with averaged, quiet Sun observations, and remove the need to invoke "missing opacity" to resolve discrepancies. The present treatment has important implications for radiative transfer calculations and the model atmospheres used as inputs.

          Slantwise convection and heat transport in the icy moon oceans

 - **Abstract**
 Ocean heat transport on icy moons shapes the ice shell topography, a primary observable of these moons. Two key processes control the heat transport: baroclinic instability driven by surface buoyancy contrasts and convective instability driven by heating from the core. However, global ocean simulations cannot accurately resolve convection under realistic icy moon conditions and instead often use Earth-based convective parameterizations, which capture only vertical convective mixing and cannot represent rotation-aligned slantwise convection on icy moons. We use high-resolution convection-resolving simulations to investigate ocean heat transport by slantwise convection in a parameter regime relevant to icy moons, isolated from baroclinic instability. Total heat transport follows the Coriolis-Inertial-Archimedean scaling with an added latitude dependence. The vertical transport increases with latitude, and the meridional transport is poleward. These results indicate that slantwise convection redistributes heat toward the poles, favoring a poleward-thinning ice shell, qualitatively consistent with Enceladus's observed ice thickness distribution.

 - **Abstract**
 Exoplanets are organized in a broad array of orbital configurations that reflect their formation along with billions of years of dynamical processing through gravitational interactions. This history is encoded in the angular momentum architecture of planetary systems--the relation between the rotational properties of the central star and the orbital geometry of planets. A primary observable is the alignment (or misalignment) between the rotational axis of the star and the orbital plane of its planets, known as stellar obliquity. Hundreds of spin-orbit constraints have been measured for giant planets close to their host stars, many of which have revealed planets on misaligned orbits. A leading question that has emerged is whether stellar obliquity originates primarily from gravitational interactions with other planets or distant stars in the same system, or if it is primordial--imprinted during the star-formation process. Here we present a comprehensive assessment of primordial obliquities between the spin axes of young, isolated Sun-like stars and the orientation of the outer regions of their protoplanetary disks. Most systems are consistent with angular momentum alignment but about one-third of isolated young systems exhibit primordial misalignment. This suggests that some obliquities identified in planetary systems at older ages--including the Sun's modest misalignment with planets in the Solar System--could originate from initial conditions of their formation.

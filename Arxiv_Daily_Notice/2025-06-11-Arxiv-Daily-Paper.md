 - **Abstract**
 Pulsars have traditionally been used for research into fundamental physics and astronomy. In this paper, we investigate the expanding applications of radio pulsars in societal and industrial domains beyond their conventional scientific roles. We describe emerging applications in positioning, navigation, timing and synchronization, random number generation, space weather monitoring, public engagement, antenna calibration techniques, and leveraging extensive pulsar data sets generated by large-scale observatories. Such pulsar data sets have already been used to demonstrate quantum-computing algorithms. We evaluate the potential for compact radio receiver systems for pulsar detection by describing optimal observing bands. We show that relatively simple and compact receiver systems can detect the brightest pulsar, Vela. The equivalent of an ~4m-diameter dish with a small bandwidth operating around 700 MHz would be able to detect many more pulsars. Such a detector would be able to localise itself to around 10 km using pulsar navigation techniques. The space weather community requires direct measurements of the integrated electron density at a range of solar elongations. The only method to get model-independent values is through pulsar observations and we explore the possibility of measuring dispersion measures (DMs) and rotation measures with a range of telescopes (observing from low to mid-frequencies) as well as using a typical model to predict the variation of the DM as a function of solar radii. We review how pulsars can be used to produce random sequences and demonstrate that such sequences can be produced using the scintillation properties of pulsars as well as from pulse jitter.

 - **Abstract**
 We study Diffusion Schrödinger Bridge (DSB) models in the context of dynamical astrophysical systems, specifically tackling observational inverse prediction tasks within Giant Molecular Clouds (GMCs) for star formation. We introduce the Astro-DSB model, a variant of DSB with the pairwise domain assumption tailored for astrophysical dynamics. By investigating its learning process and prediction performance in both physically simulated data and in real observations (the Taurus B213 data), we present two main takeaways. First, from the astrophysical perspective, our proposed paired DSB method improves interpretability, learning efficiency, and prediction performance over conventional astrostatistical and other machine learning methods. Second, from the generative modeling perspective, probabilistic generative modeling reveals improvements over discriminative pixel-to-pixel modeling in Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) testing cases of physical simulations with unseen initial conditions and different dominant physical processes. Our study expands research into diffusion models beyond the traditional visual synthesis application and provides evidence of the models' learning abilities beyond pure data statistics, paving a path for future physics-aware generative models which can align dynamics between machine learning and real (astro)physical systems.

          Kinetically Coupled Dark Matter Condensates

 - **Abstract**
 Dark matter consisting of ultralight bosons can form a macroscopic Bose-Einstein condensate with distinctive observational signatures. While this possibility has been extensively studied for axions and axion-like particles $-$ pseudoscalars with masses protected by shift symmetry $-$ realistic models from string theory and other higher-dimensional theories predict more complex structures. Here we investigate a two-field generalization where an axion couples to a moduli field through its kinetic term, representing the phase and radial modes of a complex scalar field. We demonstrate that when this system forms a gravitationally bound Bose-Einstein condensate, the kinetic coupling produces dramatic modifications to cosmological evolution compared to the canonical single-field case. Most notably, the axion Jeans scale becomes dynamically dependent on the moduli field's evolution, fundamentally altering structure formation. By mapping existing observational constraints from canonical axion models to our two-field scenario, we identify regions of parameter space that are already excluded by current observations. In particular, consistency with observations requires that the moduli field must take on small field values, $\chi/M_{\rm pl} \ll 1$, throughout most of cosmic history for this class of axions to remain a viable description of all dark matter.

          The Epoch of Giant Planet Migration Planet Search Program. III. The Occurrence Rate of Young Giant Planets Inside the Water Ice Line

 - **Abstract**
 We present statistical results from the Epoch of Giant Planet Migration RV planet search program. This survey was designed to measure the occurrence rate of giant planets interior to the water ice line of young Sun-like stars, compare this to the prevalence of giant planets at older ages, and provide constraints on the timescale and dominant inward migration mechanism of giant planets. Our final sample amounts to 85 single young (20-200 Myr) G and K dwarfs which we target across a 4-year time baseline with the near-infrared Habitable-zone Planet Finder spectrograph at McDonald Observatory's Hobby-Eberly Telescope. As part of this survey, we discovered the young hot Jupiter HS Psc b. We characterize survey detection completeness with realistic injection-recovery tests and measure an occurrence rate of $1.9^{+2.6}_{-1.4}$% for intermediate-age giant planets ($0.3 < m \; sin \; i < 13$ $M_\mathrm{Jup}$) within 2.5 AU. This is lower than the field age occurrence rate for the same planet masses and separations and favors an increase in the prevalence of giant planets over time from $\sim$100 Myr to several Gyr, although our results cannot rule out a constant rate. A decaying planet occurrence rate is, however, strongly excluded. This suggests that giant planets located inside the water ice line originate from a combination of in situ formation or early migration coupled with longer-term inward scattering. The completeness-corrected prevalence of young hot Jupiters in our sample is $1.5^{+2.2}_{-1.1}$%--similar to the rate for field stars--and the 95% upper limit for young brown dwarfs within 5000 d is $<$3.6%.

 - **Abstract**
 The distribution of 21 cm emission from neutral hydrogen is a powerful cosmological and astrophysical probe, as it traces the underlying dark matter and cold gas distributions throughout cosmic times. However, the prediction of observable signals is hindered by the large computational costs of the required hydrodynamic simulations. We introduce a novel machine learning pipeline that, once trained on a hydrodynamical simulation, is able to generate both halo mass density maps and the three-dimensional 21 cm brightness temperature signal, starting from a dark matter-only simulation. We use an attention-based ResUNet (HALO) to predict dark matter halo maps, which are then processed through a trained conditional variational diffusion model (LODI) to produce 21 cm brightness temperature maps. LODI is trained on smaller sub-volumes that are then seamlessly combined in 512-times larger volume using a new method, called `latent overlap'. We demonstrate that, once trained on 25^3 (Mpc/h)^3 volume simulations, we are able to predict the 21 cm power spectrum on an unseen dark matter map (with the same cosmology) to within 10% for wavenumbers k <= 10 h Mpc^-1, deep inside the non-linear regime, with a computational effort of the order of two minutes. While demonstrated on this specific volume, our approach is designed to be scalable to arbitrarily large simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 Searches for supernovae (SNe) progenitors have relied on a direct detection of the star in fortuitous pre-explosion images. We propose an alternative method, using a combination of photometric stellar population fitting alongside integral-field-unit (IFU) spectroscopic analysis of the ionised gas to fully explore the SN environment and constrain the progenitor properties. Isochrone fitting of HST/WFC3 observations reveals the environment of iPTF13bvn contains two stellar populations with unique age ($\tau=\log{t [years]}$) and extinction ($A_V$) values, with the closest agreement found between past progenitor studies of iPTF13bvn and our oldest stellar population (P2): $\tau_{P2}=6.97^{+0.06}_{-0.06}$, a corresponding initial mass $M_{initial,P2} = 20.0 M_\odot$ and $A_{V,P2}=0.53^{+0.10}_{-0.08}$ mag. Further analysis with VLT/MUSE IFU-spectroscopic observations reveals no bright H II regions associated with iPTF13bvn, suggesting no immediate ongoing star formation. Extinctions derived from the ionised gas are a minimum of ~2.5 times higher than the resolved stellar population values, assisting in building a 3D picture of the environment. An analysis of the distribution of spaxel extinctions reveals increased variability in the environment of iPTF13bvn, on the edge of a spiral arm. Our study highlights the complex relationship between stars, gas and dust and how, when used in a holistic environmental analysis, they can begin to resolve degeneracies that have plagued past progenitor investigations. Specifically for iPTF13bvn, our results support a binary progenitor and a growing consensus for binarity as the predominant mass-loss mechanism for Type Ib SNe progenitors.

 - **Abstract**
 In this White Paper, we present the potential of the enhanced X-ray Timing and Polarimetry (eXTP) mission to constrain the equation of state of dense matter in neutron stars, exploring regimes not directly accessible to terrestrial experiments. By observing a diverse population of neutron stars - including isolated objects, X-ray bursters, and accreting systems - eXTP's unique combination of timing, spectroscopy, and polarimetry enables high-precision measurements of compactness, spin, surface temperature, polarimetric signals, and timing irregularity. These multifaceted observations, combined with advances in theoretical modeling, pave the way toward a comprehensive description of the properties and phases of dense matter from the crust to the core of neutron stars. Under development by an international Consortium led by the Institute of High Energy Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the eXTP mission is planned to be launched in early 2030.

          Photospheric emission from GRB 211211A altered by a strong radiation-mediated shock

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-ray burst (GRB) spectra are typically non-thermal, with many including two spectral breaks suggestive of optically-thin emission. However, the emitted spectrum from a GRB photosphere, which includes prior dissipation of energy by radiation-mediated shocks (RMSs), can also produce such spectral features. Here, we analyze the bright GRB 211211A using the Kompaneets RMS Approximation (KRA). We find that the KRA can fit the time-resolved spectra well, significantly better than the traditionally used Band function in all studied time bins. The analysis of GRB 211211A reveals a jet with a typical Lorentz factor ($\Gamma \sim 300$), and a strong RMS (upstream dimensionless specific momentum, $\gamma_u \beta_u \sim 3$) occurring at a moderate optical depth ($\tau \sim 35$) in a relatively cold upstream ($\theta_u = k_{\rm B} T_u / m_e c^2 \sim 10^{-4}$). We conclude that broad GRB spectra that exhibit two breaks can also be well explained by photospheric emission. This implies that, {in such cases}, the spectral shape in the MeV-band alone is not enough to determine the emission mechanism during the prompt phase in GRBs.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Be stars are rapidly rotating stars surrounded by a disc; however, the origin of these remains unclear. Mass and angular momentum transfer in close binaries account for the rapid rotation of a major fraction of Be stars, supported by the previous detection of low-mass stripped companions to them. The stripped companions can be helium burning subdwarf OB-type stars (sdOBs), and white dwarfs (WDs). Aims. The main objective of this study is to characterise the identified Be stars in the young open cluster NGC 663, and search for possible hot companions. Methods. We present the first ultraviolet (UV) photometric study of NGC 663 using far-UV (FUV) and near-UV (NUV) data from UVIT/AstroSat as a part of the UOCS series (XVIII). We identified 23 previously known Be stars in the cluster. Further, we utilised the spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting technique to derive the fundamental parameters and to search for UV-bright companions of the identified Be stars. Results. Our study reveals that 19 out of 23 Be stars show a significant UV excess, indicating the presence of hot companions. Here, we report the first detection of high-mass sdOB companions to Be stars, with 69.5% of them found in binaries within a cluster, offering direct evidence of binary interactions. Conclusions. This study showcases the key role of binary interactions in the formation of Be stars in clusters and provides insights into massive star evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a near-infrared spectroscopic and imaging analysis of the star-forming region IRAS 16475-4609, based on TripleSpec/SOAR spectroscopy and NEWFIRM/CTIO imaging, complemented by archival radio and sub-millimeter data. Our spectroscopic analysis indicates that the central source is an early B-type star (B0-B0.7V) powering a compact HII region characterized by strong HI and HeI recombination lines, and molecular H$_2$ emission. We derive a distance of 3.51$\pm$0.74 kpc, consistent with the position of the Scutum-Crux near arm at Galactic longitudes of $\sim$340$^\circ$. At this distance, the ionized gas traced by Brackett-$\gamma$ emission has a radius of 0.27$\pm$0.06 pc, placing the source in a transition phase between ultra-compact and compact HII regions. From radio data, we estimate an ionizing photon flux of N$_{ly}$=(2.3$\pm$0.3)$\times10^{47}$ photons s$^{-1}$, and an electron temperature of T$_e$=(5.4$\pm$0.2)$\times$10$^3$ K for the ionized gas. The analysis also reveals an obscured high-density molecular clump southwest of the HII region, coincident with an ATLASGAL sub-millimeter peak, indicating a potential site of ongoing and triggered star formation as the ionization front advances into the surrounding molecular material. These results suggest that IRAS 16475-4609 is a young high-mass star-forming region with stellar feedback actively shaping its environment, offering valuable insight into the early evolution of compact HII regions.

          AstroQ: Automated Scheduling of Cadenced Astronomical Observations

 - **Abstract**
 Astronomy relies heavily on time domain observations. To maximize the scientific yield of such observations, astronomers must carefully match the observational cadence to the phenomena of interest. This presents significant scheduling challenges for observatories with multiple large programs, each with different cadence needs. To address this challenge, we developed AstroQ, an automated framework for scheduling cadenced observations. We tested this on a suite of Doppler exoplanet programs at Keck Observatory, where the algorithm powers the KPF-Community Cadence project. As a point of reference, AstroQ can determine the provably optimal ordering of 3680 observations of 200 targets -- each with its own cadence needs and accessibility constraints -- over a six month period to five minute time resolution. Schedules of this size may be constructed in ~120 seconds on modern workstation, enabling dynamic rescheduling due to weather changes, target-of-opportunity interrupts, and other needs. A key advantage of AstroQ over manual scheduling is realistic projections of program completion, savings in human effort, and elimination of human bias in balancing many programs. AstroQ is open source and may be applied to other scheduling needs, both in astronomy and beyond.

          Unified reconstruction of the Lyman-alpha power spectrum with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo

 - **Abstract**
 The complex geometry of the Ly$\alpha$ forest data has motivated the use of various two-point statistics as alternatives to the three-dimensional power spectrum ($P_{\mathrm{3D}}$), which carries cosmological information in Fourier space. On large scales, the three-dimensional correlation function ($\xi_\mathrm{3D}$) has provided robust measurements of the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) scale at 150 Mpc. On smaller scales, the one-dimensional power spectrum, $P_{\mathrm{1D}}(k_\|)$, has been the primary tool for extracting information. At the same time, the cross-spectrum, $P_\times(\theta, k_\|)$, has been introduced to incorporate angular information without the complications caused by survey window functions. We propose an analytical forward-modeling framework to reconstruct $P_{\mathrm{3D}}$ from all these observables in a nearly model-independent way. We demonstrate the performance of our method using a hypothetical mock data vector representative of future Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) measurements and show that the monopole of $P_{\mathrm{3D}}$ can be reconstructed in 25 $k$ bins between $0.07~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ and $1.8~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, achieving a median precision of $8\%$ and a mean precision of $13\%$. Our method can serve as an intermediary for consistency checks, though it is not intended to replace direct $P_{\mathrm{3D}}$ estimation.

          A Multi-Species Atmospheric Escape Model with Excited Hydrogen and Helium: Application to HD209458b

 - **Abstract**
 Atmospheric escape shapes exoplanet evolution and star-planet interactions, with He I 10830 Å absorption serving as a key tracer of mass loss in hot gas giants. However, transit depths vary significantly across observed systems for reasons that remain poorly understood. HD209458b, the archetypal hot-Jupiter, exhibits relatively weak He I 10830 Å and H$\alpha$ absorption, which has been interpreted as evidence for a high H/He ratio (98/2), possibly due to diffusive separation. To investigate this possibility and other processes that control these transit depths, we reassess excitation and de-excitation rates for metastable helium and explore the impact of diffusion processes, stellar activity, and tidal forces on the upper atmosphere and transit depths using a model framework spanning the whole atmosphere. Our model reproduces the observed He I transit depth and H$\alpha$ upper limit, showing strong diffusive separation. We match the observations assuming a photoelectron efficiency of 20-40\%, depending on the composition of the atmosphere, corresponding to mass-loss rates of $1.9-3\times10^{10}$ g/s. We find that the He I 10830 Å transit depth is sensitive to both stellar activity and diffusion processes, while H$\alpha$ is largely unaffected due to its strong dependence on Lyman-$\alpha$ excitation. These differences may help explain the system-to-system scatter seen in population-level studies of the He I line. While He I data alone may not tightly constrain mass-loss rates or temperatures, they do confirm atmospheric escape and help narrow the viable parameter space when interpreted with physically motivated models. Simultaneous observations of He I, H$\alpha$, and stellar activity indicators provide powerful constraints on upper atmosphere dynamics and composition, even in the absence of full transmission spectra.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a study of the double-lined spectroscopic binary HD 21278 that contains one of the brightest main sequence stars in the young $\alpha$ Persei open cluster. We analyzed new spectra and reanalyzed archived spectra to measure precise new radial velocity curves for the binary. We also obtained interferometric data using the CHARA Array at Mount Wilson to measure the sky positions of the two stars and the inclination of the $\sim$ 2 milliarcsecond orbit. We determine that the two stars have masses of $5.381 \pm 0.084 M_{\odot}$ and $3.353 \pm 0.064 M_{\odot}$. From isochrone fits, we find the cluster's age to be $49 \pm 7$ Myr (using PARSEC models) or $49.5 \pm 6$ Myr (MIST models). Finally, we revisit the massive white dwarfs that are candidate escapees from the $\alpha$ Persei cluster to try to better characterize the massive end of the white dwarf initial-final mass relation. The implied progenitor masses challenge the idea that Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarfs are made by single stars with masses near $8 \msun$.

 - **Abstract**
 AT2022cmc is the first on-axis jetted tidal disruption event (TDE) to be discovered at optical wavelengths. The optically bright nature of AT2022cmc presents an unprecedented opportunity to place this jetted TDE in the context of the larger optically selected thermal TDE population and explore potential connections to optical TDE subclasses, particularly the class of luminous TDEs that lack optical spectral features. In this work we present late-time optical observations of AT2022cmc, both imaging and spectroscopy, that extend the optical dataset to $\sim 160$ days from the first detection in the observed frame. The light curve clearly evolves from red to blue, which we interpret as a transition from a non-thermally dominated spectral energy distribution (SED) to thermally dominated SED. By accounting for the non-thermal emission evident in the optical SED at early times, we extract the properties of the thermal emission and compare to a sample of optically selected thermal TDEs. We find that the properties of AT2022cmc are consistent with previous correlations found for the evolution and properties of thermal TDEs, with the thermal properties of AT2022cmc aligning with the class of featureless and luminous TDEs. The confirmation of this similarity motivates the importance of prompt and multi-wavelength follow-up of featureless and luminous TDEs in order to further explore the connection they have with jetted TDEs.

          Submillimeter and Mid-Infrared Variability of Young Stellar Objects in the M17 HII Region

 - **Abstract**
 We conducted a comprehensive analysis of young stellar object (YSO) variability at submillimeter and mid-infrared (mid-IR) wavelengths for the M\,17 \ion{H}{2} region, using 3.5 years monitoring data from the JCMT Transient Survey at $450$ and $850\,\mu$m and 9 years mid-IR monitoring data from the NEOWISE mission. Our study encompasses observations of 198 and 164 bright submillimeter peaks identified within the deep JCMT coadded maps at 450 and $850\,\mu$m, and 66 YSOs seen by NEOWISE W2 that were previously identified in mid-IR observations. We find one robust linear submillimeter variable, an intermediate mass protostar, with a $4\%$ peak flux change in 3.5 years of JCMT monitoring that sets a lower limit of $16\%$ luminosity increase for the source. At mid-IR wavelengths, our analysis reveals secular and stochastic variability in 22 YSOs, with the highest fraction of secular variability occurring at the earliest evolutionary stage. This mid-IR fractional variability as a function of evolutionary stage result is similar to what has previously been found for YSO variability within the Gould Belt and the intermediate-mass star formation region M17\,SWex, though overall less variability is detected in M\,17 in submillimeter and mid-IR. We suspect that this lower detection of YSO variability is due to both the greater distance to M\,17 and the strong feedback from the \ion{H}{2} region. Our findings showcase the utility of multiwavelength observations to better capture the complex variability phenomena inherent to star formation processes and demonstrate the importance of years-long monitoring of a diverse selection of star-forming environments.

 - **Abstract**
 The $\alpha$-attractor models of inflation have remained one of the preferred inflationary models for nearly a decade now. The unique attractor nature of these models in the $n_s-r$ plane have put these models in the sweet-spot of the $n_s-r$ measurement of Planck observations. In this article, we analyse the behaviour of such attractor models in a Warm Inflation setup to investigate whether the attractor nature of these models can be retained even when the dynamics deviates from the standard Cold inflationary dynamics. We have chosen to analyse these models in a strongly dissipative Warm inflation setup, namely the Minimal Warm Inflation, as in such a setup the inflationary dynamics significantly departs from the standard Cold inflation dynamics. We observe that the departure from the standard Cold inflation dynamics destroys the unique attractor nature of such models. The analysis clearly indicates that the attractor nature of these $\alpha$-attractor models is quite unique to the standard Cold inflationary dynamics. However, on a positive note, the analysis indicates that the $\alpha$-attractor models may be made in tune with the recent ACT results in Warm inflation for certain parameter ranges.

 - **Abstract**
 After the formation of the Moon the terrestrial planets were pummelled by impacts from planetesimals left over from terrestrial planet formation. This work attempts to reproduce the impact rates set by modern crater chronologies using leftover planetesimals from three different dynamical models of terrestrial planet formation. I ran dynamical simulations for 1 billion years using leftover planetesimals from the Grand Tack, Depleted Disc and Implantation models of terrestrial planet formation with the GENGA N-body integrator. I fit the cumulative impacts on the Earth and Mars using a function that is a sum of exponentials with different weighing factors and e-folding times. Most fits require three or four terms. The fitted timescales cluster around t1=10 Myr, t2=35 Myr, t3=100 Myr and t4>200 Myr. I attribute them to dynamical losses of planetesimals through different mechanisms: high-eccentricity Earth crossers and the nu6 secular resonance, Earth crossers, Mars crossers, and objects leaking on to Mars crossing orbits from beyond Mars. I place a constraint on the initial population using the known Archean terrestrial spherule beds, and I conclude that the Archean impacts were mostly created by leftover planetesimals. The inferred mass in leftover planetesimals at the time of the Moon's formation was about 0.015 Earth masses. The third time constant is comparable to that of modern crater chronologies. As such, the crater chronologies are indicative of impacts by an ancient population of Mars crossers. The initial perihelion distribution of the leftovers is a major factor in setting the rate of decline: to reproduce the current crater chronologies the number of Earth crossers at the time of the Moon's formation had to be at most half of the Mars crossers. These results together place constraints on dynamical models of terrestrial planet formation.

 - **Abstract**
 Elemental abundances hold important information about the star formation history in the Galactic Center. The thermal X-ray spectra of certain stars can provide a robust probe of elemental abundances, mainly through the presence of K-shell emission lines. In this work, based on deep archival {\it Chandra} observations, we obtain X-ray measurements of five heavy elements (Si, S, Ar, Ca and Fe) for three sources in the Arches cluster, one source in the Quintuplet cluster, as well as a field source known as Edd 1, which are all probable WR stars exhibiting a high quality X-ray spectrum. A two-temperature, non-equilibrium ionization plasma model is employed for the spectral fit, taking into account light element compositions characteristic of WR star winds, which is substantially depleted in hydrogen but enriched in nitrogen and/or carbon. It is found that the Arches and Quintuplet WR stars share similar abundances of Si, S, and Ar, while exhibiting distinct Ca and Fe abundances, which may be understood as due to dust depletion of the latter two elements in Quintuplet. The observed near-solar or sub-solar metallicity of the WR star winds can be naturally understood as the result of nucleosynthesis and internal mixing of the parent star, which have a supersolar initial metallicity as expected for the Galactic center in general. Implications of our findings on the origin of the young star clusters and isolated massive stars in the Galactic center, as well as the elemental composition of the accretion flow onto Sgr A*, are addressed.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first detection of spatially resolved protostellar outflows and jets in the outer Galaxy. We observed five star-forming regions in the outer Galaxy (Sh 2--283, NOMF05-16/19/23/63; galactocentric distance = 15.7--17.4 kpc) with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). Towards Sh 2--283, we have detected distinct outflow ($\sim$5--50 km s$^{-1}$) and jet components ($\sim$50--100 km s$^{-1}$) associated with the protostar in CO(3--2) emission. The outflows and jets are well-collimated, with the jets exhibiting multiple bullet structures. The position-velocity diagram along the CO flow axis shows two characteristic structures: (a) the flow velocity which linearly increases with the position offset from the core center (Hubble-like flow), and (b) continuous velocity components of the periodical flows (spine-like structures), which may indicate the episodic mass-ejection event. The time intervals of the mass-ejection events are estimated to be 900--4000 years based on the slopes of these spine-like structures. These characteristics align with those of nearby protostellar systems, indicating that early star formation in low-metallicity environments, such as the outer Galaxy, resembles that in the inner Galaxy. In contrast to the physical similarities, the $N\mathrm{(SiO)}$/$N\mathrm{(CO)}$ ratio in the jet bullet appears to be lower than that measured in the low-mass protostellar sources in the inner Galaxy. This may indicate the different shock chemistry or different dust composition in the outer Galaxy source, although non-LTE effects could also affect the observed low $N\mathrm{(SiO)}$/$N\mathrm{(CO)}$ ratio. We also report the new detection of the other 4 outflow sources in the outer Galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 The equation of state (EoS) is a needed input to determine the neutron-star global properties and to relate them. It is thus important to provide consistent and unified EoSs to avoid possible biases in the analyses coming from the use of inconsistent EoSs. We propose a numerical tool, CUTER, allowing the user to consistently match a nuclear-physics informed crust to an arbitrary higher density EoS. We present here the second version of this tool, CUTER v2. Two functionalities are available with the CUTER v2 tool, allowing the user to reconstruct either the whole (outer and inner) crust, or the outer crust only. We show that the code, that has been tested and validated for use by the astrophysical community, is able to efficiently perform both tasks, allowing the computation of neutron-star global properties in a consistent way.

          Identifying Merger-Driven Long Gamma-Ray Bursts based on Machine Learning

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are classified as Type I GRBs originated from compact binary mergers and Type II GRBs originated from massive collapsars. While Type I GRBs are typically shorter than 2 seconds, recent observations suggest that some extend to tens of seconds, forming a potential subclass, Type IL GRBs. However, apart from their association with kilonovae, so far no rapid identification is possible. Given the uncertainties and limitations of optical and infrared afterglow observations, an identification method based solely on prompt emission can make such identification possible for many more GRBs. Interestingly, two established Type IL GRBs: GRB 211211A and GRB 230307A, exhibit a three-episode structure: precursor emission (PE), main emission (ME), and extended emission. Therefore, we comprehensively search for GRBs in the Fermi/GBM catalog and identify 29 three-episode GRBs. Based on 12 parameters, we utilize machine learning to distinguish Type IL GRBs from Type II GRBs. Apart from GRB 211211A and GRB 230307A, we are able to identify six more previously unknown Type IL GRBs: GRB 090831, GRB 170228A, GRB 180605A, GRB 200311A, GRB 200914A, and GRB 211019A. We find that Type IL GRBs are characterized by short duration and minimum variability timescale of PE, a short waiting time between PE and ME, and that ME follows the $E_{\rm p,z}$--$E_{\rm iso}$ correlation of Type I GRBs. For the first time, we identify a high-significant PE in the confirmed Type IL GRB 060614.

 - **Abstract**
 The X-ray Imaging Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM) provides the best spectral resolution with which to study Sulfur (S) K-shell photoabsorption features from the interstellar medium (ISM). For the first time, we demonstrate the high-signal detection of interstellar atomic SII K-beta absorption in the spectrum of X-ray binaries (XRBs) 4U 1630-472 and GX 340+0. The persistence of this feature across multiple instruments, targets, and flux states implies that it is interstellar in nature. We measure the SII Kbeta line centroid at 2470.8 +/- 1.1 eV after including systematic uncertainties. We also find that the most recently published high resolution SII absorption template requires a systematic energy scale shift of +7-8 eV, which is comparable to the level of disagreement among various atomic modeling procedures. The XRISM 300 ks observation of GX 340+0 provides unprecedented signal-to-noise in the S K region, and we find evidence of residual absorption from solid S in the spectra of GX 340+0. Absorption templates from three Fe-S compounds, troilite (FeS), pyrrhotite (Fe_7S_8) and pyrite (FeS_2), provide equally good fits to the residuals. Even though we are not able to distinguish among these three compounds, they provide equal estimates for the abundance of S locked in dust grains. Having accounted for both the gaseous and solid S in the GX 340+0 sightline provides us with a direct measurement of S depletion, which is 40% +/- 15%. Our depletion measurement provides an upper limit to the fraction of interstellar Fe bound in Fe-S compounds of < 25%, which is consistent with prior studies of Fe-S compounds via Fe L-shell absorption. Both XRBs in this study are at a distance of approximately 11 kpc and on the opposite side of the Galactic disk, suggesting that this value could represent the average S depletion of the Milky Way when integrated across all phases of the ISM.

 - **Abstract**
 Baryonic physics has a considerable impact on the distribution of matter in our Universe on scales probed by current and future cosmological surveys, acting as a key systematic in such analyses. We seek simple symbolic parametrisations for the impact of baryonic physics on the matter power spectrum for a range of physically motivated models, as a function of wavenumber, redshift, cosmology, and parameters controlling the baryonic feedback. We use symbolic regression to construct analytic approximations for the ratio of the matter power spectrum in the presence of baryons to that without such effects. We obtain separate functions of each of four distinct sub-grid prescriptions of baryonic physics from the CAMELS suite of hydrodynamical simulations (Astrid, IllustrisTNG, SIMBA and Swift-EAGLE) as well as for a baryonification algorithm. We also provide functions which describe the uncertainty on these predictions, due to both the stochastic nature of baryonic physics and the errors on our fits. The error on our approximations to the hydrodynamical simulations is comparable to the sample variance estimated through varying initial conditions, and our baryonification expression has a root mean squared error of better than one percent, although this increases on small scales. These errors are comparable to those of previous numerical emulators for these models. Our expressions are enforced to have the physically correct behaviour on large scales and at high redshift. Due to their analytic form, we are able to directly interpret the impact of varying cosmology and feedback parameters, and we can identify parameters which have little to no effect. Each function is based on a different implementation of baryonic physics, and can therefore be used to discriminate between these models when applied to real data. We provide publicly available code for all symbolic approximations found.

 - **Abstract**
 Scalar dark matter is a viable alternative to particle dark matter models such as Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPS). This is particularly the case for scalars with a low mass $m \gtrsim 10^{-21} {\rm eV}$ as required to make quantum effects macroscopic on galactic scales. We point out that by synchronising the measurements of arrival times of pairs of pulsars, Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTA) could probe ultralight dark matter (ULDM) scenarios with a mass $10^{-23} {\rm eV}\lesssim m \lesssim 10^{-19} {\rm eV}$ that is greater than the one reached in standard analysis. The upper limit on the mass $m$ is set by the time lag $\Delta t$ between the observations of the two pulsars and could be pushed above $10^{-19} {\rm eV}$ for $\Delta t$ smaller than one hour.

          Interstellar Chemistry of CN Radicals on Ices: The formation of CH3CN and CH3NC and potential connection to acetamide

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Among the most significant chemical functional groups of interstellar molecules are the class of nitriles, which are proposed as key prebiotic molecules due to their chemical connection to the peptide bond after hydrolysis. CN radicals, the simplest representative of this group, have been shown to exhibit strong interactions with interstellar water ices, potentially impacting their reactivity with other radicals nearby. Aims. This study explores (a) whether CN and CH3 radicals can readily react to form methyl cyanide (CH3CN) and its isomer methyl isocyanide (CH3NC); and (b) the feasibility of the reaction (CN...H2O)hemi -> C(OH)=NH and its potential role in the formation of acetamide. Methods. Following a benchmark, density functional theory was employed to map the potential energy surfaces of these chemical processes, focusing on their reactivity on water and carbon monoxide ices. Results. The results show that CN reacts with CH3 radicals on water ices, forming CH3CN and CH3NC efficiently. However, these reactions are driven by diffusion of CH3 towards the reactive site and subsequently compete with back-diffusion of CH3 from that site. The formation of the radical intermediate C(OH)=NH on water ice requires quantum tunnelling and assuming that acetimidic acid forms via CH3 + C(OH)=NH -> CH3C(OH)=NH, it can also only isomerize into acetamide through a sizable barrier thanks to quantum tunnelling. Both quantum tunnelling-driven reactions are highly dependent on the local structure of the water ice. Finally, radical coupling reactions on carbon monoxide ices are found to be barrierless for all cases and again, both the cyanide and the isocyanide are formed. Conclusions. This work reinforces the conclusion that CN radicals on interstellar grain surfaces are highly reactive and unlikely to persist unaltered.

 - **Abstract**
 We demonstrate that TOI-6883 is a physically bound visual binary system composed of two solar-type stars, TOI-6883A (TIC 393818343) and TOI-6883B (TIC 393818340), initially regarded as a single star hosting the exoplanet TOI-6883b. Gaia DR3 astrometry shows that both stars have nearly identical parallaxes 10.6 mas, consistent proper motions, and a projected separation of 616 AU, confirming their binary nature. Using astrometric and photometric data, we estimate the stellar masses, physical separation, and an orbital period of 15,000 years. The system is energetically bound. We revise the planet designation to TOI-6883Ab to reflect stellar multiplicity. We evaluate the impact of the binary companion on planetary stability and find the planet's orbit to be long-term stable, although Kozai-Lidov perturbations remain possible. Further astrometric and photometric follow-up will be essential to better constrain the binary orbit and assess potential dynamical influences on the planetary architecture.

 The SPECULOOS (Search for habitable Planets EClipsing ULtra-cOOl Stars) project aims to detect temperate terrestrial planets transiting nearby ultracool dwarfs, including late M-dwarf stars and brown dwarfs, which are well-suited for atmospheric characterization using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and upcoming giant telescopes like the European Extremely Large Telescope (ELT). Led by the University of Liège, SPECULOOS is conducted in partnership with the University of Cambridge, the University of Birmingham, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of Bern, and ETH Zurich. The project operates a network of robotic telescopes at two main observatories: SPECULOOS-South in Chile, with four telescopes, and SPECULOOS-North in Tenerife, currently with one telescope (soon to be two). This network is complemented by the SAINT-EX telescope located in San Pedro Mártir, Mexico. In this paper, we review the status of our facilities after five years of operations, the current challenges and development plans, and our latest scientific results.

 - **Abstract**
 Carbon Radio Recombination Lines (CRRLs) at decametre wavelengths trace the diffuse phase of the interstellar medium (ISM) of the Galaxy. Their observation allows to measure physical parameters of this phase. We observed CRRLs with the recently commissioned New Extension in Nançay Upgrading LOFAR (NenuFAR) telescope towards two of the brightest sources at low-frequency (10-85 MHz): Cassiopeia A and Cygnus A (hereafter Cas A and Cyg A respectively), to measure the density n_e and temperature T_e of electrons in line-of-sight clouds. We used NenuFAR's beamforming mode, and we integrated several tens of hours on each source. The nominal spectral resolution was 95.4 Hz. We developed a pipeline to remove radio frequency interference (RFI) contamination and correct the baselines. We then fitted the spectral lines observed in absorption, associated to line-of-sight clouds. Cas A is the brightest source in the sky at low frequencies and represents an appropriate test bench for this new telescope. On this source, we detected 398 C\alpha lines between principal quantum numbers n=426 and n=826. C\alpha lines towards Cyg A were fainter. We stacked the signal by groups of a few tens of lines to improve the quality of our fitting process. On both sources we reached significantly higher S/N and spectral resolution than the most recent detections by the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR). The variation of line shape with n provides constraints on the physical properties of the clouds: T_e, n_e, the temperature T_0 of the radiation field, the mean turbulent velocity v_t and the typical size of the cloud. The NenuFAR observations sample a larger space volume than LOFAR's towards the same sources due to the differences in instrumental beamsizes, and the discrepancies highlight the sensitivity of low-frequency CRRLs as probes of the diffuse ISM, paving the way towards large area surveys of CRRLs in our Galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 Star formation (SF) studies are benefiting from the huge amount of data made available by recent large-area Galactic plane surveys conducted between 2 {\mu}m and 3 mm. Fully characterizing SF demands integrating far-infrared/sub-millimetre (FIR/sub-mm) data, tracing the earliest phases, with near-/mid-infrared (NIR/MIR) observations, revealing later stages characterized by YSOs just before main sequence star appearance. However, the resulting dataset is often a complex mix of heterogeneous and intricate features, limiting the effectiveness of traditional analysis in uncovering hidden patterns and relationships. In this framework, machine learning emerges as a powerful tool to handle the complexity of feature-rich datasets and investigate potential physical connections between the cold dust component traced by FIR/sub-mm emission and the presence of YSOs. We present a study on the evolutionary path of star forming clumps in the Hi-GAL survey through a multi-step approach, with the final aims of (a) obtaining a robust and accurate set of features able to well classify the star forming clumps in Hi-GAL based on their evolutionary properties, (b) establishing whether a connection exists between the cold material reservoir in clumps, traced by FIR/sub-mm emission, and the already formed YSOs, precursors of stars. For these purposes, our designed experiments aim at testing whether the FIR/sub-mm properties related to clumps are sufficient to predict the clump evolutionary stage, without considering the direct information about the embedded YSOs at NIR/MIR. Our machine learning-based method involves a four-step approach, based on feature engineering, data handling, feature selection and classification. Our findings suggest that FIR/sub-mm and NIR/MIR emissions trace different evolutionary phases of star forming clumps, highlighting the complex and asynchronous nature of the SF process.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we calibrate the luminosity relation of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) by Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) which is employed to analyze the Pantheon+ sample of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) in a manner independent of cosmological assumptions. The A219 GRB dataset are used to calibrate the Amati relation (\(E_{\rm p}\)-\(E_{\rm iso}\)) at low redshift with the ANN framework, facilitating the construction of the Hubble diagram at higher redshifts. Cosmological models are constrained with GRBs at high-redshift and the latest observational Hubble data (OHD) via a Markov Chain Monte Carlo numerical approach. For the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) model within a flat universe, we obtain \(\Omega_{\rm m} = 0.321^{+0.078}_{-0.069}\), \(h = 0.654^{+0.053}_{-0.071}\), \(w_0 = -1.02^{+0.67}_{-0.50}\), and \(w_a = -0.98^{+0.58}_{-0.58}\) at the 1-\(\sigma\) confidence level, which indicating a preference for dark energy with potential redshift evolution (\(w_a \neq 0\)). These findings by using ANN align closely with those derived from GRBs calibrated by using Gaussian Processes.

 - **Abstract**
 The Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way, is an irregular dwarf galaxy exhibiting evidence of recent and ongoing star formation. We performed a spatial clustering analysis of far-ultraviolet stars in the SMC younger than 150 Myr using data from the Ultra Violet Imaging Telescope onboard AstroSat. We identified 236 young stellar structures as surface overdensities at different significance levels. The sizes of these structures range from a few parsecs to several hundred parsecs. Their irregular morphologies are characterized by a perimeter-area dimension, derived from the projected boundaries of the young stellar structures, of Dp = 1.46 +/- 0.4. The 2D fractal dimensions obtained from, respectively, the number-size relation and the size distribution are D2 = 1.64 +/- 0.03 and D2 = 1.31 +/- 0.16. These values indicate significant lumpiness among the young stellar structures. In addition, the surface density distribution of the identified structures follows a log-normal distribution. These features are strikingly similar to those of the turbulent interstellar medium, thus supporting the scenario of hierarchical star formation regulated by supersonic turbulence.

 - **Abstract**
 Extragalactic foregrounds -- most notably the Cosmic Infrared Background (CIB) and the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect -- exhibit complex, non-Gaussian structure and correlations that can bias analyses of small-scale cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature anisotropies. These foregrounds can introduce mode coupling at small-scales (multipoles $\ell \geq 3000$) that mimic true lensing signals, thereby complicating analyses such as CMB lensing reconstruction. We present a novel approach to learn their full joint distribution using Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) trained on paired CIB-tSZ patches at 150 GHz, from the Agora suite of extragalactic sky simulations. While simulations like Agora, which are based on N-body calculations, can take thousands of CPU hours, DDPM can synthesize realistic CIB-tSZ patches that faithfully reproduce both auto- and cross-spectral statistics of the 2-point, 3-point, and 4-point correlation functions, in a matter of seconds. We further demonstrate matching pixel-value histograms and Minkowski functionals, confirming that conventional non-Gaussian benchmarks are also satisfied. This framework provides a powerful generative tool for forward-modeling correlated extragalactic foregrounds in current and future CMB analyses. Although we mainly demonstrate the joint modeling of tSZ and CIB at a single frequency, we also include examples of its extension to multiple frequencies, showing that the framework can learn the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) across different bands. While establishing DDPMs as a promising tool for addressing foreground contamination in next-generation CMB surveys, we also outline remaining challenges to their practical deployment in analysis pipelines, such as scaling to larger sky areas and reliance on the underlying cosmological and astrophysical assumptions in the simulations used for training.

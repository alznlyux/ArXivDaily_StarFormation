          Dynamical Instability of Multi-planet Systems and Free-floating Planets

 - **Abstract**
 The ejection of planets by the instability of planetary systems is a potential source of free-floating planets. We numerically simulate multi-planet systems to study the evolution process, the properties of surviving systems, and the statistics of ejected planets. For systems with only super-Earth planets, we find that the time (in units of the orbital period $P_{1}$ of the innermost planet) for the system to lose the first planet by collision or ejection increases with the semimajor axis of the innermost planet. In contrast, the time (in units of $P_{1}$) for the first close encounter between two planets is identical. These two timescales also depend differently on the orbital spacing between the planets. Most systems with only super-Earths do not have planets ejected. In systems with super-Earths and a cold Jupiter, we discover that a cold Jupiter significantly increases the probability of ejection of the super-Earths by close encounters. Of 38\% of ejected super-Earths, most velocities relative to their parent stars are smaller than $6\ \mathrm{km\ s^{-1}}$. We conservatively estimate that more than 86\% of the surviving two-planet systems in the super-Earths plus cold Jupiter sample are long-term stable by using empirical criteria. Most super-Earths in the remaining two-planet systems are on highly elliptical but stable orbits and have migrated inwards compared with their initial states.

 - **Abstract**
 The Neutron Star X-ray binary Sco X-1 is one of the brightest Z-type sources in our Galaxy, showing frequent periods of flaring activity and different types of relativistic outflows. Observations with RXTE have shown that the strongest X-ray variability appears in the transition from/to the flaring state. During this transition, it has been proposed that two particular types of quasi-periodic oscillations might be connected with the ejection of the so-called ultra-relativistic flows. In this paper, we present an analysis of the first NICER observations of Sco X-1 obtained during a multi-wavelenght campaign conducted in February 2019, in order to characterise the properties of QPOs as the system evolves through its various accretion states. We compute a light-curve and a Hardness-Intensity diagram to track the evolution of the source spectral properties, while we investigate the X-ray time variability with a Dynamical Power Density Spectrum. To trace the temporal evolution of QPOs, we segment the dataset into shorter, continuous intervals, and compute and fit the averaged PDS for each interval. Our analysis shows that the overall behaviour of the source is consistent with the literature; strong QPOs around 6 Hz are detected on the normal branch, while transitions to/from the flaring branch -- occurring over timescales of a few hundreds of seconds -- are characterised by rapid, weaker quasi-periodic variability reaching frequencies up to 15 Hz. Despite limited statistical significance, we also identify faint, transient timing features above 20 Hz, occasionally coexisting with the prominent 6 Hz QPOs. Although tentative, the existence of these features in the NICER data is crucial for interpreting the simultaneous radio observations from the same multi-wavelength campaign, potentially reinforcing the connection between the ejection of relativistic outflows and the accretion states in Sco X-1.

 - **Abstract**
 Ultra-hot Jupiters showcase extreme atmospheric conditions, including molecular dissociation, ionisation, and significant day-to-night temperature contrasts. Their close proximity to host stars subjects them to intense stellar irradiation, driving high temperatures where hydride ions (H$^-$) significantly contribute to opacity, potentially obscuring metal features in near-infrared transmission spectra. We investigate the atmosphere of WASP-189b, targeting atomic, ionic, and molecular species (H, He, Fe, Ti, V, Mn, Na, Mg, Ca, Cr, Ni, Y, Ba, Sc, Fe$^+$, Ti$^+$, TiO, H$_2$O, CO, and OH), focusing on (i) the role of H$^-$ as a source of continuum opacity, and (ii) the relative hydride-to-Fe abundance using joint optical and near-infrared data. We present two transits of WASP-189b gathered simultaneously in the optical with HARPS and near-infrared with NIRPS, supported by photometric light curves from EulerCam and ExTrA. Transmission spectra were analysed via cross-correlation to detect absorption features and enhance the signal-to-noise ratio. Atmospheric retrievals quantified relative abundances by fitting overall metallicity and proxies for TiO, H$^-$, and e$^-$. Only atomic iron is detected in HARPS data (S/N ~5.5), but not in NIRPS, likely due to H$^-$ continuum dampening. Retrievals on HARPS-only and HARPS+NIRPS suggest the hydride-to-Fe ratio exceeds equilibrium predictions by about 0.5 dex, hinting at strong hydrogen ionisation. Including NIRPS data helps constrain H$^-$ abundance and set an upper limit on free electron density, unconstrained in HARPS-only data. These results emphasise H$^-$ as a significant continuum opacity source impeding detection of planetary absorption features in WASP-189b's near-infrared transmission spectrum.

          The impact of kilonova seed photons on GRB VHE emission

 - **Abstract**
 Over the last few years, an increasing number of gamma-ray bursts (GRB) have been detected with very high energy (VHE) emission in excess of 100 GeV, with a few cases above 1 TeV. In several instances, synchrotron seed photons do not fully explain the emission observed, suggesting the presence of other seed photon sources to up-scatter. In this work, we consider the kilonova as a source of seed photons for up-scattering in the afterglow. We model the kilonova as a thermal source injecting into the back of a GRB fireball, evolved using a shell model, and with the electron and photon populations updated via a kinetic solver. We find that VHE emission from weaker afterglows, such as those found in short GRBs, can be affected by such seed photons, with the kilonova seed photons mitigating the loss of synchrotron photons on the VHE emission when afterglow parameters are varied. We also find that VHE emission in structured jets, due to weaker synchrotron emission at their wings, can also benefit from this supply of seed photons, especially when viewed off-axis. We apply this model to GRB 170817A, and show that its VHE emission is higher than expected in previous models for the first 100 days, though still below the detection threshold.

 - **Abstract**
 mcdust is a parallel simulation code for dust evolution in protoplanetary disks. The code is written in FORTRAN90 and parallelised with OpenMP. The code models dust collisional evolution and transport in the vertical and radial directions. The currently included collisional outcomes are dust growth by sticking, fragmentation of dust particles and erosion, where a small particle chips a portion of the large particle. We employ a representative particle approach to track a limited number of particles instead of tracking every particle, saving computational time. We have a static power-law gas disk with temperature assumed to be vertically isothermal. Dust coagulation depends on the local gas properties, and therefore, we bin particles into grids and perform collisions. We make use of an adaptive grid approach where we make sure that each cell has an equal number of representative particles. This guarantees that there are always sufficient particles to resolve the physics of collisions. The code resolves dust coagulation in 2D(r-z).

          A Late-Time Rise in Planet Occurrence Reproduces the Galactic Height Trend in Planet Occurrence

 - **Abstract**
 While stellar metallicity has long been known to correlate with planetary properties, the galactic metallicity gradient alone does not account for the trend. It is therefore possible that there exists some time-dependent component to planet occurrence in the Milky Way over Gyr timescales, driven by something other than the metal enrichment of the ISM. In this paper, we investigate the observable effect of a time-dependent planet occurrence rate upon a Kepler-like sample of stars. Using a novel planetary system population synthesis code, psps, we impose several prescriptions for time-variable planet occurrence upon our sample. For this study, we employ a simplistic step function fiducial model for Milky Way planet occurrence, where we vary the time of the step and the planet occurrence rate before and after. We then forward model the expected yield for a synthetic Kepler mission as a function of galactic height, employing the mission's footprint and sensitivity to transits. Finally, we compare the modeled trends to the observed result from the mission itself. We find that, broadly speaking, models in which planet occurrence increased by a factor of several within the past few Gyr can reproduce the occurrence-galactic height trend as-observed; this timing is broadly consistent with the galactic kinematic heating timescale. We consider how varying the functional form of our planet occurrence prescription affects our conclusions. Finally, we consider the physical implications of a seemingly recent increase in planet occurrence on Gyr timescales, as part of a broader conversation about the galactic context for planet formation.

          Shepherding Miorita and its flock: A group of near-Earth asteroids driven by apsidal and von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai secular resonances. A source of low-perihelion asteroids

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Secular resonances can control the dynamical evolution of near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) and, in some cases, lead to increased orbital stability. Asteroid 622577 Miorita (2014 LU14 ) was the first NEA found by the Isaac Newton Telescope (INT) and exhibits unusual dynamical traits although it approaches Venus, Earth, and Mars at relatively close range. Aims. Here, we investigate the orbital context of Miorita and search for possible dynamical analogs within the NEA population. Methods. We studied the orbital evolution of Miorita using direct N-body calculations. We used the NEOMOD 3 orbital distribution model to verify our conclusions. Observational data were obtained with INT's Wide Field Camera. Results. Miorita is subjected to a von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai secular resonance, but it is also in a near apsidal resonance, both controlled by Jupiter. We identified a group of dynamical analogs of Miorita that includes 387668 (2002 SZ), 2004 US1 , 299582 (2006 GQ2), and 2018 AC4. Miorita-like orbits can evolve into metastable, low-perihelion trajectories driven by apsidal and von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai secular resonances like those of 504181 (2006 TC) and 482798 (2013 QK48). Objects in such paths may end up drawn into the Sun. Conclusions. Concurrent secular resonances tend to stabilize the orbits of these asteroids as they are protected against collision with Earth and other inner planets by the resonances. This group signals the existence of an active dynamical pathway capable of inserting NEAs in comet-like orbits. NEOMOD 3 gives a low probability for the existence of NEAs like Miorita, 504181 or 482798.

 - **Abstract**
 Triaxial pulsators are a recently discovered group of oscillating stars in close binary systems that show pulsations around three axes at the same time. It has recently been theoretically shown that new types of pulsation modes, the Tidally Tilted Standing (TTS) modes, can arise in such stars. Here, we report the first detection of a quadrupole TTS oscillation mode in the pulsating component of the binary system EL CMi following an analysis of TESS space photometry. Two dipole oscillations around different axes in the orbital plane are present as well. In addition, the binary system is characterized using new radial velocity measurements, phoebe as well as simultaneous spectral energy distribution and light curve modeling. The pulsating primary component has properties typical of a Delta Scuti star but has accreted and is still accreting mass from its Roche Lobe filling companion. The donor star is predicted to evolve into a low-mass helium white dwarf. EL CMi demonstrates the potential of asteroseismic inferences of the structure of stars in close binaries before and after mass transfer and in three spatial dimensions.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar activity variability is one of the main obstacles to the detection of Earth-like planets using the RV method. The aim of this work is to measure the effect of activity in the spectra of M dwarfs and detect activity-sensitive lines in the NIR. We took advantage of the simultaneous observations of HARPS and the newly commissioned NIRPS spectrograph to carry out a blind search of the most activity-sensitive spectral lines in the NIR using NIRPS spectra and known activity indicators in the optical from HARPS as a reference. We analysed the spectra of Proxima (M5.5V) and Gl 581 (M3V), two M dwarfs with different activity levels and internal structures. Spectral lines were identified for both stars and their profiles were fitted using different models. We found hundreds of lines sensitive to activity for both stars; the Proxima spectra were more affected. For Proxima, 32% of the identified lines can be used to measure the rotation period of the star, while for Gl 581 the numbers drops to 1%. The fraction of lines sensitive to activity increases with increasing line depth. A list of 17 lines with rotation period detection for both stars is provided. Stellar activity is able to affect a significant number of spectral lines in the NIR, and methods should be developed to mitigate those effects at the spectral level. The line distortions detected here are expected to come mainly from the flux effect due to temperature contrasts between active regions and the quiet photosphere; however, we cannot rule out the possibility that core-emission from chromospheric activity or Zeeman splitting are also affecting some lines. The new line lists presented here can be used to improve the RV extraction and the detection of RV variability due to stellar activity signals, and to help false positive detection and the modelling of activity variability, thereby enhancing exoplanet detection in the NIR.

 - **Abstract**
 With the rise of large radio interferometric telescopes, particularly the SKA, there is a growing demand for computationally efficient image reconstruction techniques. Existing reconstruction methods, such as the CLEAN algorithm or proximal optimisation approaches, are iterative in nature, necessitating a large amount of compute. These methods either provide no uncertainty quantification or require large computational overhead to do so. Learned reconstruction methods have shown promise in providing efficient and high quality reconstruction. In this article we explore the use of generative neural networks that enable efficient approximate sampling of the posterior distribution for high quality reconstructions with uncertainty quantification. Our RI-GAN framework, builds on the regularised conditional generative adversarial network (rcGAN) framework by integrating a gradient U-Net (GU-Net) architecture - a hybrid reconstruction model that embeds the measurement operator directly into the network. This framework uses Wasserstein GANs to improve training stability in combination with regularisation terms that combat mode collapse, which are typical problems for conditional GANs. This approach takes as input the dirty image and the point spread function (PSF) of the observation and provides efficient, high-quality image reconstructions that are robust to varying visibility coverages, generalises to images with an increased dynamic range, and provides informative uncertainty quantification. Our methods provide a significant step toward computationally efficient, scalable, and uncertainty-aware imaging for next-generation radio telescopes.

 - **Abstract**
 The Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI) is an upcoming NASA Small Explorer satellite mission, designed for all-sky observations in the soft gamma-ray domain with the use of germanium detectors (GeDs). An active Anticoincidence System (ACS) of BGO scintillators surrounds the GeDs to reduce the background and contribute to the detection of transient events. Accurately modeling the ACS performance requires simulating the intricate scintillation processes within the shields, which significantly increases the computational cost. We have encoded these effects into a correction matrix derived from dedicated Geant4 simulations with the inclusion of the optical physics. For this purpose, we use laboratory measurements for the energy and spatial response of the ACS lateral wall to benchmark the simulation and define instrument parameters, including the BGO absorption length and the electronic noise. We demonstrate that the simulations replicate the experimental energy resolution and light collection uniformity along the BGO crystal, with maximum discrepancies of 20% and 10%, respectively. The validated simulations are then used to develop the correction matrix for the lateral wall, accounting for the light collection efficiency and energy resolution based on the position within the crystal. The gamma-ray quantum detection efficiency is also position-dependent via the inclusion of the optical physics. It is enhanced by $\sim$8% close to the SiPMs and suppressed by $\sim$2% in the adjacent corners with respect to the average value. Finally, we explore the energy threshold and resolution of the bottom ACS, considering the impact of its smaller crystals compared with the lateral walls.

 - **Abstract**
 Near-infrared high-resolution echelle spectrographs unlock access to fundamental properties of exoplanets, from their atmospheric escape and composition to their orbital architecture, which can all be studied simultaneously from transit observations. We present the first results of the newly commissioned ESO near-infrared spectrograph, NIRPS, from three transits of WASP-69b. We used the RM Revolutions technique to better constrain the orbital architecture of the system. We extracted the high-resolution helium absorption profile to study its spectral shape and temporal variations. Then, we made 3D simulations from the EVE code to fit the helium absorption time series. We measure a slightly misaligned orbit for WASP-69b (psi of 28.7+/-5.7 deg). We confirm the detection of helium with an average excess absorption of 3.17+/-0.05%. The helium absorption is spectrally and temporally resolved, extends to high altitudes and has a strong velocity shift up to -29.5+/-2.5 km/s 50 minutes after egress. EVE simulations put constraints on the mass loss of 2.25 10^11 g/s and hint at reactive chemistry within the cometary-like tail and interaction with the stellar winds that allow the metastable helium to survive longer than expected. Our results suggest that WASP-69b is undergoing a transformative phase in its history, losing mass while evolving on a misaligned orbit. This work shows how combining multiple observational tracers such as orbital architecture, atmospheric escape, and composition, is critical to understand exoplanet demographics and their formation and evolution. We demonstrate that NIRPS can reach precisions similar to HARPS for RM studies, and the high data quality of NIRPS leads to unprecedented atmospheric characterization. The high stability of NIRPS combined with the large GTO available for its consortium, enables in-depth studies of exoplanets as well as large population surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 With more than a dozen significant detections, the helium triplet has emerged as a key tracer of evaporating exoplanet atmospheres. This near-infrared feature can be observed from the ground and holds great promise, especially with upcoming observations provided by new-generation instruments such as the Near Infrared Planet Searcher (NIRPS). However, as the helium triplet is also present in stellar spectra, careful removal of the average stellar contribution is necessary to accurately characterize the atmospheres of transiting exoplanets. In this study, we analyze multi-epoch observations of the Sun obtained with NIRPS to investigate the temporal variability of the helium triplet. Our findings reveal significant variability across different timescales, ranging from minutes to days. We identify telluric contamination and stellar activity as likely sources for the short-term and long-term variability, respectively. Importantly, we demonstrate that this variability has minimal impact on the retrieval of planetary parameters crucial to the study of atmospheric escape.

 - **Abstract**
 Pulsational pair-instability supernovae (PPISNe) are transient events occurring in progenitor stars with helium cores of approximately 32-65 solar masses, where rapid electron-positron pair production induces pressure loss, collapse, and pulsations driving episodic mass loss. The number, strength, and duration of these pulses can lead to shell collisions that produce shock-powered transients, potentially explaining some of the most luminous events, such as superluminous supernovae, and other rare transients. Rapid progenitor rotation lowers the PPISN mass threshold and influences the dynamics, energetics, and chemical composition of PPISN-driven pulses. In this study, we computed 1D evolutionary models of massive, rotating PPISN progenitor stars with zero-age main-sequence masses of 85-140 solar masses and solar metallicity and 10% solar metallicity. Our analysis reveals strong correlations between PPISN ejected mass and total energy as well as between ejected mass and peak ejected shell velocity. Additionally, moderate correlations indicate that higher initial PPISN progenitor mass leads to greater mass ejection and energy release, while negative correlations show that rapid rotation appears to reduce mass ejection and kinetic energy of the shells. Subsequent pulses lead to hydrogen-poor, carbon- and oxygen-enriched ejected shells, indicating the effect of rotationally-induced chemical mixing in PPISN-driven episodic mass loss with implications for their transients. We model the light curve and synthetic spectra that arise from the collision of two H-poor shells for one of our models using the radiation transport code SuperLite. We find that shock-heated H-poor PPISN shell collisions from rapidly rotating progenitors can lead to moderately luminous H-poor transients that share some similarities with observed SLSN-I events.

 - **Abstract**
 Special orientations of the orbital planes may be reminiscent of the specific conditions that triggered and drove the star formation processes and how these are related to local and global Galactic kinematics. For a special sample of 66 extrasolar planets discovered with the microlensing method it is possible to determine the position angle of the planets in the sky relative to their hosts. We test the hypothesis that such orientations are randomly distributed against the possibility that the orbital planes follow some preferential alignment. We find that planets in the Scutum-Centaurus arm show a significant alignment with the Galactic plane, with an isotropic distribution disfavored by a factor of 10. Bulge planets and disk planets outside this major arm are instead compatible with isotropic distributions or show weak alternative preferences at most. Using the method proposed here, the future Roman microlensing survey will be able to identify and quantify preferential orientations in all structures from the Sun to the bulge with high confidence and accuracy.

 - **Abstract**
 The standard approach to searching for gravitational wave signatures in pulsar timing array (PTA) data has been to compare the theoretical Hellings and Downs (HD) curve with the observed correlations in pulsar timing residuals as a function of angular separation on the sky between pulsar pairs. While this approach has successfully produced evidence for the presence of nanohertz-wavelength gravitational waves, it does not, on its own, produce any directional information. It is also insensitive to the polarization of the gravitational waves. An alternative approach is to construct maps of the gravitational wave distribution on the sky. In this paper, we present a simple quadratic estimator of the gravitational wave power as a function of direction on the sky that is sensitive to the polarization state of the wave. In this way, we describe the full, $S_2 \times S_2$, state-space of a polarized gravitational wave background across the sky and the Poincaré sphere describing polarization. A natural question arises from this perspective: what is the resolution of a polarized sky-map, i.e. effectively how many independent pixels can a such a map contain? In other words, how many distinct gravitational waves can a PTA, in principle, distinguish? It turns out the answer is finite, and is approximately $N_{\rm res} = 16 \times 2 = 32$, where 16 is the number of resolvable sky-positions and 2 is the number of distinct polarization states. This corresponds to an angular resolution of $58^\circ$, which can be achieved by a PTA with more than $N_{\rm pulsar} \gtrsim 20$ pulsars. We demonstrate that the variance of the map is equivalent to the HD significance, while for a single point source, a 3-$\sigma$ HD signal corresponds to a 5.2-$\sigma$ map significance.

 - **Abstract**
 We have initiated a large project on identifying the requirements for developing a realistic and ground-up approach to simulating the formation of terrestrial planets in our solar system. As the first phase of this project, we present here the criteria that any model of planetesimal growth needs to fulfill in order to be self-consistent and produce reliable results. We demonstrate how these criteria emerge by revisiting runaway growth and carrying out a thorough analysis of its results. As our goal is to identify the pathway to a realistic model, we focus analysis on simulations where at the beginning, planetesimals are not artificially enlarged. We show how using uninflated planetesimals, as the first requirement for a realistic model, will result in a set of criteria naturally emerging from the evolution of the system. For instance, the growth times in simulations with uninflated planetesimals become comparable to the time of giant planet formation implying that any realistic simulation of planetesimal growth, in addition to using real-size planetesimals, needs to include the perturbation of the growing giant planets as well. Our analysis also points to a strong connection between the initial distribution of planetesimals and the final outcome. For instance, due to their natural expansion, initially isolated distributions, or a collection of initially isolated distributions, such as rings of planetesimals, do not produce reliable results. In a self-consistent and realistic model, where the initial conditions are supported by basic principles and do not include simplifying, ad hoc assumptions, the entire disk of planetesimals has to be simulated at once. We present the results of our analyses and discuss their implied criteria.

 - **Abstract**
 We determine optimal requirements for the joint detection of habitable-zone planets and cold giant planets with the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO). Analysis of 164 nearby stars shows that a coronagraph outer working angle (OWA) of 1440 milliarcseconds (mas) is necessary to achieve 80-90% visibility of cold giants. Approximately 40 precursor radial velocity measurements with 1 m/s precision are required to adequately constrain orbital parameters before HWO observations. We demonstrate that 6-8 astrometric measurements distributed across the mission timeline, compared to radial velocity constraints alone and to astrometry constraints alone, significantly improve orbital parameter precision, enabling direct determination of orbital inclination with uncertainties of 0.8-3 degrees. For habitable-zone planet characterization, 4-5 epochs provide moderate confidence, while high-confidence (95%) confirmation requires 8+ observations. These specifications are essential for the comprehensive characterization of planetary system architectures and understanding the potential habitability of terrestrial exoplanets.

 - **Abstract**
 We present maps of the mean metallicity distributions on the Galactocentric $R$--$Z$ plane at different azimuthal angles using red clump stars selected from the LAMOST and APOGEE surveys. In the inner disk ($R < $ 11\,kpc), the metallicity distribution is symmetric between the upper and lower disk. However, we find a North-South metallicity asymmetry in the outer disk ($R > 11$\,kpc), especially towards the anti-Galactic center ($-5^\circ < \Phi < 15^\circ$) direction. By further dissecting the map in age space, we detect this asymmetry across all mono-age stellar populations. However, the asymmetry is less pronounced in older populations ($\tau > 8$ Gyr) compared to younger ones ($\tau < 6$\,Gyr). This reduced significance likely stems from three factors: larger age uncertainties, fewer stars in the outer disk, and the kinematically hotter nature of older populations. The observed metallicity asymmetry may be the consequence of the purturbation of the recent pericentric passage through the Galactic disk and tidal force of the well-known Sagittarius dwarf galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 Although the debate about the systematic errors of DESI DR1 is still open, recent DESI DR2 is consistent with DESI DR1 and further strengthens the results of DESI DR1. In this analysis, we present a $\sim 2.38 \sigma$ discrepancy between Planck $\Lambda$ CDM cosmology and the DESI DR2 Luminous Red Galaxy (LRG1) data at $z_{\text{eff}} = 0.51$, which predicts an unexpectedly large value for $\Omega_m$, $\Omega_m = 0.471^{+0.119}_{-0.065}$. We find that the $w_0 w_a$CDM model, using DESI DR2 data, suggests $w_0 > 1$, indicating a deviation from the standard $\Lambda$CDM paradigm, where is strictly $w_0 = -1$. Additionally, the DESI DR2 data reveals that the value of $\Omega_m$ fluctuates at the 2.97 $\sigma$ level as redshift bin increases, particularly within the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. The DESI DR2 LRG1 data at $z_{\text{eff}} = 0.51$ seem to contradict the results from Type Ia supernovae in the same redshift range. However, it is expected that this discrepancy will become less significant with future DESI data releases, and the trend for $\Omega_m$ is expected to continue to increase as higher redshifts are considered. The statistical significance of this trend was approximately $1.8 \sigma$ when only the DESI DR1 data was considered, but, in the light of DESI DR2 data, the significance has decreased to about $0.52 \sigma$. Despite this reduction, the trend showing an increase in $\Omega_m$ with higher redshifts remains, though with less statistical confidence. This highlights the importance of understanding why the DESI LRG1 data at $z_{\text{eff}} = 0.51$ appear to be an outlier in the determination of $\Omega_m$.

 - **Abstract**
 The Quintuplet cluster, located in the Galactic centre, is one of the few young massive clusters in the Milky Way. It allows us to study dozens of massive, post main sequence stars individually, providing unique insights into the properties of the most massive stars. Our goal is to study the radio continuum emission of the most massive stars in the cluster. We carried out a total of nine observations (three in the C- and six in the X-band) of the Quintuplet cluster with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array in A-configuration. We cross-matched the detected sources with infrared stellar catalogues to ensure cluster membership, calculated their spectral indices, quantified variability, and inferred clumping-scaled mass-loss rates We present the most complete catalogue of radio stars in the Quintuplet cluster to date, with a total of 41 detections, and the deepest images of the cluster in the 4 to 12 GHz range (reaching an rms noise level of $2.3\, \mu\mathrm{Jy/beam}$ in the X-band). The six year baseline of our observations allowed us to perform a robust variability assessment, finding that around $60\%$ of the Quintuplet radio-stars are variable on timescales of months to years. We derived the spectral indices of 28 out of the 41 sources. Based on their spectral indices and variability, we classify 11 of them as colliding-wind binaries, seven as strictly thermal sources, and ten as ambiguous. Including the ambiguous sources, we estimate a multiplicity fraction of ($75\pm22\%$). We also computed upper limits for the mass-loss rates of the thermal radio-stars, finding them in agreement with typical values for WNh and WC stars. Finally, we compare these results to the ones obtained from our analogous study of the Arches cluster.

 - **Abstract**
 AstroPix is a novel high-voltage CMOS active pixel sensor being developed for a next generation gamma-ray space telescope, AMEGO-X. To meet AMEGO-X instrument requirements, AstroPix must achieve full depletion of its $500~\rm{\mu m}$ thick, $500~\rm{\mu m}$-pitch pixels. It must be sensitive to gamma rays in the range of $25-700$ keV, with the energy resolution at 122 keV of $<10$%. Furthermore, given the space-based nature of AMEGO-X, the power consumption of AstroPix needs to be lower than $1.5~\rm{mW/{cm}^2}$. We report the gamma-ray response of the latest version of AstroPix, AstroPix4. The chip contains $16\times 13$ array of $500~\rm{\mu m}$-pitch pixels. The power consumption is estimated to be about $2~\rm{mW/{cm}^2}$, which is approximately half the power of the previous AstroPix version. The input capacitance is reduced, allowing for the detection of the 14 keV photopeak from $\rm{^{57}Co}$ and a moderate energy resolution of 14% at 122 keV. The dynamic range is estimated to be in the range from 14 keV to $\sim250$ keV. We found that the sensor depletion layer expands as expected and the measured depletion depth is approximately $90~\rm{\mu m}$ when biased at $-240$ V.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission features of T Cha, a G8-type T Tauri star that has exhibited "seesaw"-type mid-infrared continuum variability over nearly two decades due to the destruction of the disk's inner wall, using JWST/MIRI and Spitzer observations. We report the first detection of weak PAH emission at 6.2, 7.7, and 8.6 microns in the Spitzer/IRS spectrum from 2005. The inner wall destruction in the 2022 JWST epoch allowed more ultraviolet photons to reach the outer disk, increasing the flux levels of PAH bands and enabling their detection well above the continuum. The 11.2 micron PAH flux increases by a factor of three, yet its profile shape remains remarkably stable. The 6.2/11.2 micron flux ratio has increased, but the charge state of the PAH population remains 75% neutral. The PAH features exhibit a "class C" spectral profile, with redshifted peaks and broadened wings consistent with emission from low-mass T Tauri disks. A weak 12.7/11.2 micron ratio points to a lower abundance of duo- and trio-hydrogen modes, implying a predominantly zigzag carbon structure. A faint "class A" sub-component in the 6.2 and 7.7 micron bands may indicate additional PAH processing by ultraviolet radiation from accretion hotspots. Placement on PAH charge-size grids locates T Cha in the low-ionisation, small-size regime (NC <= 30), signifying a largely neutral PAH population across multiple epochs spanning 18 years. Through multi-epoch, high-resolution data from JWST and Spitzer, we identify T Cha as a benchmark source for probing disk evolution and PAH processing, emphasizing the potential of temporal monitoring with JWST.

          Correlation of Coronal Hole Area Indices and Solar Wind Speed

 - **Abstract**
 Coronal holes (CHs) are widely considered as the main sources of high-speed solar wind streams. We validate this thesis comparing the smoothed time series of solar wind speed measured by Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) and various indices of CH areas constructed from the CH catalog compiled at the Kislovodsk Mountain Astronomical Station for the period 2010-2025. The main result is that we find specific indices of CH areas that give a strong correlation with smoothed solar wind speed variations. As an example, 1-year averaged areas of CHs located within 30 degrees of the solar equator yield a correlation of 0.9 with 1-year averaged solar wind speed. This strong correlation is a feature of the particular CH catalog, and considering an alternative CH catalog obtained using the Spatial Possibilistic Clustering Algorithm (SPoCA) from the Heliophysics Event Knowledgebase (HEK), the same index provides a correlation of only 0.3. Although the fact that the correlation significantly depends on the catalog requires a separate discussion, we conclude that if some of the catalogs can be used to construct a reliable indicator of solar wind speed variations, then this methodology should be maintained further. Additionally, we present time-latitude diagrams of rolling correlation between CHs areas and solar wind speed, which, in our opinion, can be used to reveal source CHs for high-speed solar wind streams.

          On the orbital variability of gamma-ray emission in $γ^2$ Velorum

 - **Abstract**
 Colliding wind binaries (CWBs) are promising sources of high-energy gamma-ray emission driven by shock acceleration of particles at wind interaction zones. The nearby CWB system $\gamma^2$ Velorum (WR 11), composed of a Wolf-Rayet (WR) and an O-star, has been recently associated with GeV gamma-ray emission observed by Fermi-LAT, including evidence of orbital variability. This offers a valuable opportunity to test models of phase-dependent hadronic emission and absorption in CWBs. We aim to explain both the spectral energy distribution (SED) and orbital variability of gamma-ray emission from $\gamma^2$ Velorum using a physically motivated phase-dependent hadronic model. We consider the injection of accelerated relativistic protons based on the WR wind's kinetic energy intercepted at the wind collision region (WCR), and calculate the resulting phase-dependent hadronic gamma-ray emission assuming a proton conversion efficiency $\eta_p$ and accounting for energy-dependent diffusion, advection, conical shock interception and the evolution of the effective acceleration volume, assumed to scale with the WCR, with the orbital phase. Gamma-ray emission from hadronic interactions is attenuated by $\gamma$ - $\gamma$ absorption, calculated via full angular integration over both stellar photon fields. Our model successfully reproduces the observed SED and is consistent with the apastron-to-periastron flux ratio, resulting in a dip in emission at periastron passage and an increase during apastron. Our findings support the conclusion that the observed orbital modulation is primarily driven by geometric variations of the WCR. This underscores the significant influence of evolving orbital geometry on the high-energy gamma-ray light curves of $\gamma^2$ Velorum.

 - **Abstract**
 It has remained challenging to reliably identify sub-parsec supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs), despite them being expected to be ubiquitous. We propose a new method using multi-band continuum reverberation mapping to identify low-mass-ratio SMBHBs in active galactic nuclei. The basic principle is that, due to the presence of a low-density cavity between the mini-disks and the circumbinary disk, the continuum emissions show a deficit at certain wavelengths, leading to a distinguishing feature in the relation between the inter-band time lag and wavelengths $\tau(\lambda)$. Specifically, the relation appears flat at short wavelengths because of the truncated sizes of the mini-disks and transits to a power law $\lambda^{4/3}$ at long wavelength stemming from the circumbinary disk. This transition feature is distinct from the uniform relation $\lambda^{4/3}$ of the standard accretion disk around a single black hole. Using the lamp-post scenario and assuming that only the secondary black hole is active in a low-mass-ratio SMBHB, we design a simple continuum reverberation model to calculate the transfer function of the accretion disks and the resulting $\tau(\lambda)$ relations for various SMBHB orbital parameters. The transition wavelength typically can lie at UV/optical bands, mainly depending on the total mass and orbital separation of the SMBHB. We apply our SMBHB model to the intensive multiwavelength monitoring data of the SMBHB candidate PG1302-102 and find that the SMBHB model can reproduce the inter-band time lags. Remarkably, the inferred total mass and orbital period from the SMBHB fitting are consistent with values derived from other independent methods.

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the possibility of retrieving cosmological information from 21-cm tomographic data at intermediate redshift. The first step in our approach consists of training an encoder, composed of several three dimensional convolutional layers, to cast the neutral hydrogen 3D data into a lower dimension latent space. Once pre-trained, the featurizer is able to generate 3D grid representations which, in turn, will be mapped onto cosmology ($\Omega_{\rm m}$, $\sigma_{8}$) via likelihood-free inference. For the latter, which is framed as a density estimation problem, we consider a Bayesian approximation method which exploits the capacity of Masked Autoregressive Flow to estimate the posterior. It is found that the representations learned by the deep encoder are separable in latent space. Results show that the neural density estimator, trained on the latent codes, is able to constrain cosmology with a precision of $R^2 \ge 0.91$ on all parameters and that most of the ground truth of the instances in the test set fall within $1\sigma$ uncertainty. It is established that the posterior uncertainty from the density estimator is reasonably calibrated. We also investigate the robustness of the feature extractor by using it to compress out-of-distribution dataset, that is either from a different simulation or from the same simulation but at different redshift. We find that, while trained on the latent codes corresponding to different types of out-of-distribution dataset, the probabilistic model is still reasonably capable of constraining cosmology, with $R^2 \ge 0.80$ in general. This highlights both the predictive power of the density estimator considered in this work and the meaningfulness of the latent codes retrieved by the encoder. We believe that the approach prescribed in this proof of concept will be of great use when analyzing 21-cm data from various surveys in the near future.

 - **Abstract**
 Cygnus X-3 is the only known Galactic high-mass X-ray binary with a Wolf-Rayet companion. Recent X-ray polarimetry results with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer have revealed it as a concealed ultraluminous X-ray source. It is also the first source where pronounced orbital variability of X-ray polarization has been detected -- notably with only one polarization maximum per orbit. Polarization caused by scattering of the source X-rays can only be orbitally variable if the scattering angles change throughout the orbit. Since this requires an asymmetrically distributed medium around the compact object, the observed variability traces the intrabinary structures. The single-peaked profile further imposes constraints on the possible geometry of the surrounding medium. Therefore, the X-ray polarization of Cygnus X-3 is the first opportunity to study the wind structures of high-mass X-ray binaries in detail. We aim to uncover the underlying geometry through analytical modeling of the polarized variability. Knowledge of these structures could be extended to other sources with similar wind-binary interactions. We study the variability caused by single scattering in the intrabinary bow shock, exploring both the optically thin and optically thick limits. We consider two geometries of the reflecting medium, the axisymmetric parabolic bow shock and the parabolic cylinder shock, and determine the geometry that best matches the X-ray polarimetric data. We find that the peculiar properties of the data can only be replicated with a cylindrical bow shock with asymmetry across the shock centerline and significant optical depth. This geometry is comparable to shocks formed by the jet-wind or outflow-wind interactions. The position angle of the orbital axis is slightly misaligned from the orientation of the radio jet in all our model fits.

          Nighttime Cloud Detection, Tracking and Prediction with All-Sky Cameras

 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents a novel method for real-time nighttime cloud detection, tracking, and prediction using all-sky cameras, aimed at enhancing the efficiency of ground-based robotic telescopes. Ground-based telescopes are vulnerable to adverse weather conditions, particularly cloud cover, which can lead to the loss of valuable observation time and potential damage to the telescope. Existing methods for cloud detection have limitations in accuracy, particularly under varying illumination conditions such as gibbous moon phases. To address these challenges, we developed an algorithm that uses the temporal incoherence of image sequences from all-sky cameras. The method computes difference images to highlight moving cloud structures, applies Otsu thresholding to generate binary cloud maps, and uses mathematical morphology techniques to reduce noise from bright stars and other artifacts. Segmented cloud regions are then tracked across successive frames, allowing estimation of a velocity vector and enabling short-term predictions of cloud movement. Our approach achieves reliable cloud detection and tracking, providing predictions up to 15 minutes into the future - a capability critical for robotic telescopes that rely on look-ahead scheduling. The system was validated against extensive historical data from the Liverpool Telescope's Skycam A and T systems, achieving a false positive rate of approximately 1% and a similar false negative rate, depending on cloud thickness and speed. By improving cloud forecasting and observational scheduling, the system offers a valuable tool for enhancing the operational reliability of robotic telescopes.

 We obtained 420 high-resolution spectra of Proxima, over 159 nights, using the Near Infra Red Planet Searcher (NIRPS). We derived 149 nightly binned radial velocity measurements with a standard deviation of 1.69 m/s and a median uncertainty of 55 cm/s, and performed a joint analysis combining radial velocities, spectroscopic activity indicators, and ground-based photometry, to model the planetary and stellar signals present in the data, applying multi-dimensional Gaussian process regression to model the activity signals. We detect the radial velocity signal of Proxima b in the NIRPS data. All planetary characteristics are consistent with those previously derived using visible light spectrographs. In addition, we find evidence of the presence of the sub-Earth Proxima d in the NIRPS data. When combining the data with the HARPS observations taken simultaneous to NIRPS, we obtain a tentative detection of Proxima d and parameters consistent with those measured with ESPRESSO. By combining the NIRPS data with simultaneously obtained HARPS observations and archival data, we confirm the existence of Proxima d, and demonstrate that its parameters are stable over time and against change of instrument. We refine the planetary parameters of Proxima b and d, and find inconclusive evidence of the signal attributed to Proxima c (P = 1900 d) being present in the data. We measure Proxima b and d to have minimum masses of 1.055 $\pm$ 0.055 Me, and 0.260 $\pm$ 0.038 Me, respectively. Our results show that, in the case of Proxima, NIRPS provides more precise radial velocity data than HARPS, and a more significant detection of the planetary signals. The standard deviation of the residuals of NIRPS after the fit is 80 cm/s, showcasing the potential of NIRPS to measure precise radial velocities in the near-infrared.

 - **Abstract**
 The Near-InfraRed Planet Searcher (NIRPS) is a high-resolution, high-stability near-infrared (NIR) spectrograph equipped with an AO system. Installed on the ESO 3.6-m telescope, it was developed to enable radial velocity (RV) measurements of low-mass exoplanets around M dwarfs and to characterise exoplanet atmospheres in the NIR. This paper provides a comprehensive design overview and characterisation of the NIRPS instrument, reporting on its on-sky performance, and presenting its GTO programme. The instrument started its operations on 1 Apr 2023 after intensive on-sky testing phases. The spectral range continuously covers the Y, J, and H bands from 972.4 to 1919.6 nm. The thermal control system maintains 1 mK stability over several months. The NIRPS AO-assisted fibre link improves coupling efficiency and offers a unique high-angular resolution capability with a fibre acceptance of only 0.4 arcsec. A high spectral resolving power of 90 000 and 75 000 is provided in HA and HE modes, respectively. The overall throughput from the top of the atmosphere to the detector peaks at 13 percent. The RV precision, measured on the bright star Proxima with a known exoplanetary system, is 77 cm/s. NIRPS and HARPS can be used simultaneously, offering unprecedented spectral coverage for spectroscopic characterisation and stellar activity mitigation. Modal noise can be aptly mitigated by the implementation of fibre stretchers and AO scanning mode. Initial results confirm that NIRPS opens new possibilities for RV measurements, stellar characterisation, and exoplanet atmosphere studies with high precision and high spectral fidelity. NIRPS demonstrated stable RV precision at the level of 1 m/s over several weeks. The instrument high throughput offers a notable improvement over previous spectrographs, enhancing our ability to detect small exoplanets.

          Rediscussion of eclipsing binaries. Paper XXV. The chemically-peculiar system AR Aurigae

 - **Abstract**
 AR Aur is a detached eclipsing binary containing two late-B stars which are chemically peculiar, on a circular orbit of period 4.135 d. The primary is a HgMn star which shows temporal changes in its chemical abundances and spectral line profiles, whilst the secondary is a likely weak Am star. Published analyses of the system have used spectroscopic light ratios to constrain the eclipse models and found that the secondary star is larger than the primary. This unexpected outcome has been taken as an indication that the system is young and the secondary has yet to reach the main sequence. In this work we present the first analysis of the light curve of the system obtained by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), whose quality allows us to avoid using a spectroscopic light ratio to constrain the solution. When combined with literature spectroscopic results we obtain highly precise masses of 2.544 +/- 0.009 Msun and 2.358 +/- 0.009 Msun, and radii of 1.843 +/- 0.002 Rsun and 1.766 +/- 0.003 Rsun. The light ratio is inconsistent with spectroscopic determinations, confirming the suggestion of Takeda (2025) that spectroscopic light ratios of the system are unreliable due the chemical peculiarity of the stars. The properties of the system are matched by theoretical predictions for a slightly super-solar metallicity and an age of 33 +/- 3 Myr: both components are young main-sequence stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Short--period ($P<$1 hr orbits) detached double white dwarf binary (DWDB) components identified with transient surveys (e.g. SDSS, ZTF) have hot surface temperatures ($>$10,000 K) and observed radii a factor two larger than completely degenerate white dwarfs. We formulate tidal heating in helium composition extremely low mass white dwarf (ELM WD) components of detached DWDBs which reach mass transfer within a Hubble time. We combine a mass radius relation which varies with surface temperature and the tidal friction model of Hut 1981, where the additional orbital energy loss from tidal friction is accounted for by increases in the primary surface temperature, and hence increasing radius. Applying this heating model to the current sample of binaries with ZTF, we predict temperature increases from the present day of up to $\sim$40\% before the onset of mass transfer. We find that helium white dwarfs are generically hot and large at the onset of mass transfer, even for the oldest DWDBs whose components can cool to be degenerate by the present day. In the population of Galactic DWDBs, we find that the onset of mass transfer should occur at orbital periods as long as 1000s (17 minutes), or binary gravitational wave frequency of 2 mHz. This is over three times longer than periods expected for degenerate WD (5 minutes). Since mass transferring DWDBs are progenitors for a variety of transients and stellar populations e.g. RCrB stars, AM CVn binaries, type .Ia supernova, the finite temperature of donor white dwarfs should be taken into account.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) can strip planetary atmospheres, reducing the potential habitability of terrestrial planets. While flares have been observed for decades, stellar CMEs remain elusive. Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) emissions are sensitive to both flares and CME-induced coronal dimming. We assess the detectability of stellar CME-induced EUV dimming events by adapting a known "Sun-as-a-star" dimming technique -- validated by the Solar Dynamics Observatory's EUV Variability Experiment (EVE) -- to stellar conditions. We adapt the solar data to reflect a range of stellar intensities, accounting for intrinsic brightness, distance, and interstellar medium (ISM) attenuation. We generate synthetic light curves for two different missions: the legacy EUV Explorer (EUVE) and the proposed ESCAPE mission. Our results indicate that dimming detections are well within reach. EUVE's broadband imager was capable of detecting stellar CMEs -- albeit with limited spectral (temperature) resolution -- but that was not part of the observing plan. EUVE's spectroscopic survey lacked sufficient sensitivity for CME detections. Optimizing modern instrument design for this task would make the observation fully feasible. In this work, we present a tool to explore the stellar-CME detection parameter space. Our tool shows that an instrument with performance similar to ESCAPE, setting a 600-second integration period, and integrating the spectra into bands, any star with an X-ray flux $\geq 2.51 \times 10^{-12}$ergs$^{-1}$~cm$^{-2}$ should have a $\geq 3\sigma$ detection even for a modest few-percent dimming profile, regardless of ISM attenuation. Such measurements would be crucial for understanding the space weather environments of exoplanet host stars and, ultimately, for evaluating planetary habitability.

 - **Abstract**
 We compare an autoencoder convolutional neural network (AE-CNN) with a conventional maximum-likelihood estimator (MLE) for inferring cluster virial masses, $M_v$, directly from the galaxy distribution around clusters, without identifying members or interlopers. The AE-CNN is trained on mock galaxy catalogues, whereas the MLE assumes that clusters of similar mass share the same phase-space galaxy profile. Conceptually, the MLE returns an unbiased estimate of $\log M_v$ at fixed true mass, whereas the AE-CNN approximates the posterior mean, so the true $\log M_v$ is unbiased at fixed estimate. Using MDPL2 mock clusters with redshift space number density as input, the AE-CNN attains an rms scatter of $0.10\,\textrm{dex}$ between predicted and true $\log M_v$, compared with $0.16\,\textrm{dex}$ for the MLE. With inputs based on mean peculiar velocities, binned in redshift space or observed distance, the AE-CNN achieves scatters of $0.12\,\textrm{dex}$ and $0.16\,\textrm{dex}$, respectively, despite strong inhomogeneous Malmquist bias.

 - **Abstract**
 We have reprocessed the data archived from the Parkes 70-cm pulsar (PKS70) survey with an expanded DM search range and an acceleration search. Our goal was to detect pulsars that might have been missed in the original survey processing. Of the original 43842 pointings, 34869 pointings were archived, along with 440 additional pointings for confirmation or timing. We processed all of these archived data and detected 359 known pulsars: 265 of these were detected in the original survey, while an additional 94 currently known pulsars were detected in our reprocessing. A few among those 94 pulsars are highly accelerated binary pulsars. Furthermore, we detected 5 more pulsars with DMs higher than the original survey thresholds, as well as 6 more pulsars below the nominal survey sensitivity threshold (from the original survey beams with longer integrations). We missed detection of 33 (of the 298) pulsars detected in the original survey, in part because portions of the survey data were missing in the archive and our early stage candidate sifting method. We discovered one new pulsar in the re-analysis, PSR J0540$-$69 which has a spin period of 0.909 s and resides in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). This new pulsar appeared in three PKS70 beams and one additional L-band observation that targeted the LMC pulsar PSR B0540$-$69. The numerous pulsar detections found in our re-analysis and the discovery of a new pulsar in the LMC highlight the value of conducting multiple searches through pulsar datasets.

 - **Abstract**
 Star-forming regions are essential for studying very young stellar objects of various masses. They still contain a significant amount of dust and gas. We present a study of light curves of stars in the field of the Chamaeleon I association. We use automatic spectral classification with MKCLASS to identify the spectral types of the stars in the field with a light curve from the NEOWISE and Gaia surveys. The light curves are analysed using the software Peranso and astropy. We also used VSX to identify the variability type. Based on astrometry, we have identified 92 stars, 73 of which are members of the association. We received light curves for 55 stars from the Gaia survey and for 69 stars from the ALLWISE/NEOWISE survey. For 28 of them, it was possible to determine the types of variables, mostly T Tauri and Orion variables. The spectral types of the members are mostly cooler M-type stars, with one being a possible chemically peculiar (CP) star. The non-members associated with light curve measurements include spectral types A-G with one CP candidate.

 - **Abstract**
 Strange quark stars (SQSs), namely compact stars entirely composed of deconfined quark matter, are characterized by similar masses and compactness to neutron stars (NSs) and have been theoretically proposed to exist in the Universe since the 1970s. However, multiwavelength observations of compact stars in the last 50 years have not yet led to an unambiguous SQS identification. This article explores whether SQSs could form in the supernova (SN) explosion of an evolved star (e.g., carbon-oxygen, or Wolf-Rayet) occurring in a binary with the companion being a neutron star (NS). The collapse of the iron core of the evolved star generates a newborn NS and the SN explosion. Part of the ejected matter accretes onto the NS companion as well as onto the newborn NS via matter fallback. The accretion occurs at hypercritical (highly super-Eddington) rates, transferring mass and angular momentum to the stars. We present numerical simulations of this scenario and demonstrate that the density increase in the NS interiors during the accretion process may induce quark matter deconfinement, suggesting the possibility of SQS formation. We discuss the astrophysical conditions under which such a transformation may occur and possible consequences.

          Superhydrogenation of indene at low temperatures

 - **Abstract**
 The hydrogenation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) is crucial to understanding molecular hydrogenation formation in the interstellar medium. This process also helps to elucidate the weakening of the aromatic bonds in PAHs, which may function as a carbon reservoir. Tunneling can significantly promote the hydrogenation process in a low to moderate temperature range. We present the hydrogenation sequence of the newly observed PAH molecule, indene, and clarify the tunneling rule at temperature in photodissociation region (PDR) and dark molecular cloud conditions. In addition, we report fit parameters to be utilized in astronomical modeling. The hydrogenation sequence was studied using simple hydrogenation rules and confirmed by barriers from density functional theory (DFT). To make our kinetic studies useful to modelers, we implemented a Monte Carlo method based program to generate and optimize random initial fit parameters (alpha, beta, gamma, and T0) to achieve the statistically best fit. We find that indene hydrogenation follows rules similar to those of other PAHs, such as pentacene, coronene, and corannulene, with binding energies for odd numbered hydrogenation steps ranging from 0.5 to 2 eV and barriers around 0.13 eV for the first, fifth, and seventh hydrogenation steps. The third hydrogenation step is the rate limiting step, similar to what is found for other PAHs. Even numbered hydrogenation steps have lower barriers and lead to more stable intermediates as a result of radical recombinations. The hydrogenation sequence follows a scheme that strongly depends on the PAH's shape, the number of aromatic rings, and the presence of five membered rings. Furthermore, we observe that tunneling plays an important role in the hydrogenation of indene at temperatures between 30 and 75 K, which corresponds to the temperatures of dust in PDRs.

          The Cooling of Old White Dwarfs in 47 Tucanae

 - **Abstract**
 We analysed the cooling of white dwarfs in the globular cluster 47 Tucanae using deep observations from the Hubble Space Telescope that resolve the white dwarf cooling sequence to late enough cooling times that the white dwarf core has begun to crystallise and the envelope has become convectively coupled to the core. At such late cooling times, both the state of matter assumed for ions in the treatment of element diffusion and the thickness of the outer H envelope become important considerations for modelling white dwarf cooling. Using the stellar evolution software Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA), we created a suite of white dwarf cooling models for different treatments of element diffusion, as well as different values of the white dwarf mass and H envelope thickness parameters. Three different diffusion scenarios were considered: i) the standard MESA implementation, which implicitly uses an ideal gas approximation for the ions, ii) a custom modified implementation that accounts for non-ideal gas effects, and iii) no diffusion. An unbinned likelihood analysis was performed to compare these cooling models to the observations. This work both constrains the values of parameters important for modelling white dwarf cooling and tests the implementation of element diffusion in MESA to late cooling times. We find that models with thicker H envelopes are preferred and that the standard MESA diffusion treatment produces a best-fitting model that well reproduces the cumulative white dwarf luminosity functions of the observations.

- **Abstract**
 Interstellar objects are the ejected building blocks of other solar systems. As such, they enable the acquisition of otherwise inaccessible information about nascent extrasolar systems. The discovery of the third interstellar object, 3I/ATLAS, provides an opportunity to explore the properties of a small body from another solar system and to compare it to the small bodies in our own. To that end, we present spectrophotometric observations of 3I/ATLAS taken using the SuperNova Integral Field Spectrograph on the University of Hawaii 2.2-m telescope. Our data includes the earliest $\lambda\leq3800$ A spectrum of 3I/ATLAS, obtained $\sim$12.5 hours after the discovery announcement. Later spectra confirm previously reported cometary activity, including Ni and CN emission. The data show wavelength-varying spectral slopes ($S\approx($0\%-29\%)/1000 A, depending on wavelength range) throughout the pre-perihelion ($r_h=4.4$-$2.5$ au) approach of 3I/ATLAS. We perform synthetic photometry on our spectra and find 3I/ATLAS shows mostly stable color evolution over the period of our observations, with $g-r$ colors ranging from $\sim$0.69-0.75 mag, $r-i$ colors ranging from $\sim$0.26-0.30 mag, and $c-o$ colors ranging from $\sim$0.50-0.55 mag. Ongoing post-perihelion observations of 3I/ATLAS will provide further insight into its potentially extreme composition.

- **Abstract**
 Spectroscopic datasets are essential for training and calibrating photometric redshift (photo-$z$) methods. However, spectroscopic redshifts (spec-$z$'s) constitute a biased and sparse sampling of the photometric galaxy population, which creates difficulties for the common grid-based approach for mapping color to redshift using self-organizing maps (SOMs). Instead, we utilized the uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) algorithm to compress a Rubin-Roman-like $ugrizyJH$ color space into a thin and densely-sampled manifold. Crucially, the manifold varies continuously and monotonically in redshift and specific star formation rate in roughly orthogonal directions. Using $\sim$110,000 COSMOS2020 many-band photo-$z$'s and $\sim$15,000 spec-$z$'s as representative and non-representative samples, respectively, we trained and tested redshift estimation from a SOM (SOM-$z$) and from nearest neighbors in UMAP space (UMAP-$k$NN-$z$). Compared to SOM-$z$, UMAP-$k$NN-$z$ exhibited smaller photo-$z$ scatter and fraction of outliers for the representative training set. When training with the highly biased spec-$z$ sample, UMAP-$k$NN-$z$ maintained similar performance, but the outlier fraction for SOM-$z$ increased by nearly three times. The physically-meaningful trends across the UMAP manifold allow for accurate redshift regression even in regions of color space sparsely populated by spectroscopic objects, which comprise nearly 25% of the photometric sample. This suggests that representative, spectroscopically-anchored training sets can be produced by interpolating between spectroscopic sources at the UMAP coordinates of photometric objects, maximizing the performance of photo-$z$ algorithms.

- **Abstract**
 With the aim of evaluating the roles of the cold neutral medium (CNM) in the cloud-scale baryon cycle, we perform a high-resolution study of the CNM in and around the extreme star-forming region 30 Doradus (30 Dor). For our study, we use Galactic Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder H I Survey data and produce H I emission and absorption cubes on 7 pc scales. To examine the CNM structures toward 30 Dor, we decompose the H I absorption cube into 862 Gaussian components and find that these components are distributed at four velocity ranges (B1, B2, B3, and B4, respectively): 200$-$230 km s$^{-1}$, 230$-$260 km s$^{-1}$, 260$-$277 km s$^{-1}$, and 277$-$300 km s$^{-1}$. We derive line-of-sight average spin temperatures and opacity-corrected total H I column densities and show that the B1$-$B4 structures have systematically different properties, indicating that they are physically distinct. As for the nature of the observed CNM structures, we find that B2 is associated with the main dense structure where ionized, atomic, and molecular gases are concentrated. B3 and B4 trace inflows whose combined mass flux rate of 0.14 $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ is comparable to the current star formation rate, while B1 probes outflows with a much lower mass flux rate of 0.007 $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. Interestingly, the H I column densities in B1$-$B4 are nearly uniform with a factor of two spatial variations, implying the presence of H I shielding layers for H$_{2}$ formation.

- **Abstract**
 We investigate the host galaxy of the long gamma-ray burst GRB 230307A, which is associated with a kilonova candidate likely produced by a binary neutron-star (BNS) merger. The transient occurred at a projected offset of $\sim 40$ kpc from its spiral-galaxy host. We consider two explanations for this large distance: (i) NSs that merge inside a remote globular cluster, or (ii) a BNS that formed in the disk whose orbit was strongly modified by the NS natal kicks. Using JWST data and comparisons with known globular clusters, we show that a globular-cluster origin is extremely unlikely, ruling out case (i). Considering case (ii), using JWST and MUSE data, we derive the host galaxy morphology, stellar mass, estimate the atomic gas (HI+He) contribution, and the host rotation curve. Assuming an NFW halo and applying Bayesian inference, we obtain a mass model for the host galaxy. From this model, we compute the time required for a disk-formed BNS, with a given natal kick, to reach the observed offset while marginalizing over uncertainties and over the initial position in the disk. We compare these results with BNS-merger simulations from the SEVN population-synthesis code combined with PARSEC stellar evolutionary tracks, which provide the coalescence time and kick velocity for each realization. The two approaches have an overlap in the kick-time diagram, but only 0.1\% of the simulated systems fall within the 2$\sigma$ region of the galaxy mass model. This indicates that a disk origin is possible, but requires fine-tuned conditions for the kilonova to occur at such a large distance from the host galaxy.

- **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive kinematic analysis of the solar neighborhood (d < 50 pc) using high-precision astrometric data from the third Gaia Data Release (DR3). By leveraging the full six dimensional phase space information (positions and velocities), we apply the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm to blindly identify stellar overdensities in the Galactocentric Cartesian velocity space (U, V, W ). Our unsupervised machine learning approach successfully recovers the kinematic cores of major local moving groups, including the Hyades and Pleiades streams, without prior assumptions regarding their membership or spatial distribution. We analyze the velocity dispersion and structural properties of these associations, demonstrating that automated clustering algorithms are robust tools for mapping the complex dynamical history of the local Milky Way disk. These results confirm the hierarchical nature of stellar kinematic substructures and provide a catalog of high-probability members for future spectroscopic follow-up.

- **Abstract**
 Isotopic fractionation is a very powerful tool to follow the evolution of material from one stage to the next in the star-formation process. Pre-stellar cores exhibit some of the highest levels of deuteration because their physical conditions greatly favor deuteration processes. Deuteration maps are a measure of the effectiveness of the deuteration across the core, and they are useful to study both the deuteration as well as the formation mechanism of the main species. Methanol is the simplest O-bearing complex organic molecule (COM) detected in the interstellar medium (ISM). It represents the beginning of molecular complexity in star-forming regions, thus a complete understanding of its formation and deuteration is a necessary step to understand the development of further chemical complexity. In this paper, we use single-dish observations with the IRAM 30 m telescope and state-of-the-art chemical models to investigate the deuteration of methanol towards the prototypical pre-stellar core L1544. We also compare the results of the chemical models with previous observations of deuterated methanol towards the pre-stellar cores HMM1 and L694-2. The spectra extracted from the CHD$_2$OH map show that the emission is concentrated in the center and towards the north-west of the core. Using deep observations towards the dust and the methanol peaks of the core, we derive a very large deuterium fraction for methanol ($\sim20\%$) towards both peaks. The comparison of our observational results with chemical models has highlighted the importance of H-abstraction processes in the formation and deuteration of methanol. Deep observations combined with state-of-the-art chemical models are of fundamental importance in understanding the development of molecular complexity in the ISM. Our analysis also shows the importance of non-LTE effects when measuring the D/H ratios in methanol.

- **Abstract**
 The use of the spectral subtraction technique allows measurements of chromospheric activity in late-type stars across several activity indicators, such as H$\alpha$ and the other Balmer lines in the visible, He I D3 and Na I D1, D2, Ca II H and K, and Ca II infrared triplet, as well as the Paschen series and He I $\lambda$10830 lines in the near-infrared. iSTARMOD is an updated and extended version of the original STARMOD code and its subsequent modifications. iSTARMOD is presented in this paper as a Python code developed to quantify chromospheric activity by using the spectral subtraction technique. iSTARMOD improves usability, modularity, and integration with modern data analysis workflows and is publicly available, including several examples that help one learn how to use and test the code. The iSTARMOD code is accompanied here with a series of calibrations of $\chi$-functions, to transform the excess emission equivalent widths measured through iSTARMOD into absolute surface fluxes. The method provided with this code and the corresponding flux calibrations allows for the automatic characterization of the chromospheric activity of a large number of spectra or a large number of stars and is also very useful for mitigating the effect of activity on radial velocities in the search for exoplanets.

- **Abstract**
 AT 2020vdq has been known as a candidate of repeating partial tidal disruption events (pTDEs), due to its two flares with a time interval of $\sim$1000 days. Here, a simplified method is proposed to test such repeating pTDEs scenario considering a main-sequence star tidally disrupted twice. For the two flares in AT 2020vdq if related to the repeating pTDEs scenario, theoretical TDE model determined stellar mass of the original star disrupted for the first flare should be not very different from the mass of the star (to trace the reminder of the original star) disrupted for the second flare, because a partial TDE with impact parameter $\beta$ smaller than 1 can lead to most of (probable higher than 90\%) the stellar mass also bound to the reminder of the original star. After considering theoretical TDE model applied to describe the two flares in AT 2020vdq, the model determined stellar masses are about 2${\rm M_\odot}$ and $0.36{\rm M_\odot}$ for the stars disrupted in the first flare and the second flare. The large mass difference cannot be reasonably expected by the repeating pTDEs with $\beta$ around 0.6 in AT 2020vdq. The results in this manuscript indicate that the repeating pTDEs scenario is not preferred at current stage in AT 2020vdq, but the probable double TDEs for two individual stars tidally disrupted should be currently recommended.

- **Abstract**
 Solar prominences are cool, dense stable structures routinely observed in the corona. Prominences are often ejected from the Sun via coronal mass ejections (CMEs). However, they are rarely detected in a cool, low-ionized state within CMEs measured in situ, making their evolution hard to study. We examine the thermodynamic evolution of one of these rare cases where a quiescent prominence eruption clearly preserves its low-ionized charge state as evidenced by in situ detection. We use multi-viewpoint Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) observations to track and estimate the density, temperature and speed of the prominence as it erupts. We observe that part of the prominence remains in absorption well beyond initial liftoff, indicating the bulk of the prominence experiences minimal ionization and suggesting any strong heating is balanced by radiative losses, expansion, or conduction. From its subsequent in situ passage near 1au, charge states reveal that the prominence is composed of both cool, low-ionized ions as well as hotter plasma reflected by the presence of highly ionized iron, Fe$^{16+}$. Simulated non-equilibrium ionization and recombination results using observationally derived initial conditions match the in situ multi-thermal state for a prominence composed of 70% cool plasma with a 1.8MK peak temperature, and 30% hot plasma with a 4.3MK peak temperature. This suggests that the prominence may not be heated uniformly or that parts of it cools more rapidly. The complex, multi-thermal nature of this erupting prominence emphasizes the need for more comprehensive spectral observations of the global corona.

          SN 2022ngb: a faint, slow-evolving Type IIb Supernova with a low-mass envelope

- **Abstract**
 An extensive photometric and spectroscopic follow-up campaign of the Type IIb SN 2022ngb is presented in the article. Through detailed modeling of this dataset, we aim to constrain the key physical parameters of the explosion, infer the nature of the progenitor star and its environment, and probe the dynamical properties of the ejecta. We analyze photometric and spectroscopic data of SN 2022ngb. By constructing and modeling the bolometric light curve with semi-analytic models, we estimate the primary explosion parameters. The spectroscopic data are compared with those of well-studied SNe IIb and NLTE models to constrain the properties of the progenitor and the structure of the resulting ejecta. SN 2022ngb is a low-luminosity SN IIb with a peak bolometric luminosity of L_bol = 7.76 (+1.15/-1.00) x 10^41 erg/s and a V-band rising time of 24.32 +/- 0.50 days. Light curve modeling indicates an ejecta mass of ~2.9-3.2 M_sun, an explosion energy of ~1.4 x 10^51 erg, and a low synthesized 56Ni mass of ~0.045 M_sun. Nebular phase spectra exhibit asymmetric line profiles, pointing to a non-spherical explosion and an anisotropic distribution of radioactive material. Our analysis reveals a relatively compact stripped-envelope progenitor with a pre-SN mass of approximately 4.7 M_sun (corresponding to a 15-16 M_sun ZAMS star). Our analysis suggests that SN 2022ngb originated from the explosion of a moderate-mass relatively compact, stripped-envelope star in a binary system. The asymmetries inferred from the nebular phase spectral line features suggest a non-spherical explosion.

- **Abstract**
 We present a systematic investigation of 1,481 Galactic open clusters (OCs) through the application of the Limepy dynamical model, from which we derive the fundamental structural parameters of OCs. We conduct the statistical analyses on the structural parameters with clusters' ages and locations within the Milky Way. Our results reveal the higher concentration in the cluster centeris associated with the sharper truncation at the periphery of cluster, which is consistent with previous findings for globular clusters(GCs). We further find the systematic increase of the lower limit of clusters' half-mass radius (Rh) with age. Our results also show that OCs located at larger vertical distances from the Galactic plane systematically display higher central concentrations. Our findings collectively suggest that the structural characteristics of OCs are shaped by both intrinsic evolutionary processes and interactions with the Galactic environment. During the evolution of star clusters, the combined effects of mass segregation and tidal stripping lead to the systematic pattern between central concentration and outer truncation. Clusters of different ages and locations within the Milky Way undergo different evolutionary histories, resulting in correlations between the Rh and age, as well as between central concentration and galactic location.

- **Abstract**
 Due to their proximity, the Pleiades are an important benchmark open cluster. Despite its status, asteroseismic analyses of its members are rare. In particular, the gravity-mode (g-mode) pulsators, which allow inference of stellar near-core properties have not been analysed yet. We aim to identify and analyse the population of g-mode pulsators in the Pleiades. Our focus lies on the internal rotation as measured from asteroseismology to obtain a well defined sample of stellar rotation on the early main sequence. Based on full-frame images from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), we constructed light curves for intermediate-mass Pleiades members and searched for g-mode pulsators among them. For pulsators exhibiting period spacing patterns, we determined their near-core rotation rate and buoyancy periods. For all other g-mode pulsators, we estimated the near-core rotation rate based on the dominant mode frequency to obtain a comprehensive rotation rate distribution. Among our 105 target stars, we find 28 g-mode pulsators distributed across the entire upper main sequence, 19 of which are hybrid pulsators, but only three stars exhibit period spacing patterns in the current TESS data. The near-core rotation rates in A- and early F-type members are distributed between 1 and 3 d$^{-1}$ without any clear mass-dependence. This distribution is much broader than the one in the similar open cluster NGC 2516. A comparison of the buoyancy periods shows that the Pleiades and NGC 2516 are of similar asteroseismic age. With the large population of g-mode and hybrid pulsators, the Pleiades constitute a valuable asteroseismic benchmark cluster, reaffirming its important role in stellar astrophysics.

- **Abstract**
 Aims. We investigate the role of filaments in high-mass star formation, whether gas flows from large to small scales along them, and what their properties might reveal about the region they are found in. Methods. The Max Planck IRAM Observatory Program (MIOP), the Cygnus Allscale Survey of Chemistry and Dynamical Environments (CASCADE), includes high spatial resolution (~3'') data of HCO+(1-0) and H13CO+(1-0) emission in the star-forming DR20 region in the Cygnus X complex. In this data we identify filaments with the structure identification algorithm DisPerSE. We further analyze these filaments using Gaussian fits to the spectra to determine the line peak velocity and full width half maximum along them. The Python package FilChaP was used to determine filament widths. Results. We find projected velocity gradients inside several filaments between 0.4 to 2.4km/s over projected length-scales of 0.1pc toward star-forming cores. This can be interpreted as a sign of gas flowing along the filaments toward the cores. The filament width distributions exhibit median values between 0.06 and 0.14pc depending on the core, the tracer, and the method. Standard deviations are approximately 0.02 to 0.06pc. These values are roughly in agreement with the filament width of 0.1pc typically found in nearby low-mass star-forming regions. Conclusions. This first analysis of filamentary properties within the Cygnus X CASCADE program reveals potential signatures of gas flows along filaments onto star-forming cores. Furthermore, the characteristics of the filaments in this high-mass star-forming region can be compared to those of filaments in low-mass star-forming regions typically studied before. Extending such studies to the entire CASCADE survey will enhance our knowledge of high-mass filament properties on solid statistical grounds.

- **Abstract**
 The bar/bulge and inner disk are fundamental building blocks of the Milky Way, containing a large fraction of its stellar mass. However, stars in these regions are faint, crowded, and have high extinction, which makes studying their formation and evolution challenging. Using the integral-field spectrograph MUSE with adaptive-optics on the Very Large Telescope, we overcome these limitations and measure accurate ages, chemical abundances, and line-of-sight velocities for 98 main-sequence turn-off and subgiant branch stars with $R_{gc}<3.5$ kpc in Baade's Window. We find that 17% stars have ages younger than 5 Gyr, and the age distribution reveals multiple peaks at 3.1, 4.8, 7.6, and 10.8 Gyr, indicating that star formation in the inner Galaxy occurred in multiple episodes. These stars are predominantly metal-rich but span a broad metallicity range ($-1.2<$[Fe/H]$<+0.6$). The [$\alpha$/Fe]-[Fe/H] distribution shows both $\alpha$-rich and $\alpha$-poor sequences, with most stars being metal-rich and low-[$\alpha$/Fe]. Our results demonstrate that IFUs enable reliable measurements of stellar parameters even in the most crowded regions of the Milky Way, opening a new pathway to study the chemodynamical evolution of the inner Galaxy.

- **Abstract**
 We report resolution of a halo of X-ray line emission surrounding the Zero Age Main Sequence (ZAMS) G8.5V star HD 61005 by Chandra ACIS-S. Located only 36.4 pc distant, HD 61005 is young (approx. 100 Myr), x-ray bright (300 times Solar), observed with nearly edge-on geometry, and surrounded by Local Interstellar Medium (LISM) material denser than in the environ of the Sun. HD 61005 is known to harbor large amounts of circumstellar dust in a dense ecliptic plane full of mm-sized particles plus attached, extended wing like structures full of micron sized particles, which are evidence for a strong LISM-dust disk interaction. These properties aided our ability to resolve the 220 au wide astrosphere of HD61005, the first ever observed for a main sequence G-star. The observed x-ray emission morphology is roughly spherical, as expected for an astrospheric structure dominated by the host star. The Chandra spectrum of HD 61005 is a combination of a hard stellar coronal emission (T=8 MK) at Lx = 6 x10e29 erg per sec, plus an extended halo contribution at Lx = 1x10e29 erg per sec dominated by charge exchange (CXE) lines, such as those of OVIII and NeIX. The Chandra CXE x-ray morphology does not track the planar dust morphology but does extend out roughly to where the base of the dust wings begins. We present a toy model of x-ray emission produced by stellar wind (SW)-LISM CXE interactions, similar to the state of the young Sun when it was approximately 100 Myrs old (Guinan and Engle 2007), and transiting through an approximately 1000 times denser part of the interstellar medium (ISM) such as a Giant Molecular Cloud (Stern 2003, Opher and Loeb 2024).

- **Abstract**
 A key question in astronomy is how ubiquitous Earth-like rocky planets are. The formation of terrestrial planets in our solar system was strongly influenced by the radioactive decay heat of short-lived radionuclides (SLRs), particularly $^{26}$Al, likely delivered from nearby supernovae. However, current models struggle to reproduce the abundance of SLRs inferred from meteorite analysis without destroying the protosolar disk. We propose the `immersion' mechanism, where cosmic-ray nucleosynthesis in a supernova shockwave reproduces estimated SLR abundances at a supernova distance ($\sim$1 pc), preserving the disk. We estimate that solar-mass stars in star clusters typically experience at least one such supernova within 1 pc, supporting the feasibility of this scenario. This suggests solar-system-like SLR abundances and terrestrial planet formation are more common than previously thought.

- **Abstract**
 The Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory (STEREO) mission has laid a foundation for advancing real-time space weather forecasting by enabling the evaluation of heliospheric imager (HI) data for predicting coronal mass ejection (CME) arrivals at Earth. This study employs the ELEvoHI model to assess how incorporating STEREO/HI data from the Lagrange 5 (L5) perspective can enhance prediction accuracy for CME arrival times and speeds. Our investigation, preparing for the upcoming ESA Vigil mission, explores whether the progressive incorporation of HI data in real-time enhances forecasting accuracy. The role of human tracking variability is evaluated by comparing predictions based on observations by three different scientists, highlighting the influence of manual biases on forecasting outcomes. Furthermore, the study examines the efficacy of deriving CME propagation directions using HI-specific methods versus coronagraph-based techniques, emphasising the trade-offs in prediction accuracy. Our results demonstrate the potential of HI data to significantly improve operational space weather forecasting when integrated with other observational platforms, especially when HI data from beyond 35° elongation are used. These findings pave the way for optimising real-time prediction methodologies, providing valuable groundwork for the forthcoming Vigil mission and enhancing preparedness for CME-driven space weather events.

- **Abstract**
 We present a kinematical study of the outer halo (r_GC approximately 60 to 160 kpc) of the Milky Way based on spectroscopy of 55 RR Lyrae stars obtained with the ESI instrument on the Keck II telescope. Our spectroscopic targets were selected from three photometric surveys: NGVS, DES, and Pan-STARRS1. We derive center-of-mass radial velocities with uncertainties of 6 to 35 km s^-1. The halo velocity dispersion measured from our sample is 70 plus/minus 7 km s^-1. The velocity field shows a possible dipole-like structure, with redshifted northern and blueshifted southern hemispheres. Fitting a Milky Way - Large Magellanic Cloud dipole perturbation model yields a weak or marginal dipole signal with amplitude -30 (+16, -20) km s^-1 and apex direction (l, b) = (-38.2 (+42.4, -31.5), -41.3 (+27.9, -23.8)) deg, along with a bulk compression velocity of -16 plus/minus 11 km s^-1. Although limited by sky coverage and sample size, our results are consistent with the presence of LMC-induced disequilibrium in the distant halo beyond 100 kpc. In addition to the 55 RR Lyrae stars, our spectroscopy reveals that 10 additional photometrically selected RR Lyrae candidates are actually quasar or blazar contaminants, highlighting the need for caution regarding such contaminants in sparsely sampled photometric surveys. Our study demonstrates that single-epoch spectroscopy of RR Lyrae stars is a viable method for probing the kinematics of the outer halo, and future surveys such as Rubin LSST and DESI-II have the potential to significantly advance this effort.

- **Abstract**
 The modeling of stellar spectra is pervasive in astronomy. Conventionally, the shapes of absorption lines are modeled by convolving thermal profiles (computed given some model stellar atmosphere and line list) with broadening kernels intended to account for the effects of rotation and other nonthermal sources of broadening (i.e., macroturbulence). Here, we show that the assumptions that permit this convolution can break down at high spectral resolution and produce appreciable errors in the modeled flux. We then consider the effects of rotation, microturbulence, and macroturbulence on the intensity and flux contribution functions, which astronomers use to map individual spectral segments to quasi-physical formation ``locations'' in the stellar atmosphere. We show that proper consideration of 1) the distinction between intensity and flux and 2) the inclusion of rotation and macroturbulence in the contribution function can dramatically change the modeled formation temperatures. To complement this analysis, we provide a package -- this http URL -- which quickly computes model line contribution functions and formation parameters given bulk stellar properties as input. In closing, we emphasize the assumptions inherent to this analysis, consider in which regimes the convolution expression for flux should be avoided, and caution how the concept of a singular ``formation temperature'' can oversimplify some realities of radiative transfer.

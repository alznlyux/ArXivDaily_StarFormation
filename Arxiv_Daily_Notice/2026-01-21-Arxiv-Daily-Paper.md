#### Title:
          Metal Pipe: A Broadly-Applicable Stellar Abundance Pipeline Using Isochronal Parameters
 - **Authors:** Jared R. Kolecki, Lauren M. Weiss

- **Abstract**
 Characterizing exoplanet host stars at a population level requires a method of homogeneously characterizing stellar properties across all spectral types. To this end, we have developed Metal Pipe, a new code for determining stellar parameters and abundances, which is designed for use across a wider range of spectral types than many commonly used codes. It combines the widely-used package MOOG with photometric stellar parameters, a user-supplied high-resolution spectrum, and a newly curated list of spectral lines. Metal Pipe outputs values for $T_{\rm{eff}}$, $\log{(g)}$, $M_*$, $R_*$, and $L_*$ from isochrones, and abundances of C, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, Ca, Ti, and Fe from MOOG. In this paper, we describe the Metal Pipe algorithm and tests of Metal Pipe against previous abundance measurements on archival HIRES spectra of 503 F, G, and K type stars. We find RMS scatters of ~100 K in $T_{\rm{eff}}$, ~0.10 dex in $\log{(g)}$, and ~0.10 dex for all measured abundances. These values are comparable to estimated measurement uncertainties, verifying Metal Pipe for continued use in building a detailed abundance catalog. Future papers in this series will test Metal Pipe's applicability to late K and M dwarf stars, and provide other improvements.

          Pink Dwarfs and the Paths to Stardom: How Brown Dwarfs Pushed Above the Hydrogen Burning Limit Evolve

- **Abstract**
 Brown dwarfs that gain mass through binary interactions may be pushed above the boundary that divides brown dwarfs from low-mass stars: the hydrogen burning limit (HBL). Some of these objects will make their way to the main sequence and may eventually be indistinguishable from ordinary low-mass stars, while others will remain brown dwarf-like, unable to burn hydrogen at a high enough rate to power their surface luminosity. We study the evolution of both types of object to provide a taxonomy and testable observational predictions for these objects depending on their evolutionary path. Using MESA simulations, we find that a subset of the objects that will eventually become stars experience an extended luminosity plateau, where their surface luminosity remains nearly constant on 100 Myr - Gyr timescales. We find that the plateau timescale is set by the amount of energy required to re-heat the cores of these objects to a level sufficient to sustain convection. The timescales required for the cores of these objects to "unfreeze" and arrive at the main sequence is long enough that surveys may be able to find objects in this evolutionary stage. These objects, along with those that never reach the main sequence, occupy a unique space in a mass-luminosity diagram, and would provide a unique constraint on binary mass transfer physics.
#### Title:
          Unveiling Ionized Jet Morphologies: Sub-arcsecond VLA Observations of Compact Radio Sources
 - **Authors:** Tatiana M. Rodriguez (1), Peter Hofner (2 and 3), Emmanuel Momjian (4), Esteban D. Araya (5 and 2), Ananay Sethi (2), Viviana Rosero (6) ((1) University of Cologne, (2) New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology, (3) Adjunct Astronomer at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory, (4) National Radio Astronomy Observatory, (5) Western Illinois University, (6) California Institute of Technology)

- **Abstract**
 We present sub-arcsecond ($\theta\sim0.1^{\prime\prime}$) resolution VLA 1.3 cm continuum and 22.2 GHz H$_2$O maser observations toward 15 compact radio continuum sources with rising spectral index and 8 string-like radio continuum structures in the Rosero et al. (2016, 2019) survey. Three different morphologies are observed: elongated or double-peak string-like structure (6 out of 23 cases), a collection of distinct continuum peaks (4 out of 23 cases), and single compact sources (13 out of 23 cases). The majority of H$_2$O maser spots detected are within a sky-projected distance of $\sim5,000$ au from the radio continuum peaks and tend to be well aligned and distributed in an elongated structure when more than three spots are observed. We generally recover less emission than Rosero et al. (2016, 2019), which together with the fact that more than half of the jet candidates in our survey appear mostly compact, suggest core/halo shock structures even on small scales. We also detected proper motion in 10 cases and measured an average projected velocity of approximately 120 km s$^{-1}$. Radio brightness variability is detected in at least two cases, possibly due to weak accretion bursts. This work, together with our previous molecular jet study, provides further evidence that support the main source of ionization in the studied sources is shocks, yet collimation is only observed in 4 cases. We conclude that the available data supports the thermal jet classification of 7 sources, and the ionized jet interpretation is further supported in 16 sources.

          Aligned, Misaligned and Polar Orbits of Hot Jupiters: Measuring Spin-Orbit Angles via Doppler Tomography with HARPS-N

- **Abstract**
 Although the migration of hot Jupiters is not yet fully understood, measurements of the projected spin-orbit angle {\lambda} help shed light on the processes involved. Here we present Doppler tomography of three known hot Jupiters to determine their {\lambda} orientation: HAT-P-49 b, HAT-P-57A b, and XO-3A b. Our analysis explores the impact of cross-correlation processing methods on the detectability and characterization of the planet's Doppler shadow using up to three independent routines for cross-correlation functions extraction; those being: Yabi, iSpec and IRAF. After accounting for differences among the results obtained with the various routines, we report: first, the HAT-P-49 system is a case of a hot Jupiter on a polar orbit with {\lambda}=-85.3{\pm}1.7°, second, HAT-P-57A indicates practically no deviation of the planet's projected orbit from the host's equatorial plane with {\lambda}=-0.4^{+1.4}_{-1.9}°, and third, the XO-3A system with the measured value of {\lambda}=38{+3}_{-4}° lies in between an aligned and a perpendicular orientation, which is a less populated region of the spin-orbit distribution. Our findings highlight both the diversity of spin-orbit angles among close-in giant planets and the potential discrepancies in their measurement that can arise from different approaches to constructing the cross-correlation functions.

- **Abstract**
 Previously we developed a local model for a spherically contracting/expanding gas cloud that can be used to study turbulence and small scale instabilities in such flows. In this work we generalise the super-comoving variables used in studies of cosmological structure formation to our local spherical flow model, which make it significantly easier to derive analytical solutions and analyse the interactions of more complex flows with the background. We show that a wide class of solutions to the local spherical flow model can be obtained via a mapping from the corresponding solutions in regular Cartesian flows. The rescaling of time in the transformation results in a modification of the linear instabilities that can occur in spherical flows, causing them to have a time dependent growth rate in the physical time coordinate, and can prevent slower instabilities from operating. Finally, we show that the small scale flows in isotropic contraction/expansion can be mapped directly to Cartesian, inviscid, incompressible hydrodynamics, meaning that one expects a form of rescaled Kolmogorov-turbulence at the small scale of isotropically contracting/expanding flows.

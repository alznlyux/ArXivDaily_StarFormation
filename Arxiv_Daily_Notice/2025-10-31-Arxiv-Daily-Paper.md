          New Pipeline for Efficient Analysis of Large Spectroscopic Samples of OB Stars

- **Abstract**
 We present a new spectroscopic pipeline designed to analyse large numbers of hot massive stars homogeneously. The pipeline has been developed to utilise large grids of FASTWIND non-LTE, line blanketed models in which spherical geometry is adopted, and uniquely incorporates model errors. The pipeline has been applied to three contemporary datasets involving Very Large Telescope spectroscopy of OB stars in the Magellanic Clouds, namely the VLT FLAMES Tarantula Survey (VFTS), XShooting-ULLYSES (XShootU) and Binaries at Low Metallicity (BLOeM). We find satisfactory agreement with previous detailed temperatures and surface gravities, although strong nebular contamination, binarity and disk emission from OBe stars are problematic for automatic pipelines, requiring visual inspection of fits. The tool has been incorporated into the pipeline for the VISTA/4MOST pipeline.

          Potential Thermal Profiles of The Third Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS

- **Abstract**
 We investigate the thermal evolution of 3I/ATLAS, the third macroscopic interstellar object discovered on 2025 July 1. By comparing modeled thermal profiles with observations of volatile activity, it is possible to constrain bulk physical properties of a cometary nucleus. 3I/ATLAS is actively producing a variety of cometary volatiles. In this paper, we calculate one-dimensional thermal profiles of the third interstellar object 3I/ATLAS throughout its trajectory in an attempt to gain insight into its bulk properties based on measurements of its volatiles. Assuming a variety of typical comet and asteroid bulk geophysical properties such as heat capacities, densities, and conductivities, we calculate the radial thermal profile as a function of depth throughout the hyperbolic trajectory. The methods and code to generate the thermal profile are flexible for any hyperbolic or bound orbit. The thermal profiles are benchmarked to the nominal sublimation temperatures of H$_2$O, CO$_2$ and CO, but are still applicable to any volatile. Comparison between the modeled surface temperatures and the observed onset of H$_2$O activity near 3 au indicates that surface temperatures exceeding $\sim$150 K can only be achieved if the albedo is below 0.2. We therefore set the upper limit on the albedo of 3I/ATLAS to be 0.2.

          Ram pressure shaping HVC droplets -- FAST HI observations of HVC AC-III and theoretical interpretation
 - **Authors:** Xunchuan Liu

- **Abstract**
 FAST HI observations reveal unprecedented internal structures of the high-velocity cloud AC-III, which is found to consist of several coherent subclumps (D1--D6) with nearly constant line widths of $\sim 20~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}$, while the global velocity spread ranges from $-220$ to $-180~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}$. These subclumps exhibit parabolic morphologies, consistent with ram-pressure--confined droplets, with their heads tending to point toward the Galactic plane. A steady-state model reproduces both the morphology and the observed exponential density profiles. The tip density reaches $\sim 2~\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$, implying an ambient medium density of $\sim 10^{-3}~\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$, in agreement with the Galactic warm ionized medium at a distance of $\sim 5$~kpc. Deviations from symmetric droplet shapes, along with internal patterns such as strip-like ridges, rings, and holes, indicate rich internal dynamics. In particular, the observations are consistent with fluid loops forming inside the droplets in response to interactions between neighboring subclumps. These loops can generate ring-like dynamic patterns and drive secondary turbulence, sustaining long-lived internal motions. An intermediate-velocity component ($-150$ to $-100~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}$) exhibits a shell-like morphology aligned with the head of AC-III, possibly shaped by pressure interactions mediated by the WIM. Overall, we suggest that HVC AC-III is entering the Galactic WIM layer and being sculpted by ram pressure into a droplet-like morphology, providing a valuable case for studying the structure formation, turbulence origin, and dynamic evolution of HVCs, as well as the physical properties of the ambient medium.

          Hot Jupiter Origin and Tidal Evolution Constrained by a Broken Age-Frequency Relation

- **Abstract**
 The discovery of hot Jupiters has challenged the classical planet formation theory. Although various formation mechanisms have been proposed, the dominant channel and relative contributions remain unclear. Furthermore, hot Jupiters offer a unique opportunity to test tidal theory and measure the fundamental tidal quality factor, which is yet to be well-constrained. In this work, based on a hot Jupiter sample around single Sun-like stars with kinematic properties, {we find that the declining trend of their frequency is broken with a ridge at about 2 Gyr, providing direct evidence that hot Jupiters are formed with multiple origins of different timescales. By fitting with the theoretical expectations, we provide a constraint of tidal factor for Sun-like stars, which aligns well with the detected number of hot Jupiters with orbital decay. Moreover, we simultaneously constrain the relative importance of different channels: although the majority of hot Jupiters are formed early, within several tenths of Gyr via 'Early' models (e.g., in-situ formation, disk migration, planet-planet scattering and Kozai-Lidov interaction), a significant portion (about 40%) should be formed late on a relatively long timescale extending up to several Gyr mainly via the secular chaos mechanism, further supported by the obliquity distribution of 'late-arrived' hot Jupiters. Our findings provide a unified framework that reconciles hot Jupiter demographics and long-term evolution with multichannel formation.

          A new particle-based code for Lagrangian stochastic models applied to stellar turbulent convection

- **Abstract**
 The inclusion of convection in stellar evolution models lacks realism, especially near convective-radiative interfaces. Furthermore, the interaction of convection with oscillations prevent us from accurately predicting seismic frequencies, and therefore from fully exploiting the asteroseismic data of low-mass stars. We aim to develop a new formalism to model the one-point statistics of stellar convection, to implement it in a new numerical code, and to validate this implementation against benchmark cases. This new formalism is based on Lagrangian Probability Density Function (PDF) methods, where a Fokker-Planck equation for the PDF of particle-based turbulent properties is integrated in time. We then develop a Monte-Carlo implementation of this method, where the flow is represented by a large number of notional particles acting as realisations of the PDF. Notional particles interact with each other through the time- and space-dependent mean flow, which is estimated from the particle realisations through a scheme similar to Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics. We establish a model for the evolution of turbulent properties along Lagrangian trajectories applicable to stellar turbulent convection, with only a minimal number of physical assumptions necessary to close the system. In particular, no closure is needed for the non-linear advection terms, which are included exactly through the Lagrangian nature of formalism. The numerical implementation of this new formalism allows us to extract time-dependent maps of the statistical properties of turbulent convection in a way which is not possible in grid-based large-eddy simulations, in particular the turbulent pressure, Reynolds stress tensor, internal energy variance and convective flux.

- **Abstract**
 In this study, we applied Al-Wardat's method to analyze the subgiant system HIP72217 for which we obtained accurate parameters including stellar masses, effective temperatures ($T_{\text{eff}}$) and system this http URL the primary component we determined a stellar mass of $M_A = 1.14 \pm 0.15\,M_{\odot}$ and effective temperature $T_{\text{eff,A}} = 6125 \pm 50$\,K while for the secondary component we obtained the values of $M_B = 1.12 \pm 0.14\,M_{\odot}$ and $T_{\text{eff,2}} = 5950 \pm 50$\,K. The system's age was estimated to be $3.548 Gyr$, which is consistent with the predicted evolutionary period of a subgiant binary. The evolutionary timeline of HIP\,72217 becomes clearer through our study, which also demonstrates Al-Wardat's approach as an effective approach for binary star system characterization. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the physical mechanisms that control subgiant binary evolution and their broader role in stellar evolutionary processes.

- **Abstract**
 During massive star formation, dense gas undergoes chemical evolution, producing both simple and complex organic molecules (COMs) characteristic of hot molecular cores. How this evolution depends on protostellar physical properties remains unclear. We investigate the chemical content of 22 well-studied massive protostars from the SOFIA Massive (SOMA) Star Formation survey, aiming to identify correlations between chemical and physical parameters. We analyzed Atacama Compact Array and Total Power 1.3 mm (Band 6) data, deriving column densities, line widths, and excitation temperatures of multiple molecular species by modeling detected lines under local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) using MADCUBA. Spectra show 35 species, from simple molecules (e.g., CO, SO, SiO) to complex organic molecules (COMs), with seven sources exhibiting high chemical complexity (> 100 transitions). Average excitation temperatures vary across the sample: $T_\text{ex}>100~\text{K}$ for eight sources, $50-100~\text{K}$ for four, and $T_\text{ex} < 50~\text{K}$ for the remainder. Sources with $T_\text{ex} < 50~\text{K}$ trace lukewarm, chemically simple gas, while those with $T_\text{ex}>100~\text{K}$ indicate the presence of typical hot cores where thermal desorption is efficient, resulting in line-rich spectra. Comparing these chemical properties with the bolometric luminosity to envelope mass ratio ($L_\text{bol}/M_\text{env}$), an evolutionary tracer, we find tentative correlations with line widths, excitation temperature, and column densities. These data provide important constraints for chemodynamical models of massive protostellar cores.

- **Abstract**
 Spectral observations of 3I/ATLAS (C/2025 N1) with JWST/NIRSpec and SPHEREx reveal an extreme CO2 enrichment (CO2/H2O = 7.6+-0.3) that is 4.5 sigma above solar system comet trends and among the highest ever recorded. This unprecedented composition, combined with substantial absolute CO levels (CO/H2O = 1.65+-0.09) and red spectral slopes, provides direct evidence for galactic cosmic ray (GCR) processing of the outer layers of the interstellar comet nucleus. Laboratory experiments demonstrate that GCR irradiation efficiently converts CO to CO2 while synthesizing organic-rich crusts, suggesting that the outer layers of 3I/ATLAS consist of irradiated material which properties are consistent with the observed composition of 3I/ATLAS coma and with its observed spectral reddening. Estimates of the erosion rate of 3I/ATLAS indicate that current outgassing samples the GCR-processed zone only (depth ~15-20 m), never reaching pristine interior material. Outgassing of pristine material after perihelion remains possible, though it is considered unlikely. This represents a paradigm shift: long-residence interstellar objects primarily reveal GCR-processed material rather than pristine material representative of their primordial formation environments. With 3I/ATLAS approaching perihelion in October 2025, immediate follow-up observations are critical to confirm this interpretation and establish GCR processing as a fundamental evolutionary pathway for interstellar objects.

- **Abstract**
 As astronomy advances and data becomes more complex, models and inference also become more expensive and complex. In this paper we present {\sc ampere}, which aims to solve this problem using modern inference techniques such as flexible likelihood functions and likelihood-free inference. {\sc ampere}\ can be used to do Bayesian inference even with very expensive models (hours of CPU time per model) that do not include all the features of the observations (e.g. missing lines, incomplete descriptions of PSFs, etc). We demonstrate the power of \ampere\ using a number of simple models, including inferring the posterior mineralogy of circumstellar dust using a Monte Carlo Radiative Transfer model. {\sc ampere}\ reproduces the input parameters well in all cases, and shows that some past studies have tended to underestimate the uncertainties that should be attached to the parameters. {\sc ampere}\ can be applied to a wide range of problems, and is particularly well-suited to using expensive models to interpret data.

- **Abstract**
 A major challenge in modeling classical Cepheids is the treatment of convection, particularly its complex interplay with pulsation. This inherently three-dimensional process is typically approximated in one-dimensional hydrocodes using dimensionless turbulent convection (TC) free parameters. Calibrating these parameters is essential for reproducing key observational features such as light-curve amplitudes, secondary bumps, and the red edge of the instability strip. In this work, we calibrate TC parameters adopted in the publicly available MESA-RSP code through comparison with both observational data of classical Cepheids and stellar parameter constraints from the Stellingwerf code. We compute multi-band (V, I, and Ks) MESA-RSP light curves for 18 observed Large Magellanic Cloud Cepheids, using stellar parameters determined from the Stellingwerf code. By fine-tuning the mixing-length and eddy viscosity parameters, we calibrate the TC treatment in MESA-RSP. We then compare the resulting period-luminosity (PL), period-radius (PR), and period-mass-radius (PMR) relations with predictions from the Stellingwerf models. We successfully reproduce multi-band light curves and obtain PL, PR, and PMR relations consistent with Ragosta et al. (2019). While in broad agreement with previous work, we explicitly identify distinct mass-luminosity (ML) relations for fundamental-mode and first-overtone Cepheids for the first time. This suggests that the macroscopic processes affecting the ML relation depend on stellar mass and/or effective temperature range. Although our study focuses on the calibration of TC parameters, we do not find a single set of parameter values that reproduces all light curves. No statistically significant correlation is found between stellar properties and convection parameters, although subtle trends with period and effective temperature may be present.

- **Abstract**
 Neon (Ne) is the fifth most abundant element in the Universe. Because it is chemically inert, it has never been considered in astrochemical models that studied molecular evolution. In the cold dark environments of pre-stellar cores, where the temperatures are below 10 K, Ne can condense onto the surface of interstellar grains. We investigated the effect of Ne on the production of formaldehyde (H$_2$CO) and methanol (CH$_3$OH) through carbon monoxide (CO) hydrogenation on different cold surfaces. We highlight its role in conditions corresponding to pre-stellar cores. In an ultra-high vacuum system, we conducted two types of experiments. The first experiment involved the co-deposition of CO and H atoms with or without Ne. The second experiment involved depositing a monolayer of CO and separately a monolayer of Ne (or vice versa), followed by bombarding the layers with hydrogen atoms. Additionally, we used a gas-grain chemical code to simulate a pre-stellar core and determine where Ne can affect the chemistry. The presence of Ne on the surface significantly inhibits CO hydrogenation at temperatures below 12 K. In the co-deposition experiments, we observed a 38% decrease in the H$_2$CO production at 11 K when the quantity of Ne in the mixture was lower than a monolayer. At 10 K and with one monolayer in the mixture, the production decreased to 77%, and it reached 91% for a few monolayers of Ne in the mixture at 9 K. While the decrease in CH$_3$OH formation is still notable, it is less pronounced: 43% at 11 K, 61% at 10 K, and 77% at 9 K. Experiments with stacked layers revealed that the CO layer decay varies slightly when the Ne layer is positioned above or below it. This observation indicates that Ne and CO create a mixture in which Ne can diffuse and stabilize at the surface, which isolates CO molecules from the accreting H atoms.

          The dance of dust: Investigating young stellar object dipper variability

- **Abstract**
 The dipper subclass of YSOs are characterised by frequent dips in their light curves. Irregular dippers do not show periodic signatures and have dips accounting for significant proportions of their photospheric flux. Given the short timescales on which these dips occur, their driving mechanisms are linked to the inner circumstellar disc dynamics. We present the first multi-epoch analysis of 16 irregular dippers observed with X-Shooter. Investigating the properties of their dips, and in particular the analysis of the dust characteristics, we aim to understand the root of their variability, and get a glimpse of the inner disc behaviour. We employed a novel approach to measure the properties of the dips, by combining class III templates with Gaia photometry to construct the intrinsic photospheres. We measured several dip properties including the depth of the dips, near-infrared (NIR) excesses, and their optical depths as a function of wavelength. We record 20 significant dips that range in their dip properties and show no relation to one another. In almost all cases, the low optical depths and small NIR excesses are observed. Comparison of their optical depths with grain opacity models show that the dips can be explained by the presence of dust substructures containing processed grains obscuring their photospheres and/or their discs. These grain distributions can have maximum sizes as large as 20$\mu m$ and in many cases have almost grey-like extinction, while some require a strong scattering component. The findings highlight the extent of the irregularity of dippers, but also link it to the dust dynamics in the inner regions of circumstellar discs. The dust substructures causing the variability require processed dust grains to be lifted above the disc into the line of sight. Possible lifting mechanisms including disc winds, unstable accretion columns, and disc warps are discussed.

- **Abstract**
 For a sample of masers, the basic kinematic equations were solved by including the Galactic rotation parameters and the peculiar velocity of the Sun as the unknown variables. Based on spectral analysis, the following estimates were obtained: $|f|_{R,\theta}=(7.0,5.1)\pm(1.2,1.4)$ km s$^{-1}$ and the corresponding wavelengths $\lambda_{R,\theta}=(1.9,1.7)\pm(0.4,0.7)$ kpc, as well as $\chi_\odot=-140^\circ\pm15^\circ$. The presence of periodic perturbations in the vertical velocities of masers with an amplitude of $|f|_W=3.1\pm1.4$ km s$^{-1}$ and a wavelength of $\lambda=1.9\pm0.8$ kpc was confirmed. It is shown that the velocities $f_R$ and $f_\theta$ can have both the same and different signs. Therefore, we obtained a large scatter of estimates. Thus, if $f_R$ and $f_\theta$ have the same signs, then $\Omega_p=25.8\pm2.0$ km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$ and $R_{cor}=9.1\pm0.8$ kpc. And when $f_R$ and $f_\theta$ have different signs, then $\Omega_p=35.4\pm2.0$ km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$ and $R_{cor}=6.8\pm0.8$ kpc.

- **Abstract**
 We present AT2022kak, a rapidly evolving optical transient discovered by the KiloNova and Transients Program (KNTraP). This interesting burst exhibited extremely fast evolution, with a large amplitude blue outburst of m > 3.3 in a single night, and a rapid fade back to quiescence in the following two nights. We deployed a multi-wavelength follow-up campaign, monitoring the object for the next two months, but saw no recurrent burst. Three years later, while observing to get spectroscopy of the object in quiescence, there was a new outburst, enabling the collection of time-resolved spectra of the rise and fade of the outburst. The light curve properties of the first burst and spectra of the second burst are consistent with a dwarf nova. Its fast evolving behaviour makes it one of the fastest and faintest dwarf novae observed. The estimated distance of AT2022kak from the Galactic centre is ~6.6 kpc, with a scale height of ~2 kpc. This scale height places it in the Galactic thick disk, where only very few dwarf novae have been found, and is therefore a potential Population II dwarf novae system.

 - **Abstract**
 The measurement of the temporal evolution in the redshift of distant objects, the redshift drift, is a probe of universal expansion and cosmology. We perform the first steps towards a measurement of such effect using the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest in the spectra of bright quasars as a tracer of cosmological expansion. Our goal is to determine to which precision a velocity shift measurement can be carried out with the signal-to-noise (S/N) level currently available and whether this precision aligns with previous theoretical expectations. A precise assessment of the achievable measurement precision is fundamental for estimating the time required to carry out the whole project. We acquire 12 hours of ESPRESSO observations distributed over 0.875 years of the brightest quasar known, J052915.80-435152.0 (z=3.962), to obtain high-resolution spectra of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest, with median S/N of ~86 per 1 km/s pixel at the continuum. We divide the observations into two epochs and analyse them using both a pixel-by-pixel method and a model-based approach. This comparison allows us to estimate the velocity shift between the epochs, as well as the velocity precision that can be achieved at this S/N. The model-based method is calibrated using high-resolution simulations of the intergalactic medium, and it provides greater accuracy compared to the pixel-by-pixel approach. We measure a velocity drift of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest consistent with zero: $\Delta v = -1.25\pm 4.45 {\rm ms^{-1}}$, equivalent to a cosmological drift of $\dot{v}=-1.43\pm 5.09 {\rm ms^{-1}yr^{-1}}$ or $\dot{z}= (-2.19\pm7.77) \times 10^{-8}{\rm yr^{-1}}$. The measurement uncertainties are on par with the expected precision. We estimate that reaching a 99% detection of the cosmic drift requires a monitoring campaign of 5400 hours of integration time over 54 years with an ELT and an ANDES-like high-resolution spectrograph.

 - **Abstract**
 The young $\beta$ Pictoris system has been monitored with high-resolution optical spectrographs for decades. These observations have revealed strongly variable absorption in the Ca II H\&K lines attributed to in-falling cometary bodies. Since 2003, over 9000 HARPS observations of $\beta$ Pictoris have been taken and many of these have not yet been used for exocomet studies. We search these spectra for new exocomet phenomenology enabled by the long time coverage and large volume of this dataset. We systematically carry out telluric correction of the HARPS spectra using molecfit, compare multi-year observations of the Ca II and Na I lines and use a Bayesian fitting algorithm to extract exocomet line parameters. We explore the usage of an unbiased reference spectrum with which to calibrate the continuum, and investigate Keplerian orbital solutions to observed exocomet acceleration. We find a general absence of exocometary sodium line absorption, with only two instances of clear ($\sim 2$ % deep) exocometary sodium out of 198 nights of observation, as well as a weaker ($\sim 1$ %) feature that persists over 13 nights in 2004. We find that these events occur during times of deep Ca II absorption at the same red-shift, implying that strongly Ca II-evaporating exocomets also exhibit detectable levels of Na I, in spite of the vast majority of Na I being rapidly photo-ionised in close proximity to the star. We find long-lived Ca II absorption in 2017 and 2018 that persists on a timescale of a year, which may be difficult to explain with the classical exocomet model. Finally, we investigate two strongly accelerating, blue-shifted exocomes observed in 2019 that show strong and sudden departures from Keplerian motion, suggesting rapid changes to the dynamics of the exocomet cloud. We hypothesize that this is caused by the destruction of the comet nuclei shortly after their periastron passages.

 - **Abstract**
 Geminga is the third gamma-ray pulsar firmly detected by imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs) after the Crab and the Vela pulsars. Most of its emission is expected at tens of GeV, and, out of the planned telescopes of the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), the Large-Sized Telescopes (LSTs) are the only ones with optimised sensitivity at these energies. We aim to characterise the gamma-ray pulse shape and spectrum of Geminga as observed by the first LST (hereafter LST-1) of the CTAO-North. Furthermore, this study confirms the great performance and the improved energy threshold of the telescope, as low as 10 GeV for pulsar analysis, with respect to current-generation Cherenkov telescopes. We analysed 60 hours of good-quality data taken by the LST-1 at zenith angles below 50$^\circ$. Additionally, a new Fermi-LAT analysis of 16.6 years of data was carried out to extend the spectral analysis down to 100 MeV. Lastly, a detailed study of the systematic effects was performed. We report the detection of Geminga in the energy range between 20 and 65 GeV. Of the two peaks of the phaseogram, the second one, P2, is detected with a significance of 12.2$\sigma$, while the first (P1) reaches a significance level of 2.6$\sigma$. The best-fit model for the spectrum of P2 was found to be a power law with $\Gamma = (4.5 \pm 0.4_{stat})^{+0.2_{sys}}_{-0.6_{sys}}$, compatible with the previous results obtained by the MAGIC. No evidence of curvature is found in the LST-1 energy range. The joint fit with Fermi data confirms a preference for a sub-exponential cut-off over a pure exponential, even though both models fail to reproduce the data above several tens of GeV. The overall results presented in this paper prove that the LST-1 is an excellent telescope for the observation of pulsars, and improved sensitivity is expected to be achieved with the full CTAO-North.

          Prospect of Constraining the EoS of Neutron Stars Using Post-Merger Signals

 - **Abstract**
 Post-merger gravitational-wave emission from a binary neutron star merger carries crucial information about the equation of state (EoS) of matter at high temperatures. Current gravitational wave detectors have limited sensitivities at post-merger frequencies in the range [1.5, 4] kHz. Therefore, valuable inferences can only be made after combining information from multiple (BNS) events. Criswell et al. [Phys. Rev. D 107, 043021 (2023)] carries out an injection study to infer the radius posterior for a $1.6 M_{\odot}$ NS by combining the information from injected BNS events via the hierarchical Bayesian inference (HBI) formulation. This formulation utilizes empirical relations that connect the peak frequency of the post-merger remnant with the chirp mass of the system, and the EoS proxy parameter $R_{1.6}$. In this work, we extend the HBI formulation to other EoS proxy parameters (i.e., the radius of (NS), $R_{1.X}$, with masses 1.2, 1.4, and 1.8 $M_{\odot}$) and combine the four $R_{1.X}$ posteriors through the piecewise polytropic EoS model to obtain measurable constraints on the EoS of the NS. We show that the NS radii can be constrained to within $\sim$1 km ( $\sim$0.55 km) assuming uniform (astrophysical) prior on $R_{1.X}$ for injections in the A+ noise. We also study systematic biases in the analysis coming from the limitations of empirical relations.

          The Initial Mass Function of Stars and Brown Dwarfs in the Upper Sco Association

 - **Abstract**
 I present infrared spectroscopy of 37 brown dwarf candidates in the Upper Sco association, 35 of which are classified as young and cool, making them likely members. This sample includes many of the faintest spectroscopically confirmed members ($K=16$-17 mag), which should have masses down to $\sim0.007$-0.01 $M_\odot$ for the range of ages in Upper Sco (7-14 Myr). Using my updated membership catalog for Upper Sco, I have estimated the initial mass function (IMF) for a field in the center of the association that encompasses $\sim80$\% of the known members. I have derived IMFs in the same manner for previous membership samples in three other star-forming populations, consisting of IC 348, Taurus, and Chameleon I. When using logarithmic mass bins, the substellar IMFs for Upper Sco and the other young regions are roughly flat down to the completeness limits of $\sim$0.01 $M_\odot$. These IMFs are broadly similar to mass functions recently measured for the solar neighborhood. Finally, I have used W1$-$W2 colors to search for excess emission from circumstellar disks among the late-type objects in my new census of Upper Sco. I measure an excess fraction of 52/200 for members with spectral types of M6.25-M9.5, which is similar to results from previous membership catalogs. For the L-type members, it is difficult to detect the small W2 excess emission produced by typical disks around brown dwarfs because of the large uncertainties in spectral types, which preclude accurate estimates of the photospheric colors. Thus, W2 photometry provides poor constraints on the presence of disks for the L-type members of Upper Sco.

 - **Abstract**
 Throughout its mission, the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) has often rolled about its along-track axis by up to 28° to partially compensate for the suboptimal location of the Shallow Radar (SHARAD) antenna along an edge of the spacecraft that is opposite the imaging payload deck, thereby enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of echoes returned from the surface. After recent modeling work predicted that a much larger roll would improve the S/N by ~10 dB relative to nadir-pointed observing, MRO began a limited series of 120° roll maneuvers to test the effects on radar sounding. Three such SHARAD very-large-roll (VLR) observations have been acquired since May 2023, and they show dramatic improvements in signal clarity and depth of penetration, with S/N increasing by 9, 11, and 14 dB over that of nearly coincident observations at 0° roll angle. In low dielectric terrains, the first and second VLR observations enabled basal detections at depths previously unachievable, reaching depths of 800 m in Medusae Fossae materials and 1500 m through the ice of Ultimi Scopuli, respectively. The second VLR observation also obtained enhanced reflections throughout the ice stack. In the higher dielectric terrain of Amazonis Planitia, the third VLR observation improved continuity of a dipping subsurface interface, but it revealed neither an extension of the interface to greater depths nor any deeper interfaces. The MRO mission intends to obtain more SHARAD VLR observations of polar terrains and of midlatitude glacial and ground ices, sediments, and volcanics.

          Libration of Pluto's argument of perihelion and the role of the major planets

 - **Abstract**
 Pluto's argument of perihelion is known to librate around $90^\circ$. This libration is related to the secular phenomenon known as the von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai (vZLK) oscillation. In this work, we make a quantitative assessment of the influence of Neptune's mean motion resonance and of the other giant planets' secular perturbations on the libration of Pluto's argument of perihelion. Here, a parameter $k^2 = (1-e^2) \cos^2 I$ is the key where $e$ is eccentricity and $I$ is inclination. When $k^2$ of a Pluto-like object is larger than a certain critical value, libration of its argument of perihelion would not occur. The secular effect of other disturbing planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus) plays a significant role in determining the critical $k^2$. The non-zero oscillation amplitude of the critical resonant argument also plays a role, although not a dominant one.

          Polytropic Wind-Driven Bubbles and their Shock Structures in Radially Stratified Ambient Media

 - **Abstract**
 We extend the analytic expressions for polytropic wind-driven bubbles and their shock structures, formulated initially in Koo and McKee 1992(a,b), focusing on spherically symmetric configurations in astrophysical environments with $\rho\propto r^{-2}$, which arises naturally in the star-forming environment and has applications to winds flowing into a preexisting bubble. Wind luminosity is assumed to be constant, and as a result the shock velocities of these bubbles are constant in time. The ratio of specific heats is assumed to be the same in the shocked ambient medium and the shocked wind. Numerical results are presented for one selected ratio of wind density to ambient density. Exact ODEs are written for the compressed wind region and approximate solutions are found by fitting the ODE solutions. By analyzing the interactions between stellar winds and ambient media in the strong compression limit, we model the formation and evolution of spherical bubbles, highlighting their shock fronts and contact discontinuities. Our analytic method provides an intuitive approach to calculating the thickness of bubble shells, which is crucial for understanding their dynamics and observational characteristics. A numerical method explores conditions without explicitly requiring the strong compression limit, and then we compare numerical to analytical results under various conditions.

          Determination of Light Curve Parameters of Poorly Studied Eclipsing Variables Using Data from Tess and Other Sky Surveys

 - **Abstract**
 A group of poorly studied eclipsing variables (the classification of which is marked as uncertain and/or the period of brightness changes is uncertain) has been studied with the using of the photometric observations of the TESS mission and NSVS, ASAS-SN sky surveys. We also obtained some observations covering the brightness minima of our variables by our group using the telescopes at Astronomical Observatory on Kolonica Saddle (Slovakia) and Observatory and Planetarium in Hlohovec (Slovakia) during the "Variable-2024" astrocamp. The periods and classification were corrected. For NSV 575 and NSV 014 the periods were found for the first time, but it is doubtful that NSV 014 is an eclipsing variable, because there are no eclipses but the asymmetric wave is present, which indicates that the variable star can be re-classified as a low-amplitude pulsating one. Different methods were used for approximation of the light curves and further calculation of stellar system's parameters such as eclipse depths and durations, values of reflection effect and effect of ellipticity of stars. The initial period was estimated using the periodogram based on the trigonometrical polynomial fit of high order (up to 10). For better approximation of the complete eclipsing phase curve, the "New Algol Variable" (NAV) software was used. The methods of "asymptotic parabolas" and "wall-supported asymptotic parabolas" were used for calculation of moments of eclipses, which use only near-eclipse part of the observations instead of a complete curve. These methods were implemented in the software MAVKA among a larger set of features. For the variables NSV 489 and NSV 1884, our moments of eclipses and the ones found in the literature, were used for the O-C curves. For NSV 489, the period was adjusted taking into account the slope of the O-C diagram.

          Hot donors in cataclysmic variables: The case of EI Psc

 - **Abstract**
 Context: We present results of time-resolved optical spectroscopy and photometry of the short-orbital period dwarf nova EI Psc. Aims: This study aims to determine fundamental system parameters of EI Psc, study properties of accretion structures in the system, and investigate its origin and current evolution state. Methods: We analyse newly obtained time-resolved spectroscopic and photometric observations as well as archival data. We used light curve modelling, Doppler tomography, and MESA evolutionary models to study the characteristics of EI Psc. Results: The system contains a relatively low temperature ($T_{\rm eff} = 6130\,\mathrm{K}$) white dwarf with mass of $M_{\mathrm WD} = 0.70(4)\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. The mass of the warm ($T_2 = 4440\,\mathrm{K}$) secondary is $M_2 = 0.13\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. The inclination of the system is $i= 44.5°(7)$. The mass accretion rate is $\approx$ $4\times10^{-13}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot\,\mathrm{year}^{-1}$. The long-term light curve of the system shows outbursts and superoutbursts. The quiescence light curve is double-humped and is formed by the combination of radiation from the Roche lobe filling the hot secondary and the hot spot. The radius of the outer disc is about two times smaller than the tidal truncation radius. Most of the disc's emission consists of emission lines and radiation from the hot spot at the stream-disc impact region. Conclusions: These types of systems are formed from progenitors with a low mass WD $\mathrm{M}_{\mathrm{WD}} \lesssim 0.6\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$ and relatively massive secondaries $1.1-1.5\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$ with initial orbital periods on a scale of days. The number of similar systems is expected to be significantly lower than the usual CVs due to a lower forming rate of their relatively massive progenitors.

          Deuterated water abundance in the young hot core RCW 120 S2

 - **Abstract**
 Since the emission of water molecules cannot be observed from Earth, less abundant isotopologues, such as H$_2^{18}$O and HDO, are used to trace water in star-forming regions. The main aim of this study is to determine HDO abundance in the hot core RCW 120 S2. We performed observations of the hot core in the 200-255~GHz range using the nFLASH230 receiver on the APEX telescope. Two HDO lines were detected toward RCW 120 S2. Their intensities are described by excitation temperature $286\pm2$~K and gas number density $\geq 10^9$~cm$^{-3}$. The emission originates from the hot core rather than the warm dense envelope surrounding a central young stellar object. The HDO column density ranges from $(3.9-7.9)\times10^{13}$~cm$^{-3}$ with a most probable value $5.6\times10^{13}$~cm$^{-3}$. The HDO abundance relative to hydrogen nuclei is $1.5\times10^{-9}$. This HDO abundance value is among the lowest reported for hot cores. Combined with the non-detection of the H$_2^{18}$O line, we conclude that protostellar heating in RCW 120 S2 is still in its early stages.

          Exploring the Accretion disc/Corona Connection in NGC 6814: Insights from UV and X-ray spectral-timing studies

 - **Abstract**
 We conducted a comprehensive spectral and timing analysis of NGC 6814 using AstroSat's 2019 and XMM-Newton's 2021 observations. Cross-correlation analysis revealed a significant correlation between FUV (1541 Å)/X-ray and UVW1 (2910 Å)/X-ray variations, with delays of $\sim 15~\rm{ks}$ and $30~\rm{ks}$, respectively. We constructed four broadband SEDs after applying aperture correction (for the UVIT filter), subtracting host galaxy and emission line contributions from UV flux, and using mean X-ray spectra alongside selected UV data points. First, we fitted the SEDs with KYNSED model assuming various combinations of inclination, $\theta$, color correction factors, $f_{\rm col}$, and BH spins. Best-fit models were achieved for $\theta=70^{\circ}$ (consistent with past estimates for this source) and for spin $\leq 0.5$, while $f_{\rm col}$ is not constrained. KYNSED provided satisfactory fit to all SEDs in the case when the corona is powered by the accretion process, with $\sim 10-20$% of the accretion power transferred to the corona, $\dot{m}/\dot{m}_{\rm Edd}\sim 0.1$, corona radius of $\sim 6-10~r_g$, and height of $\sim7.5-35~r_g$. Model time-lags computed using the SED best-fit results are aligned well with the observed time-lags. Although some of the model parameters are not constrained, the important result of our work is that both the broadband X-ray/UV spectra and the X-ray/UV time-lags in NGC 6814 are consistent with the hypothesis of X-ray illumination of the disc in a lamp-post geometry framework. Within this model framework, we do not need to assume an outer or inner truncated disc.

 - **Abstract**
 Whether the presence of planets affects the lithium (Li) abundance of their host stars is still an open question. To investigate the difference of the Li abundance between planet-host stars (HS) and isolated stars (IS) with no detected planets, we analyze a large sample of stars with temperatures ranging from 4600 to 6600 K and metallicity ranging from -0.55 to +0.50. The sample consists of 279 HS whose spectra were taken from the California-Kepler Survey (CKS), which followed up planets detected by Kepler, and 171 IS whose spectra were taken from the Keck archive. The non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) effects were taken into consideration. It is found that the distribution of Li abundances in both the HS and IS groups are generally consistent with each other. This suggests that the presence of Kepler-like planets does not have a significant impact on Li depletion. We also found that the non-LTE corrections can not be neglected for stars with A(Li) over ~ 2.5 dex.

          Hidden Transits: TOI-2285 b is a Warmer sub-Neptune Likely with a Super-Earth Companion

 - **Abstract**
 TOI-2285 b is a sub-Neptune-sized planet orbiting a nearby M dwarf, discovered through the TESS photometric survey and ground-based follow-up observations. The planet was initially reported to have an orbital period of 27.27 d, making it one of the lowest temperature sub-Neptunes transiting a bright M dwarf. However, additional TESS data reveal that its true orbital period is 13.64 d, half the original value, resulting in a warmer equilibrium temperature (358 K) than previously estimated (284 K). The misidentification likely resulted from the low signal-to-noise ratio of individual transit signals and the limited number of transits observed by TESS at that time. This case highlights the importance of carefully considering harmonic solutions for similar cases. The additional TESS data also reveal another planetary candidate with an orbital period of 9.67 d and a radius of 1.5 $R_\oplus$, requiring validation in future studies.

 - **Abstract**
 In Limongi et al. (2024) we presented and discussed the main evolutionary properties and final fate of stars in the mass range 7-15 Msun. The evolutions of those models were computed by means of a medium size nuclear network that guaranteed a proper calculation of the nuclear energy generation and hence a good modeling of the physical evolution of these stars. In the present paper, we extend this study by computing the detailed chemical yields of stars in the mass range 9-15 Msun, i.e., those stars that explode as core collapse supernovae (CCSNe). The explosive nucleosynthesis is then computed in the framework of the thermal bomb induced explosion by means of the HYPERION code (Limongi and Chieffi 2020). We find that: (1) the yields of the intermediate mass elements (i.e., O to P) show a steep decrease as the inital mass decreases; (2) the yields of s-weak component, i.e., those produced by the slow neutron captures from Ga to to the first neutron closure shell, decrease almost linearly as a function of the initial mass with respect to the ones produced by the more massive stars; (3) the global contribution of the stars in the mass range 9.22-13 Msun to the yields of a generation of massive stars averaged over a standard initial mass function is negligible for essentially all the isotopes. In spite of this, however, the models of stars in this mass range can be fundamental to interpret the observations of specific supernovae.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic strings, topological defects predicted by high-energy theories, may contribute to the late-time expansion of the Universe, effectively mimicking dynamical dark energy. We investigate four phenomenological extensions of the $\Lambda$CDM model involving a residual string network: (i) a non-relativistic component with positive energy density (Model~1), (ii) a velocity-dependent extension (Model~2), (iii) a non-relativistic string network with energy density allowed to take both positive and negative values (Model~3), and (iv) a general scenario with free energy and velocity parameters (Model~4). These models are constrained using \textit{Planck} CMB data, SDSS or DESI baryon acoustic oscillations, and Type Ia supernovae observations. Models~1 and~2 yield strong upper bounds on the string density, for example, $\Omega_{\mathrm{s}} < 0.00901$ at 95\% CL from the CMB+DESI+DESY5 combination for Model~2, and mildly shift the inferred value of $H_0$ upward, though they are not favored by Bayesian evidence. For the same combination, the bulk velocity is bound as $v_{\mathrm{s}} < 0.569$. Models~3 and~4 exhibit a consistent preference for slightly negative values of $\Omega_{\mathrm{s}}$, with CMB-only data yielding $\Omega_{\mathrm{s}} = -0.038^{+0.029}_{-0.022}$ and $v_{\mathrm{s}}< 0.574$ in Model~4, and a best-fit improvement of $\Delta \chi^2 = -6.07$. However, these improvements are not sufficient to overcome the Occam penalty, and the Bayesian evidence continues to favor $\Lambda$CDM. These findings demonstrate the power of current data to constrain exotic energy components and encourage further exploration of string-inspired extensions to $\Lambda$CDM, particularly those involving negative-tension networks.

 - **Abstract**
 Sulfur is essential for life, but its abundance and distribution in the interstellar medium remain uncertain, with over 90% of sulfur undetected in cold molecular clouds. Sulfur allotropes (S$_{\rm n}$) have been proposed as possible reservoirs, but the only detected interstellar molecule with a disulfide bond is S$_2$H in the Horsehead Nebula, making the estimation of sulfur chains abundances difficult. Here we present total-power ALMA images of H$_2$S, S$_2$H, SO$_2$, CO$^+$, and SH$^+$ towards the Horsehead nebula. These observations, with unprecedented sensitivity (rms $\sim$ 1.5 mK), provide the first detections of SH$^+$ and CO$^+$ in this region, together with the identification of a new S$_2$H line. The comparison of the spectroscopic images of H$_2$S, S$_2$H, SO$_2$, CO$^+$ and SH$^+$ shows that the S$_2$H emission originates from a warm gas layer adjacent to the photodissociation front. The emission peak of S$_2$H is offset from those of reactive ions such as SH$^+$, CO$^+$, and SO$^+$, suggesting that gas-phase reactions involving SH$^+$ and H$_2$S are not the dominant formation pathway of S$_2$H. Instead, we propose that S$_2$H is desorbed from irradiated grain surfaces by non-thermal processes. The SH$^+$ detection indicates that sulfur is not significantly depleted at the UV-irradiated edge of the molecular cloud, arguing against a major refractory sulfur reservoir in the interior of molecular clouds.

 - **Abstract**
 We present two new radio continuum images obtained with Apertif at 1.4 GHz. The images, produced with a direction-dependent calibration pipeline, cover 136 square degrees of the Lockman Hole and 24 square degrees of the ELAIS-N fields, with an average resolution of 17x12" and residual noise of 33 uJy/beam. With the improved depth of the images we found in total 63692 radio sources, many of which are detected for the first time at this frequency. With the addition of the previously published Apertif catalog for the Bootes field, we cross-match with the LOFAR deep-fields value-added catalogs at 150 MHz, resulting in a homogeneous sample of 10196 common sources with spectral index estimates, one of the largest to date. We analyze and discuss the correlations between spectral index, redshift, linear sources size, and radio luminosity, taking into account biases of flux-density-limited surveys. Our results suggest that the observed correlation between spectral index and redshift of active galactic nuclei can be attributed to the Malmquist bias reflecting an intrinsic relation between radio luminosity and the spectral index. We also find a correlation between spectral index and linear source size with more compact sources having steeper spectra.

 - **Abstract**
 The circumstellar envelopes (CSEs) of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars harbour a rich variety of molecules and are sites of complex chemistry. Our current understanding of the circumstellar chemical processes of carbon-rich AGB stars is predominantly based on observations of a single star, IRC+10216, often regarded as an archetypical carbon star. We aim to estimate stellar and circumstellar properties for five carbon stars, and constrain their circumstellar CS abundances. This study compares the CS abundances among the sources, informs circumstellar chemical models, and helps to assess if IRC+10216 is a good representative of the physics and chemistry of carbon star CSEs. We modelled the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and CO line emission to derive the stellar and outflow properties. Using these, we then retrieved CS abundance profiles with detailed radiative transfer modelling, imposing spatial and excitation constraints from ALMA and single-dish observations. We obtain good fits to the SEDs and CO lines for all sources and reproduce the CS line emission across various transitions and apertures, yielding robust estimates of the CS abundance profiles. Peak CS fractional abundances range from 1$\times$10$^{-6}$ - 4$\times$10$^{-6}$, with e-folding radii of 1.8$\times$10$^{16}$ - 6.8$\times$10$^{16}$ cm. We also derive reliable $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C and $^{32}$S/$^{34}$S ratios from CS isotopologue modelling. Our results refine previous single-dish CS abundance estimates and improve the relative uncertainty on the CS e-folding radius for IRAS 07454$-$7112 by a factor of $\sim$2.5. Chemical models reproduce our estimates of the CS radial extent, corroborating the CS photodissociation framework used therein. We find no significant differences between the derived CS abundance profiles for IRC+10216 and the rest of the sample, apart from the expected density-driven variations.

 - **Abstract**
 Time-series photometry at mid-infrared wavelengths is becoming a common technique to search for atmospheres around rocky exoplanets. This method constrains the brightness temperature of the planet to determine whether heat redistribution is taking place - indicative of an atmosphere - or whether the heat is reradiated from a low albedo bare rock. By observing at 15$\mu$m we are also highly sensitive to CO$_2$ absorption. We observed three eclipses of the rocky super-Earth LHS 1140c using MIRI/Imaging with the F1500W filter. We found significant variation in the initial settling ramp for these observations and identify a potential trend between detector settling and the previous filter used by MIRI. We analysed our data using aperture photometry but also developed a novel approach which joint-fits pixel light curves directly using a shared eclipse model and a flexible multi-dimensional Gaussian process which models changes in the PSF over time. We demonstrate using simulated data that our method has the ability to weight away from particular pixels which show increased systematics, allowing for the recovery of eclipse depths in a more robust and precise way. Both methods and an independent analysis detect the eclipse at $>5\sigma$ and are highly consistent with a low albedo bare rock. We recover a dayside brightness temperature of $T_\mathrm{day} = 561\pm44$ K, close to the theoretical maximum of $T_\text{day; max} = 537\pm9$ K. We rule out a wide range of atmospheric forward models to $>3\sigma$ including pure CO$_2$ atmospheres with surface pressure $\ge10$ mbar and pure H$_2$O atmospheres with surface pressure $\ge1$ bar. Our strict constraints on potential atmospheric composition, in combination with future observations of the exciting outer planet LHS 1140b, could provide a powerful benchmark to understand atmospheric escape around M dwarfs.

 - **Abstract**
 About half of the mass of all heavy elements with mass number A > 90 is formed through the slow neutron capture process (s-process), occurring in evolved asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars with masses ~1-6 $\rm{M_{\odot}}$. The s-process can be studied by modeling the accretion of material from AGB stars onto binary barium (Ba), CH, and carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP)-s stars. Comparing observationally derived surface parameters and 1D-LTE abundance patterns of s-process elements to theoretical binary accretion models, we aim to understand the formation of post-accretion systems. We explore the extent of dilution of the accreted material and describe the impact of convective mixing on the observed surface abundances. We compute a new grid of 2700 accretion models for low-mass post-accretion systems. A maximum-likelihood comparison determines the best fit models for observational samples of Ba, CH, and CEMP-s stars. We find consistent AGB donor masses in the mass range of 2-3 $\rm{M_{\odot}}$ across our sample of post-accretion binaries. We find the formation scenario for weak Ba stars is an AGB star transferring a moderate amount of mass ($\leq$0.5 $\rm{M_{\odot}}$) resulting in a ~2.0-2.5 $\rm{M_{\odot}}$ star. The strong Ba stars are best fit with lower final masses ~1.0-2.0 $\rm{M_{\odot}}$, and significant accreted mass ($\geq$0.5 $\rm{M_{\odot}}$). The CH and CEMP-s stars display lower final masses (~1.0 $\rm{M_{\odot}}$) and small amounts of transferred material (~0.1 $\rm{M_{\odot}}$). We find that Ba stars generally accrete more material than CEMP-s and CH stars. We also find that strong Ba stars must accrete more than 0.50 $\rm{M_{\odot}}$ to explain their abundance patterns, and in this limit we are unable to reproduce the observed mass distribution of strong Ba stars. The mass distributions of the weak Ba stars, CEMP-s, and CH stars are well reproduced in our modeling.

 - **Abstract**
 Complete, accurate, and precise catalogues of exoplanet host star (EHS) properties are essential to deriving high-quality exoplanet parameters. This paper aims at homogeneously parameterising EHS and their exoplanets, using Gaia and GSP-spec data. For 2573 EHS, we computed their L*, R*, and M*, with no prior assumption from stellar evolution models. Their Galactic positions, kinematic and orbital properties were derived. We re-scaled Mp and Rp of 3556 exoplanets, fully consistently with the stellar data. These new stellar Teff, L*, and R* are in rather good agreement with literature values but are more precise. In particular, R* are derived with typically less than 3% uncertainty; this reduces the uncertainty on Rp significantly and allows for a finer analysis of the decrease in the number of planets around the evaporation valley. Larger differences, however, were found for M*. We note that the EHS population is rather diverse in terms of the chemical and Galactic properties, although they are all found in the Solar vicinity, close to the Local spiral arm. Most EHS belong to the thin disc, but some older thick disc and halo members have also been identified. For the less massive planets, the average Rp increases with the metallicity of the host star. For giant planets, a dichotomy between dense and inflated planets is found. Denser planets tend to be more massive as the metallicity of the host star increases, while inflated planets are more massive for less metallic hosts. If confirmed, this bimodality implies that the diversity of giant exoplanets depends on their Galactic birth locus, with dense giant planets being more numerous than inflated ones when [M/H]>~1.5 times Solar, as in the central Milky Way regions. The Gaia spectroscopic catalogue of exoplanets and their host stars is large, homogeneous, and precise. It would be a useful added-value for planetary studies.

 - **Abstract**
 We consider the 21\,cm brightness temperature as a probe of the Hubble tension in the framework of an inhomogeneous cosmological model. Employing Buchert's averaging formalism to study the effect of inhomogeneities on the background evolution, we consider scaling laws for the backreaction and curvature consistent with structure formation simulations. We calibrate the effective matter density using MCMC analysis using Union 2.1 Supernova Ia data. Our results show that a higher Hubble constant ($\sim73$\,km/s/Mpc) leads to a shallower absorption feature in the brightness temperature versus redshift curve. On the other hand, a lower value ($\sim67$\,km/s/Mpc) produces a remarkable dip in the brightness temperature $T_{21}$. Such a substantial difference is absent in the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Our findings indicate that inhomogeneities could significantly affect the 21\,cm signal, and may shed further light on the different measurements of the Hubble constant.

 - **Abstract**
 Relativistic reflection features in the X-ray spectra of accreting black holes are considered to be generated by the illumination of the accretion disk by the hot corona. In this work, we present a numerical method for the emission line profile and the reflection spectrum produced by an off-axis X-ray source. The X-ray source is considered as a point source, as in the lamppost scenario, except that it is located off-axis and moves at arbitrary velocity. The observed flux for the distant observer is calculated directly without priority evaluation of the emissivity on the accretion disk, which allows our model to be applicable to the point source that deviates from the axis of the black hole spins and moves with a velocity. To study the impact of the off-axis geometry on the measurement of source properties, we simulate observations for a black hole binary with NuSTAR and eXTP. We compare the simulation with the observation of the phase-resolved spectra of the low-frequency quasiperiodic oscillation observed by the Insight Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope. Due to the nonaxisymmetric illumination on the accretion disk, parameters of the model are not reproduced by the lamppost model, including the corona height, radial velocity, and the reflection fraction. On the other hand, all the model parameters are recovered through the off-axis model.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a compilation of observed recurrence times ($t_{\rm rec}$) and infer the corresponding local mass-accretion rates ($\dot m$) for type I X-ray bursts, milliHertz quasi-periodic oscillating sources and recurrent novae eruptions. We construct models of the $t_{\rm rec}-\dot m$ relation for accreting white dwarfs and neutron stars and find that both are roughly consistent with a global inverse linear relation, connecting for the first time thermonuclear runaways on neutron stars and white dwarfs. We find that theoretical models of pure He bursts are in agreement with the best $t_{\rm rec}$ measurements in ultra-compact X-ray binaries at low $\dot m$ (4U~$0614+09$ and 2S~0918-549). We suggest that the transient Z source XTE~J1701-462 is a slow rotator, based on its mHz QPO properties. Finally, we discuss the implications for thermonuclear ignition and point out that the difference in eruption/burst energy ($E_{b_{WD}}/E_{b_{NS}}=2\times 10^4$) is consistent with the difference in area between neutron stars and white dwarfs $\left((R_{WD}/R_{NS})^2=4\times 10^4\right)$. We conclude that ignitions of thermonuclear shell flashes on neutron stars and white dwarfs depend primarily on the specific mass accretion rate and do not depend on the nature of the underlying compact object.

 - **Abstract**
 The chemical composition of exoplanets is thought to be influenced by the composition of the disks in which they form. JWST observations have unveiled a variety of species in numerous nearby disks, showing significant variations in the C/O abundance ratio. However, little is known about the composition and C/O ratio of disks around young stars in clusters exposed to strong ultraviolet (UV) radiation from nearby massive stars, which are representative of the environments where most planetary systems form, including ours. We present JWST spectroscopy of d203-504, a young 0.7 $\rm M_{\odot}$ star in the Orion Nebula with a 30 au disk irradiated by nearby massive stars. These observations reveal spectroscopic signatures of CO, H$_2$O, CH$_3^+$, and PAHs. Water and CO are detected in absorption in the inner disk ($r\lesssim 1$ au), where the estimated gas-phase C/O ratio is 0.48, consistent with the Solar value and that of the Orion Nebula. In contrast, \ch{CH3+} and PAHs are found in the extended surface layers of the disk. These results suggest that gas in the inner disk is chemically shielded from UV radiation while the surface layers of the disk experience UV-induced chemistry, potentially depleting their carbon content.

 - **Abstract**
 Recently, the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) measurements from the DESI survey have suggested hints of dynamical dark energy, challenging the standard $\Lambda $CDM model. In this work, we adopt an improved inverse distance ladder approach based on the latest cosmological data to provide a model-independent perspective, employing a global parametrization based on cosmic age (PAge). Our analysis incorporates DESI DR2 BAO measurements, cosmic chronometer (CC) data, and type Ia supernovae (SNe) observations from either the DESY5 or PantheonPlus datasets. For the DESY5+DESI DR2+CC datasets, we obtain $H_0 = 67.91 \pm 2.33~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$. This value is consistent with the Planck 2018 result, while shows $2.0 \sigma$ tension with the SH0ES measurement. Furthermore, by mapping specific cosmological models into PAge approximation parameter space $(p_{\mathrm{age}}, \eta)$, our model-independent analysis reveals a notable deviation from the $\Lambda \mathrm{CDM}$ model, as indicated by the DESY5 and DESI DR2 datasets. Finally, DESY5+DESI DR2+CC datasets provide nearly decisive evidence favoring the PAge model over the standard $\Lambda \mathrm{CDM}$ model. These findings highlight the need for further investigation into the expansion history to better understand the deviations from the $\Lambda \mathrm{CDM}$ model.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we investigate the gravitational wave (GW) emission from stars tidally disrupted by black holes (TDEs), using a semi-analytical approach. Contrary to previous works where this signal is modeled as a monochromatic burst, we here take into account all its harmonic components. On top of this, we also extend the analysis to a population of repeated-partial TDEs, where the star undergoes multiple passages around the black hole before complete disruption. For both populations, we estimate the rate of individual GW-detections considering future observatories like LISA and a potential deci-Hertz (dHz) mission, and derive the GW background from these sources. Our conclusions, even if more conservative, are consistent with previous results presented in literature. In fact, full disruptions of stars will not be seen by LISA but will be important targets for dHz observatories. In contrast, GWs from repeated disruptions will not be detectable in the near future.

 - **Abstract**
 The formation of primordial black holes or other dark matter relics from amplified density fluctuations in the early universe may also generate scalar-induced gravitational waves (GW), carrying vital information about the primordial power spectrum and the early expansion history of our universe. We present a Bayesian approach aimed at reconstructing both the shape of the scalar power spectrum and the universe's equation of state from GW observations, using interpolating splines to flexibly capture features in the GW data. The optimal number of spline nodes is chosen via Bayesian evidence, aiming at balancing complexity of the model and the fidelity of the reconstruction. We test our method using both representative mock data and recent Pulsar Timing Array measurements, demonstrating that it can accurately reconstruct the curvature power spectrum as well as the underlying equation of state, if different from radiation.

 - **Abstract**
 The recent discovery of a large number of massive black holes within the first two billion years after the Big Bang, as well as their peculiar properties, have been largely unexpected based on the extrapolation of the properties of luminous quasars. These findings have prompted the development of several theoretical models for the early formation and growth of black holes, which are, however, difficult to differentiate. We report the metallicity measurement around a gravitationally lensed massive black hole at redshift 7.04, hosted in a galaxy with very low dynamical mass. The weakness of the [OIII]5007 emission line relative to the narrow Hbeta emission indicates an extremely low chemical enrichment, less than 0.01 solar. We argue that such properties cannot be uncommon among accreting black holes around this early cosmic epoch. Explaining such a low chemical enrichment in a system that has developed a massive black hole is challenging for most theories. Models assuming heavy black hole seeds (such as Direct Collapse Black Holes) or super-Eddington accretion scenarios struggle to explain the observations, although they can potentially reproduce the observed properties in rare cases. Models invoking "primordial black holes" (i.e. putative black holes formed shortly after the Big Bang) may potentially explain the low chemical enrichment associated with this black hole.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the ExoPhoto database (this https URL), an extension of the ExoMol database, specifically developed to address the growing need for high-accuracy, temperature-dependent photodissociation cross section data towards short-UV wavelengths. ExoPhoto combines theoretical models from three major computational databases (ExoMol, UGAMOP and PhoMol) and experimental datasets from two experimental groups, providing extensive wavelength and temperature coverage. ExoPhoto currently includes photodissociation data for 20 molecules: AlH, HCl, HF, MgH, OH, NaO, MgO, O2, AlCl, AlF, CS, HeH+, CO, CO2, H2O, SO2, C2H2, C2H4, H2CO, and NH3, derived from theoretical models and supported by experimental data from 5 databases. ExoPhoto also includes detailed data on branching ratios and quantum yields for selected datasets. The data structure of ExoPhoto follows the ExoMol framework, with a consistent naming convention and hierarchical JSON-based organization. Photodissociation cross sections are stored in a set of .photo files which provide data as a function of wavelength with one file for each target molecule temperature. Future developments aim to include more photodissociation cross section data and to provide data for molecules in non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE). These will expand the utility of ExoPhoto for advanced astrophysical, planetary modeling and industrial applications.

 - **Abstract**
 In contrast to the large-scale primordial power spectrum $\mathcal{P}_{\zeta}(k)$ and primordial non-Gaussianity $f_{\mathrm{NL}}$, which are strictly constrained, the small-scale $\mathcal{P}_{\zeta}(k)$ and $f_{\mathrm{NL}}$ remain less restricted. Considering local-type primordial non-Gaussianity, we study the PBH and SIGW caused by large-amplitude small-scale primordial power spectrum. By analyzing current observational data from PTA, CMB, BAO, and abundance of PBH, and combining them with the SNR analysis of LISA, we rigorously constrain the parameter space of $\mathcal{P}_{\zeta}(k)$ and $f_{\mathrm{NL}}$. Furthermore, we examine the effects of different shapes of the primordial power spectrum on these constraints and comprehensively calculate the Bayes factors for various models. Our results indicate that SIGW generated by a monochromatic primordial power spectrum are more likely to dominate current PTA observations, with the corresponding constraint on the primordial non-Gaussian parameter being $-10.0<f_{\mathrm{NL}}<1.2$.

 - **Abstract**
 Highly-differential spectroscopic studies have revealed that the Sun is deficient in refractory elements relative to solar twins. To investigate the role of giant planets on this signature, we present a high precision abundance analysis of HARPS spectra for 50 F- and G-type stars spanning -0.4<[Fe/H]<+0.5. There are 29 stars in the sample which host planets of masses > 0.01 MJup. We derive abundances for 19 elements, and apply corrections to 14 of them for systematic errors associated with one dimensional (1D) model atmospheres, or the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE), or both. We find that, among the solar twins in our sample, the Sun is Li poor in comparison to other stars at similar age, in agreement to previous studies. The sample shows a variety of trends in elemental abundances as a function of condensation temperature. We find a strong correlation in these trends with [Fe/H], with a marginally-significant difference in the gradients for stars with and without giants planets detected, that increases after applying 3D and non-LTE corrections. Our overall results suggests that the peculiar composition of the Sun is primarily related to Galactic chemical evolution rather than the presence of giant planets.

          Mass-feeding of jet-launching white dwarfs in grazing and common envelope evolution

 - **Abstract**
 I propose a scenario that allows white dwarfs (WDs) to launch relatively powerful jets when they enter a common envelope evolution (CEE) or experience a grazing envelope evolution (GEE) with a red giant branch star (RGB) or an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star. In this, still a speculative scenario, the accretion for a time is mainly onto an accretion disk with a radius of ~ 1Ro that increases in mass. The accretion disk launches the powerful two opposite jets by releasing gravitational energy, up to several times super-Eddington, as its mass increases. The jets that the disk launches remove high-entropy gas from the disk's outskirts and the envelope that the WD inflates because of nuclear burning on its surface. The motivations to allow WDs to launch powerful jets are recent findings, from the morphologies of post-CEE planetary nebulae, that jets play a major role in the CEE and the accumulating evidence that jets power luminous red novae by jets, as their morphologies indicate. I strengthen my call to include jets in the simulation and modeling of the CEE, consider the GEE as a phase preceding the CEE in many (but not all) cases, and include jets as a major ingredient in modeling and stimulating all energetic luminous red novae.

          Spectroscopic Observations of Supra-Arcade Downflows

 - **Abstract**
 Despite their somewhat-frequent appearance in EUV imaging of off-limb flares, the origins of Supra-Arcade Downflows (SADs) remain a mystery. Appearing as dark, tendril-like downflows above growing flare loop arcades, SADs themselves are yet to be tied into the standard model of solar flares. The uncertainty of their origin is, in part, due to a lack of spectral observations, with the last published SAD spectral observations dating back to the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory / Solar Ultraviolet Measurements of Emitted Radiation (SOHO/SUMER) era in 2003. In this work, we present new observations of SADs within an M-class solar flare on April 2nd, 2022, observed by the Hinode EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) and NASA Solar Dynamics Observatory. We measure Fe XXIV 192.02 Angstrom Doppler downflows and non-thermal velocities in the low-intensity SAD features, exceeding values measured in the surrounding flare fan. The ratio of temperature-sensitive Fe XXIV 255.11 Angstrom and Fe XXIII 263.41 Angstrom lines also allow the measurement of electron temperature, revealing temperatures within the range of the surrounding flare fan. We compare EIS line-of-sight Doppler velocities with plane-of-sky velocities measured by AIA, to construct the 3D velocity profile of four prominent SADs, finding evidence for their divergence above the flare loop arcade - possibly related to the presence of a high altitude termination shock. Finally, we detect 'stealth' SADs, which produce SAD-like Doppler signals, yet with no change in intensity.

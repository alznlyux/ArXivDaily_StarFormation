- **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive photometric and kinematic study of the open clusters HSC 25, HSC 37, and HSC 2878, located in the innermost regions of the Galactic disc. Utilizing data from Gaia DR3 and the UPMASK membership algorithm, we identify 44, 55, and 112 most probable members for HSC 25, HSC 37, and HSC 2878, respectively. The mean proper-motion components are obtained as (-5.901 +/- 0.41, -6.213 +/- 0.40), (-3.231 +/- 0.56, -4.564 +/- 0.47), and (-3.830 +/- 0.51, -5.198 +/- 0.44) mas yr^-1 for HSC 25, HSC 37, and HSC 2878, respectively. The open clusters span a broad range of evolutionary stages, with estimated ages of log(t/yr) = 8.38 +/- 0.08, 7.04 +/- 0.09, and 9.04 +/- 0.09, and corresponding heliocentric distances of 7.36 +/- 0.37, 6.79 +/- 0.18, and 6.17 +/- 0.22 kpc. The obtained metallicities are 0.0388 +/- 0.0039, 0.0259 +/- 0.0028, and 0.0209 +/- 0.0023, respectively. Total mass estimates are 135, 755, and 204 solar masses, respectively, highlighting notable differences in stellar content across the clusters. An analysis of dynamical relaxation times suggests that HSC 25 and HSC 2878 are dynamically evolved, whereas the much younger HSC 37 is still in an early phase of dynamical evolution. The high space velocities and orbital parameters of these clusters reveal significant deviations from typical disc kinematics. HSC 25 and HSC 37 exhibit eccentric orbits and small perigalactic distances, consistent with dynamically heated or accreted origins within the Galactic bulge. In contrast, HSC 2878's relaxed, planar orbit suggests in situ bulge membership despite its age. These findings point toward a heterogeneous dynamical origin for the clusters, with implications for star formation and evolution in the inner Milky Way.

- **Abstract**
 Accurate estimation of propagation characteristics of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) is crucial for predicting their geoeffectiveness. Stereoscopic techniques to study the kinematics of CMEs generally have been carried out using remote sensing observations from three viewpoints, i.e. STEREO-A, STEREO-B, and SOHO. Since the loss of STEREO-B in 2014, stereoscopic reconstruction of CMEs has been restricted to the observations from only two viewpoints, i.e., STEREO-A and SOHO. When the angle of separation between STEREO-A and SOHO is small, it leads to larger uncertainties in the CME kinematics derived using stereoscopic techniques. In this paper, we demonstrate how this limitation can be addressed and how uncertainties in the estimation of CME kinematics and propagation direction can be reduced. For this purpose, we selected the CME of April 21, 2023, which was observed by two spacecraft, i.e. STEREO-A and SOHO, separated by a small 10 degree angle. Using the Graduated Cylindrical Shell (GCS) model on the remote-sensing observations near the Sun and the Advanced Drag-Based Model (ADBM) in the heliosphere, we estimated the arrival time of the CME at different locations in the heliosphere and compared it with the actual arrival time obtained from the in-situ measurements taken by three spacecraft, BepiColombo, STEREO-A and Wind. Our analysis reveals a directional uncertainty of approx 20 degree from observations from two viewpoints. These uncertainties significantly affect the arrival-time prediction of the CME. We consider the actual chronology of CME arrival times at STEREO-A and Wind as critical parameters to constrain the direction of propagation, which serves as a key input in the ADBM. The chronology of arrival of the CME ejecta at STEREO-A, which is 4.5 hrs earlier than at Wind, proved essential for resolving directional ambiguities in the GCS reconstruction model

- **Abstract**
 The Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) provides the closest example of star and planet formation in highly irradiated environments. It is a key region to study how UV radiation from massive stars drive mass-loss in protoplanetary disks through photoevaporation. Far-UV photons (6<E<13.6 eV) heat up the gas of the disk, forming a photodissociation region (PDRs). We use the NIRCam images from the PDRs4All program combined with those of the GTO program 1256 to extract key information on ONC disks. Specifically, the radii of the disks observed in silhouette against the bright background , the presence and positions of the dissociation fronts (DFs), the presence and positions of ionization fronts (IFs), intensities of Pa $\alpha$ lines, and their near IR SEDs. From those, we construct a typology for ONC disks: Type I show an IF and DF nearly merged at the disk surface; Type II have their DFs at the disk surface and IFs at a distance of several 10s of astronomical units from the disk; and Type III also have their DF at the disk surface, but show no IF. For all disks, we find that PAH emission traces the PDR. We establish that the SEDs of candidate JuMBOs observed as part of the PDRs4All program are similar to the SEDs of Type III ONC disks except for JuMBO24, which is of Type I or II. A detailed look at this SED shows it is compatible with a young low mass binary star with an unresolved ionized disk : a microproplyd binary. We observe that the disk radius of ONC disks increases with increasing projected distance to the ionizing source interpreted as evidence of the truncation of the disks by the photoevaporation. The disk radii measured at IR wavelengths appear larger than at millimeter wavelengths, interpreted as evidence of the dust radial segregation within the disks. The thermal pressure within the PDRs of ONC disk increases with the FUV radiation field, but with a flatter slope.

- **Abstract**
 The nearby quasar, PG 1211+143, has one of the prototype examples of an ultra fast outflow (UFO), as seen in several past XMM-Newton and Chandra observations. In December 2024, PG 1211+143 was observed simultaneously with XRISM Resolve and XMM-Newton, allowing both the Fe K and soft X-ray outflows to be examined at high resolution simultaneously. The Resolve spectrum revealed a forest of Fe K band absorption lines from the UFO (Mizumoto et al. 2026), comprising of up to six discrete velocity components ranging from $v/c=-0.074$ to $v/c=-0.40$. Here we present the simultaneous XMM-Newton RGS (Reflection Grating Spectrometer) spectrum, where three lower ionization counterparts of the Fe K velocity zones are observed; at $v/c=-0.074, -0.12$ and $-0.33$. The soft X-ray absorbers tend to be somewhat less ionized than their Fe K counterparts, with their opacity mainly arising from Fe L shell lines and highly ionized Oxygen. From comparing the Resolve and RGS absorbers, we show that the outflow can be parameterized with a density profile varying with radius as $r^{-5/3}$, while the lower ionization zones likely originate from denser clumps of gas. Pure electron scattering appears insufficient to provide enough thrust to power the wind, unless sufficient low ionization gas capable of radiative line driving exists outside of the line of sight. Overall, PG 1211+143 provides further evidence for the clumpy nature of accretion disk winds, as was recently revealed in the quasar PDS 456 with XRISM.

- **Abstract**
 Massive O-type stars lose a significant fraction of their mass through radiation-driven winds, a process that critically shapes their evolution and feedback into the interstellar medium. Accurate predictions of mass-loss rates are essential for models of stellar structure and population synthesis. We computed wind parameters for O-type stars using a self-consistent approach that couples the hydrodynamics of the wind with detailed calculations of the line acceleration. This approach follows the theory of radiation-driven stellar winds and allows us to derive mass-loss rate distributions for different atomic configurations of the stellar flux. We used the TLUSTY code for stellar atmosphere models to compute non-local thermodynamic equilibrium models; these models served as input radiation fields for the calculation of the line-force parameters, for which we used the LOCUS code. These line-force parameters were then iteratively coupled with the HYDWIND code to solve the wind hydrodynamics. The procedure was applied across a grid of stellar parameters for three chemical configurations. We obtain self-consistent wind parameters for a broad set of O-type stellar models. The results show a systematic decrease in mass-loss rates with the inclusion of more elements in the radiation field, which is attributed to a strong effect on the UV region of the spectral energy distribution. As more elements are included, resulting in a larger number of spectral lines, the contribution from the UV diminishes, leading to lower mass-loss rates. We fitted three theoretical prescriptions for $\dot{M}$ using a Bayesian approach; this yielded Pearson correlation values greater than 0.92 for all three model grids. It also allowed for the estimation of the wind momentum-luminosity relationships for each of the grids, yielding results similar to those based on observations of O-type stars.

- **Abstract**
 We present high-angular resolution ($\simeq 0\rlap.{''}06$) VLA and ALMA observations of Orion South separated by 15.52 years. The purpose of this study was to search for orbital motions in three close ($\simeq 0\rlap.{''}1$) binary systems in the region. We do not detect changes in the position angle of the binaries but in two of the cases we detect significant changes in their separation in the plane of the sky. We use these changes to estimate that the total mass of the binaries is in the $\simeq$1-2 $M_\odot$ range. We also estimate the disk masses from the mm emission. The dust-to-stellar mass ratio is in the range of 0.04 to 0.18, values consistent with those expected for very early stellar evolution (Class 0) protostars.

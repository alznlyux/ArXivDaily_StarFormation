- **Abstract**
 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are fundamental to cosmology and galactic chemical evolution, yet the nature of their progenitor systems remains unresolved. Multiple evolutionary pathways, including single-degenerate, double-degenerate, and helium-donor systems, are thought to contribute to the SN Ia population, but direct observational constraints are limited. This uncertainty hampers our understanding of SN Ia diversity and introduces systematic uncertainties in their use as precision cosmological probes. By the 2040s, surveys such as Gaia, LSST, SDSS-V, 4MOST, and the gravitational-wave mission LISA will identify thousands of compact binaries in the Milky Way that are potential SN Ia progenitors. However, survey discoveries alone are insufficient. Robust identification and characterization require high-time-resolution, phase-resolved spectroscopy to determine fundamental parameters such as component masses, orbital inclinations, chemical compositions, and accretion states. Addressing these challenges demands new observational capabilities. The most compact binaries require continuous, dead-time-free spectroscopy with negligible readout noise, while the progenitor population spans a wide range of brightness and orbital periods. A modular, multi-aperture telescope array equipped with fast, low-noise spectrographs can flexibly combine collecting area for faint targets, observe bright systems efficiently, and deliver uninterrupted time series through staggered exposures. Such observations are difficult for single-aperture facilities.

- **Abstract**
 Planet formation in the chemically ancient, dynamically heated Galactic thick disc remains poorly constrained, owing to the expectation that its low solid reservoirs, short disc lifetimes, and harsh irradiation environments inhibit efficient assembly of planetary bodies. However, an increasing number of confirmed thick disc planet hosts now challenge this view, indicating that planetary formation and survival in the early Milky Way may have been more resilient -- and more diverse -- than standard disc-evolution models suggest. Here we present a homogeneous characterisation of 38 exoplanetary systems orbiting bona fide thick disc stars, combining new detections with a systematic reassessment of archival systems. High-precision radial velocities and space-based transit photometry, combined with uniform high-resolution spectroscopy, yield self-consistent stellar and planetary parameters, and thick disc membership is secured via joint chemical and kinematic criteria. Among these systems, we identify two remarkably low-density, inflated planets -- TOI-1927 b and TOI-2643 b -- representing the first puffy planets known to orbit thick disc stars, and an outcome that is highly unexpected in metal-poor environments, thereby challenging current models of atmospheric retention and thermal inflation at low metallicity. This consolidated sample establishes a new empirical baseline for understanding how planetary architectures emerge under the depleted, short-lived discs characteristic of the early Milky Way.
#### Title:
          Using a neural network approach and starspots dependent models to predict effective temperatures and ages of young stars

- **Abstract**
 This study presents a statistical approach to accurately predict the effective temperatures of pre-main sequence stars, which are necessary for determining stellar ages using the isochrone methodology and cutting-age starspots-dependent models. By training a Neural Network model on high-quality spectroscopic temperatures from the Gaia-ESO Survey as the response variable, and using photometric data from Gaia DR3 and 2MASS catalogs as explanatory variables, we implemented a methodology to accurately derive the effective temperatures of much larger populations of stars for which only photometric data are available. The model demonstrated robust performance for low-mass stars with temperatures below 7000 K, including young stars, the primary focus of this work. Predicted temperatures were employed to construct Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams and to predict stellar ages of different young clusters and star forming regions through isochrone interpolation, achieving excellent agreement with spectroscopic-based ages and literature values derived from model-independent methods like lithium equivalent widths. The inclusion of starspot evolutionary models improved the age predictions, providing a more accurate description of stellar properties. Additionally, the results regarding the effective temperature and age predictions of the young clusters provide evidence for intrinsic age spreads in the youngest clusters, suggesting multiple formation events over time.

- **Abstract**
 We present the identification and characterization of 15 mid-to-late T dwarf candidates in the Euclid Quick Release 1 (Q1) dataset, based on a combined photometric and spectroscopic analysis. Candidates were initially selected via color-based cuts in the Euclid $Y_E - J_E$ and $J_E - H_E$ color-color space, targeting the region occupied by ultracool dwarfs in synthetic photometry from the Sanghi et al. (2024) sample. From an initial pool of 38,845 sources, we extracted low-resolution near-infrared spectra from the Euclid NISP instrument and applied a two-stage validation procedure that included spectral template fitting followed by visual inspection. Eight of the 15 validated candidates are newly identified objects with no prior literature association. We examined their morphological and photometric properties and compared them with established spectral standards. Photometric distances were derived using band-averaged distance modulus estimates. We discuss the limitations and promise of the Euclid survey for ultracool dwarf studies, and demonstrate the potential for discovering substellar populations beyond the reach of current wide-field surveys.

- **Abstract**
 The MeerKAT Large Area Synoptic Survey (MeerKLASS) collaboration has acquired multiple passes of L-band (856-1712 MHz) scanning observations over a 268 deg$^2$ sky region. This scanning enables efficient, large-area sky surveys by continuously scanning the MeerKAT array back and forth at fixed elevation while recording data at 2 sec intervals, progressively covering the survey region as the Earth rotates. We employ a novel on-the-fly (OTF) interferometric imaging technique to construct continuum images and catalogs from 16 hours of scan data. These data products, constituting the first MeerKLASS L-band data release (DR1), consist of high-fidelity radio continuum images and a catalogue of 34,874 radio sources detected with a SNR$>$9. The resulting Stokes I images achieve a median noise level of 33 $\mu$Jy\,beam$^{-1}$ and a median angular resolution of approximately $25.5''\times 7.8''$. Cross-comparisons with previous surveys confirm the consistency of our flux density scale within 5\% and astrometric precision within $1.5''$. Additionally, flux densities measured across the seven sub-bands enable in-band spectral-index estimates for the detected sources, providing insights into their physical properties and the broader source population. We compute the differential source counts, finding good agreement with existing measurements and validating our end-to-end processing. This data release demonstrates the effectiveness of scanning surveys when combined with OTF interferometric imaging. Commensal intensity mapping and interferometric imaging offers a dramatic enhancement of survey science per invested hour of observations and could therefore be an appealing option for next generation facilities like SKA-Mid.
#### Title:
          Pre-supernova O-C shell mergers could produce more $^{44}\mathrm{Ti}$ than the explosion

- **Abstract**
 The formation of $^{44}\mathrm{Ti}$ in massive stars is thought to occur during explosive nucleosynthesis, however recent studies have shown it can be produced during O-C shell mergers prior to core collapse. We investigate how mixing according to 3D macro physics derived from hydrodynamic simulations impacts the pre-supernova O-C shell merger nucleosynthesis and if it can dominate the explosive supernova production of $^{44}\mathrm{Ti}$ and other radioactive isotopes. We compare a range of observations and models of explosive $^{44}\mathrm{Ti}$ yields to pre-explosive multi-zone mixing-burning nucleosynthesis simulations of an O-C shell merger in a $15~\mathrm{M}_\odot$ stellar model with mixing conditions corresponding to different 3D hydro mixing scenarios. Radioactive species produced in the O shell have a spread in their pre-explosive yields predictions across different 3D mixing scenarios of 2.14 dex on average. $^{44}\mathrm{Ti}$ has the largest spread of 4.78 dex. The pre-explosive production of $^{44}\mathrm{Ti}$ can be larger than the production of all massive star models in the NuGrid data set where $^{44}\mathrm{Ti}$ is dominated by the explosive nucleosynthesis contribution, as well all other massive star and supernova models. We conclude that quantitative predictions of $^{44}\mathrm{Ti}$ and other radioactive species more broadly require an understanding of the 3D hydrodynamic mixing conditions present during the O-C shell merger.

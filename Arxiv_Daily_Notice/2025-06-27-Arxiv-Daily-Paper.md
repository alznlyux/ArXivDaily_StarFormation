 - **Abstract**
 The primordial power spectrum of matter density perturbations contains highly valuable information about new fundamental physics, in particular cosmological inflation, but is only very weakly constrained observationally for small cosmological scales $k\gtrsim 3\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. We derive novel constraints, $\mathcal{P}_\mathcal{R}(k)\lesssim 5\cdot10^{-6}$ over a large range of such scales, from the formation of ultracompact minihalos in the early universe. Unlike most existing constraints of this type, our results do not rest on the assumption that dark matter can annihilate into ordinary matter.

          SPT-3G D1: CMB temperature and polarization power spectra and cosmology from 2019 and 2020 observations of the SPT-3G Main field

 - **Abstract**
 We present measurements of the temperature and E-mode polarization angular power spectra of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) from observations of 4% of the sky with SPT-3G, the current camera on the South Pole Telescope (SPT). The maps used in this analysis are the deepest used in a CMB TT/TE/EE analysis to date. The maps and resulting power spectra have been validated through blind and unblind tests. The measurements of the lensed EE and TE spectra are the most precise to date at l=1800-4000 and l=2200-4000, respectively. Combining our TT/TE/EE spectra with previously published SPT-3G CMB lensing results, we find parameters for the standard LCDM model consistent with Planck and ACT-DR6 with comparable constraining power. We report a Hubble constant of $H_0=66.66\pm0.60$ km/s/Mpc from SPT-3G alone, 6.2 sigma away from local measurements from SH0ES. For the first time, combined ground-based (SPT+ACT) CMB primary and lensing data have reached Planck's constraining power on some parameters, a milestone for CMB cosmology. The combination of these three CMB experiments yields the tightest CMB constraints to date, with $H_0=67.24\pm0.35$ km/s/Mpc, and the amplitude of clustering $\sigma_8=0.8137\pm0.0038$. CMB data alone show no evidence for physics beyond LCDM; however, we observe a 2.8 sigma difference in LCDM between CMB and baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) results from DESI-DR2, which is relaxed in extended models. The combination of CMB and BAO yields 2-3 sigma shifts from LCDM in the curvature of the universe, the amplitude of CMB lensing, or the dark energy equation of state. It also drives mild preferences for models that address the Hubble tension through modified recombination or variations in the electron mass in a non-flat universe. This work highlights the growing power of ground-based CMB experiments and lays a foundation for further cosmological analyses with SPT-3G.

 - **Abstract**
 We present projected constraints on the abundance of primordial black holes (PBHs) as a constituent of dark matter, based on microlensing observations from the upcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) at the Vera C. Rubin Observatory. We use a catalogue of microlensing light curves simulated with Rubin Observatory's OpSims to demonstrate that competitive constraints crucially rely on minimising the false positive rate (FPR) of the classification algorithm. We propose the Bayesian information criterion and a Boosted Decision Tree as effective discriminators and compare their derived efficiency and FPR to a more standard $\chi^2$-test.

 - **Abstract**
 Primordial black holes (PBHs) with masses below $10^9\,\rm{g}$ are typically assumed to have negligible cosmological impact due to their rapid evaporation via Hawking radiation. However, the 'memory burden' effect, which is a quantum suppression of PBH evaporation, can dramatically alter their decay dynamics. In this work, we revisit early-Universe constraints on ultralight PBHs in this mass range, demonstrating that memory burden significantly alters previous constraints. We compute new cosmological bounds from BBN that strongly limit the presence of ultralight PBHs in the early Universe. We report that the PBHs in the mass range $10^0$-$10^2\,\rm{g}$ for $k=2$ are unconstrained by observations.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a study of the white dwarf (WD) cooling sequence of the globular cluster 47 Tucanae (47 Tuc or NGC 104) using deep infrared observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). By combining these data with ultra-deep optical imaging from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) taken ~12 years earlier, we derived precise proper motions (PMs) and isolated a clean sample of WD cluster members. We estimated the cluster's age by comparing the observed WD cooling sequence luminosity function (LF), derived from JWST photometry, with theoretical models, obtaining a value of 11.8 +/- 0.5 Gyr, in agreement with main sequence turn-off ages, and ages determined from the masses and radii of two eclipsing binaries in the cluster. The age determined from the infrared LF is consistent with the optical LF based on the HST photometry. However, small discrepancies exist between the shape of the observed and theoretical LFs. To investigate these differences, we tested the cooling times of WD models populating the bright part of the observed cooling sequence against a semi-empirical calibration from the literature, based on bright WDs in 47 Tuc, finding agreement within less than 2 sigma. A more detailed analysis of dynamical effects and the impact of multiple stellar populations on the WD mass distribution in the observed field will be essential for addressing this discrepancy in future studies.

 - **Abstract**
 We studied the properties of dark matter admixed-neutron stars (DMANS), considering fermionic dark matter (DM) that interacts gravitationally with hadronic matter (HM). Using relativistic mean-field equations of state (EoSs) for both components, we solved the two-fluid Tolman Oppenheimer Volkoff (TOV) equations to determine neutron star (NS) properties assuming that DM is confined within the stellar core. For hadronic matter, we employed realistic EoSs derived from low energy nuclear physics experiments, heavy-ion collision data, and NS observations. To constrain key dark matter parameters such as particle mass, mass fraction, and the coupling to mass ratio, we applied Bayesian inference, incorporating various astrophysical data including mass, radii, and NICER mass-radius distributions for PSR J0740+6620 and PSR J0030+0451. Additionally, we explored the influence of high-density HM EoSs and examined the impact of stiffer hadronic EoSs, excluding the vector meson self-interaction term. Our findings indicate that current astrophysical observations primarily constrain the dark matter fraction, while providing limited constraints on the particle mass or coupling. However, the dark matter fraction is largely insensitive to how astrophysical observations or uncertainties in the high-density EoS are incorporated. Instead, it is predominantly determined by the stiffness of the hadronic EoS at high densities, with stiffer hadronic EoSs yielding a higher dark matter mass fraction. Therefore, we conclude that the dark matter fraction plays a crucial role in shaping the properties of DMANS. Future investigations incorporating more realistic EoSs and astrophysical observations of other compact objects may provide deeper insights into dark matter.

          Planck Constraints on Axion-Like Particles through Isotropic Cosmic Birefringence

 - **Abstract**
 We present constraints on isotropic cosmic birefringence induced by axion-like particles (ALPs), derived from the analysis of cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization measurements obtained with the high-frequency channels of Planck. Recent measurements report a hint of isotropic cosmic birefringence, though its origin remains uncertain. The detailed dynamics of ALPs can leave characteristic imprints on the shape of the $EB$ angular power spectrum, which can be exploited to constrain specific models of cosmic birefringence. We first construct a multi-frequency likelihood that incorporates an intrinsic nonzero $EB$ power spectrum. We also show that the likelihood used in previous studies can be further simplified without loss of generality. Using this framework, we simultaneously constrain the ALP model parameters, the instrumental miscalibration angle, and the amplitudes of the $EB$ power spectrum of a Galactic dust foreground model. We find that, if ALPs are responsible for the observed cosmic birefringence, ALP masses at $\log_{10}m_{\phi}[{\rm eV}]\simeq-27.8$, $-27.5$, $-27.3$, $-27.2$, $-27.1$, as well as $\log_{10}m_{\phi}[{\rm eV}]\in[-27.0,-26.5]$, are excluded at more than $2\,\sigma$ statistical significance.

          Prospects for radio weak lensing: studies using LOFAR observations in the ELAIS-N1 field

 - **Abstract**
 We carry out a shape and weak lensing analysis of Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) radio sources and Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) optical sources within the European Large Area Infrared Space Observatory Survey-North 1 (ELAIS-N1) field. Using HSC data alone, we detect a cosmic shear correlation signal at a significance of $\sim$$9\sigma$ over a $\sim$$6.4$ deg$^2$ region. For the radio dataset, we analyse observations from both the LOFAR Two Metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) and the International LOFAR Telescope (ILT). While LoTSS provides the deepest radio imaging of ELAIS-N1 with a central source density of $\sim$2.7 arcmin$^{-2}$, its $6^{\prime\prime}$ resolution limits the accuracy of shape measurements. But, using LoTSS-matched HSC sources, we show that accurate radio shape measurements would enable us to measure the amplitude of the shear correlation function at least at $\sim$2$\sigma$ significance. In contrast, ILT observation of the field offers a superior $0.3^{\prime\prime}$ resolution. By cross-matching HSC and ILT samples, we measure a position angle correlation of $R_{\cos(2\alpha)} = 0.15 \pm 0.02$. This result highlights ILT's ability to resolve extended and diffuse emission. The current ILT observations lack the required depth for robust weak lensing measurements. To assess the potential of ILT, we use simulated data with increased observation hours. Our analysis indicates that with 3200 hours of ILT observations or deeper data, and assuming that statistical errors dominate over systematics, a shear correlation could be detected with moderate significance. To achieve this will require precise radio shear measurements and effective mitigation of point spread function (PSF) systematics.

 - **Abstract**
 The Rayleigh criterion determines the resolution limit of a periodogram, which is the minimum frequency separation required to barely resolve two sinusoids. Failing to consider the Rayleigh criterion may result in incorrect interpretations of long-period signals or spurious claims that two closely spaced periodogram peaks represent two distinct physical processes. We demonstrate how applying the Rayleigh criterion can help observers avoid false positive detections caused by uneven observing cadence or insufficient observing time baseline. We present three synthetic datasets that illustrate (1) a single oscillation with a split Lomb-Scargle periodogram peak resulting from uneven observing cadence can be mistaken for two oscillations if the Rayleigh criterion is neglected, (2) oversampling a periodogram's frequency grid does not improve resolution, and (3) observing time baseline requirements for resolving two closely spaced oscillations. We use the Rayleigh criterion to revisit detections of planets, stellar activity, and differential rotation from four published datasets. We show that the frequency separation between planet 55~Cnc~d and the activity cycle is too small to distinguish the two phenomena based on published radial velocities (RVs) alone. Likewise, the contested 4970-day planet orbiting HD~99492 cannot be statistically separated from zero frequency. We determine that a cubic polynomial better explains the long-term RV variability of Barnard's star than a sinusoid model. Finally, our re-analysis of {\it Kepler} observations of two active stars shows that the signals previously attributed to differential rotation can be modeled by a Gaussian process with a single quasiperiodicity. This work demonstrates the importance of the Rayleigh criterion when constructing a time-domain model.

 - **Abstract**
 Interferometric measurements are essential to constrain models of stellar systems, by spatially resolving angular distances and diameters well below the classical diffraction limit. In this work, we describe the interferometric module of Phoebe, which could be used just for this purpose. Since binaries in Phoebe are represented by a triangular mesh, our complex model is based on the integration over triangles. Consequently, Roche distortion, rotation, non-synchronicity, misalignment, eclipses of components, darkening, reflection, or irradiation are all accurately accounted for. For comparison purposes, we provide a simplified model, where components are represented by circular disks. The key point of our approach is a possibility of combination with other datasets (light curves, radial velocities), which allows to construct robust models of stellar systems.

 - **Abstract**
 Spectroscopic observations constrain the fundamental properties of stellar atmospheres, in particular, the effective temperature, the gravitational acceleration, or the metallicity. In this work, we describe the spectroscopic module for Phoebe, which allows for modelling of spectra, either normalized, or in absolute units (${\rm W}\,{\rm m}^{-2}\,{\rm m}^{-1}$). The module is based on extensive grids of synthetic spectra, taken from literature, which are interpolated and integrated over the surface. As an approximation, we assume that limb darkening is given by an analytical law, while other effects (e.g., eclipses) are treated self-consistently. Our approach is suitable for single stars, binaries, or multiples, and can be further extended to systems with pulsating components.

          Stellar Dynamics in Open Clusters Increases the Binary Fraction and Mass Ratios: Evidence from Photometric Binaries in 35 Open Clusters

 - **Abstract**
 Using the Bayesian Analysis of Stellar Evolution-9 (BASE-9) code and Gaia DR3, Pan-STARRS, and 2MASS data, we identify photometric binaries in 35 open clusters (OCs) and constrain their masses. We find a strong correlation between the binary fraction and cluster dynamical age and an even stronger correlation between core binary fraction and cluster dynamical age. We find the binary mass-ratio (q) distribution of dynamically young OCs is statistically distinct from that of the old OCs. On average, dynamically young OCs display multi-modal q distributions rising toward unity and toward our detection limit of q=0.5 while more dynamically evolved clusters display more uniform q distributions often with a peak near q=1. Interestingly, the uniform q distribution with a peak near q=1 is consistent with binaries in the field. We also observe a similar transition from multi-modal to unimodal q distributions when comparing low mass to high mass OCs in our sample. Lastly, we find a correlation between the median q of the binary population in a cluster and the cluster dynamical age. We interpret these results as an indication that dynamical encounters tend to increase the fraction of high-mass-ratio binaries within a given cluster -- particularly within the cluster's core where stellar dynamics are likely more important. This may be the result of stellar exchanges that tend to produce binaries with larger q and/or the preferential disruption or evaporation of lower q binaries.

          A Ground-Based Transit Observation of the Long-Period Extremely Low-Density Planet HIP 41378 f

 - **Abstract**
 We present a ground-based transit detection of HIP 41378 f, a long-period ($P = 542$ days), extremely low-density ($0.09 \pm 0.02$ g cm$^{-3}$) giant exoplanet in a dynamically complex system. Using photometry from Tierras, TRAPPIST-North, and multiple LCOGT sites, we constrain the transit center time to $T_{C,6} = 2460438.889 \pm 0.049$ BJD TDB. This marks only the second ground-based detection of HIP 41378 f, currently the longest-period and longest-duration transiting exoplanet observed from the ground. We use this new detection to update the TTV solution for HIP 41378 f and refine the predicted times of its next two transits in November 2025 and April 2027. Incorporating new TESS Sector 88 data, we also rule out the 101-day orbital period alias for HIP 41378 d, and find that the remaining viable solutions are centered on the 278, 371, and 1113-day aliases. The latter two imply dynamical configurations that challenge the canonical view of planet e as the dominant perturber of planet f. Our results suggest that HIP 41378 d may instead play the leading role in shaping the TTV of HIP 41378 f.

          KMT-2022-BLG-0086: Another binary-lens binary-source microlensing event

 - **Abstract**
 We present the analysis of a microlensing event KMT-2022-BLG-0086 of which the overall light curve is not described by a binary-lens single-source (2L1S) model, which suggests the existence of an extra lens or an extra source. We found that the event is best explained by the binary-lens binary-source (2L2S) model, but the 2L2S model is only favored over the triple-lens single-source (3L1S) model by $\Delta\chi^{2} \simeq 9$. Although the event has noticeable anomalies around the peak of the light curve, they are not enough covered to constrain the angular Einstein radius $\theta_{\rm E}$, thus we only measure the minimum angular Einstein radius $\theta_{\rm E,min}$. From the Bayesian analysis, it is found that that the binary lens system is a binary star with masses of $(m_1,m_2)=(0.46^{+0.35}_{-0.25}\, M_\odot, 0.75^{+0.67}_{-0.55}\, M_\odot)$ at a distance of $D_{\rm L}=5.87^{+1.21}_{-1.79}$ kpc, while the triple lens system is a brown dwarf or a massive giant planet in a low-mass binary-star system with masses of $(m_1,m_2,m_3)=(0.43^{+0.41}_{-0.35}\, M_\odot, 0.056^{+0.055}_{-0.047}\, M_\odot, 20.84^{+20.20}_{-17.04}\, M_{\rm J})$ at a distance of $D_{\rm L}=4.06^{+1.39}_{-3.28}$ kpc, indicating a disk lens system. The 2L2S model yields the relative lens-source proper motion of $\mu_{\rm rel} \geqslant 4.6\, \rm mas\, yr^{-1}$ that is consistent with the Bayesian result, whereas the 3L1S model yields $\mu_{\rm rel} \geqslant 18.9\, \rm mas\, yr^{-1}$, which is more than three times larger than that of a typical disk object of $\sim 6\, \rm mas\, yr^{-1}$ and thus is not consistent with the Bayesian result. This suggests that the event is likely caused by the binary-lens binary-source model.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of CO$_2$ gas emission around HD 23514, an F5V star in the $\sim$150 Myr-old Pleiades cluster, hosting one of the rare giant-impact disks with unique mineralogy dominated by silica dust. We show that the dust feature remains stable over several decades, and that the sub-$\mu$m grains, which give rise to the $\sim$9 $\mu$m feature, are co-spatial with the hot CO$_2$ molecules within the sub-au vicinity of the star. Examining the Spitzer spectrum taken 15 years earlier, we show that the CO$_2$ emission was also present at 4.3 $\sigma$ significance. The existence of tiny silica grains and volatile gas requires special conditions to prevent the rapid loss caused by stellar radiation pressure and photodissociation. We explore several pathways explaining the observed properties and suggest that a past giant impact and/or stripping atmospheric event, involving large bodies with volatile content similar to the carbonaceous chondritic material, can simultaneously explain both the silica and volatile emission. Our discovery provides an important context for the amount of volatiles that a newly formed planet or the largest planetesimals could retain during the giant impact phase in the early solar system evolution.

          Phosphates Reveal High pH Ocean Water on Enceladus

 - **Abstract**
 Enceladus offers our best opportunity for exploring the chemistry of an ocean on another world. Here, we perform geochemical modeling to show how the distribution of phosphate species found in ice grains from Enceladus's plume provides a very straightforward constraint on the pH of the host solution. The ratio of HPO$_4$/PO$_4$ species serves as a pH indicator. We find evidence of moderately alkaline water (pH 10.1-11.6)--significantly more alkaline than current estimates (~8-9) of the pH of Enceladus's ocean. Nevertheless, the pH range from phosphates is consistent with the CO$_2$/H$_2$O ratio measured in the plume if CO$_2$ exsolves from ocean water according to its equilibrium solubility. A simple energy balance can be used to quantify volatile fractionation during gas transport inside Enceladus's tiger stripes; we deduce that ~83% of water vapor is removed as ice during transport between the liquid-vapor interface and where gases exit the subsurface. We also explore how CO$_2$ degassing may lead to an increase in the apparent pH of ocean water. We generate maps of allowed combinations of pH and dissolved inorganic carbon concentration of the source water for a wide range of scenarios. Our preferred interpretation, constrained by the observed heat flux, implies minimal CO$_2$ degassing from ocean water. Hence, the pH recorded by phosphates should closely approximate that of the ocean; our best estimate is pH ~10.6. Such a high pH seems to reflect a major role of silicates enriched in Na, Mg, or Fe(II) interacting extensively with ocean water. Silica nanoparticles would not form or would subsequently dissolve if the pH is too high (>10.5). The outgassing model presented here provides a new path to quantify the dissolved concentrations of volatile species.

 Hot cores are small ($\lesssim$0.1 pc), dense ($\geq$10$^6$ cm$^{-3}$), and hot ($>$100 K) regions around massive protostars and are one of the main production sites of complex organic molecules (COMs, $\geq6$ atoms, including carbon). The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is an ideal place to study hot core and COM formation in an environment that is different from our Galaxy, though prior to this study there have only been nine detections of extragalactic hot cores (seven in the LMC and two in the Small Magellanic Cloud, SMC). Here, we report 1.2 mm continuum and molecular line observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in the star-forming region N160 that we named N160A-mm. We identify six 1.2 mm continuum sources, four of which are associated with methanol (CH$_3$OH) emission. Another COM, methyl cyanide (CH$_3$CN) is associated with the brightest source, N160A-mmA, the most chemically rich source in the field. Using the XCLASS software, we perform spectral modeling to estimate rotational temperatures and total column densities of detected molecular species for four sources. Based on the temperature exceeding 100 K, small size, and high H$_2$ number density, we identify N160A-mmA as a hot core. We compare the molecular abundances of this newly detected hot core with those previously detected in the LMC and SMC, as well as with a sample of Galactic hot cores, and discuss the complex nature of N160A-mmA.

 - **Abstract**
 The Fe K$\alpha$ fluorescence line ($\sim 6.4$ keV) has been observed during solar and stellar flares. Two emission mechanisms of the Fe K$\alpha$ line, photoionization and collisional ionization, have been discussed, and the aim of this work is to collect evidences for each mechanism employing a statistical correlation approach between the Fe K$\alpha$ line flux and rough flare properties. Here, we systematically searched the NICER (0.2$-$12 keV) archive data for the Fe K$\alpha$ line of RS Canum Venaticorum type stars. Among our analyzed 255 observation IDs with a total exposure of $\sim 700$ ks, we found 25 data sets (total $\sim 40$ ks) exhibiting the Fe K$\alpha$ emission line at 6.37$-$6.54 keV with its equivalent width of 44.3$-$578.4 eV: 18 observations during flares, 6 observations during unconfirmed possible flare candidates and one at a quiescent phase. These observations indicate a positive correlation between the Fe K$\alpha$ line intensity and the 7.11$-$20 keV thermal plasma luminosity with its powerlaw index of $0.86 \pm 0.46$. This correlation in the range of the thermal plasma luminosity $10^{29-33}$ erg s$^{-1}$ is consistent with the photoionization origin of the line. On the other hand, the equivalent width of the Fe K$\alpha$ line has a negative correlation with the 7.11$-$20 keV thermal plasma luminosity with its powerlaw index of $-0.27 \pm 0.10$. This anti-correlation is consistent with the decline of the fluorescence efficiency with increasing the stellar flare loop height. Furthermore, we found a signature of an absorption line at $6.38^{+0.03}_{-0.04}$ keV during a superflare of $\sigma$ Gem. The equivalent width of the line was $-34.7^{+2.03}_{-1.58}$ eV. We discuss the density of the Fe ions from the equivalent width using the curve of growth analysis.

 - **Abstract**
 Low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) are commonly observed in black hole X-ray binaries, and their frequency has been found to correlate with various energy spectral properties. In this work, we present a detailed timing analysis of Swift J1727.8-1613, revealing a novel two-branch correlation between the QPO frequency and the observed disk emission, which differs from previous findings of a single correlation. Specifically, at QPO frequencies below 3 Hz, the QPO frequency is negatively correlated with the observed disk emission. Such a negative relation transitions to a positive one, as the QPO frequency exceeds approximately 3 Hz. The correlation between QPO frequency and Compton flux exhibits an opposite trend, with a positive correlation at lower frequencies and a negative correlation at higher ones. We interpret these behaviors as signatures of an evolving disk-corona geometry, within the framework of a Lense-Thirring precessing hot flow. Additionally, we find that during the flare state, the QPO fractional root-mean-square (rms) remains nearly constant above 15 keV, but increases with energy below this threshold. The slope of the rms-energy relation becomes steeper as the energy spectrum softens.

 - **Abstract**
 We combine F115W and F277W images collected with the Near Infrared Camera of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) with multi-band, multi-epoch Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations of Omega Centauri to investigate its multiple stellar populations and internal kinematics. Our study focuses on a region spanning $\sim$0.9 to $\sim$2.3 half-light radii from the cluster center, largely unexplored by HST and JWST. Using chromosome maps, we identify the principal populations along the upper main sequence and among M-dwarfs, distinguishing lower-stream (LS) stars, chemically akin to first-generation globular cluster stars with similar metallicities, and upper-stream (US) stars, enriched in helium and nitrogen but oxygen-poor. Both streams also host subpopulations with varying metallicities. We find radially anisotropic motions, with US stars exhibiting significantly stronger anisotropy than LS stars. Subdividing the US into extreme and intermediate light-element populations reveals a gradient in anisotropy, with intermediate stars lying between the LS and extreme US populations. However, metal-rich and metal-poor stars within each stream show moderate kinematic differences. The LS stars show higher angular momentum and dispersion compared to US stars, and also exhibit stronger systemic rotation and tangential proper-motion skewness, further highlighting their kinematic divergence. Finally, leveraging a mass range of $\sim$0.15 - 0.7 solar masses, we detect a low degree of energy equipartition for all cluster stars, which decreases with radial distance from the cluster center.

          Saturns, but not super-Jupiters, occur more frequently in the presence of inner super-Earths

 - **Abstract**
 Studies from recent years have reached different conclusions regarding how frequently super-Earths are accompanied by long period giant planets and vice versa. This relation has been predicted to be mass dependent by planet formation models. We investigate that as the origin of the discrepancy using a radial velocity sample: the California Legacy Survey. We perform detection completeness corrections in order to discard detection bias as a possible explanation to our results. After bias corrections, we find that cold Jupiters are 5.65 times more massive when not in company of an inner super-Earth, while super-Earths are not significantly more massive while in company of an outer giant planet. We also report an occurrence enhancement for Saturns (median projected mass of 0.6MJ) while in presence of a super-Earth by a factor of 4, and for super-Earths in presence of Saturns by the same factor. This positive correlation disappears for super-Jupiters (median projected mass of 3.1MJ). These results show that while cold Jupiters are generally accompanied by inner super-Earths, this does not hold for the largest giant planets, such as those that will be discovered by Gaia, which will likely not be accompanied by transiting planets. The mass dependence, in combination with different detection limits of different surveys, may explain the discrepancies concerning occurrence relations between cold Jupiters and super-Earths.

 - **Abstract**
 White dwarfs with metal pollution are caused by the accretion of rocky dust from tidally disrupted minor bodies and are signposts for planetary systems. These minor bodies are perturbed by planets that have survived post-main sequence evolution. Open questions exist as to the typical mass of the perturbers and the specific planetary architectures that cause metal pollution. JWST's sensitivity in the mid-IR has opened new doors to deciphering polluted white dwarfs. We present JWST Cycle 1 MIRI imaging of four nearby metal-polluted white dwarfs with the goal of detecting and characterizing planetary companions. With deep mid-IR imaging we are sensitive to cold Jupiter-mass planet analogs. In addition to finding two candidate planetary companions, for the first time we detect significant excesses above the expected photospheric emission at 21~$\mu$m for two of our targets, WD 2149+021 and WD 2105-820. WD 2105-280 has a candidate planetary companion at a projected separation of 34 au and an infrared excess--if both candidates are confirmed, it would represent the first WD multi-planet system. We investigate whether these excesses could be caused by very low luminosity warm dust disks or planets. While both are likely, we argue that the most likely explanation for the excesses is that they are the thermal emission from jovian-mass planets in orbits with semi-major axes $<$10 au, using a combination of observational constraints. If most of the candidate planets presented here are confirmed, it would suggest that metal polluted white dwarfs are frequently orbited by at least one giant planet.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent cosmological observations have achieved high-precision measurements of the Universe's expansion history, prompting the use of nonparametric methods such as Gaussian processes (GP) regression. We apply GP regression for reconstructing the Hubble parameter using CC data, with improved covariance modeling and latest study in CC data. By comparing reconstructions in redshift space $z$ and transformed space $\log(z+1)$ , we evaluate six kernel functions using nested sampling (NS) and approximate Bayesian computation rejection (ABC rejection) methods and analyze the construction of Hubble constant $H_0$ in different models. Our analysis demonstrates that reconstructions in $\log(z+1)$ space remain physically reasonable, offering a viable alternative to conventional $z$ space approaches, while the introduction of nondiagonal covariance matrices leads to degraded reconstruction quality, suggesting that simplified diagonal forms may be preferable for reconstruction. These findings underscore the importance of task-specific kernel selection in GP-based cosmological inference. In particular, our findings suggest that careful preliminary screening of kernel functions, based on the physical quantities of interest, is essential for reliable inference in cosmological research using GP.

 - **Abstract**
 The 21-cm global signal is obscured by very bright galactic and extra galactic foreground emissions. Typical single-spectrum fit (SSF) based methods for foreground/signal separation can result in biased estimates of the cosmological signal due to the presence of spectral oscillations induced by the interaction between chromatic beams and the spatial shape of the foregrounds. Modelling this interaction requires some amount of assumed foreground information. We present a mapmaking-based approach which describes the beam-weighted observation of the sky by multiple globally-distributed antenna experiments as an observation equation. This equation is inverted in order to estimate the low-order sky modes ($\ell\lesssim10$). The resulting chromaticity-free sky monopole is then fit with a smooth foreground function and a 21-cm model. Given the insensitivity of global 21-cm experiments to small angular scales, we rely on the mean and covariance of higher-order foreground modes being known. We show that this mapmaking-based method is capable of inferring the cosmological signal in cases where a SSF with a simple beam-factor based chromaticity correction fails, even when the foreground model used in the mapmaking method features uncertainty at the 10\% level.

 - **Abstract**
 Imaging polarimetry is a well-known method for analysing the structure and composition of cometary dust. Accordingly, comets are classified based on the phase angle dependent degree of linear polarization of their comae. The goal of this study is to examine the size and structure of the dust grains in the coma and in particular in the tail of the bright comet C/2023 A3 (Tsuchinshan-ATLAS) and to infer possible variations. For this purpose, we rely on the method of telescopic wide-field polarimetric imaging of the comet in order to obtain the dependence of the degree of linear polarization (DoLP) of the coma and tail on the phase angle across a broad range, using an off-the-shelf industrial grade polarization camera combined with a small telescope of short aperture ratio. These observations are accompanied by T-matrix modeling using the MSTM4 software framework for simulation of light scattering by fractal agglomerates of spherical monomer particles. Our observations indicate that the coma exhibits a high maximum DoLP of 0.34, which is further exceeded by a factor of about two by the DoLP of the comet's tail. Differences in the phase angle of maximum DoLP between coma and tail indicate a higher carbon vs.\ silicate fraction in the coma than in the tail. Our simulations are able to reproduce the observations when assuming that the dust agglomerates are formed of larger monomers in the coma than in the tail. A possible explanation of these results is that the coma monomers are coated by a thin layer of frozen volatiles, which sublimate due to solar heating when the dust moves from the coma towards the tail.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we study two scalar field driven dark energy models characterized by the axion potential and the inverse power law potential, each coupled to dark matter through a momentum exchange interaction. By formulating the dynamics as an autonomous system, we identify the equilibrium points and analyze their stability. To constrain these models, we utilize observational data from Pantheon Plus Type Ia Supernovae, DES Y5, DESI DR2 BAO, and Planck 2018 CMB compressed likelihood, employing Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Both potentials exhibit weak to strong preference over the $\Lambda$CDM model, with a particularly strong preference for the momentum-coupled scenario when Supernova data are included in the analysis. Furthermore, we find the coupling parameter to be negative, with no lower bound, for both potentials. This suggests that momentum-exchange coupling between the dark sectors cannot be ruled out. From the stability analysis, we observe that for both potentials, the late-time attractor corresponds to a dark energy dominated phase, and the scalar field can behave as a stiff fluid during the early epoch.

 We present first-light deep H$\alpha$ imaging taken with the Nanshan 1-meter wide-field telescope on the local galaxy NGC 4258, alongside archival data from Hubble Space telescope (HST), Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope, and The Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey. The H$\alpha$ image shows ongoing star formation not only inside the galaxy but also in an HI cloud in the eastern HI tail, which is roughly 16 kpc away from the main galaxy. The HST images reveal several ultra-blue compact objects ($\rm F555W - F814W <-0.5 mag,\, FWHM\sim 0.2''$) in the H$\alpha$ bright region, aligned with the HI tail, suggesting the presence of young open cluster candidate in the HI tail. Our results suggest that wide field H$\alpha$ imaging is a valuable tool for investigating recent star formation in the extended regions of NGC 4258. Furthermore, the star formation in diffuse HI tails could highlight an potential aspect of galaxy stellar halo formation, warranting further investigation of the impact of star formation in halos on galaxy evolution.

 We present a comprehensive timing analysis of X-ray data from the {\it XMM-Newton} satellite, examining 50 light curves covering 17 years of observations of the blazar Mrk~421. This work uses classical deterministic and stochastic methods in a novel way, enabling the distinction of temporal scales and offering essential insights through correlations among parameters. Deterministic behaviors are primarily explored through recurrence quantification analysis (RQA), used innovatively by varying the threshold input parameter to examine variability at multiple temporal scales. To investigate behavior across various scales from a stochastic perspective, we apply both autoregressive moving average (ARMA) and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models, with results from ARIMA more tightly related to short scales. Our findings reveal that Mrk~421's X-ray emission is a multifaceted process, driven by both deterministic and stochastic patterns, indicating a complex interplay of physical phenomena. Our study demonstrates that deterministic patterns are more pronounced at small temporal scales, which are disconnected from large scales. On the other hand, stochastic processes with memory propagate from large to small time scales, while noise affects both scales, as indicated by the correlation analysis. These results underscore the importance of advanced methodologies for interpreting astrophysical data, contributing to ongoing discussions in blazar physics by exploring connections between our calculated parameters and established models. The same approach can potentially be applied to other sources, enhancing our general understanding of variability and emission mechanisms in blazars.

 - **Abstract**
 An element's astrophysical origin should be reflected in the spatial distribution of its abundance, yielding measurably different spatial distributions for elements with different nucleosynthetic sites. However, most extragalactic multi-element analyses of gas-phase abundances to date have been limited to small numbers of sightlines, making statistical characterization of differences in spatial distributions of elements impossible. Here we use integrated field spectroscopic data covering the full face of the nearby dwarf galaxy NGC 5253 sampled at 3.5-pc resolution to produce maps of the abundances of oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur using independent direct methods. We find strong evidence for differences in the elements' spatial statistics that mirror their predicted nucleosynthetic origins: the spatial distributions of oxygen and sulfur, both predominantly produced in core-collapse supernovae, indicate that initial injection occurs on larger scales than for nitrogen, which is predominantly produced by asymptotic giant branch stars. All elements are well-correlated but oxygen and sulfur are much better correlated with each other than with nitrogen, consistent with recent results for stellar abundances in the Milky Way. These findings both open a new avenue to test nucleosynthetic models, and make predictions for the structure of stellar chemical abundance distributions.

 - **Abstract**
 This work investigates the impact of dark matter (DM) on the microscopic and macroscopic properties of proto-neutron stars (PNSs). We employ a single-fluid framework in which DM interacts with ordinary matter (OM) via the Higgs portal and remains in thermal equilibrium through non-gravitational interactions. Using a quasi-static approximation, we analyze the evolution of PNSs during the Kelvin--Helmholtz phase by varying the DM mass while keeping the entropy per baryon and lepton fraction fixed. Our results show that DM absorbs thermal energy from the stellar medium without efficient re-emission, thereby altering neutrino emission and affecting the star's thermal evolution history. Furthermore, neutrinos contribute significantly to pressure support in the PNS phase, inhibiting DM mass accretion during neutrino-trapped stages. Based on the requirement to satisfy the observed $2\,\rm M_\odot$ neutron star mass constraint and to maintain consistency with supernova remnant data, we suggest an upper limit of $m_\chi \leq 0.62\,\rm GeV$ for the DM mass that can accrete in evolving PNSs. In contrast, we established that cold neutron stars (NSs) can support higher DM masses without compromising equilibrium stability, owing to increased central density, enhanced gravitational binding energy, and reduced thermal pressure.

 Stellar streams are sensitive laboratories for understanding the small-scale structure in our Galaxy's gravitational field. Here, we analyze the morphology of the $300S$ stellar stream, which has an eccentric, retrograde orbit and thus could be an especially powerful probe of both baryonic and dark substructures within the Milky Way. Due to extensive background contamination from the Sagittarius stream (Sgr), we perform an analysis combining Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey photometry, $\textit{Gaia}$ DR3 proper motions, and spectroscopy from the Southern Stellar Stream Spectroscopic Survey ($\textit{S}^5$). We redetermine the stream coordinate system and distance gradient, then apply two approaches to describe $300S$'s morphology. In the first, we analyze stars from $\textit{Gaia}$ using proper motions to remove Sgr. In the second, we generate a simultaneous model of $300S$ and Sgr based purely on photometric information. Both approaches agree within their respective domains and describe the stream over a region spanning $33^\circ$. Overall, $300S$ has three well-defined density peaks and smooth variations in stream width. Furthermore, $300S$ has a possible gap of $\sim 4.7^\circ$ and a kink. Dynamical modeling of the kink implies that $300S$ was dramatically influenced by the Large Magellanic Cloud. This is the first model of $300S$'s morphology across its entire known footprint, opening the door for deeper analysis to constrain the structures of the Milky Way.

 - **Abstract**
 Chemically-homogeneously evolving stars have been proposed to account for several exotic phenomena, including gravitational-wave emissions and gamma-ray bursts. Here we study whether these stars can explain the metal-poor dwarf galaxy, I Zwicky 18. We apply our synthetic spectral models from Paper II to (i) establish a classification sequence for these hot stars, (ii) predict the photonionizing flux and the strength of emission lines from a IZw18-like stellar population, and (iii) compare our predictions to available observations of this galaxy. Adding two new models computed with PoWR, we report (i) these stars to follow a unique sequence of classes: O->WN->WO (i.e. without ever being WC). From our population synthesis with standard assumptions, we predict that (ii) the source of the UV C-IV and other emission bumps is a couple dozen WO-type Wolf-Rayet stars (not WC as previously assumed) which are the result of chem.-hom. evolution, while these, combined with the rest of the O-star population, account for the He-II ionizing flux and spectral hardness. Contrasting our results against published optical and UV data and accounting for different aperture sizes and spatial regions probed by the observations, we find that (iii) our models are highly consistent with them. Since our "massive Pop II stars" might just as well exist in early star-forming regions, our findings have implications for upcoming JWST surveys; and given that our results apply for binary populations too as long as the same fraction (10%) of the systems evolves chem. homogeneously, we conclude that the stellar progenitors of gravitational waves may very well exist today in IZw18.

 - **Abstract**
 While transmission spectroscopy has allowed us to detect many atomic and molecular species in exoplanet atmospheres, the improvement in resolution and signal-to-noise ratio enabled us to become sensitive to planet-occulted line distortions (POLDs) in the spectrum that are induced by center-to-limb variations and the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect. POLDs can bias the interpretation of the transmission spectrum, and it is difficult to correct for them with stellar models. We analyzed two ESPRESSO transits (R $\sim$ 140$\,$000) of the archetypal hot Jupiter HD$\,$189733$\,$b. The transmission spectrum of this aligned system is heavily affected by POLDs, stellar activity, and instrumental effects. It is therefore a challenging study case of how to account for these effects when the planetary signal is retrieved from chemical species through transmission spectroscopy. We confirm the previous detections of the sodium doublet signature in the upper atmosphere of HD$\,$189733$\,$b. When we accounted for POLDs and isolated the planetary signal from uncorrected stellar residuals, we found a shallower (0.432 $\pm$ 0.027 %) and more strongly blueshifted (-7.97 $\pm$ 0.28 km/s) signal. We attempted to reinterpret the other high-resolution sodium studies of this system in light of our results. We suggest that the POLDs and stellar activity are insufficiently corrected for in all analyses, including ours. We also detected a planetary lithium signature of 0.102 $\pm$ 0.016 % (6.4$\sigma$) at a blueshift of -2.4 $\pm$ 1.8 km/s.

 Currently, the increasing availability of accurate cosmological probes leads to the emergence of tensions between data on the one hand and between theoretical predictions and direct observations on the other. Moreover, after 25 years since the discovery of the accelerated expansion of the Universe has elected the $\Lambda$CDM model as the reference model, resolving shortcomings of the standard cosmological model seems to be an unpostponed priority. Hence, it is key to test alternative models and investigate new cosmological probes at distances that range from the late to the early Universe, namely between the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and type Ia supernovae and baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO) data. Bargiacchi et al. (2022) for the first time analysed dark energy (DE) models using quasars (QSOs) while also testing their consistency with BAO. Here, we carry on by exploring the compatibility of QSOs with both CMB data and dark energy survey measurements against the standard cosmological model and some DE extensions, such as the $w$CDM and Chevallier-Polarski-Linder parameterisations. We also consider an interacting dark matter and vacuum energy scenario, where vacuum energy perturbations affect the evolution of the matter growth rate in a decomposed Chaplygin gas model. We implement the QSO probe in Cobaya Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm, using Botzmann solver codes as Cosmic Linear Anisotropy Solving System (CLASS) for the theory predictions. Our work shows that simple DE deviations from $\Lambda$CDM model do not reconcile the data and that only more complex models of interaction in the dark sector can succeed in solving the discrepancies of probes at all scales.

 - **Abstract**
 Split main-sequences (MSs) and extended main-sequence turn-offs (eMSTOs) have been observed in nearly all Magellanic Clouds clusters younger than 2 Gyr. More recently, Hubble Space Telescope (HST) ultraviolet photometry uncovered a puzzling new population of UV-absorbed stars, dubbed UVdim, in five Magellanic Clouds clusters aged between 40 and 200 Myr, as well as in one 1.5 Gyr-old cluster. These UVdim stars predominantly lie on the blue MS, which is composed of slow rotators, and their distinct UV properties are believed to stem from dusty circumstellar disks. Although eMSTOs are common in both Magellanic Clouds and Galactic open clusters (OCs) of comparable ages, UVdim stars have not yet been investigated in Galactic OCs. In this work, we fill that gap by combining Swift/UVOT, SkyMapper, and Gaia photometry to extend the search for UVdim stars to 35 Galactic OCs younger than 2 Gyr. By constructing colour-colour diagrams analogous to those employed with HST WFC3/UVIS, we find no evidence of UVdim-like stars in most Galactic open clusters and identify possible UVdim candidates in only five systems. The rarity of UVdim stars in young OCs suggests a potential difference between Magellanic Cloud clusters and their Milky Way counterparts, although the underlying reason remains unclear.

 - **Abstract**
 Future gravitational-wave (GW) detectors are expected to detect tens of thousands of compact binary coalescences (CBC) per year, depending also on the final detectors layout. For this reason, it is essential to have a fast, reliable tool for forecasting how different detector layouts will affect parameter estimation for these events. The Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) is a common tool for tackling this problem. In this paper, we present a new open source code GWJulia to perform FIM analysis of CBC parameters, i.e., stellar black-hole binaries (BBH), neutron star binaries (BNS), and neutron star-black hole binaries (NSBH). The code is purely written in Julia, making it fast while maintaining a high level of accuracy. We consider a set of case studies to compare different Einstein Telescope (ET) designs. We compare a 10km triangular configuration with two 15km L-shaped detectors with different orientations and temperatures. We discuss also the accuracy of combinations of parameters, which is very informative for cosmology or population studies. Finally, we focus on the detection of golden events and explore how the FIM can guide posterior sampling of GW signals using a novel Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) sampler.

          Quintessence and phantoms in light of DESI 2025

 - **Abstract**
 We analyse DESI BAO, CMB, and supernova data to explore the physical origin of the DESI indication for dynamical dark energy. Beyond the standard CPL parametrization, we explore truncated alternatives and quintessence models. We conclude that there is compelling evidence for dark energy to be decaying in the late universe, but the evidence for a phantom behaviour is less significant. Models without phantom behaviour are compatible with the data at the $2\sigma$ CL. Furthermore, we examine a concrete quintessence scenario with a Higgs-like potential, allowing for a direct comparison with parametrized approaches and testing its consistency with current observations. This framework enables a broader investigation of late-time cosmic evolution and reveals a $93.8\%$ preference for a future transition into an anti-de Sitter space, which may ultimately lead to a cosmological collapse of our Universe.

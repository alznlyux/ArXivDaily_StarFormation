 - **Abstract**
 Astronomical image interpretation presents a significant challenge for applying multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to specialized scientific tasks. Existing benchmarks focus on general multimodal capabilities but fail to capture the complexity of astronomical data. To bridge this gap, we introduce AstroMMBench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs in astronomical image understanding. AstroMMBench comprises 621 multiple-choice questions across six astrophysical subfields, curated and reviewed by 15 domain experts for quality and relevance. We conducted an extensive evaluation of 25 diverse MLLMs, including 22 open-source and 3 closed-source models, using AstroMMBench. The results show that Ovis2-34B achieved the highest overall accuracy (70.5%), demonstrating leading capabilities even compared to strong closed-source models. Performance showed variations across the six astrophysical subfields, proving particularly challenging in domains like cosmology and high-energy astrophysics, while models performed relatively better in others, such as instrumentation and solar astrophysics. These findings underscore the vital role of domain-specific benchmarks like AstroMMBench in critically evaluating MLLM performance and guiding their targeted development for scientific applications. AstroMMBench provides a foundational resource and a dynamic tool to catalyze advancements at the intersection of AI and astronomy.

 - **Abstract**
 This article introduces a new physics-guided Machine Learning framework, with which we solve the generally non-invertible, ill-conditioned problems through an analytical approach and constrain the solution to the approximate inverse with the architecture of Neural Networks. By informing the networks of the underlying physical processes, the method optimizes data usage and enables interpretability of the model while simultaneously allowing estimation of detector properties and the propagation of their corresponding uncertainties. The method is applied in reconstructing Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) maps observed with the novel interferometric QUBIC experiment aimed at measuring the tensor-to-scalar ratio r.

          Geometry of the Milky Way's dark matter from dynamical models of the tilted stellar halo

 - **Abstract**
 The shape and orientation of the Milky Way's dark matter halo remain poorly constrained. Observations of the accreted stellar halo show that it is triaxial and tilted with respect to the disc. If this configuration is long-lived, it can be used to place constraints on the shape and orientation of the dark matter halo that can support it close to steady state. We fit equilibrium orbit-superposition (Schwarzschild) models to the stellar halo in a realistic Milky Way potential with a tilted dark matter halo, assuming that the long axes of each halo and the disc normal are coplanar. These models are matched to parametric density fits and velocity anisotropy measurements of Gaia Sausage-Enceladus (GSE) stars at radii $r\in[6,60]$ kpc. The observations are consistent with a (near-)prolate dark matter halo whose density has a short-to-long axis ratio of $q_\mathrm{dm}=0.87_{-0.09}^{+0.05}$. The long axis is inclined at an angle of $\beta_\mathrm{dm}=43_{-8}^{+22}\,^\circ$ to the disc plane, which exceeds the stellar halo tilt by $\approx18^\circ$. Spherical haloes cannot support the observed structure of the GSE in equilibrium. The best-fitting dynamical GSE model has a radius-dependent shape and orientation; between radii of 6 and 60 kpc the tilt increases from $\beta_*(r)\approx10^\circ$ to $\approx35^\circ$. Our model provides a good fit to the observed triaxial structure and dynamics of the GSE. It is therefore an excellent source of realistic initial conditions for simulations of the halo, such as for investigating perturbations from satellites or the Galactic bar.

          Updates to the WFC3/UVIS Saturation Map

 - **Abstract**
 The calwf3 software for WFC3/UVIS utilizes a reference file to flag pixels that are saturated beyond their full-well depth. Previously, this was accomplished using a constant threshold of 65,500 e$^{-}$ across the entire detector. In this study, we retrieved $\sim$1 million stars from the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST) to determine the flux level at which the Point Spread Function begins to flatten, which occurs as the central pixel saturates. We quantified the saturation limit as a function of position on the detector in 1,024 discrete regions, and interpolated to a pixel-by-pixel saturation map to construct a spatially-variable saturation map reference file that is now implemented in the calwf3 calibration pipeline. We find the saturation varies by 13% across the UVIS detectors, from 63,465 e$^{-}$ to 72,356 e$^{-}$. These values agree well with earlier studies using sparser datasets, with the current analysis leading to improved characterization on small scales. Critically, the revised saturation values are larger than the previous constant threshold over 87% of the UVIS detector, leading to the recovery of usable science pixels near bright sources. This update greatly improves the robustness of saturation flags in the Data Quality arrays of observations obtained with WFC3/UVIS, and users are encouraged to redownload their data from MAST to benefit from the improved flags.

          Dark forces suppress structure growth

 - **Abstract**
 No experimental test precludes the possibility that the dark matter experiences forces beyond general relativity -- in fact, a variety of cosmic microwave background observations suggest greater late-time structure than predicted in the standard $\Lambda$ cold dark matter model. We show that minimal models of scalar-mediated forces between dark matter particles do not enhance the growth of unbiased tracers of structure: weak lensing observables depend on the total density perturbation, for which the enhanced growth of the density contrast in the matter era is cancelled by the more rapid dilution of the background dark matter density. Moreover, the same background-level effects imply that scenarios compatible with CMB temperature and polarization anisotropies in fact suppress structure growth, as fixing the distance to last scattering requires a substantially increased density of dark energy. Though massive mediators undo these effects upon oscillating, they suppress structure even further because their gravitational impact as nonclustering subcomponents of matter outweighs the enhanced clustering strength of dark matter. We support these findings with analytic insight that clarifies the physical impact of dark forces and explains how primary CMB measurements calibrate the model's predictions for low-redshift observables. We discuss implications for neutrino mass limits and other cosmological anomalies, and we also consider how nonminimal extensions of the model might be engineered to enhance structure.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of TOI-4507 b, a transiting sub-Saturn with a density $<0.3$ g/cm$^3$ on a 105-day polar orbit around a $700$ Myr old F star. The transits were detected using data from TESS as well as the Antarctic telescope ASTEP. A joint analysis of the light curves and radial velocities from HARPS, FEROS, and CORALIE confirmed the planetary nature of the signal by limiting the mass to be below $30\,M_\oplus$ at $95\%$ confidence. The radial velocities also exhibit the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect and imply that the star's equatorial plane is tilted by $82.0_{-2.4}^{+2.6}$ deg with respect to the planet's orbital plane. With these characteristics, TOI-4507 b is one of longest-period planets for which the stellar obliquity has been measured, and is among the longest-period and youngest ''super-puff'' planets yet discovered.

          The warm outer layer of a Little Red Dot as the source of [Fe II] and collisional Balmer lines with scattering wings

 - **Abstract**
 The population of the Little Red Dots (LRDs) may represent a key phase of supermassive black hole (SMBH) growth. A cocoon of dense excited gas is emerging as key component to explain the most striking properties of LRDs, such as strong Balmer breaks and Balmer absorption, as well as the weak IR emission. To dissect the structure of LRDs, we analyze new deep JWST/NIRSpec PRISM and G395H spectra of FRESCO-GN-9771, one of the most luminous known LRDs at $z=5.5$. These reveal a strong Balmer break, broad Balmer lines and very narrow [O III] emission. We unveil a forest of optical [Fe II] lines, which we argue is emerging from a dense ($n_{\rm H}=10^{9-10}$ cm$^{-3}$) warm layer with electron temperature $T_{\rm e}\approx7000$ K. The broad wings of H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ have an exponential profile due to electron scattering in this same layer. The high $\rm H\alpha:H\beta:H\gamma$ flux ratio of $\approx10.4:1:0.14$ is an indicator of collisional excitation and resonant scattering dominating the Balmer line emission. A narrow H$\gamma$ component, unseen in the other two Balmer lines due to outshining by the broad components, could trace the ISM of a normal host galaxy with a star formation rate $\sim5$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. The warm layer is mostly opaque to Balmer transitions, producing a characteristic P-Cygni profile in the line centers suggesting outflowing motions. This same layer is responsible for shaping the Balmer break. The broad-band spectrum can be reasonably matched by a simple photoionized slab model that dominates the $\lambda>1500$ Å continuum and a low mass ($\sim10^8$ M$_{\odot}$) galaxy that could explain the narrow [O III], with only subdominant contribution to the UV continuum. Our findings indicate that Balmer lines are not directly tracing gas kinematics near the SMBH and that the BH mass scale is likely much lower than virial indicators suggest.

          The OATMEAL Survey. III. An Aligned Transiting Warm Brown Dwarf and Evidence for Quiescent Brown Dwarf Migration

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first measurement of the sky-projected orbital obliquity of a benchmark transiting brown dwarf host, HIP 33609, as a part of the Orbital Architectures of Transiting Massive Exoplanets And Low-mass stars (OATMEAL) survey. HIP 33609 b is a highly eccentric, 68 $M_{\rm J}$ brown dwarf orbiting a 10,300 K, A-type star with an orbital period of 39 days. Its host star is a known member of the 150 Myr old MELANGE-6 moving group, making it an excellent laboratory for testing sub-stellar evolutionary models. Using in-transit spectra collected by the Planet Finder Spectrograph (PFS) on the Magellan II Clay 6.5 m telescope, we measured a sky-projected orbital obliquity of $|\lambda|= 12.7 \pm 1.3$°. The mass of the brown dwarf is most consistent with a stellar-like fragmentation formation history followed by a period of migration. Given the high eccentricity ($e=0.557$) but low orbital obliquity of the brown dwarf, we claim that coplanar high eccentricity tidal migration seems to be the most plausible pathway, however, it remains difficult to conclusively rule out other migration mechanisms. The low orbital obliquity for HIP 33609 is consistent with previous measurements of high mass-ratio companions, and bears a striking resemblance to the obliquity distribution of transiting warm Jupiters. We suggest brown dwarfs may follow a dynamically quiescent migration pathway, consistent with them forming in isolated conditions.

          Constraints on the Thompson optical depth to the CMB from the Lyman-$α$ forest

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first constraints on the electron optical depth to reionization, $\tau_{\mathrm{e}}$, from the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest alone for physically motivated reionization models that match the reionization's end-point, $z_{\rm{end}}$, required by the same astrophysical probe, and for symmetric reionization models with fixed duration, $\Delta z$, commonly adopted in CMB reionization analyses. Compared to traditional estimates from the latter, the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest traces the ionization state of the IGM through its coupling with the thermal state. We find an explicit mapping between the two solving the chemistry and temperature evolution equations for hydrogen and helium. Our results yield $\tau_{\mathrm{e}}$=$0.042^{+0.047}_{-0.02}$ (95% C.L) and $\tau_{\mathrm{e}}$=$0.042^{+0.024}_{-0.015}$ for reionization models with $z_{\rm{end}}$ and $\Delta z$-fixed, respectively, disfavoring a high $\tau_{\mathrm{e}}$=0.09 by 2.57$\sigma$ and 4.31$\sigma$. With mock Lyman-$\alpha$ forest data that mimics the precision of future larger quasar sample datasets, we would potentially obtain tighter $\tau_{\mathrm{e}}$ constraints and exclude such a high $\tau_{\mathrm{e}}$ with a higher significance, paving the way for novel constraints on the epoch of reionization from a large-scale structure probe independent of the CMB.

          What's in Your Transit? Towards Reliably Getting $5\times$ More Science from Exoplanet Transit Data

 - **Abstract**
 Exoplanetary science heavily relies on transit depth ($D$) measurements. Yet, as instrumental precision increases, the uncertainty on $D$ appears to increasingly drift from expectations driven solely by photon-noise. Here we characterize this shortfall (the Transit-Depth Precision Problem, TDPP), by defining an amplification factor, $A$, quantifying the discrepancy between the measured transit-depth uncertainty and the measured baseline scatter on a same time bin size. While in theory $A$ should be $\sim\sqrt{3}$, we find that it can reach values $\gtrsim$10 notably due to correlations between $D$ and the limb-darkening coefficients (LDCs). This means that (1) the performance of transit-based exoplanet studies (e.g., atmospheric studies) can be substantially improved with reliable priors on LDCs and (2) low-fidelity priors on the LDCs can yield substantial biases on $D$--potentially affecting atmospheric studies due to the wavelength-dependence of such biases. For the same reason, biases may emerge on stellar-density and planet-shape/limb-asymmetry measurements. With current photometric precisions, we recommend using a 3$^{\rm rd}$-order polynomial law and a 4$^{\rm th}$-order non-linear law, as they provide an optimal compromise between bias and $A$, while testing the fidelity for each parametrization. While their use combined with existing LDC priors (10-20% uncertainty) currently implies $A\sim10$, we show that targeted improvements to limb-darkening models can bring $A$ down to $\sim2$. Improving stellar models and transit-fitting practices is thus essential to fully exploit transit datasets, and reliably increasing their scientific yield by $5\times$, thereby enabling the same science with up to $25\times$ fewer transits.

 - **Abstract**
 Interpreting the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of astrophysical objects with physically motivated models is computationally expensive. These models require solving coupled differential equations in high-dimensional parameter spaces, making traditional fitting techniques such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo or nested sampling prohibitive. A key example is modeling non-thermal emission from blazar jets - relativistic outflows from supermassive black holes in Active Galactic Nuclei that are among the most powerful emitters in the Universe. To address this challenge, we employ machine learning to accelerate SED evaluations, enabling efficient Bayesian inference. We generate a large sample of lepto-hadronic blazar emission models and train a neural network (NN) to predict the photon spectrum with strongly reduced run time while preserving accuracy. As a proof of concept, we present an NN-based tool for blazar SED modeling, laying the groundwork for future extensions and for providing an open-access resource for the astrophysics community.

          SN 2025coe: A Triple-Peaked Calcium-Strong Transient from A White-Dwarf Progenitor

 SN 2025coe is a calcium-strong transient located at an extremely large projected offset $\sim$39.3 kpc from the center of its host, the nearby early-type galaxy NGC 3277 at a distance of $\sim$25.5 Mpc. In this paper, we present multi-band photometric and spectroscopic observations spanning $\sim$100 days post-discovery. Its multi-band light curves display three distinct peaks: (1) an initial peak at $t \approx 1.6$ days attributed to shock cooling emission, (2) a secondary peak of $M_{R, \, peak} \approx$ $-$15.8 mag at $t \approx 10.2$ days powered by radioactive decay, and (3) a late-time bump at $t \approx 42.8$ days likely caused by ejecta-circumstellar material/clump interaction. Spectral evolution of SN 2025coe reveals a fast transition to the nebular phase within 2 months, where it exhibits an exceptionally high [Ca II]/[O I] ratio larger than 6. Modeling of the bolometric light curve suggests an ejecta mass of $M_{\rm ej} = 0.29^{+0.14}_{-0.15} \, M_{\odot}$, a $^{56}$Ni mass of $M_{\rm ^{56}Ni} = 2.4^{+0.06}_{-0.05} \times 10^{-2} M_{\odot}$, and a progenitor envelope with mass $M_e = 1.4^{+6.9}_{-1.2} \times 10^{-3} \, M_{\odot}$ and radius $R_e = 13.5^{+64.1}_{-11.1} \, R_{\odot}$. The tidal disruption of a hybrid HeCO white dwarf (WD) by a low-mass CO WD provides a natural explanation for the low ejecta mass, the small fraction of $^{56}$Ni, and the presence of an extended, low-mass envelope.

 - **Abstract**
 Bayes factors have become a popular tool in exoplanet spectroscopy for testing atmosphere models against one another. We show that the commonly used method for converting these values into significance "sigmas" is invalid. The formula is neither justified nor recommended by its original paper, and overestimates the confidence of results. We use simple examples to demonstrate the invalidity and prior sensitivity of this approach. We review the standard Bayesian interpretation of the Bayes factor as an odds ratio and recommend its use in conjunction with the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) or Bayesian Predictive Information Criterion Simplified (BPICS) in future analyses (Python implementations are included) . As a concrete example, we refit the WASP-39 b NIRSpec transmission spectrum to test for the presence of SO$_2$. The prevalent, incorrect significance calculation gives $3.67\sigma$ whereas the standard Bayesian interpretation yields a null model probability $p(\mathcal{B}|y)=0.0044$. Surveying the exoplanet atmosphere literature, we find widespread use of the erroneous formula. In order to avoid overstating observational results and estimating observation times too low, the community should return to the standard Bayesian interpretation.

 - **Abstract**
 The Simons Observatory (SO) is a cosmic microwave background experiment with over 67,000 polarization-sensitive transition-edge sensor (TES) detectors currently installed for use in observations and plans to increase the total detector count to ${\sim}$98,000 detectors with the Advanced SO upgrade. The TES arrays are packaged into Universal Focal-Plane Modules (UFMs), which also contain the multiplexing readout circuit. Within a readout module, a DC/RF routing wafer provides a cold interface between the detectors and the readout multiplexing chips. Each routing wafer hosts twelve bias lines, which contain the ${\sim}$400 ${\mu}{\Omega}$ shunt resistors that are part of the TES bias circuitry. More than 70 routing wafers have been fabricated and tested both at room temperature and 100 mK before integration into UFMs. The lab measurements for all screened wafers have been compiled to show the distribution of measured average shunt resistance Rsh for each bias line, both across bias lines on a single routing wafer and across all routing wafers. The mean average shunt resistance for all wafers was found to be 396 ${\mu}{\Omega}$ with a standard deviation of 16 ${\mu}{\Omega}$, or ${\sim}$4%. For each wafer, we note good uniformity of average Rsh between bias lines, with a slight downward trend with increasing distance from the center of the wafer. The fabrication data collected at room temperature shows agreement with the cryogenic measurements of Rsh distribution.

 - **Abstract**
 The rapid appearance of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at $z\gtrsim7$ requires efficient pathways to form massive black hole seeds. We investigate whether annihilation of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) can alter primordial (Pop III.1) protostellar evolution sufficiently to enable formation of such `heavy'' seeds. Using the one-dimensional Geneva stellar-evolution code (GENEC) with an implemented Gould single-scatter capture module, we compute a grid of protostellar evolution models covering ambient WIMP mass densities $\rho_\chi=10^{12}$-$10^{16}\ \mathrm{GeV\,cm^{-3}}$, WIMP masses $m_\chi=30$-$3000\ \mathrm{GeV}$, spin-dependent cross sections $\sigma_{\rm SD}=10^{-42}$-$10^{-40}\ \mathrm{cm^2}$, and baryonic accretion rates $\dot{M_*}=(1-3)\times10^{-3}\, M_\odot \,{\rm yr}^{-1}$. We find a robust bifurcation of outcomes. For sufficiently high ambient dark matter density ($\rho_\chi\gtrsim5\times10^{14}\ \mathrm{GeV\,cm^{-3}}$) and capture efficiency ($\sigma_{\rm SD}\gtrsim10^{-41}\ \mathrm{cm^2}$) WIMP annihilation supplies enough energy to inflate protostars onto extended, cool (Hayashi-track) configurations that dramatically suppress ionizing feedback and permit uninterrupted growth to $\sim10^{5}\,M_\odot$. Lighter WIMPs and larger $\sigma_{\rm SD}$ favour earlier and stronger annihilation support; heavier WIMPs delay the effect. For our fiducial case, WIMP masses $<$3 TeV are essential for allowing growth to the supermassive regime, otherwise the protostar evolves to the compact, feedback-limited regime that results in `light'' seeds. These results indicate that, under plausible halo conditions, DM annihilation provides a viable channel for forming heavy black hole seeds.

          Inconsistencies of Tsallis Cosmology within Horizon Thermodynamics and Holographic Scenarios

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the cosmological implications of Tsallis entropy in two widely discussed settings: the Cai--Kim thermodynamic derivation of the Friedmann equations and the holographic dark energy (HDE) scenario with the Hubble scale as infrared cutoff. In both cases, the dynamics introduce a nonextensivity parameter $\delta$, with standard $\Lambda$CDM recovered for $\delta=1$. Previous studies have argued that only small deviations from extensivity are observationally allowed, typically constraining $|1 - \delta| \lesssim 10^{-3}$. In this work we go further and present, for the first time, a systematic consistency analysis across the entire expansion history. We show that even mild departures from $\delta=1$ lead to pathological behavior in the effective dark energy sector: its density becomes negative or complex, its equation of state diverges, or alternatively it contributes an unacceptably large early--time fraction that spoils radiation domination and violates BBN and CMB bounds. Our results sharpen and unify earlier hints of tension, providing a clear physical explanation in terms of corrections that grow uncontrollably with expansion rate toward the past. We conclude that, within both the Cai--Kim and HDE frameworks, viable cosmology is realized only in the extensive limit, effectively collapsing the models back to $\Lambda$CDM. More broadly, our findings call attention to the importance of dynamical consistency and cosmological viability tests when assessing nonextensive entropies as possible explanations of the Universe's dynamics.

          Searching for Ultra-light Dark Matter in Spatial Correlations of White Dwarf Structure

 - **Abstract**
 If dark matter is ultra-light and has certain Standard Model interactions, it can change the mass-radius relation of white dwarf stars. The coherence length of ultra-light dark matter imparts spatial correlations in deviations from the canonical mass-radius relation, and thus white dwarfs can be used to reconstruct the coherence length, or equivalently the particle mass, of the dark matter field. We simulate the observability of such spatial correlations accounting for realistic complications like variable hydrogen envelope thickness, dust, binaries, measurement noise, and distance uncertainties in DA white dwarfs. Using a machine learning approach on simulated data, we measure the dark matter field coherence length and find that large deviations from the mass-radius relation ($\sim10\%$ change in radius) are needed to produce an observable signal given realistic noise sources. We apply our spatial correlation measurement routine to the SDSS catalog of 10,207 DA white dwarfs. We detect a positive spatial correlation among white dwarfs at separations corresponding to a coherence length of $300\pm50$ pc, with an average Z-score of 85 for white dwarfs separated by less than this coherence length. We conclude that this signal is due to observational bias. The signal can be explained by an offset between measurements and theory for nearby cool white dwarfs, and the presence of few, low-temperature white dwarfs with noisy measurements at further distances. With future improvements in white dwarf models and measurement techniques, particularly for cool white dwarfs, this method can provide interesting constraints on ultra-light dark matter models.

 - **Abstract**
 Ices imprint strong absorption features in the near- and mid-infrared, but until recently they have been studied almost exclusively with spectroscopy toward small samples of bright sources. We show that JWST photometry alone can reveal and quantify interstellar ices and present a new open-source modeling tool, icemodels, to produce synthetic photometry of ices based on laboratory measurements. We provide reference tables indicating which filters are likely to be observably affected by ice absorption. Applying these models to NIRCam data of background stars behind Galactic Center (GC) clouds, and validating against NIRSpec spectra of Galactic disk sources, we find clear signatures of CO, H$_2$O, and CO$_2$ ices and evidence for excess absorption in the F356W filter likely caused by CH-bearing species such as methanol. The ice ratios differ between the Galactic disk and Center, with GC clouds showing a higher H$_2$O fraction. The large ice abundance in CO, H2O, and possibly complex molecules hints that the high complex molecule abundances observed in gas emission in the CMZ are driven by ice-phase chemistry in non-star-forming gas. Accounting for all likely ices, we infer that $>25%$ of the total carbon is frozen into CO ice in the GC, which exceeds the entire solar-neighborhood carbon budget. By assuming the freezeout fraction is the same in GC and disk clouds, we obtain a metallicity measurement indicating that $Z_GC\gtrsim2.5Z_\odot$. These results demonstrate that photometric ice measurements are feasible with JWST and capable of probing the metallicity structure of the cold interstellar medium.

 Aims. We aim to confirm and measure the mass of the transiting planet candidate around the K5V star TOI-2093, previously announced by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) project. Methods. We combined photometric data from 32 sectors between 2019 and 2024 with 86 radial velocity measurements obtained with the CARMENES spectrograph over a period of 2.4 years, along with a series of ground-based, broadband photometric monitoring campaigns to characterize the host star and the transiting planet candidate, as well as to search for additional planets in the system. Our data indicate that TOI-2093 is a main-sequence star located at a distance of 83 pc, with solar metallicity, and a rotation period of 43.8 +- 1.8 d. Results. We have confirmed the planetary nature of the TESS transiting planet candidate, named TOI-2093 c, through the detection of its Keplerian signal in the spectroscopic data. We measured a planetary radius of 2.30 +- 0.12 Rearth, a Neptune-like mass of 15.8 +- 3.7 Mearth, and an orbital period of 53.81149 +- 0.00017 d. This makes TOI-2093 c the smallest exoplanet known in the habitable zone of a main-sequence FGK star. Given its size and relatively high density, TOI-2093 c belongs to a class of planets with no analog in the Solar System. In addition, the CARMENES data revealed the presence of a second planet candidate with a minimum mass of 10.6 +- 2.5 Mearth and an orbital period of 12.836 +- 0.021 d. This inner planet, which we designated TOI-2093 b, shows no detectable photometric transit in the TESS light curves. The orbital planes of the two planets are misaligned by more than 1.6 deg despite the near 4:1 mean-motion resonance of their orbital periods.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the foreground interstellar medium along the line of sight and intracluster medium of $\omega$ Centauri ($\omega$ Cen) by measuring the equivalent width of Na I D absorptions from MUSE observations. The large line-of-sight velocity difference between $\omega$ Cen and the foreground enables us to separate Na I D absorption contributed from atomic gas in the interstellar and intracluster medium. We find that small-scale substructures in the foreground Na I D distribution correlate with differential reddening derived from photometric methods. Using an empirical Na I D equivalent width-reddening relation, we determine an average reddening of $E(B-V)=0.153\pm0.003$ mag within the half-light radius of $\omega$ Cen. However, the Na I D-inferred differential reddening is significantly larger than photometric estimates. This is likely due to scatter in the Na I D-reddening relation. We find no evidence for intracluster atomic gas from spectra of horizontal branch stars, as there is no significant Na I D absorption at $\omega$ Cen's systemic velocity. Given this non-detection, we place the strongest upper limit to date on the intracluster atomic gas column density in $\omega$ Cen of $\lesssim2.17 \times 10^{18}~\rm{cm^{-2}}$. We also estimate the ionized gas density from pulsar dispersion measure variations, which exceed the atomic gas limit by $\sim$50 times. Nevertheless, the strong correlation between dispersion measure and foreground Na I D suggests that much or all of this ionized gas resides in the foreground. Given ongoing mass loss from bright giant stars, our findings imply that the intracluster gas accumulation timescale is short, and gas removal in the cluster is likely not tied to stripping as $\omega$ Cen passes through the Galactic disk.

 - **Abstract**
 We present high-precision TESS photometry of V421 Peg (TIC 301747091), an early F-type eclipsing binary containing a candidate $\gamma$ Dor component. The observed short-cadence data allow the detection of pulsation signals, along with revision of the fundamental properties of the component stars. Detailed binary modeling indicated that the program target is a partially-eclipsing detached system in a circular orbit and that both components are currently in super-synchronous states. The radii of each star were measured with an accuracy of about 1 \%. By periodogram analysis of the outside-eclipse residual lights obtained from the binary star model, we extracted nine significant signals, five of which are likely aliasing frequencies due to sampling artifacts and uncorrected trends in the data used. The other signals of $f_1$, $f_2$, $f_3$, and $f_6$ are considered to be independent pulsations with frequencies ranging from 0.73 day$^{-1}$ to 1.02 day$^{-1}$, corresponding to pulsation constants of 0.63$-$0.88 days. These frequencies, pulsation constants, and position on the H-R diagram reveal that the pulsating signals are $\gamma$ Dor variables arising from the V421 Peg primary component.

 - **Abstract**
 Ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) are the most energetic particles ever detected. Cosmic rays that achieve the highest energies are rare, and their flux at Earth is extremely low. As a result, next-generation experiments with large effective areas are required and under development. The Fluorescence detector Array of Single-pixel Telescopes (FAST) is one such project. Although observation time is limited compared with ground particle detectors, it enables direct measurements of $X_\mathrm{max}$, a crucial parameter sensitive to the primary cosmic-ray composition. FAST will achieve large-area coverage by significantly reducing the cost of telescopes. This necessitates a simplified telescope compared to conventional designs. Demonstrating the feasibility of our telescope and observational method is essential. To validate the FAST concept, prototype telescopes have been deployed at the Pierre Auger Observatory and the Telescope Array experiment.

 - **Abstract**
 The discovery of supermassive black holes with masses $\gtrsim 10^9 M_\odot$ at redshifts $z\gtrsim 10$ challenges conventional formation scenarios based on baryonic accretion and mergers within the first few hundred million years. We propose an alternative channel in which ultralight scalar dark matter undergoes dark-to-black conversion via quasi-bound state depletion around black hole seeds. We estimate the accretion rate of the scalar field as a function of the boson mass parameter $\mu$ and the black hole mass $M_{\rm BH}$, and integrate this rate over cosmological timescales. Our results show that once a critical value of $\mu M_{\rm BH}$ is reached, scalar field accretion becomes highly efficient, enabling substantial black hole growth even from relatively small initial seed masses. For boson masses $\mu \sim 10^{-19}-10^{-16}\,\mathrm{eV}$, black hole seeds of $10^2-10^5 M_\odot$ can reach $10^6-10^8 M_\odot$ within $\sim 10^8$ yr. This dark-to-black mechanism provides a natural pathway for the rapid formation of massive black holes in the early universe, offering a potential probe of the microphysical nature of dark matter.

 - **Abstract**
 The solar atmosphere is permeated by various types of waves that originate from subsurface convection. As these waves propagate upward, they encounter they encounter a steep decrease in the density of the medium, leading to their steepening into shock waves. These shock waves typically exhibit a characteristic sawtooth pattern in wavelength-time ($\lambda$-t) plots of various chromospheric spectral lines, viz., H$\alpha$, Ca II 8542 Å to name a few. In this study, we investigate the propagation of shock waves in the lower solar atmosphere using coordinated observations from the Swedish 1-meter Solar Telescope (SST), the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS), and the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). Our analysis reveals that after forming in the chromosphere, these shock waves travel upward through the solar atmosphere, with their signatures detectable not only in the transition region but also in low coronal passbands. These shock waves dissipate their energy into the chromosphere as they propagate. In certain cases, the energy deposited by these waves is comparable to the radiative losses of the chromosphere, highlighting their potential role in chromospheric heating. Our findings reported here provide crucial insights into wave dynamics in the lower solar atmosphere and their contribution to the energy transport process in the chromosphere.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a spectroscopic and imaging analysis of the $z_{gal} \approx 1.1334$ ultra-strong MgII absorption system identified in the $VLT$/UVES spectrum of a background quasar located at $\rho \approx 18$ kpc from a star-forming galaxy. Low ionization metal lines like MgI, FeII, and CaII are also detected for this absorber. The HI lines are outside of the wavelength coverage. The MgII has a rest-frame equivalent width of $W_r(2796) =3.185 +/- 0.032 A^{\circ} $, with the absorption spread across $\Delta v \approx 460$ km~s$^{-1}$ in several components. A component-by-component ionization modeling shows several of these components having solar and higher metallicities. The models also predict a total HI column density of $log[N(HI)/cm^{-2}] \approx 22.5$, consistent with ultra-strong MgII absorbers being sub-Damped Lyman Alpha and Damped Lyman Alpha systems. The absorber is well within the virial radius of the nearest galaxy which has a stellar mass $M_* = 4.7 \times 10^{10}$~M$_\odot$, and a star formation rate of $\approx 8.3$~M$_\odot$~yr$^{-1}$. The absorption is along the projected major axis of the galaxy with a velocity spread that is wider than the galaxy's disk rotation. From the kinematic analysis of the absorber and the galaxy, the origin of the absorption can be attributed to a combination of circumgalactic gas structures, some corotating with the disk and the rest at line-of-sight velocities outside of the disk rotation.

 - **Abstract**
 The Habitable Zone (HZ) is defined by the possibility of sustaining liquid water on a planetary surface. In the Solar System, the HZ for a conservative climate model extends approximately between the orbits of Earth and Mars. We elaborate on earlier HZ models and apply an analytical climate model of the temperature distribution on tidally-locked planets to extend the HZ. We show that planets orbiting M- and K-dwarf stars may maintain liquid water on their night side, significantly closer to their host star than the inner border of the conservative HZ. We calculate the extended borders of the HZ in the flux-effective temperature diagram. This extension may explain the presence of water vapor and other volatile gases in the transmission spectra of warm Super-Earth-sized exoplanets closely orbiting M dwarfs, recently detected by JWST. We also mention the HZ extension outwards, due to subglacial liquid water in the form of intra-glacial lakes or subglacial melting.

 - **Abstract**
 We demonstrate that the extension of the Habitable Zone (HZ) due to the presence of liquid water on the night side of tidally locked planets, modelled in this and earlier works, significantly increases the number of potentially habitable planets. We calculate the occurrence of habitable planets orbiting M-, K-, and G-dwarf stars within the conservative and extended HZ, beyond the inner and outer boundaries of the conservative HZ. Integrating over the phase space in the HZ diagram and normalizing our calculation to relatively recent analyses of the Kepler data, we show that potentially habitable planets may be as much as 50 times more abundant than in the lower estimate, limited to the conservative HZ of G-type stars only. For an intermediate heat transport rate on tidally locked planets, we find that the extended HZ could imply more than one habitable planet per star, and hundreds of habitable planets within 10 pc from Earth.

 - **Abstract**
 The Hadrosymmetric Twin Higgs (HTH) model provides a natural solution to the little hierarchy problem by incorporating all three generations of quarks in a twin sector. Unlike other Twin Higgs scenarios, such as the Mirror Twin Higgs (MTH), the HTH framework avoids introducing additional light states or radiation and thus remains consistent with stringent bounds on the effective number of relativistic species, $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$. Its particle content and interactions also make it difficult to probe at colliders, highlighting the importance of cosmological tests. In this work, we study the cosmological implications of the HTH model, focusing on the persistent tensions in the Hubble constant ($H_0$) and the matter clustering amplitude ($\sigma_8$). Implementing the HTH sector in a Boltzmann code and confronting it with cosmic microwave background (CMB) data and local $H_0$ measurements, we find that the scenario reduces the Hubble tension from more than $4\sigma$ to about $2.5\sigma$, while also alleviating the $\sigma_8$ discrepancy. These results demonstrate that the HTH framework not only addresses naturalness in particle physics but also offers a viable route to mitigating current cosmological tensions, thereby strengthening the link between fundamental theory and precision cosmology.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the inflationary gravitational wave background induced by Abelian gauge fields generated by non-minimal kinetic and axial couplings to the inflaton. We show that the gravitational wave spectrum is scale invariant and derive its amplitude for generic gauge field coupling parameters, within the slow-roll approximation. We constrain the coupling values and the scale of inflation for which the induced gravitational wave background is observable, while ensuring that back-reaction on the inflationary dynamics remains negligible. We find that a sizeable axial coupling can boost this secondary gravitational wave signal above the standard inflationary background. In the course of our analysis, we also show how to analytically match tensor perturbations across an arbitrary number of eras with different equations of state.

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of the hard, bright X-ray emission that defines the gamma Cas analog class of Be stars remains an outstanding question in Be star literature. This work explores the possibility that the X-ray flux is produced by accretion onto a white dwarf companion. We use three-dimensional smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations to model the prototype gamma Cas system assuming a white dwarf companion and investigate the accretion of the circumstellar material by the secondary star. We contrast these results to a model for 59 Cyg, a non-gamma Cas Be star system with a stripped companion. We find that the secondary stars in both systems form disk-like accretion structures with Keplerian characteristics, similar to those seen in the Be decretion disks. We also find that white dwarf accretion can produce X-ray fluxes that are consistent with the observed values for gamma Cas, while the predicted X-ray luminosities are significantly lower for the non-degenerate companion in 59 Cyg. In addition, using the three-dimensional radiative transfer code, HDUST, we find that these models produce H-alpha emission consistent with the observations for both gamma Cas and 59 Cyg, and that the predicted polarization degrees across optical and UV wavelengths are at detectable levels. Finally, we discuss the impact that future UV spectropolarimetry missions could have on our understanding of these systems.

 - **Abstract**
 The black hole in the Galactic Center, Sgr A*, is prototypical for ultra-low-fed galactic nuclei. The discovery of a hand-full of gas clumps in the realm of a few Earth masses in its immediate vicinity provides a gas reservoir sufficient to power Sgr A*. In particular, the gas cloud G2 is of interest due to its extreme orbit, on which it passed at a pericenter distance of around 100 AU and notably lost kinetic energy during the fly-by due to the interaction with the black hole accretion flow. 13 years prior to G2, a resembling gas cloud called G1, passed Sgr A* on a similar orbit. The origin of G2 remained a topic of discussion, with models including a central (stellar) source still proposed as alternatives to pure gaseous clouds. Here, we report the orbit of a third gas clump moving again along (almost) the same orbital trace. Since the probability of finding three stars on close orbits is very small, this strongly argues against stellar-based source models. Instead, we show that the gas streamer G1-2-3 plausibly originates from the stellar wind of the massive binary star IRS16SW. This claim is substantiated by the fact that the small differences between the three orbits - the orientations of the orbital ellipses in their common plane as a function of time - are consistent with the orbital motion of IRS 16SW.

 - **Abstract**
 Signs of lightning on Venus have long been sought, including by space missions and ground-based telescopes searching for optical flashes, plasma waves, or radio signatures. These efforts have yielded conflicting findings regarding the presence or absence of lightning in Venus's atmosphere. In this study we adopt an indirect approach to constrain the prevalence of lightning on Venus, using the chemical by-products it produces in Venus's atmosphere. Nitric oxide (NO) is a key tracer species of lightning, being exclusively generated by lightning in Venus's lower atmosphere. By calculating the present rate of atmospheric destruction of NO in Venus's atmosphere through photochemical-kinetic modelling, we constrain the lightning power required to sustain the estimated NO abundances on modern Venus. The reported NO constraints require lightning to generate at-least three times the power released on Earth; consistent with either a higher rate of strikes, or greater energy per strike, or a combination of both. Limited detections of optical flashes within the clouds could point to lightning striking deeper in the atmosphere and nearer the surface -- with the result that its optical flashes are obscured by the clouds -- driven by triboelectric charging during volcanic eruptions or wind interactions with surface sediments. Our findings underscore the importance for future missions of confirming lightning on Venus, either by verifying the below-cloud NO abundance, or by detecting another unambiguous lightning signature, to provide the first definitive evidence of lightning on a rocky planet other than Earth.

 - **Abstract**
 The AdvCam is a next-generation camera for the Large-Sized Telescopes of the Cherenkov Tele- scope Array Observatory, based on silicon photomultipliers. Its fully digital readout system enables the design of new, sophisticated trigger logic. The Large-Sized Telescopes aim to cover the low-energy range of the cosmic gamma-ray spectrum, with a threshold starting at about 20 GeV, using the existing photomultiplier tube camera. The AdvCam, along with the new trigger logic, as shown by simulations, lowers the detectable energy threshold to 13 GeV. The proposed trigger logic has a multilevel structure. The first level involves fast coincidences among small pixel regions at a rate of approximately 1 GHz, while the second level processes all camera pixels within an approximately 10-nanosecond time window. Different families of machine learning algorithms optimized for FPGAs form the second-level trigger. In this work, we consider two main approaches: Deep Neural Networks and Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise, both running with latencies below 1 microsecond at a 1 MHz rate. This work provides a detailed description of the trigger chain and its performance, as studied through simulation.

 - **Abstract**
 Molecules are ubiquitous in space. They are necessary component in the creation of habitable planetary systems and can provide the basic building blocks of life. Solid-state processes are pivotal in the formation of molecules in space and surface diffusion in particular is a key driver of chemistry in extraterrestrial environments, such as the massive clouds in which stars and planets are formed and the icy objects within our Solar System. However, for many atoms and molecules quantitative theoretical and experimental information on diffusion, such as activation barriers, are lacking. This hinders us in unraveling chemical processes in space and determining how the chemical ingredients of planets and life are formed. In this article, an astrochemical perspective on diffusion is provided. Described are the relevant adsorbate-surface systems, the methods to model their chemical processes, and the computational and laboratory techniques to determine diffusion parameters, including the latest developments in the field. While much progress has been made, many astrochemically relevant systems remain unexplored. The complexity of ice surfaces, their temperature-dependent restructuring, and effects at low temperatures create unique challenges that demand innovative experimental approaches and theoretical frameworks. This intersection of astrochemistry and surface science offers fertile ground for physical chemists to apply their expertise. We invite the physical chemistry community to explore these systems, where precise diffusion parameters would dramatically advance our understanding of molecular evolution in space - from interstellar clouds to planetary surfaces - with implications on our understanding on the origins of life and planetary habitability.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the fourth data release of JADES, the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey, providing deep spectroscopic observations in the two GOODS fields. A companion paper presents the target selection, spectroscopic redshifts and success rates, and in this paper, we discuss the data reduction and present emission line flux measurements. The spectroscopy in this work consists of medium-depth, deep and ultradeep NIRSpec/MSA spectra of 5,190 targets, covering the spectral range $0.6\text{--}5.5$~\mum and observed with both the low-dispersion prism ($R=30\text{--}300$) and all three medium-resolution gratings ($R=500\text{--}1,500$). We describe the data reduction, analysis and description of the data products included in this data release. In total, we measured 3,297 robust redshifts out of 5,190 targets, spanning a redshift range from $z=0.5$ up to $z=14.2$, including 974 at $z>4$. This data release includes 1-d and 2-d fully reduced spectra with 3 and 5 pixel extractions, with slit-loss corrections and background subtraction optimized for point sources. Furthermore, we provide redshifts and $S/N>5$ emission-line flux catalogues for the prism and grating spectra, as well as new guidelines to use these data products. Lastly, we are launching a new JADES Online Database, designed to enable quick selection and browsing of this data release. Altogether, these data provide the largest statistical sample to date to characterise the properties of galaxy populations across Cosmic time.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Low- and intermediate-mass giants undergo a complex chemical evolution that has yet to be observationally probed. The influence of core helium flash on the chemical composition of stellar atmospheres has been an open question since its theoretical prediction 60 years ago. Aims. Based on high-resolution spectral observations of 44 open star clusters in the Gaia-ESO survey, our aim is to perform the first large-scale homogeneous investigation into the carbon and nitrogen photospheric content of low- and intermediate-mass giant stars in different phases of evolution. Methods. We determined carbon and nitrogen abundances using spectral synthesis of the C2 Swan (1,0) band head at 5135 Å and C2 Swan (0,1) band head at 5635.5 Å, 12C14N bands in the interval 6470 - 6490 Å, and the forbidden [O i] line at 6300.31 Å. Results. We revealed differences in C/N abundance ratios between pre- and post-core-He-flash stars. The lower C/N ratios in core He-burning red clump stars are mainly due to the enhancement of nitrogen abundances. We presented calibrations of the relationship between [C/N] and stellar age for solar metallicity low- and intermediate-mass giants taking into account different evolutionary stages. Conclusions. The C/N abundance ratios in the investigated first-ascent giant stars are slightly less affected by the first dredge-up than predicted by the theoretical models. The rotation-induced extra mixing is not as efficient as theoretically predicted. The core helium flash may trigger additional alterations in carbon and nitrogen abundances that are not yet theoretically modelled. We found that the evolutionary stage of stars must be taken into account when using [C/N] as an age indicator.

 - **Abstract**
 Pulsars are spinning neutron stars typically observed as pulses emitted at radio wavelengths. These pulsations exhibit a rotational stability that rival the best atomic clocks, making pulsars one of the most important tools for resolving gravitational phenomena in extreme environments. I will present an overview of the ways in which radio pulsars can be used to test strong-field gravity and observe gravitational radiation, both in the context of historical and ongoing experiments. I will also describe how these measurements can be translated to sought-after quantities like the masses and moments of inertia of neutron stars.

 - **Abstract**
 The Trans-Iron Galactic Element Recorder for the International Space Station (TIGERISS) is under construction and is planned for launch in 2027 and will be attached at the SOX location on the Columbus module on the ISS. TIGERISS will make the first definitive measurements of Ultra-Heavy Galactic Cosmic Rays (UHGCRs; Z >29) on an individual element basis past barium ($^{56}$Ba), through the lanthinides, and to lead ($^{82}$Pb). TIGERISS has a geometry factor of 1.06 m$^2$ sr and is comprised of four planes of single-sided silicon strip detectors (SSDs) arranged in orthogonal X-Y layers with an X-Y pair above and an X-Y pair below two large-area Cherenkov detectors. The top Cherenkov detector is comprised of a mosaic of aerogel radiators (n =1.05) while the bottom Cherenkov detector has an acrylic radiator (n = 1.49). The combination of the Cherenkov velocity measurements with the precise measurements of the ionization and trajectory of the traversing cosmic rays leads to highly accurate charge measurements of $<$ 0.25 c.u. over the entire elemental range of $^5$B through $^{82}$Pb. These TIGERISS measurements are highly sensitive in determining the strength of s-process, r-process, and rp-processes of Galactic nucleosynthesis while providing critical data needed for multi-messenger studies to determine the contributions of extreme phenomena, including supernovae (SN) and Neutron Star Mergers (NSMs), in the production of galactic matter. The science goals of TIGERISS, mission status, instrument design and performance of the TIGERISS SSD subsystem in relation to the measurements and science goals of TIGERISS are discussed in this paper.

          CosmoUiT: A Vision Transformer-UNet Hybrid for Fast and Accurate Emulation of 21-cm Maps from the Epoch of Reionization

 - **Abstract**
 The observation of the redshifted 21-cm signal from the intergalactic medium will probe the epoch of reionization (EoR) with unprecedented detail. Various simulations are being developed and used to predict and understand the nature and morphology of this signal. However, these simulations are computationally very expensive and time-consuming to produce in large numbers. To overcome this problem, an efficient field-level emulator of this signal is required. However, the EoR 21-cm signal is highly non-Gaussian; therefore, capturing the correlations between different scales of this signal, which is directly related to the evolution of the reionization, with the neural network is quite difficult. Here, we introduce CosmoUiT, a UNet integrated vision transformer-based architecture, to overcome these difficulties. CosmoUiT emulates the 3D cubes of 21-cm signal from the EoR, for a given input dark matter density field, halo density field, and reionization parameters. CosmoUiT uses the multi-head self-attention mechanism of the transformer to capture the long-range dependencies and convolutional layers in the UNet to capture the small-scale variations in the target 21-cm field. Furthermore, the training of the emulator is conditioned on the input reionization parameters such that it gives a fast and accurate prediction of the 21-cm field for different sets of input reionization parameters. We evaluate the predictions of our emulator by comparing various statistics (e.g., bubble size distribution, power spectrum) and morphological features of the emulated and simulated maps. We further demonstrate that this vision transformer-based architecture can emulate the entire 3D 21-cm signal cube with high accuracy at both large and small scales.

 - **Abstract**
 A number of cosmic shear studies have reported results that are in mild tension with the Planck cosmic microwave measurement. To explore if this can be caused by biases in the shear estimation, we revisit the analysis of data from the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS) using an alternative shape measurement pipeline that is more robust to uncertainties in the calibration. To this end, we present an implementation of MetaCalibration, and compare its performance to that of lensfit, which has been used in previous analyses of these data. We find that the multiplicative bias is reduced, especially for the most distant redshifts, as derived from multi-band image simulations designed to match the KiDS data (SURFS-based KiDS-Legacy-Like Simulations: SKiLLS). For all tomographic bins we obtain a multiplicative bias $|m|<0.017$, with negligible additive bias. Importantly, the calibration has a negligible sensitivity to key galaxy properties. The resulting robust shear estimates were used to obtain cosmological parameter constraints. We find that the parameter $S_8\equiv \sigma_8 \sqrt{\Omega_\mathrm{m}/0.3} =0.789_{-0.024}^{+0.020}$ is consistent with the previous KiDS-1000 lensfit constraint of $S_8=0.776^{+0.029 +0.002}_{-0.027-0.003}$ (statistical + systematic errors). Thanks to the higher effective source density, the constraining power is improved by about 28%. The difference in $S_8$ with the Planck value remains at a similar level, 1.8$\sigma$, implying that it is not caused by the shear measurements.

 - **Abstract**
 Kilonovae are the scientifically rich, but observationally elusive, optical transient phenomena associated with compact binary mergers. Only a handful of events have been discovered to date, all through multi-wavelength (gamma ray) and multi-messenger (gravitational wave) signals. Given their scarcity, it is important to maximise the discovery possibility of new kilonova events. To this end, we present our follow-up observations of the gravitational-wave signal, S250818k, a plausible binary neutron star merger at a distance of $237 \pm 62$ Mpc. Pan-STARRS tiled 286 and 318 square degrees (32% and 34% of the 90% sky localisation region) within 3 and 7 days of the GW signal, respectively. ATLAS covered 70% of the skymap within 3 days, but with lower sensitivity. These observations uncovered 47 new transients; however, none were deemed to be linked to S250818k. We undertook an expansive follow-up campaign of AT 2025ulz, the purported counterpart to S250818k. The griz-band lightcurve, combined with our redshift measurement ($z = 0.0849 \pm 0.0003$) all indicate that SN 2025ulz is a SN IIb, and thus not the counterpart to S250818k. We rule out the presence of a AT 2017gfo-like kilonova within $\approx 27$% of the distance posterior sampled by our Pan-STARRS pointings ($\approx 9.1$% across the total 90% three-dimensional sky localisation). We demonstrate that early observations are optimal for probing the distance posterior of the three-dimensional gravitational-wave skymap, and that SN 2025ulz was a plausible kilonova candidate for $\lesssim 5$ days, before ultimately being ruled out.

 - **Abstract**
 The diffuse supernova neutrino background (DSNB) created by stellar core-collapses throughout cosmic history is on the verge of discovery, with SK-Gd showing early deviations from the background expectation and JUNO starting to take data. However, the interpretation of early DSNB data will face significant challenges due to degeneracies between astrophysical parameters and uncertainties in supernova neutrino modeling. We explore how complementary astronomical observations can break these degeneracies and, in this context, we investigate whether early DSNB observations can constrain invisible supernovae, which have no optical emission but are powerful neutrino sources before being swallowed by a forming black hole. Leveraging the differences in the spectra between invisible and visible supernovae, we estimate the sensitivity of 1) detecting the existence of invisible supernovae, and 2) determining the fraction of invisible supernovae. Finally, we discuss how these conclusions depend on the spectral parameters of the black hole-forming component.

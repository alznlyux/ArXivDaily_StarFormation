- **Abstract**
 A deep, space-based, all-sky near-infrared survey carried out with the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope would constitute a foundational astronomical infrastructure for decades to come. In this white paper, we present a concrete and feasible path to imaging the entire sky at $\sim0.1''$ resolution, beginning with high-impact fields in Cycle 1 and scaling to ultra-wide coverage within the nominal mission. This first-epoch survey will reach $\mathrm{H}\sim25.5$ AB mag (5$\sigma$) and maximize synergies with contemporaneous observatories, while preserving substantial time for other ambitious Roman programs. We outline representative scheduling scenarios and an example Cycle 1 program that triples early Roman-LSST overlap and delivers high-value community data products such as LSST forced photometry, joint \textit{Gaia}-Roman astrometry, and catalogs of Galactic substructure, stong lenses, and other rare systems. The Cycle 1 program will lay the foundation for an eventual all-sky survey, while also delivering high-impact early science. We invite broad community participation in shaping and carrying out both the initial program and the long-term vision of an all-sky Roman survey.

- **Abstract**
 We present a radio-continuum survey of the LMC using the MeerKAT telescope, describe the full-Stokes products included in the first data release, and highlight some initial results. The observations are centred at 1.3 GHz with a bandwidth of 0.8 GHz. The imaging products comprise six fields of view, each encompassing $\sim$5$^\circ$ $\times$ 5$^\circ$ with the resulting images achieving a resolution of 8". The median broad-band Stokes~I image root-mean-square noise value is $\sim$11 $\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$. The survey enables a variety of astrophysical studies, which we showcase with the presentation of a few findings. Within the LMC we identify a new supernova remnant candidate; present planetary nebulae and Wolf-Rayet stars without previous radio detections; and show the MeerKAT view of the well-known star-forming region 30 Doradus. We also present some examples of interesting foreground and background sources in the field, including the AB~Dor multiple-star system, a radio ring galaxy, a possible Odd Radio Circle, and a remarkable bent-tail radio galaxy.

- **Abstract**
 Context. Stellar ages are typically very difficult to estimate for field stars. New empirical methods, based on abundance ratios of chemical elements, are emerging and need to be calibrated. Aims. Our main aim is to contribute to revealing relations between [C/N] and [Y/Mg] ratios and stellar ages by determining astroseismic ages and non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) abundances, and accounting for stellar evolutionary stages and birth places in the Galaxy. Methods. We searched for solar pulsations in a sample of 1250 bright F, G, and K giants using data from the TESS space telescope and determined asteroseismic ages using the BASTA and PARAM codes. For the [Y/Mg] relations with age, we determined abundances accounting for deviations from the local thermodynamic equilibrium. For the [C/N] relations with age, we separated stars according to their evolutionary stages. Results. We determined asteroseismic ages for 218 giants and derived [Y/Mg] and [C/N] relations with age for subsamples of stars in three regions of the Galactic thin disc and the thick disc. Conclusions. The [Y/Mg]-age relation exhibits a clear radial dependence across the Galactic disc, with a steeper trend in the outer disc, progressively flatter relations towards the inner disc, and a very flat trend in the thick disc. NLTE abundances of Mg and especially of Y have to be used in order to obtain a more precise stellar age evaluation from [Y/Mg] ratios. When using [C/N] abundance ratios as stellar age indicators, evolutionary stages of stars have to be taken into account.

- **Abstract**
 We present independent imaging analyses of Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations of the active galactic nuclei in radio galaxy Centaurus~A and quasar 3C~279 using Generative Deep learning Image Reconstruction with Closure Terms (GenDIReCT), a recently developed machine-learning framework built on conditional diffusion models that uses interferometric closure invariants as primary observables. For Centaurus~A, our reconstruction reveals two prominent emission ridges ($\simeq 80\,\mu$as each) along the jet sheath with a brightness ratio of $1.4\pm 0.1$ and an opening angle of $12.3\pm 0.3$~deg. For 3C~279, we identify three distinct components in the image, with the southern jet ejecta on sub-parsec scale exhibiting a proper motion of $4.6\pm 1.0\,\mu$as over $\approx 5.39$ days away from the northern components, corresponding to an apparent superluminal velocity of $\simeq 10\pm 2$ times light speed. These measurements are consistent with those reported by the EHT Collaboration. The results are significant because we demonstrate that: (1) imaging from interferometric aperture synthesis data, especially in VLBI and most acutely in extremely sparse arrays like the EHT, remains a severely ill-posed and challenging inverse problem, yet closure invariants preserve robust morphological information that can strongly constrain structural features, and (2) more importantly, closure-invariant imaging largely avoids calibration systematics, thus providing a fundamentally independent view of spatial structure with very high angular resolution. The generative nature of GenDIReCT further allows us to sample and characterise clusters of plausible image solutions for each dataset. As a calibration-independent, generative imaging approach, GenDIReCT offers a robust and truly independent blind-imaging tool for current and future VLBI experiments.

          CALIMA: On-the-fly dust and PAH evolution for radiation-hydrodynamics galaxy formation simulations

- **Abstract**
 Dust grains and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) actively contribute to the thermodynamics, chemistry, and radiative state of the interstellar medium (ISM), yet most ISM models and galaxy simulations either exclude them altogether or adopt simplified treatments. We present CALIMA, a new module for dust and PAH formation and evolution in radiation-hydrodynamics simulations for RAMSES, designed to self-consistently couple dust physics to radiative transfer and non-equilibrium thermochemistry in a multiphase ISM. The model employs a two-size, two-composition dust framework with log-normal grain populations, explicitly evolving stellar dust injection, turbulence-informed gas-phase accretion, shattering, coagulation, thermal and non-thermal sputtering, and shock destruction, while PAHs are separate components with their own evolution. The evolving dust populations and radiation field determine local, wavelength-dependent opacities, photoelectric heating efficiencies, grain-assisted recombination, dust-gas collisional heating/cooling, and H$_2$ formation on both grains and PAHs. Updated treatments of thermal sputtering and collisional cooling that include finite grain sizes and modern ion-solid physics reduce sputtering rates at high temperatures and extend the regime where dust significantly cools hot gas. One-zone ISM tests show that dust and PAH evolution modifies classical thermal phase diagrams and C-bearing chemistry, while isolated disc galaxy simulations reveal environment-dependent variations in dust-to-metal ratio, small-to-large grain ratio, PAH fraction, and interstellar radiation field intensity that drive non-trivial structure in infrared emission, UV transparency, and H$_2$ formation. CALIMA provides a physically motivated framework to interpret dust- and PAH-based observables and to assess dust-mediated feedback in galaxy formation across cosmic time.

- **Abstract**
 A common task in astronomical research is to estimate the physical parameters (temperature, mass, density etc.) of a gas by using observed line emission. This often requires a calculation of how the radiation propagates via emission and absorption (so-called radiative transfer). In radio and infrared astronomy, the Fortran code RADEX (van der Tak et al., 2007) is a popular tool to solve the non-LTE radiative transfer of a uniform medium in a simplified geometry. I present pythonradex, a Python re-implementation of RADEX. Written in Python, it provides an easy and intuitive user interface, improved performance as well as additional functionality not included in RADEX, such as continuum effects and overlapping lines. In addition, pythonradex provides a self-consistent computation of the total flux for all geometries, including spherical geometries.

- **Abstract**
 A significant fraction of stars in both the Galactic field and stellar clusters are members of binary systems. Understanding their properties is therefore essential for a comprehensive view of stellar structure, evolution, and cluster dynamics. Despite extensive studies of cluster binaries, key issues remain unresolved, particularly for photometric binaries among low-mass stars. While the binary fraction in the field strongly depends on stellar mass, cluster studies have generally suggested an approximately constant fraction over the limited mass ranges explored. In addition, the mass function (MF) of very low-mass stars is still poorly constrained in clusters older than a few hundred Myr. We use deep Hubble Space Telescope imaging of the intermediate-age open cluster NGC 2158 to investigate its binary population and derive the luminosity and MFs down to ~0.14 solar masses, enabling the first detailed analysis of binaries in this cluster. We measure a global binary fraction of 38%, consistent with other open clusters, and find a clear mass dependence: it decreases from ~52% at 1.0 solar masses to ~11% at 0.2 solar masses. This trend mirrors that of Galactic field stars, suggesting similar binary properties. The MF is characterized by three regimes: high-mass stars (alpha= -2.49 +- 0.19), low-mass stars (alpha= -1.11 +- 0.09), and very low-mass stars (alpha= -0.08 +- 0.07). The slope change near 1.0 solar mass agrees with recent surveys, though we find a deficit below ~0.3 solar masses. We also detect a main-sequence discontinuity around ~0.3 solar masses, possibly linked to the 3He-driven instability predicted by stellar models and analogous to the Jao Gap seen in nearby field stars.

- **Abstract**
 Mira stars are popular with amateur astronomers because they are generally bright and their pulsations produce large changes in brightness. This also means they are eminently suitable to study using spectroscopy. We report here on spectroscopic observations of five Mira stars: RY Cep, SU Cam, T Cep, V667 Cas and OR Cep. We describe the lifecycle of a Mira star and explain how the carbon-oxygen balance in its atmosphere determines its spectral classification. Atmospheric pulsations in these stars produce shocks which generate Balmer emission. We present graphically their different spectral behaviours and development of emission lines.

- **Abstract**
 We update and expand the MESA Isochrones and Stellar Tracks (MIST) database to include variations in the alpha-capture elements, specifically [alpha/Fe]=-0.2, 0, +0.2, +0.4, and +0.6 for -3 <= [Fe/H] <= +0.5. Variations in [alpha/Fe] are included in a self-consistent manner from the stellar interior models to the synthetic spectra used to translate these models in the observational plane. We describe a number of updates to the physics utilized in these models as well as new information provided by the models. We validate the models with comparisons to other stellar evolution models including the previous generation of MIST and other models from the literature. MIST data products including stellar evolutiont tracks, isochrones, and bolometric correction tables can be obtained from the MIST project website, this https URL. All necessary files to reproduce MIST models are available from Zenodo.

          Dynamical masses of YSOs with the VLBA: DYNAMO VLBA: Trigonometric parallaxes and proper motions of YSOs in Orion

- **Abstract**
 We present results from a multi-epoch Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) survey of compact radio sources in the Orion complex, conducted within both the DYNAMO-VLBA and the GOBELINS projects. Our observations detected 216 compact radio sources, of which 58 yielded reliable multi-epoch astrometric solutions. For these sources, we derived trigonometric parallaxes and proper motions with typical precisions of about 0.05 mas and 0.10 mas yr$^{-1}$, respectively. The measured parallaxes range between 2.26 and 2.65 mas, corresponding to distances of 380 - 440 pc, and delineate the depth of the Orion star-forming complex. We determine mean distances of $405\pm16$ pc for NGC 2068, $403\pm5$ pc for NGC 2024, $407\pm12$ pc for the $\sigma$ Orionis region, $388.5\pm1.7$ pc for the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC), and $438\pm12$ pc for L1641. A comparison with Gaia DR3 astrometry for 28 common sources reveals negligible mean parallax offsets ($\Delta\varpi=-0.02\pm0.01$ mas) and small systematic differences in proper motions ($\sim$0.07 mas yr$^{-1}$), likely due to residual rotation of the Gaia reference frame. Our results demonstrate the capability of high-precision radio astrometry to map embedded stellar populations and to provide an independent calibration of the Gaia reference system in obscured regions.

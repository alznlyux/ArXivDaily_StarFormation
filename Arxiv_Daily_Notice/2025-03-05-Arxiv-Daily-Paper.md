 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational time delays offer unique, independent measurements of the Hubble constant, $H_0$. Precise measurements of $H_0$ stand as one of the most pressing challenges in modern cosmology, and to do so with time delays requires precise lens models. While much work has focused on streamlining the modeling process to keep pace with the erumpent discovery of strongly-lensed systems, a critical step toward reducing uncertainty in $H_0$ comes from increasing the precision of individual lens models themselves. In this work, we demonstrate that the unprecedented imaging capabilities of JWST make this goal attainable. We present the first lens model for time-delay cosmography derived from JWST data, applied to the quadruply-imaged quasar WFI2033--4723. While the primary source of systematic uncertainty in time-delay cosmography is currently the mass-sheet degeneracy (MSD), the sensitivity of models to this MSD varies on how the point spread function (PSF) errors are mitigated. As the PSF is also the primary source of uncertainty in lens modeling, we focus on a comparison of different PSF modeling methods. Within the context of power-law models, we recover results in agreement with previous Hubble Space Telescope (HST)-based models, but with better precision of key lensing parameters through implementation of new PSF modeling techniques. Despite the record-holding precision of this system's HST modeling, we achieve an additional 22% increase in precision of the Fermat potential difference, directly reducing uncertainties of cosmological inference. These results would produce a 3% ($1\sigma$ of the modeling error) shift of $H_0$ towards a higher value for this lens, keeping all else constant. This work substantiates the groundbreaking potential of JWST for time-delay cosmography and lays the groundwork for modeling systems previously too faint to provide meaningful constraints on $H_0$.

 - **Abstract**
 The simplest inflationary models predict the primordial power spectrum (PPS) of curvature perturbations to be nearly scale-invariant. However, various other models of inflation predict deviations from this behaviour, motivating a data-driven approach to reconstruct the PPS and constrain its shape. In this work, we present a novel method that employs a fully differentiable pipeline to reconstruct the PPS using Gaussian Processes and uses neural network emulators for fast and differentiable theoretical predictions. By leveraging gradient-based sampling techniques, such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, our approach efficiently samples the high-dimensional parameter space of cosmological parameters and the free-form PPS, enabling joint constraints on both. Applying this framework to Planck 2018 Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) temperature anisotropy data we find our reconstructed PPS to be consistent with near scale-invariance on small scales, while exhibiting large uncertainties at large scales, driven mostly by cosmic variance. Our results show an overestimation of the PPS amplitude compared to $\Lambda$CDM predictions from the Planck 2018 analysis, which we attribute to our choice of a conservative prior on the optical depth $\tau$ based on Planck 2015 measurements. Adopting a prior consistent with Planck 2018 measurements brings our results into full agreement with previous work. To ensure robustness of our results, we validate our differentiable pipeline against a non-differentiable framework, and also demonstrate that our results are insensitive to the choice of Gaussian process hyperparameters. These promising results and the flexibility of our pipeline make it ideally suited for application to additional data sets such as CMB polarisation as well as Large-Scale Structure probes, thus moving towards multi-probe primordial power spectrum reconstruction.

 - **Abstract**
 One of the main challenges in modeling massive stars to the onset of core collapse is the computational bottleneck of nucleosynthesis during advanced burning stages. The number of isotopes formed requires solving a large set of fully-coupled stiff ordinary differential equations (ODEs), making the simulations computationally intensive and prone to numerical instability. To overcome this barrier, we design a nuclear neural network (NNN) framework with multiple hidden layers to emulate nucleosynthesis calculations and conduct a proof-of-concept to evaluate its performance. The NNN takes the temperature, density and composition of a burning region as input and predicts the resulting isotopic abundances along with the energy generation and loss rates. We generate training sets for initial conditions corresponding to oxygen core depletion and beyond using large nuclear reaction networks, and compare the predictions of the NNNs to results from a commonly used small net. We find that the NNNs improve the accuracy of the electron fraction by $280-660\:\%$ and the nuclear energy generation by $250-750\:\%$, consistently outperforming the small network across all timesteps. They also achieve significantly better predictions of neutrino losses on relatively short timescales, with improvements ranging from $100-10^{6}\:\%$. While further work is needed to enhance their accuracy and applicability to different stellar conditions, integrating NNN trained models into stellar evolution codes is promising for facilitating large-scale generation of core-collapse supernova (CCSN) progenitors with higher physical fidelity.

          Impacts of Dynamical Dark Energy on the Neutrino Mass Constraints

 - **Abstract**
 The difference between the total neutrino mass estimates ($\sum m_\nu$) derived from cosmological data within the standard $\Lambda$CDM model and those obtained from terrestrial particle physics experiments underscores the need to explore alternative scenarios. Recent analyses have shown that a dynamic dark energy modeled by the CPL parameterization of the dark energy equation of state (EoS) can ease the constraints on $\sum m_\nu$, thus alleviating this tension. This study investigates the robustness of this discrepancy by assessing the extent to which the CPL assumption influences the results. We examine how other EoS parameterizations, such as the Barboza-Alcaniz (BA) and Jassal-Bagla-Padmanabhan (JBP) parameterizations, affect $\sum m_\nu$ estimates. We perform a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis combining the latest baryon acoustic oscillation data from DESI with the Planck 2018 cosmic microwave background data, which includes information on temperature, polarization, and lensing, as well as the Pantheon+ Type Ia supernovae observations. While both the BA and JBP parameterizations can also resolve the tension, our results show a correlation between the dark energy EoS and the constraints on neutrino mass.

 - **Abstract**
 Neural posterior estimation (NPE), a type of amortized variational inference, is a computationally efficient means of constructing probabilistic catalogs of light sources from astronomical images. To date, NPE has not been used to perform inference in models with spatially varying covariates. However, ground-based astronomical images have spatially varying sky backgrounds and point spread functions (PSFs), and accounting for this variation is essential for constructing accurate catalogs of imaged light sources. In this work, we introduce a method of performing NPE with spatially varying backgrounds and PSFs. In this method, we generate synthetic catalogs and semi-synthetic images for these catalogs using randomly sampled PSF and background estimates from existing surveys. Using this data, we train a neural network, which takes an astronomical image and representations of its background and PSF as input, to output a probabilistic catalog. Our experiments with Sloan Digital Sky Survey data demonstrate the effectiveness of NPE in the presence of spatially varying backgrounds and PSFs for light source detection, star/galaxy separation, and flux measurement.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a catalog of uniformly processed 3.6-$\mu$m and 4.5-$\mu$m band exoplanet thermal phase curves based on Infrared Array Camera observations obtained from the Spitzer Heritage Archive. The catalog includes phase curve measurements for 34 planets, 16 of which contain full orbit coverage and have detectable secondary eclipses in both channels. The data are processed in the EXCALIBUR pipeline using a uniform analysis consisting of aperture photometry and modeling of instrument effects along with the exoplanet signal. Nearest-neighbors regression with a Gaussian kernel is used to correct for instrumental systematics correlated to the star's centroid position and shape in conjunction with a novel test to avoid overfitting. These methods may have utility in addressing sub-pixel gain variations present in modern infrared detectors. We analyze the 3.6-$\mu$m and 4.5-$\mu$m phase curve properties and find a strong wavelength-dependent difference in how the properties correlate with physical parameters as well as evidence that the phase curve properties are determined by multiple physical parameters. We suggest that differences between the 3.6-$\mu$m and 4.5-$\mu$m phase curve properties are due to 3.6~$\mu$m observations probing regions of the atmosphere which could include a cloud layer. Taken together, the observed phase curve behavior suggests that different physical processes are responsible for establishing the thermal phase curve at different pressures, which are probed by different wavelengths, and that further 3D GCM modeling is required to investigate the reason for this complex dependence on planetary properties.

 - **Abstract**
 The stable rotation of young pulsars is often interrupted by two non-deterministic phenomena: glitches and red timing noise. Timing noise provides insights into plasma and nuclear physics under extreme conditions. The framework leverages rotational symmetry in pulsar spin-down models and temporal symmetry in noise processes to achieve computational efficiency, aligning with the journal's focus on symmetry principles in physical systems. In this paper, we apply a novel frequentist framework developed within the PINT software package (v0.9.8) to analyze single-pulsar noise processes. Using 17.5 years of pulse time-of-arrival (TOA) data for the young pulsar PSR J1741-3016, observed with the Nanshan 26 m radio telescope, we investigate its timing properties. In this study, we employed the Downhill Weighted Least-Squares Fitter to estimate the pulsar's spin parameters and position. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) was used for model parameter selection. The results obtained with PINT were compared to those from ENTERPRISE and TEMPONEST, two Bayesian-based frameworks. We demonstrate that PINT achieves comparable results with significantly reduced computational costs. Additionally, the adequacy of the noise model can be readily verified through visual inspection tools. Future research will utilize this framework to analyze timing noise across a large sample of young pulsars.

 - **Abstract**
 A classical nova is a thermonuclear runaway initiated on a white dwarf accreting solar-like material from its stellar companion. Once the white dwarf accretes enough mass, the pressure at the base of the accreted layer reaches a critical point, leading to the ignition of the hydrogen fuel at their interface. This paper presents a set of two-dimensional CO classical nova simulations with an extended buffer zone of a fixed low density and temperature between the top of the accreted layer and the upper boundary, allowing us to capture the thermonuclear outburst in the domain. Our domain reduces the role of the upper-outflow boundary condition that has affected previous simulations and allows us to explore the nucleosynthesis evolution in detail. We also study the effects of the initial temperature perturbation and buffer size to explore their sensitivity in our simulations. Finally, we start our simulations with a lower temperature at the base of the accreted layer ($7\times 10^7\,\mathrm{K}$) than previous work, allowing us to capture mixing earlier in the evolution, reducing the effects of the mixing-length-theory assumptions. This allows for a more realistic description of convective transport in our models.

          Low-Energy Neutrinos from Primordial Black Holes: A New Possibility for Observing Hawking Radiation

 - **Abstract**
 The study of primordial black holes (PBHs) and the Hawking radiation they produce represents a significant step toward understanding the role of these phenomena in the cosmological evolution of the Universe. PBHs could be a component of dark matter, the seeds of supermassive black holes, and sources of Hawking radiation, which, unlike the radiation from other black holes, might be observable. Over the course of the evolution of the Universe from the Big Bang to the present day, PBHs have lost a substantial portion of their mass through neutrino radiation. This occurs because, for black holes with masses $M\lesssim10^{23}\,$g, the radiation of the lightest massive particles - neutrinos - becomes significant alongside the emission of photons. This neutrino radiation eventually dominates the emission process. By the present time ($t_0=13.8$ Gyr), only black holes with masses $\lesssim 10^{15}\,$g have largely evaporated, meaning that the total emission spectrum of PBHs is now dominated by the neutrino component. In this paper, we present new estimates of the neutrino spectra emitted by PBHs of various masses, with a particular focus on low-energy radiation ($E_{kin} \in [0.01 ÷1]\, $eV) for the first time. Our calculations demonstrate that black holes in the mass range $[10^{9}\div10^{11}]\,$g emit neutrinos with intensities that exceed the background fluxes from known astrophysical sources in the low-energy range. In contrast, in the high-energy range, the emission remains below the background level, consistent with observational constraints. These findings open new avenues for the potential detection of PBH radiation and could stimulate advancements in neutrino detection technologies, particularly in the low-energy regime. The observation of neutrinos in this energy range represents one of the few opportunities to confirm the existence of Hawking radiation.

 - **Abstract**
 Classical Cepheids are not only excellent standard candles, but also invaluable tools to test stellar evolution and pulsation theories. Rates of their pulsation period change, quantified usually through $O-C$ diagrams, can be confronted with predictions of stellar evolution theory. On the other hand, period changes on much shorter time scales ($\sim$10$^{2}$-10$^{4}$days), attributed to non-evolutionary effects are often detected and lack detailed explanation. We aim to provide a systematic and quantitative description of irregular or non-linear period changes in Cepheids. We aim to provide a systematic and quantitative description of irregular or non-linear period changes in Cepheids. We analysed part of the OGLE data for classical Cepheids in the Magellanic Clouds (MCs; from both Large Magellanic Cloud, LMC, and the Small Magellanic Cloud, SMC) using the modified Hertzsprung $O-C$ technique. A sample of 3658 stars, with the best quality data and void of additional low-amplitude periodicities (e.g. due to non-radial pulsations), that could impact the results, was selected for analysis. Based on $O-C$ shapes, stars were classified into three categories: no period change (class 1), linear period change (class 2), and irregular change (class 3). In our investigation, $33.5\pm0.7$\% of analysed stars show irregular period changes. Considering the pulsation mode, irregular period changes were detected in $16.5\pm0.7$\% of the analysed fundamental mode stars and in $68.1\pm1.2$\% of the first overtone stars. The amplitude of variability in the $O-C$ diagrams increases with the pulsation period, and at a given pulsation period, it is larger for first overtone stars. While the increase is linear for first overtone stars, for fundamental mode stars it becomes steeper as the pulsation period increases.

 - **Abstract**
 MOMOS, the Multi-Object MKID Optical Spectrometer, is a proposed visible wavelength spectrometer that uses MKIDs (Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors) targeting an initial resolving power of 3500. With their modest wavelength-resolving abilities, MKIDs take the place of both the cross disperser and detector in the spectrometer. MKIDs lack read noise and dark current enabling noiseless post-observation rebinning and characterization of faint objects, as well as time-resolved photon counting spectroscopy. This work presents an MOMOS simulator customizable for different MOMOS configurations. Treating simulator products as inputs, an algorithm was developed and implemented in the MOMOS data reduction package to calibrate and extract spectra.

 - **Abstract**
 A major outstanding challenge in cosmology is the persistent discrepancy between the Hubble constant obtained from early and late universe measurements -- the Hubble tension. Examining cosmological evolution through the lens of information growth within a black hole we show the appearence of two fractal growing processes characterizing the early and late ages. These fractals induce space growth rates of $62.79\pm5.59$ km/s/Mpc and $70.07\pm0.09$ km/s/Mpc; close to the current values of the Hubble constants involved in the tension. These results strongly suggest that the Hubble tension is not given by unexpected large-scale structures or multiple, unrelated errors but by innate properties underlying the universe dynamics.

 - **Abstract**
 Motivated by the morphological measures in assessing the geometrical and topological properties of a generic cosmological stochastic field, we propose an extension of the weighted morphological measures, specifically the $n$th conditional moments of derivative (cmd-$n$). This criterion assigns a distinct weight to each excursion set point based on the associated field. We apply the cmd-$n$ on the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) to identify the cosmic string networks (CSs) through their unique Gott-Kaiser-Stebbins effect on the temperature anisotropies. We also formulate the perturbative expansion of cmd-$n$ for the weak non-Gaussian regime up to $\mathcal{O}(\sigma_0^3)$. We propose a comprehensive pipeline designed for analyzing the morphological properties of string-induced CMB maps within the flat sky approximation. To evaluate the robustness of our proposed criteria, we employ string-induced high-resolution flat-sky CMB simulated patches of $7.2$ deg$^2$ size with a resolution of $0.42$ arc-minutes. Our results demonstrate that the minimum detectable value of cosmic string tension is $G\mu\gtrsim 1.9\times 10^{-7}$ when a noise-free map is analyzed with normalized cmd-$n$. Whereas for the ACT, CMB-S4, and Planck-like experiments at 95.45\% confidence level, the normalized cmd-$n$ can distinguish the CSs network for $G\mu\gtrsim2.9 \times 10^{-7}$, $G\mu\gtrsim 2.4\times 10^{-7}$ and $G\mu\gtrsim 5.8\times 10^{-7}$, respectively. The normalized cmd-$n$ exhibits a significantly enhanced capability in the detection of CSs relative to the Minkowski Functionals.

 - **Abstract**
 Next-generation instruments for ground-based gamma-ray astronomy are marked by a substantial increase in complexity, featuring dozens of telescopes. This leap in scale introduces significant challenges in managing system operations and offline data analysis. Methods, which depend on advanced personnel training and sophisticated software, become increasingly strained as system complexity grows, making it more challenging to effectively support users in such a multifaceted environment. To address these challenges, we propose the development of AI agents based on instruction-finetuned large language models (LLMs). These agents align with specific documentation and codebases, understand the environmental context, operate with external APIs, and communicate with humans in natural language. Leveraging the advanced capabilities of modern LLMs, which can process and retain vast amounts of information, these AI agents offer a transformative approach to system management and data analysis by automating complex tasks and providing intelligent assistance. We present two prototypes that integrate with the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory pipelines for operations and offline data analysis. The first prototype automates data model implementation and maintenance for the Configuration Database of the Array Control and Data Acquisition (ACADA). The second prototype is an open-access code generation application tailored for data analysis based on the Gammapy framework.

          A large-scale ring galaxy at z = 2.2 revealed by JWST/NIRCam: kinematic observations and analytical modelling

 - **Abstract**
 A unique galaxy at z = 2.2, zC406690, has a striking clumpy large-scale ring structure that persists from rest UV to near-infrared, yet has an ordered rotation and lies on the star-formation main sequence. We combine new JWST/NIRCam and ALMA band 4 observations, together with previous VLT/SINFONI integral field spectroscopy and HST imaging to re-examine its nature. The high-resolution H$\alpha$ kinematics are best fitted if the mass is distributed within a ring with total mass $M_{\rm{ring}} = 2 \times 10^{10} M_\odot$ and radius $R_{ring}$ = 4.6 kpc, together with a central undetected mass component (e.g., a "bulge") with a dynamical mass of $M_{bulge} = 8 \times 10^{10} M_\odot$. We also consider a purely flux emitting ring superposed over a faint exponential disk, or a highly "cuspy" dark matter halo, both disfavored against a massive ring model. The low-resolution CO(4-3) line and 142GHz continuum emission imply a total molecular and dust gas masses of $M_{mol,gas} = 7.1 \times 10^{10}M_\odot$ and $M_{dust} = 3 \times 10^8 M_\odot$ over the entire galaxy, giving a dust-to-mass ratio of 0.7%. We estimate that roughly half the gas and dust mass lie inside the ring, and that $\sim 10\%$ of the total dust is in a foreground screen that attenuates the stellar light of the bulge in the rest-UV to near-infrared. Sensitive high-resolution ALMA observations will be essential to confirm this scenario and study the gas and dust distribution.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigated the impact of photometric redshift errors in the ongoing Javalambre Physics of the Accelerating Universe Astrophysical Survey (J-PAS) on void identification and properties using a watershed-based method, aiming to assess the recovery of individual voids and the overall void environment. We created galaxy mock catalogues for redshift z = 0.1 using the IllustrisTNG300-1 simulation, defining two datasets: an $ideal$ sample ($m_r < 21$ mag) and a $perturbed$ sample with the Z-coordinate errors mimicking J-PAS's line-of-sight errors, derived from the precursor miniJPAS survey data. We identified voids using ZOBOV, a watershed algorithm. We found 1065 voids in the $ideal$ sample and 2558 voids in the $perturbed$ sample. The $perturbed$ sample voids have, on average, smaller sizes and denser interiors. We filtered out voids based on density and radius in order to eliminate overdense and small spurious instances. The stacked density profile of filtered voids in the $perturbed$ sample remains close to the average density even at the boundary peak, indicating a strong blurring of structures by the redshift errors. The number of $ideal$ sample voids for which at least $50\%$ of the volume is recovered by a void in the $perturbed$ sample is 53 (29 for the filtered sample). The volume occupied by these voids is less than $10\%$ of the simulation volume. Merging voids in the $perturbed$ sample marginally improves the recovery. The overall volumes defined as voids in the two samples have an overlap of $80\%$, making up $61\%$ of the simulation box volume. While some statistical properties of voids might be recovered sufficiently well, the watershed algorithms may not be optimal for recovering the large-scale structure voids if applied straight to photometric redshift survey data.

 - **Abstract**
 The WASP-47 system is notable as the first known system hosting both inner and outer low-mass planetary companions around a hot Jupiter, with an ultra-short-period (USP) planet as the innermost planetary companion. The formation of such an unique configuration poses challenges to the lonely hot Jupiter formation model. Hot Jupiters in multiple planetary systems may have a similar formation process with warm Jupiter systems, which are more commonly found with companions. This implies that the WASP-47 system could bridge our understanding of both hot and warm Jupiter formation. In this work, we propose a possible formation scenario for the WASP-47 system based on its orbital configuration. The mean motion resonance trapping, giant planet perturbations, and tidal effects caused by the central star are key factors in the formation of USP planets in multiple planetary systems with hot Jupiters. Whether a planet can become an USP planet or a short period super-earth (SPSE) planet depends on the competition between eccentricity excitation by nearby giant planet perturbations and the eccentricity damping due to tidal effects. The $Q_p'$ value of the innermost planet is essential for the final planetary configuration. Our results suggest that a $Q_p'$ in the range of [1, 10] is favorable for the formation of the WASP-47 system. Based on the formation scenario, we estimate an occurrence rate of 8.4$\pm$2.4\% for USP planets in systems similar to WASP-47.

 - **Abstract**
 The history of the outer solar system is intrinsically related to the Giant Planets migration. A massive disk of material within a radius of 30~au was scattered during the planetary migration, creating different dynamic populations in the Transneptunian region. They were formed in a collisional environment when massive collisions allowed them to grow and form much smaller moons than the primary body. The dynamical group, known as the Cold Classicals, was formed in a sparse disk from 42 to about 47~au and did not suffer much from planet migration. Observations show that many of Cold Classical are binary, consistent with the streaming instability process. The stellar occultation technique, with a spatial resolution of a few kilometres, can be used to search for binaries where other techniques are unable to do so, and to characterise the known satellites of Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNO), constraining their formation scenarios. We review here the first stellar occultations by TNO's satellites (besides Charon), discuss the methods used to detect these events. We also fit new orbital elements and system mass for Vanth (Orcus/1) and Weywot (Quaoar/1), finding reasonable solutions for pure Keplerian orbits. Finally, we discuss the prospects regarding the stellar occultations by TNO binaries and their implications for the study of the history of the Solar System.

 - **Abstract**
 Radio telescope arrays, such as Square Kilometre Array (SKA) and next-generation Very Large Array (ngVLA), require highly precise synchronization of time-frequency references to ensure high-quality observational data. Fiber-based frequency distribution systems are highly effective. However, their proper functioning can be threatened by risk events. In this paper, we propose a hybrid fiber-based frequency-distribution and vibration detection system tailored for large radio arrays. The system ensures the performance of distributed frequency signals while allowing for the monitoring of potential threats to the optical fiber network. We design and implement a single-to-multiple hybrid system, conducting tests via a 55-km fiber link. Experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness, achieving the relative frequency stability of 3E-14/1 s and 2.7E-17/1E5 s, along with vibration detection and localization capabilities.

 - **Abstract**
 We report on the intriguing properties of a variable X-ray source projected at the outskirts of the elliptical galaxy NGC 6099 ($d \approx 139$ Mpc). If truly located near NGC 6099, this is a hyperluminous X-ray source that reached an X-ray luminosity $L_{X} \approx $ a few times $10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$ in 2012 February (XMM-Newton data), about 50 to 100 times brighter than in 2009 May (Chandra) and 2023 August (XMM-Newton). The X-ray spectrum was soft at all three epochs, with a thermal component at $kT \approx 0.2$ keV and a power-law photon index $>3$. Such properties make it a strong candidate for an intermediate mass black hole (IMBH). We also discovered a point-like, blue optical counterpart ($m_{g,{Vega}}\approx24.7$~mag, $M_{g,{Vega}}\approx-11.2$~mag), from images taken by the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, and later confirmed with Hubble Space Telescope observations. The optical continuum can be modeled as stellar emission from a compact star cluster or an X-ray-irradiated accretion disk, consistent with the IMBH scenario. We discuss alternative explanations for the nature of this system. A possible scenario is tidal stripping of an orbiting star, with repeated X-ray outbursts every few years. An alternative possibility is that the thermal X-ray emission seen in 2009 was from shocked gas in the self-intersecting tidal stream during the rising phase of a tidal disruption event, while the 2012 and 2023 emissions were from the fully-formed accretion disk.

 - **Abstract**
 The Largest Cluster Statistics\,(LCS) analysis of the redshifted 21\,cm maps has been demonstrated to be an efficient and robust method for following the time evolution of the largest ionized regions\,(LIRs) during the Epoch of Reionization\,(EoR). The LCS can, in principle, constrain the reionization model and history by quantifying the morphology of neutral hydrogen\,(\HI) distribution during the different stages of the EoR. Specifically, the percolation transition of ionized regions, quantified and constrained via LCS, provides a crucial insight about the underlying reionization model. The previous LCS analysis of EoR 21\,cm maps demonstrates that the convolution of the synthesized beam of the radio interferometric arrays, e.g. SKA1-Low with the target signal, shifts the apparent percolation transition of ionized regions towards the lower redshifts. In this study, we present an optimal thresholding strategy to reduce this bias in the recovered percolation transition. We assess the robustness of LCS analysis of the 21\,cm maps in the presence of antenna-based gain calibration errors and instrumental noise for SKA1-Low. This analysis is performed using synthetic observations simulated by the \textsc{21cmE2E} pipeline, considering SKA1-Low AA4 configuration within a radius of 2\,km from the array centre. Our findings suggest that a minimum of $1500$\,hours of observation (SNR $\gtrapprox 3$) are required for the LCS analysis to credibly suppress the confusion introduced by thermal noise. Further, we also demonstrate that for a maximum antenna-based calibration error tolerance of $\sim 0.05\%$ (post calibration), the reionization history can be recovered in a robust and relatively unbiased manner using the LCS.

 - **Abstract**
 The existence of dynamically young and metal-rich RR Lyrae stars challenges conventional notions of these variable stars. One possible scenario for their formation and evolution is via binary channels involving mass transfer. This study presents the detection of nine fundamental-mode RR Lyrae stars residing in the thin disk of the Milky Way with metallicities higher than [Fe/H] > -1.0 dex and showing proper motion anomalies. Our thin disk classification is based on kinematics and supported by $\alpha$-element abundances, where possible. We searched for indications of the light-travel time effect (LTTE) in the available literature sources and the TESS photometric data of the stars but found no signs of periodic variations induced by companions within the expected period range. This could be because of a lack of observations as well as sparse measurements and large gaps in the data. We propose a continued search for signs of binarity and a subsequent long-term follow-up of nine targets that satisfy all of our search criteria. Beyond these targets, we also report the detection of slow phase changes in the Blazhko star ST Pic, which could be compatible with the LTTE.

 - **Abstract**
 Mars' sedimentary rocks record Gyrs of environmental change. New data enable the first global analysis of paleo-environment relevant physical properties of these rocks, including layer thickness and accumulation rate. We find that layer thicknesses of post-3.5 Ga sedimentary rocks across the Martian surface show coherent variations at ~1000 km-scale that are inconsistent with simple volcanic and climatic hypotheses for formation, which are consistent with global compositional homogeneity at orbital scales. These data, in combination with new analyses of outcrop age and total rock volume demonstrate a global decrease in layer thickness that predates the eventual drop off in preserved sedimentary rock volume per Myr. The new constraints confirm a diachronous transition in Mars' global sedimentary rock record while also highlighting a regional dichotomy in young sedimentary rock deposits that has not been quantified before.

 - **Abstract**
 We compare Very Large Array observations of GRS 1915+105 made in 1994 and 2023, with nearly three decades of difference. The source has experienced intriguing major changes. The position angle of the bipolar ejecta in the plane of the sky has increased counterclockwise by 24 degrees. The inclination angle of the flow with respect to the line of sight has increased by 17 degrees. Analysis of GRS 1915+105 images over the years suggest that the observed changes took place within a year or less. Our analysis indicates that during 2023 the plane of the accretion disk was aligned with the line of sight, which may explain the deep X-ray obscured state and the high mid-infrared luminosity observed with JWST in that epoch. More recent 2024 observations imply that the position angle of the ejecta has returned to its historic values. We suggest that these abrupt changes could be due to the presence of an undetected tertiary component in the system. Future monitoring of the time evolution of the source may further clarify the cause of these remarkable changes.

 - **Abstract**
 The streaming instability is a promising mechanism for planetesimal formation. The instability can rapidly form dense clumps that collapse self-gravitationally, which is efficient for large dust grains with the Stokes number on the order of 0.1. However, dust growth models predict that collisional fragmentation prevents dust grains from growing to such sizes. We perform local simulations of the streaming instability and measure characteristic collision velocities and collision rates of dust grains based on their trajectories in moderate clumping. The collision velocities are on the order of 0.1 percent of the sound speed or lower, implying that dust grains can overcome the fragmentation barrier via the clumping. We also find that the collision rates are appreciably high regardless of the low collision velocities. Corresponding timescales are on the order of ten Keplerian periods or shorter, suggesting that dust grains can overcome the drift barrier as well. This streaming-instability-assisted (SI-assisted) coagulation greatly relaxes the conditions for planetesimal formation as recently implied.

 - **Abstract**
 Neptune-size exoplanets are less studied as characterizing their atmospheres presents challenges due to their relatively small radius and atmospheric scale height. As the most common outcome of planet formation, these planets are crucial for understanding planetary formation, migration theories, atmospheric composition, and potential habitability. Their diverse atmospheres, influenced by equilibrium temperature, composition, and cloud presence, offer unique opportunities to study atmospheric dynamics and chemistry. While low-resolution spectroscopy struggles with atmospheric characterization due to clouds, high-resolution observations provide detailed analysis of the atmospheres by detecting molecular lines beyond the cloud deck. This study investigates four subclasses of Neptune atmospheres: HAT-P-11 b (warm Neptune), HD 63433 c (warm sub-Neptune), K2-25 b (temperate Neptune), and TOI-270 d (temperate sub-Neptune), using six ground-based spectrographs: GIANO-B, CARMENES, IGRINS, HISPEC, MODHIS, and ANDES over one and three transits. Our simulation integrates the chemical kinetics model, VULCAN with the 1-D line-by-line radiative transfer model, petitRADTRANS, and estimates detection significance using the ground-based noise simulator, SPECTR. We aim to predict how future Extremely Large Telescopes (ELTs) such as TMT (MODHIS) and E-ELT (ANDES) can utilize their higher resolving powers and larger collecting areas to surpass current observatories in detecting molecular bands. We highlight the importance of photochemistry in these atmospheres and demonstrate how ELTs will help further in constraining nitrogen and sulfur chemistry. Finally, we present a comprehensive picture of cloud presence in the atmospheres and its impact on molecular detectability in Neptune-class atmospheres.

 - **Abstract**
 It is still in dispute the existence of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) with a mass of ~10^3-10^5 solar masses (Msun), which are the missing link between stellar-mass black holes (5-50 Msun) and supermassive black holes (10^6-10^10 Msun). The bright flares from tidal disruption events (TDEs) provide a new and direct way to probe IMBHs. 3XMM J215022.4-055108 is a unique off-nuclear X-ray transient which can be best explained as the TDE by an IMBH in a massive star cluster, though its mass is not well determined. Here, we report the discovery of a transient X-ray quasi-periodicity signal from 3XMM J215022.4-055108 with a period of ~85 seconds (at a significance of >3.51sigma) and fractional root-mean-squared amplitude of ~10%. Furthermore, the signal is coherent with a quality factor ~16. The significance drops to >3.13sigma if considering all light curves with sufficient quality for QPO search. Combining with the results from X-ray continuum fittings, the detection of QPO allows for joint constraints on the black hole mass and dimensionless spin in the range [9.9*10^3-1.6*10^4 Msun]$ and [0.26-0.36], respectively. This result supports the presence of an IMBH in an off-nuclear massive star cluster and may open up the possibility of studying IMBHs through X-ray timing of TDEs.

 - **Abstract**
 Turbulence is a mysterious phenomenon in physical systems and plays a critical role in the interstellar medium (ISM). Previous simulations and observations have shown that the probability density functions (PDFs) of gas densities in supersonic systems tend to be skewed, exhibiting low-density exponential tails on the $s = \ln{\rho}$ scale. In this work, we argue that these exponential tails originate from the convolution of PDF kernels with skewed tails, which can appear at both ends of the PDF. We introduce two density-fraction strategies -- the mass-fraction and volume-fraction approaches -- to explain the physical origins of the low-$s$ and high-$s$ skewed PDF kernels. The PDF kernels constructed in this work satisfy the relation that its structural entropy equals the PDF variance, as we proposed in Paper I. These two types of PDF kernels define two spaces of skewed PDFs, which are dual to each other and possess highly symmetric mathematical structures. We thus speculate that the high-$s$ skewed PDF kernels are physical and may be related to the power-law tails of the column-density PDFs (on the $\rho$ scale) of molecular clouds, which are shaped by both turbulence and gravity. Inspired by this, we further construct a form of an `isothermal' turbulent system that likely favors the volume-fraction strategy.

 - **Abstract**
 The black hole candidate system SLX 1746--331 was back to business in 2023, after a long silence of roughly 13 years. An outburst was observed thoroughly by \textit{Insight}-HXMT and \textit{NICER}. The outburst is characterized by spectral dominance of the soft state, where the joint \textit{Insight}-HXMT and \textit{NICER} spectral analysis shows the temperature dependence of the disk flux follows $T_{\rm in}^{3.98}$, and thus suggests that the inner disk reaches to ISCO during almost the entire outburst. By assuming 0.3 $L_{\rm Edd}$ for the peak flux and an inclination angle of zero degrees, the lower limit of the compact object hosted in this system is estimated as 3.28$\pm 2.14 M_\odot$. We also look into the relation of the disk temperature and disk flux for a sample of black hole systems, and by taking the disk temperature derived in the outburst of SLX 1746--331, such a relation results in a mass estimation of $5.2 \pm 4.5M_\odot$. Finally, the spin of the compact object is constrained to larger than 0.8 with a spectral model of kerrbb.

 - **Abstract**
 Swift J1727.8--1613 is a black hole X-ray binary newly discovered in 2023. We perform spectral analysis with simultaneous Insight-HXMT, NICER and NuSTAR observations when the source was approaching to the hard intermediate state. Such a joint view reveals an additional hard component apart from the normally observed hard component with reflection in the spectrum, to be distinguished from the usual black hole X-ray binary systems. By including this extra component in the spectrum, we have measured a high spin of $0.98^{+0.02}_{-0.07}$ and an inclination of around $40^{+1.2}_{-0.8}$ degrees, which is consistent with NICER results reported before. However, we find that the additional spectral component can not be exclusively determined due to the model degeneracy. Accordingly, a possible jet/corona configuration is adjusted to account for the spectral fitting with different model trials. The extra component may originate either from a relativistic jet or a jet base/corona underneath a slow jet.

          Constraints on the inflaton potential from scalar-induced gravitational waves and primordial black holes

 - **Abstract**
 A plateau on the background inflaton potential $V_{\rm b}(\phi)$ can lead cosmic inflation into an ultraslow-roll phase, greatly enhancing the primordial power spectrum on small scales, and resulting in significant scalar-induced gravitational waves (GWs) and abundant primordial black holes (PBHs). In this work, we construct an anti-symmetric perturbation $\delta V(\phi)$ on $V_{\rm b}(\phi)$ with three model parameters, the position, width, and slope of $\delta V(\phi)$, and constrain these parameters from the potential stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) in NANOGrav 15-year data set. The GW spectrum from the merger of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) with two model parameters, the amplitude and spectral index, is also investigated for comparison. We perform Bayesian analysis in three steps with increasing number of model parameters, and obtain the allowed parameter ranges. When the constraints on PBH abundance are taken into account, these ranges become further narrower. We find that the increase of model parameters cannot significantly improve the Bayes factors, and the model with an almost perfect plateau on $V_{\rm b}(\phi)$ is favored. Moreover, the interpretation of the SGWB via only the GWs generated by SMBHBs is not preferred by the data.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent JWST observations towards Westerlund 1 revealed extensive nebular emission associated with the cluster. Given the age of the region and proximity of that material to massive stars it cannot be primordial star forming gas and the origin is uncertain. We aim to determine whether the nebular emission in Westerlund 1 could be due to ablation flows from Red Supergiant (RSG) stars embedded in the cluster wind driven by the Wolf-Rayet stars in the cluster core. We also aim to explore the efficiency of mass-loading for the RSG wind in this scenario. We use 3D hydrodynamic simulations with the \textsc{pion} code to study the interaction between the cluster and RSG winds. We compare with the JWST observations by generating synthetic dust-emission maps. We find that the ablation flow morphology is consistent with the observations towards Westerlund 1, with clumps and instabilities. Synthetic observations at 11 $\mu$m predict fluxes in the ablation flow of $\sim1000-6000$ MJy ster$^{-1}$ which is consistent with the unsaturated components of the JWST F1130W observations in the vicinity of the red supergiants in the region. This good agreement is achieved without any consideration of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which have a known 11.3 $\mu$m feature that appears in the F1130W band. This suggests that the ablation flow is PAH depleted. Ablation of RSG winds can explain the observed nebulosity in Westerlund 1, at least in the vicinity of the RSGs. Further observations are encouraged to enable detailed studies of these interactions.

 Novae are found to have GeV to TeV gamma-ray emission, which reveals the shock acceleration from the white dwarfs. Recently, V1405 Cas was reported to radiated suspicious gamma-ray by \textit{Fermi}-LAT with low significance ($4.1 \sigma$) after the optical maximum. Radio observations reveal that it is one of the five brightest novae surrounded by low-density ionized gas columns. Here we report continuous search for GeV gamma-ray from \textit{Fermi}-LAT. No gamma-ray were found. For V1405 Cas, the flux level is lower than other well-studied \textit{Fermi} novae, and the gamma-ray maximum appear at $t_{0} + 145$ d. Gamma-ray of V1405 Cas are used to search potential gamma-ray periodicity. No gamma-ray periodicity was found during the time of observation. By comparing multi-wavelength data, the gamma-ray upper limit to optical flux ratio with value at around $10^{-4}$ is obtained to constrain the shock acceleration. Long-term analysis from \textit{Swift}-XRT gets X-ray spectral in the post-shock phase, which indicates that V1405 Cas became a super-soft source. The best-fit black body temperature at the super soft state is 0.11 - 0.19 keV.

 This article explores the different formation scenarios of the Kronian moons system in the context of a highly dissipative Saturn, with the objective of identifying the most likely of these scenarios. First, we review the diversity of objects - moons and rings - orbiting solar system giant planets, and the diversity of their architectures, which formation scenarios must reproduce. We then identify in this broader context the specific features of the Saturn system, such as the particularly large spectrum of its moon masses, the uniqueness of Titan and the presence of both dense and tenuous rings, before discussing the applicability of the different giant planet moon formation scenarios to the Saturn case. We discuss each of the most relevant scenarios and their respective merits. Finally, we tentatively propose a "favorite" scenario and we identify the key observations to be made by future space missions and/or Earth-based telescopic observations to validate this scenario or possibly alternative ones.

 Neutrinos from dense environments are unique laboratories for astrophysics, particle physics and many-body physics. They tell us about the last stages of the gravitational core-collapse and the explosion of massive stars. These elusive particles are also tightly linked to heavy elements synthesis in gravitational core-collapse supernovae and binary neutron star mergers, or play a pivotal role at the MeV epoch during the Universe expansion. We highlight theoretical and observational aspects of this interesting domain, in particular for the future measurement of neutrinos from the next core-collapse supernova, and of the diffuse supernova background, whose discovery might lie in the forthcoming future.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the amplification of primordial curvature perturbations through a sound speed resonance mechanism within an inflationary model featuring a non-minimal derivative coupling. In this scenario, the coupling function is composed of a constant term and a periodic term. Our analysis demonstrates that the periodic behavior of the squared sound speed transforms the curvature perturbation equation into a Mathieu equation on sub-horizon scales. This resonance effect leads to a substantial enhancement of curvature perturbations, which, upon re-entering the Hubble horizon during the radiation-dominated era, can trigger the formation of primordial black holes, potentially contributing to the dark matter density. Additionally, the amplified perturbations generate scalar-induced gravitational waves with amplitudes that may lie within the detectable range of future gravitational wave observatories, providing a testable observational signature of the model.

 - **Abstract**
 Recently, the R2D2 paradigm, standing for ''Residual-to-Residual DNN series for high-Dynamic-range imaging'', was introduced for image formation in Radio Interferometry (RI) as a learned version of the traditional algorithm CLEAN. The first incarnations of R2D2 are limited to planar imaging on small fields of view, failing to meet the spherical-imaging requirement of modern telescopes observing wide fields. To address this limitation, we propose the spherical-imaging extension S-R2D2. Firstly, as R2D2, S-R2D2 encapsulates its minor cycles in existing 2D-Euclidean deep neural network (DNN) architectures, but adapts its iterative scheme to incorporate the wide-field measurement model mapping a spherical image to visibility data. We implemented this model as the composition of an efficient Fourier-based interpolator mapping the spherical image onto the equatorial plane, with the standard RI operator mapping the equatorial-plane image to visibility data. Importantly, the interpolation step must inevitably be performed at a lower-than-optimal resolution on the plane, to meet the high-resolution requirement on the sphere of wide-field imaging while preserving scalability. Therefore, secondly, we design S-R2D2's DNN training loss to jointly learn to correct the interpolation approximations and identify residual image structures on the sphere, ensuring consistency with the spherical ground truth using the adjoint plane-to-sphere interpolator. Finally, we demonstrate through simulations S-R2D2's capability to perform fast and accurate reconstructions of spherical monochromatic intensity images, across high-resolution, high-dynamic-range settings.

 - **Abstract**
 Contact binaries are found throughout the solar system. The recent discovery of Selam, the satellite of MBA (152830) Dinkinesh, by the NASA LUCY mission has made it clear that the term `contact binary' covers a variety of different types of bi-modal mass distributions and formation mechanisms. Only by modelling more contact binaries can this population be properly understood. We determined a spin state and shape model for the Apollo group contact binary asteroid (388188) 2006 DP14 using ground-based optical and radar observations collected between 2014 and 2023. Radar delay-Doppler images and continuous wave spectra were collected over two days in February 2014, while 16 lightcurves in the Cousins R and SDSS-r filters were collected in 2014, 2022 and 2023. We modelled the spin state using convex inversion before using the SHAPE modelling software to include the radar observations in modelling concavities and the distinctive neck structure connecting the two lobes. We find a spin state with a period of $(5.7860\pm0.0001)$ hours and pole solution of $\lambda = (180\pm121)^\circ$ and $\beta = (-80\pm7)^\circ$ with morphology indicating a 520 m long bi-lobed shape. The model's asymmetrical bi-modal mass distribution resembles other small NEA contact binaries such as (85990) 1999 JV6 or (8567) 1996 HW1, which also feature a smaller `head' attached to a larger `body'. The final model features a crater on the larger lobe, similar to several other modelled contact binaries. The model's resolution is 25 m, comparable to that of the radar images used.

 On January 15 2025, the Gaia mission completed the collection of the astrometric, photometric, and spectroscopic data for about 2.5 billion celestial sources, from the solar system to the Milky Way to the distant universe. Work is ongoing to produce Gaia DR4 based on the first 5.5 years of data, with the release expected in 2026. The full 10.5 year survey will be turned into Giaa DR5 which will open up scientific possibilities beyond Gaia DR4}. In this contribution I give a brief overview of the Gaia mission, summarize results from the GaiaUnlimited project, provide a glimpse of what is to come in Gaia DR4, and summarize the new science opportunities that Gaia DR5 will bring. I close with a look ahead at the successor to Gaia, the GaiaNIR mission, which will survey the Milky Way in the infrared, thus probing the Galactic ecosystem in the regions hidden to the Gaia mission.

 - **Abstract**
 The spiral structure of the Milky Way is not conclusive, even for the disc regions in the solar neighbourhood. Especially, the arm-like structures uncovered from the over-density maps of evolved stars are inconsistent with the commonly adopted spiral arm models based on young objects. We aim to re-examine the arm segments traced by young objects and better understand the nearby spiral structure. We identify the exciting stars of 459 hii regions and calculate their parallax-based distances according to the Gaia DR3. Together with other hii regions with spectrophotometric or parallax-based distances in literature, the largest ever sample of 572 hii regions with accurate distances is used to reveal the features shown in their distributions projected onto the Galactic disc. The results are then compared to the features traced by other young objects (high-mass star-forming region masers, O-type stars, and young open clusters) and evolved stars. The structures outlined by different kinds of young objects do not exhibit significant deviation from each other. The distributions of young objects are in agreement with three arm-like features emerging in the over-density map of evolved stars. Especially, the Local Arm outlined by young objects follows an arm-like feature delineated by evolved stars and probably spirals outwards towards the direction of $\ell \sim 240^\circ$ in the third Galactic quadrant. We conclude that the arm segments traced by young objects and evolved stars are consistent with each other at least in the solar neighbourhood. In particular, the Local Arm delineated by young objects is reinterpreted as an arm segment with a large pitch angle of $25.2^\circ \pm 2.0^\circ$, whose inner edge is in good agreement with the recently discovered Radcliffe Wave.

 - **Abstract**
 Despite more than half a century of research, the dominant radiation mechanism of gamma-ray burst (GRB) prompt emission remains unsolved. Some progress has been made through the analyses of the observational spectra of Swift/BAT, Konus/Wind, and Fermi/GBM, as well as the spectra of the photosphere or synchrotron models, but it is still insufficient to pin down the answer. Recent and upcoming high-sensitivity polarization observations can provide additional instructive information for model evaluation. In this work, we thoughtfully investigate the polarization samples of POLAR and AstroSAT, combining the light curve, the spectral, and the polarization parameters. The power-law shape of the X-ray afterglows, the $T_{90}\propto (L_{\text{iso}})^{-0.5}$ correlation, and the hard low-energy spectral index $\alpha$ are revealed, thus supporting the photosphere origin. Furthermore, we discover the positive correlation of the $\alpha$ and the polarization degree (PD), which can be consistently explained by the photosphere polarization scenario involving the jet asymmetry from a moderate viewing angle of $\theta _{v}$=0.015.

 - **Abstract**
 The occurrence rate of giant planets increases with orbital period and turns over at a location that roughly corresponds to the snow line of solar-type stars. Further, the density distribution of cold Jupiters (CJs) on the semi-major axis - mass diagram shows a relatively steep inner boundary, shaping the desert of warm Jupiters. The eccentricities of CJs show a broad distribution with a decreasing number density towards the larger end. Previous planet formation models fail to reproduce all these features at the same time. We use a planet population synthesis (PPS) model with truncated initial planetesimal distribution and compare the mass and orbital distribution of the simulated planets with the observation. We show that the occurrence of CJs with respect to the orbital period, the slope of the inner boundary of CJs on the semi-major axis - mass diagram, and the eccentricity distribution of CJs agree reasonably well with observation, if CJs form from truncated planetesimal disks of 10 au or wider with suppressed migration. While PPS simulations generally overestimate the fraction of giants with eccentricity below 0.2, $N$-body simulations produce a more consistent eccentricity distribution with observation. While the fraction of high-eccentricity planets can be increased by widening the planetesimal disk or reducing the migration speed, a deficit of giants with eccentricity between 0.2-0.4 exists regardless of the choices of parameters. Our results indicate that CJs are more likely born in truncated disks near the snow line than in classical uniform disks.

 - **Abstract**
 SN 2024ggi is a Type II supernova that exploded in the nearby galaxy NGC 3621 at a distance of approximately 7 Mpc, making it one of the closest supernovae of the decade. This SN shows clear signs of interaction with a dense circumstellar material, and several studies have investigated the properties of its possible progenitor star using pre-explosion data. In this work we aim to constrain the progenitor properties of SN 2024ggi by performing hydrodynamical modeling of its bolometric light curve and expansion velocities. We present photometric and spectroscopic observations of SN 2024ggi obtained in the Complejo Astronómico El Leoncito, in Las Campanas Observatory, and in Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope Network, spanning from 2 to 106 days after explosion. We constructed its bolometric light curve and we characterize it by calculating its morphological parameters. Then, we computed a grid of one dimensional explosion models for evolved stars with varying masses and estimated the properties of the progenitor star of SN 2024ggi by comparing the models to the observations. The observed bolometric luminosity and expansion velocities are well-matched by a model involving the explosion of a star in the presence of a close circumstellar material (CSM), with a zero-age main sequence mass of $\mathrm{M_{ZAMS}}$ = 15 $M_{\odot}$, a pre-SN mass and radius of 14.1 $M_{\odot}$ and 517 $R_{\odot}$, respectively, an explosion energy of $1.3\times10^{51}$ erg, and a nickel mass below 0.035 $M_{\odot}$. Our analysis suggests that the progenitor suffered a mass-loss rate of $4 \times 10^{-3}$ $M_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$, confined to a distance of 3000 $R_{\odot}$. The CSM distribution is likely a two-component structure that consists of a compact core and an extended tail. This analysis represents the first hydrodynamical model of SN 2024ggi with a complete coverage of the plateau phase.

 - **Abstract**
 The Flat Spectrum Radio Quasar (FSRQ) B2\,1308+326 was in its highest $\gamma$-ray flaring state during 60260-60310\,MJD. During this period, the source was detected in very high energy (VHE) by the large-sized telescope (LST-1). We conducted a detailed broadband spectral study of this source using the simultaneous data available in optical/UV, X-ray, and $\gamma$-ray bands. For the broadband spectral study, we select two gamma-ray high flux states (59750-59800\,MJD, 60260-60310\,MJD) and one low flux state (59250-59320\,MJD). During the epochs, 59750-59800\,MJD (high flux state) and 59250-59320\,MJD (low flux state), the broadband spectral energy distribution (SED) is well fitted using one zone leptonic emission model involving synchrotron, synchrotron self Compton (SSC) and external Compton (EC) processes. However, the flaring state (60260-60310\,MJD) during which the source showed VHE emission requires an additional component. We show that the inclusion of the photo-meson process can successfully explain this excess $\gamma$-ray emission. Further the estimated parameters, also suggest the source is transparent to VHE gamma-rays against pair production process.

 - **Abstract**
 Of the ~25 directly imaged planets to date, all are younger than 500Myr and all but 6 are younger than 100Myr. Eps Ind A (HD209100, HIP108870) is a K5V star of roughly solar age (recently derived as 3.7-5.7Gyr and 3.5$^{+0.8}_{-1.3}$Gyr). A long-term radial velocity trend as well as an astrometric acceleration led to claims of a giant planet orbiting the nearby star (3.6384$\pm$0.0013pc). Here we report JWST coronagraphic images that reveal a giant exoplanet which is consistent with these radial and astrometric measurements, but inconsistent with the previously claimed planet properties. The new planet has temperature ~275K, and is remarkably bright at 10.65um and 15.50um. Non-detections between 3.5-5um indicate an unknown opacity source in the atmosphere, possibly suggesting a high metallicity, high carbon-to-oxygen ratio planet. The best-fit temperature of the planet is consistent with theoretical thermal evolution models, which are previously untested at this temperature range. The data indicates that this is likely the only giant planet in the system and we therefore refer to it as ``b", despite it having significantly different orbital properties than the previously claimed planet ``b".

 - **Abstract**
 We present the design and science case for a new array of radio antennas to be located at the Pierre Auger Observatory. Six stations of three SKALA antennas each will be deployed around a single water-Cherenkov surface detector triggering the radio readout. The planned antenna layout will allow for the detection of cosmic rays above a few tens of PeV and reach full efficiency for vertical air showers at several hundred PeV in primary energy. The array will thus be a pathfinder to demonstrate that fully-efficient radio detection in combination with the underground muon detectors already present at the location is possible. This will enable combined studies of the muon component and the depth of shower maximum, relevant for hadronic interaction models studies and more accurate determination of the cosmic-ray mass composition in the energy range of the Galactic-to-extragalactic transition.

          The Interplay between Dust Dynamics and Turbulence Induced by the Vertical Shear Instability

 - **Abstract**
 The interaction between gas and dust in protoplanetary disks (PPDs) plays a crucial role in setting the stage of planet formation. In particular, the streaming instability (SI) is well recognized as the mechanism for planetesimal formation out of this interaction. The outer region of PPDs is likely subject to the vertical shear instability (VSI), representing a major source of disk turbulence characterized by vertical corrugation that leads to strong dust stirring. In the meantime, the VSI turbulence in 3D generates vortices through the Rossby wave instability (RWI), which can trap dust and thereby promote dust concentration. In this study, we use the multifluid dust module in Athena++ to conduct 2D axisymmetric global simulations of PPDs with mesh refinement and 3D global simulations with modest resolution. In 2D, the VSI corrugation mode is weakened by dust back-reaction, while the SI can still survive regardless of initial conditions. Dust clumping occurs and is seeded by VSI-induced zonal flows. In 3D, dust can settle even more with increased dusty buoyancy, suppressing the VSI corrugation mode. Meanwhile, dust back-reaction enhances dust concentration in RWI vortices, though higher resolution is needed to assess dust clumping.

 - **Abstract**
 Carbon dioxide (CO$_2$) is one of the most important interstellar molecules. While it is considered that it forms on the surface of interstellar dust grains, the exact contribution of different chemical mechanisms is still poorly constrained. Traditionally it is deemed that the CO + OH reaction occurring on top of ices is the main reaction path for its formation. Recent investigations showed that in reality the reaction presents a more complex mechanism, requiring an additional H-abstraction step. Building on our previous works, we carried out a detailed investigation of such H abstraction reactions with the hydrogen atom as a reactant for the abstraction reaction. We found an unconventional chemistry for this reaction, markedly depending on the isomeric form of the HOCO radical prior to reaction. The favored reactions are t-HOCO + H -> CO + H$_2$O, c-HOCO + H -> CO$_2$ + H$_2$ and t/c-HOCO + H -> c/t-HCOOH. We estimate bounds for the rate constants of the less favored reaction channels, t-HOCO + H -> CO$_2$ + H and c-HOCO + H -> CO + H$_2$O, to be approximately 10$^{4-6}$ s$^{-1}$. However, these estimates should be interpreted cautiously due to the significant role of quantum tunneling in these reactions and the complex electronic structure of the involved molecules, which complicates their study. Our findings underscore the need for detailed investigation into the chemistry of interstellar CO$_2$ and pave the way for a reevaluation of its primary formation mechanisms in the interstellar medium.

 - **Abstract**
 We report on the discovery of rare emergence (31 nights from 360 nights of observations) of narrow absorption features in hydrogen and helium lines in stationary SS433 spectra with velocities ranging from $-650$ to $-1900$ km/s. The components arise independently of the appearance of P-Cygni line profiles which are frequently observed in the SS433 stationary spectra with terminal velocities ranging from $-200$ to $\sim -2500$ km/s. The characteristic rising time of the transient absorptions is about one day and the decay time is about two days. The phenomenology of the absorptions suggests their origin due to hydrodynamic instabilities of wind outflows from a supercritical accretion disk in SS433.

 - **Abstract**
 The isopoly bi-fluid approach assumes an isothermal evolution of the solar wind near the Sun up to the radial distance riso, followed by a polytropic evolution constrained by the observed polytropic indices. This approach provides a more accurate model of the interplanetary properties of the solar wind (u, n, Tp, Te) and their radial evolution (Dakeyo et al. 2022, 2024). In this article, we present an improvement of the isopoly approach by considering a generalized two thermal regime approach, embedding two distinct polytropic evolutions, the "bipoly" modeling. To demonstrate the capability of the approach, the models are fitted to both interplanetary and coronal observations, all classified by wind speed population in the spirit of Maksimovic et al. (2020). The set of observations used as constraints are coronal temperatures inferred from charge-state ratio observations from Solar Orbiter, and interplanetary measurements from Helios and Parker Solar Probe. The relaxation of the isothermal criteria in the near-Sun region permits to significantly improve the fast wind acceleration for low coronal temperature conditions. In summary, the new model matches closely the observational constraints: the coronal temperature and the radial evolution of the wind properties (u, n, Tp, Te) in the interplanetary medium, and this for all the wind speed populations.

 - **Abstract**
 The Simons Observatory (SO) Small Aperture Telescopes (SATs) will observe the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) temperature and polarization at six frequency bands. Within these bands, the angular response of the telescope (beam) is convolved with the instrument's spectral response (commonly called bandpass) and the signal from the sky, which leads to the band-averaged telescope beam response, which is sampled and digitized. The spectral properties of the band-averaged beam depend on the natural variation of the beam within the band, referred to as beam chromaticity. In this paper, we quantify the impact of the interplay of beam chromaticity and intrinsic frequency scaling from the various components that dominate the polarized sky emission on the tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r$, and foreground parameters. We do so by employing a parametric power-spectrum-based foreground component separation algorithm, namely BBPower, to which we provide beam-convolved time domain simulations performed with the beamconv software while assuming an idealized version of the SO SAT optics. We find a small, $0.02\sigma$, bias on $r$, due to beam chromaticity, which seems to mostly impact the dust spatial parameters, causing a maximum $0.77 \sigma$ bias on the dust $B$-mode spectra amplitude, $A_{d}$, when employing Gaussian foreground simulations. However, we find all parameter biases to be smaller than $1\sigma$ at all times, independently of the foreground model. This includes the case where we introduce additional uncertainty on the bandpass shape, which accounts for approximately half of the total allowed gain uncertainty, as estimated in previous work for the SO SATs.

          Brownian motion of main-belt asteroids on human timescales

 - **Abstract**
 The explosion of high-precision astrometric data on main-belt asteroids (MBAs) enables new inferences on gravitational and non-gravitational forces present in this region. We estimate the size of MBA motions caused by mutual gravitational encounters with other MBAs that are either omitted from ephemeris models or have uncertain mass estimates. In other words, what is the typical Brownian motion among MBAs that cannot be predicted from the ephemeris, and therefore serves as noise on inferences from the MBAs? We estimate the RMS azimuthal shift $\sigma_\phi$ of this ``Brownian noise'' by numerical estimation of the distribution of impulse sizes and directions among known MBAs, combined with analytical propagation into future positional uncertainties. At current levels of asteroid-mass knowledge, $\sigma_\phi$ rises to $\approx2$ km or $\approx1$ mas over $T=10$ yr, increasing as $T^{3/2},$ large enough to degrade many inferences from Gaia and LSST MBA data. LSST data will, however, improve MBA mass knowledge enough to lower this Brownian uncertainty by $\ge4\times.$ Radial and vertical Brownian noise at $T=10$ yr are factors $\approx7$ and $\approx45,$ respectively, lower than the azimuthal noise, and grow as $T^{3/2}$ and $T^{1/2}.$ For full exploitation of Gaia and LSST MBA data, ephemeris models should include the $\approx1000$ largest asteroids as active bodies with free masses, even if not all are well constrained. This will correctly propagate the uncertainties from these 1000 sources' deflections into desired inferences. The RMS value of deflections from less-massive MBAs is then just $\sigma_\phi\approx60$ m or 30 $\mu$as, small enough to ignore until occultation-based position data become ubiquitously available for MBAs.

 - **Abstract**
 Pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) are important sources for understanding galactic high-energy processes, but it is controversial until now about how high-energy particles in PWNe are accelerated and transported. Lacking radio counterparts of X-ray PWNe (the proposed acceleration sites) introduce difficulties to better understandings in multi wavelengths. Our recent 3, 6, and 16\,cm high-resolution observations of G11.2$-$0.3 PWN with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) uniquely show morphological similarity with its X-ray PWN (a torus/jet feature). Spectral indices of the radio torus and jet are around -0.09 and -0.10, respectively. Meanwhile for the jet region, the spectral break between radio and X-ray spectra implies particle acceleration mechanisms other than a diffusive shock acceleration. Polarization results suggest a helical B-field inside the jet, the equipartition B-field strength of which is below 100\,$\mu$G.

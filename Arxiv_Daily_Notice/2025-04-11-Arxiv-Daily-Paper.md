 - **Abstract**
 The International Astronomical Union definitions for Planet and Dwarf Planet both require that a body has sufficient mass to overcome rigid body forces and self gravitate into a nearly round shape. However, quantitative standards for determining when a body is sufficiently round have been lacking. Previously published triaxial ellipsoid solutions for asteroids, satellites, and Dwarf Planets in the radius range 135 to 800 km are examined to identify a minimum mass above which the entire population, regardless of composition, is round. From this data, the minimum mass to meet the roundness criterion is 5.0 x 10E20 kg. The triaxial shape data suggests three radius ranges: (1) bodies with a radius less than 160 km are non-spheroidal, (2) bodies with a radius in the range 160 to 450 km are transitional in shape or nearly round, (3) bodies with a radius greater than 450 km are spheroidal. Bodies orbiting the Sun with a mass greater than 5.0 x 10E20 kg are Planets or Dwarf Planets. Arguments are presented for including the 16 spheroidal moons of the Solar System as a third dynamical class that can be identified as Satellite Planets. Definitions are proposed that expand upon the taxonomy started in 2006 with the International Astronomomical Union Planet and Dwarf Planet classes.

 - **Abstract**
 Quasi-Periodic Eruptions (QPEs) are recurring bursts of soft X-ray emission from supermassive black holes (SMBHs), which a growing class of models explains via extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs). QPEs exhibit blackbody-like emission with significant temperature evolution, but the minimal information content of their almost pure-thermal spectra has limited physical constraints. Here we study the recently discovered QPEs in ZTF19acnskyy (``Ansky''), which show absorption-like features evolving dramatically within eruptions and correlating strongly with continuum temperature and luminosity, further probing the conditions underlying the emission surface. The absorption features are well-described by dense ionized plasma of column density $N_{\rm H}\gtrsim 10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$, blueshift $0.06\lesssim v/c \lesssim 0.4$, and either collisional or photoionization equilibrium. With high-resolution spectra, we also detect ionized blueshifted emission lines suggesting a nitrogen over-abundance of $21.7^{+18.5}_{-11.0}\times$ solar. We interpret our results with orbiter-disk collisions in an EMRI system, in which each impact drives a shock that locally heats the disk and expels X-ray emitting debris undergoing radiation pressure-driven homologous expansion. We explore an analytical toy model that links the rapid change in absorption lines to the evolution of the ionization parameter and the photosphere radius, and suggest that $\sim 10^{-3}M_\odot$ ejected per eruption with expansion velocities up to $v_{\rm max}\sim 0.15c$, can reproduce the absorption features. With these assumptions, we show a P Cygni profile in a spherical expansion geometry qualitatively matches the observed line profiles. Our work takes a first step towards extending existing physical models for QPEs to address their implications for spectral line formation.

          Sco X-1 as seen by IXPE

 - **Abstract**
 The X-ray polarization of Sco X-1 was measured for the first time with very high significance by the Imaging X-ray Polarimeter Explorer (IXPE). A polarization degree of 1.0% $\pm$ 0.2% at a PA of 8° $\pm$ 6° at 90% confidence level (CL) in the 2-8 keV energy band is obtained, while the source was in its soft state with short flaring periods. The source state was determined by a strictly simultaneous X-ray observation campaign jointly with IXPE, which involved NICER, NuSTAR, and Insight-HXMT, allowing for a broad-band spectrum characterization and study of quasiperiodic oscillations. The spectropolarimetric analysis yielded a polarization of <3.2% for the accretion disk and a polarization of 1.3% $\pm$ 0.4% for the hard Comptonized component. A constraint on the polarization of the reflection component, modeled using relxillNS, is obtained. All the results about the polarization degree match the theoretical expectations, while the polarization angle of 8° +/- 6° at 90% CL shows a rotation of 46° $\pm$ 9° with respect to the measured position angle of the radio jet and previous marginal results by PolarLight. This may suggest a variation in the polarization angle related to the source state, which is linked to the variation of corona geometry as reported by IXPE observations of Z sources, or possibly to relativistic precession.

 - **Abstract**
 The IRAS01425+2902 wide binary system was recently reported to have both a young planet and a puzzling geometric arrangement, where the planet and binary both orbit edge-on, but misaligned by 60 deg to the circumprimary disc. This is the youngest transiting planet yet to be detected but its misalignment to the disc is difficult to explain. In this paper we explore the dissolution of an unstable triple system as a potential mechanism to produce this system. We simulate the effects of an ejection interaction in models using a highly inclined, retrograde flyby centred on the primary star of IRAS01425. The escaping star of ~0.35 solar masses inclines both the disc and binary orbits such that they have a relative misalignment of greater than 60 deg, as inferred from observations. The planet orbit also becomes inclined relative to the disc, and our interpretation predicts that the binary should have a highly eccentric orbit (e > 0.5 from our simulations). We additionally demonstrate that despite the high relative misalignment of the disc it is unlikely to be vulnerable to von Zeipel-Kozai-Lidov oscillations.

          The Moon as a Cosmic-Ray Spectrometer: Prospects for MeV Gamma-Ray Observations

 - **Abstract**
 The Moon is the closest celestial gamma-ray emitting object. Its gamma-ray emission arises from interactions between Galactic cosmic rays (CRs) and the lunar surface. While the lunar GeV gamma-ray spectrum is dominated by a continuum from hadronic decay processes, the MeV emission exhibits both continuum and distinctive spectral lines from nuclear de-excitation and radioactive decay processes. Using Geant4 Monte Carlo particle simulations, we model the lunar gamma-ray spectrum. Our results demonstrate its consistency with Fermi-LAT observations, and predict that next-generation MeV gamma-ray instruments will detect both the lunar MeV continuum and several key spectral line features, notably the $1.779~\mathrm{MeV}$ line from $\mathrm{^{28}Si}$ de-excitation enhanced by the lunar surface composition, the $e^+e^-$ annihilation line, and radioactive decay lines from $\mathrm{^{22}Na}$ ($\tau\approx3.75\,\mathrm{yr}$) and long-lived $\mathrm{^{26}Al}$ ($\tau\approx1\,\mathrm{Myr}$). These gamma-ray lines are sensitive to CRs with energies $\lesssim1\,\mathrm{GeV\,nuc^{-1}}$, offering unique temporal probes of CR activity over different timescales. Observations of the lunar MeV gamma-ray spectrum will therefore open a new window to study the current irradiation of the solar-terrestrial environment by low-energy CRs and its long-term temporal evolution.

          Optical flares due to X-ray irradiation during BeXRB major outbursts

 - **Abstract**
 Be X-ray binaries (BeXRBs) may show strong X-ray and optical variability, and can exhibit some of the brightest outbursts that break through the Eddington limit. Major X-ray outbursts are often accompanied by strong optical flares that evolve parallel to the X-ray outburst. Our goal is to provide a simple quantitative explanation for the optical flares with an application to a sample of the brightest outbursts of BeXRBs in the Magellanic clouds and the Galactic Ultra-luminous X-ray (ULX) pulsar Swift J0243.6+6124. We constructed a numerical model to study X-ray irradiation in a BeXRB system. We then conducted a parametric investigation of the model parameters and made predictions for the intensity of the optical flares based on geometric and energetic constraints. From our modeling we found that the optical emission during major outbursts is consistent with being the result of X-ray irradiation of the Be disk. For individual systems, if this method is combined with independent constraints of the geometry of the Be disk, the binary orbital plane, and the plane of the observer, it can provide estimates of the Be disk size during major outbursts. Moreover, we computed a semi-analytical relation between optical flare luminosity and X-ray luminosity that is consistent with both model predictions and observed properties of flares.

          Be X-ray binary pulsar SXP 138: non-linear spin-down, pulse and spectral characteristics

 - **Abstract**
 We study the timing and spectral properties of the Be/X-ray binary pulsar SXP 138 using four NuSTAR observations spanning 2016 to 2017. Analysis of the light curves using the Lomb-Scargle periodogram shows an increase in the spin period of SXP 138 from 140.69 to 140.85 seconds, indicating that the source is in the propeller regime. We calculate the associated rate of spin period change and characterize its non-linearity with a quadratic fit. Pulse profiles obtained by folding the light curves at the spin period show two primary high peaks and two secondary peaks for all the observations. Such features in the pulse profile can result from the combined effect of pencil and fan beam emissions from the two antipodal hotspots accompanied by the relativistic bending of photons. The energy spectra fit with both the blackbody and the power-law spectral model. The best-fit models of all observations show an overall increasing trend in the temperature of the source from 1.8 keV to 2.5 keV, during the first three observations, and a possible decreasing trend in the photon index from 1.8 to 1.7. The power-law component is dominant in the later observations, which is associated with an increase in Compton scattering and the accretion rate. SXP 138 has not been studied in detail, and this work bridges the gap by providing the first comprehensive timing and spectral analysis of this source. These findings improve our understanding of its accretion processes and emission mechanisms, placing SXP 138 in the broader context of Be/X-ray binaries.

          A dark matter hail: Detecting macroscopic dark matter with asteroids, planetary rings, and craters

 - **Abstract**
 Dark matter could be composed of macroscopic objects with large masses and geometric cross-sections spanning many decades. We investigate the potential interaction of such `stuff-sized' dark matter by considering its interactions with asteroids, planetary rings, and terrestrial bodies. This hail of dark matter could catastrophically destroy these Solar System objects, evaporate them from their orbits, or cause substantial cratering. We estimate these effects and use them to place competitive bounds on a wide, previously-unconstrained swathe of the dark matter parameter space.

 - **Abstract**
 Searching for planets analogous to Earth in terms of mass and equilibrium temperature is currently the first step in the quest for habitable conditions outside our Solar System and, ultimately, the search for life in the universe. Future missions such as PLATO or LIFE will begin to detect and characterise these small, cold planets, dedicating significant observation time to them. The aim of this work is to predict which stars are most likely to host an Earth-like planet (ELP) to avoid blind searches, minimises detection times, and thus maximises the number of detections. Using a previous study on correlations between the presence of an ELP and the properties of its system, we trained a Random Forest to recognise and classify systems as 'hosting an ELP' or 'not hosting an ELP'. The Random Forest was trained and tested on populations of synthetic planetary systems derived from the Bern model, and then applied to real observed systems. The tests conducted on the machine learning (ML) model yield precision scores of up to 0.99, indicating that 99% of the systems identified by the model as having ELPs possess at least one. Among the few real observed systems that have been tested, 44 have been selected as having a high probability of hosting an ELP, and a quick study of the stability of these systems confirms that the presence of an Earth-like planet within them would leave them stable. The excellent results obtained from the tests conducted on the ML model demonstrate its ability to recognise the typical architectures of systems with or without ELPs within populations derived from the Bern model. If we assume that the Bern model adequately describes the architecture of real systems, then such a tool can prove indispensable in the search for Earth-like planets. A similar approach could be applied to other planetary system formation models to validate those predictions.

          Modelling the emergence and evolution of the rotation-activity relation

 - **Abstract**
 Main-sequence stars follow a well-defined rotation-activity relation. There are two primary regimes: saturated, where the fractional X-ray luminosity $\log(L_{\rm X}/L_*)$ is approximately constant, and unsaturated, where the fractional X-ray luminosity decreases with increasing Rossby number (or decreasing rotation rate). Pre-main sequence (PMS) stars have a larger scatter in $\log(L_{\rm X}/L_*)$ than main-sequence stars, are observed to have saturated levels of X-ray emission, and do not follow the rotation-activity relation. We investigate how PMS stars evolve in the rotation-activity plane and the timescale over which the X-ray rotation-activity relation emerges. Using observational data of $\sim$600 stars from four PMS clusters, stellar internal structure models, a rotational evolution model, and observed X-ray luminosity trends with age, we simulate the evolution of the PMS stars in the rotation-activity plane up to ages of 100 Myr. Our model reproduces the rotation-activity relation found for main-sequence stars, with higher-mass stars beginning to form the unsaturated regime from around 10 Myr. After $\sim$25 Myr, the gradient of the unsaturated regime matches that found for main-sequence stars. For stars of mass greater than 0.6 M$_{\odot}$, the maximum age by which a star has left the saturated regime correlates with when the star leaves the PMS. We find that an intra-cluster age spread is a key factor in contributing to the observed scatter in $\log(L_{\rm X}/L_*)$, particularly for ages < 10 Myr.

 - **Abstract**
 The subluminous red nova (SLRN) ZTF SLRN-2020 is the most compelling direct detection of a planet being consumed by its host star, a scenario known as a planetary engulfment event. We present JWST spectroscopy of ZTF SLRN-2020 taken +830 d after its optical emission peak using the NIRSpec fixed-slit $3-5$ $\mu$m high-resolution grating and the MIRI $5-12$ $\mu$m low-resolution spectrometer. NIRSpec reveals the $^{12}$CO fundamental band ($\nu=1-0$) in emission at $\sim4.7$ $\mu$m, Brackett-$\alpha$ emission, and the potential detection of PH$_3$ in emission at $\sim4.3$ $\mu$m. The JWST spectra are consistent with the claim that ZTF SLRN-2020 arose from a planetary engulfment event. We utilize DUSTY to model the late-time $\sim1-12$ $\mu$m spectral energy distribution (SED) of ZTF SLRN-2020, where the best-fit parameters indicate the presence of warm, $720^{+80}_{-50}$ K, circumstellar dust with a total dust mass of Log$\left(\frac{M_\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{M}_\odot}\right)=-10.61^{+0.08}_{-0.16}$ M$_\odot$. We also fit a DUSTY model to archival photometry taken +320 d after peak that suggested the presence of a cooler, T$_\mathrm{d}=280^{+450}_{-20}$ K, and more massive, Log$\left(\frac{M_\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{M}_\odot}\right)=-5.89^{+0.29}_{-3.21}$, circumstellar dust component. Assuming the cool component originates from the ZTF SLRN-2020 ejecta, we interpret the warm component as fallback from the ejecta. From the late-time SED model we measure a luminosity of L$_* = 0.29^{+0.03}_{-0.06}$ L$_\odot$ for the remnant host star, which is consistent with a $\sim0.7$ M$_\odot$ K-type star that should not yet have evolved off the main sequence. If ZTF SLRN-2020 was not triggered by stellar evolution, we suggest that the planetary engulfment was due to orbital decay from tidal interactions between the planet and the host star.

          Dynamical dark energy with AdS-dS transitions vs. Baryon Acoustic Oscillations at $z =$ 2.3-2.4

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, written in memory of Alexei Starobinsky, we discuss the observational viability of the Ph-$\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model - a dynamical dark energy scenario based on a phantom scalar field undergoing an anti-de Sitter (AdS) to de Sitter (dS) transition - and revisit the Sahni-Shtanov braneworld model in light of updated BAO Ly-$\alpha$ data at $z \sim 2.3$. Both models are able to remain consistent with Planck CMB data while offering potential resolutions to the $H_0$ tension. In both cases, the expansion rate $H(z)$ is suppressed relative to Planck-$\Lambda$CDM at high redshift and enhanced at low redshift, while remaining consistent with the comoving distance to recombination as estimated by Planck-$\Lambda$CDM. Comparing model predictions with BAO-inferred values of $H(z)$, we find that SDSS Ly-$\alpha$ data at $z \approx 2.33$ mildly favor such dynamical models, whereas the recent DESI Ly-$\alpha$ measurements agree more closely with $\Lambda$CDM. Although current high-redshift BAO data do not decisively favor one model over another, our findings illustrate how frameworks originally developed to address earlier anomalies - such as the braneworld scenario - may gain renewed relevance in confronting today's cosmological tensions.

          On the Origin of Spectral Features Observed during Thermonuclear X-ray Bursts and in the Aftermath Emission of a Long Burst from 4U 1820-30

 - **Abstract**
 We study 15 thermonuclear X-ray bursts from 4U 1820--30 observed with the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER). We find evidence of a narrow emission line at 1.0 keV and three absorption lines at 1.7, 3.0, and 3.75 keV, primarily around the photospheric radius expansion phase of most bursts. The 1.0 keV emission line remains constant, while the absorption features, attributed to wind-ejected species, are stable but show slight energy shifts, likely due to combined effects of Doppler and gravitational redshifts. We also examine with NICER the ``aftermath'' of a long X-ray burst (a candidate superburst observed by MAXI) on 2021 August 23 and 24. The aftermath emission recovers within half a day from a flux depression. During this recovery phase, we detect two emission lines at 0.7 and 1 keV, along with three absorption lines whose energies decreased to 1.57, 2.64, and 3.64 keV. Given the nature of the helium white-dwarf companion, these absorption lines during the aftermath may originate from an accretion flow, but only if the accretion environment is significantly contaminated by nuclear ashes from the superburst. This provides evidence of temporary metal enhancement in the accreted material due to strong wind loss. Moreover, we suggest that the absorption features observed during the short X-ray bursts and in the superburst aftermath share a common origin in heavy nuclear ashes enriched with elements like Si, Ar, Ca, or Ti, either from the burst wind or from an accretion flow contaminated by the burst wind.

          Measuring Cosmic Growth Rate with CSST Spectroscopic Survey and Fast Radio Burst

 - **Abstract**
 The cosmic growth rate, which is related to peculiar velocity and is a primary scientific objective of galaxy spectroscopic surveys, can be inferred from the Redshift Space Distortion effect and the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect. However, the reconstruction noise power spectrum of the radial velocity field in kSZ is significantly dependent on the measurement of the small-scale galaxy-electron power spectrum $P_{ge}$. In this study, we thoroughly discuss the enhancement of cosmic growth rate measurements facilitated by Fast Radio Bursts, which probe the electron density of the universe along their propagation paths to provide crucial additional information on $P_{ge}$. Subsequently, we utilize future spectroscopic surveys from the Chinese Space Station Telescope and the CMB-S4 experiment, combined with FRB dispersion measures, to achieve precise measurements of the cosmic growth rate at redshifts $z_g = 0.15,0.45,0.75$. Employing Fisher matrix forecasting analysis, we anticipate that constraints on $f\sigma_8$ will reach a precision of 0.001 with a sample size of $10^6$ FRBs. Furthermore, we perform a global analysis using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods to constrain key parameters of three distinct dark energy models and a modified gravity model based on cosmic growth rate measurements. The results demonstrate that these refined $f\sigma_8$ measurements considerably enhance the constraints on relevant cosmological parameters compared to those obtained from Planck. As the number of observed FRBs increases, alongside more precise galaxy surveys and next-generation CMB observations, new opportunities will arise for constraining cosmological models using the kSZ effect and for developing novel cosmological applications of FRBs.

 - **Abstract**
 Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) ions are crucial intermediates in interstellar chemistry and may play a key role in the infrared emission features observed in space. Here, we investigate the infrared spectra of the indenyl (C$_9$H$_7^-$) and fluorenyl (C$_{13}$H$_9^-$) anions and the indenyl cation (C$_9$H$_7^+$) using infrared pre-dissociation (IRPD) spectroscopy. The experiments were performed in a cryogenic 22 pole ion trap at the FELion beamline of the tunable free-electron laser FELIX. Spectral analysis of the two anionic PAHs, in combination with density functional theory (DFT) computations, revealed key vibrational modes near 1300 cm$^{-1}$, making these ions potential carriers of the 7.7 {\mu}m PAH emission band seen in many astronomical objects. The feature-rich spectrum of cationic indenyl could not be entirely explained by modeling through time-independent anharmonic DFT calculations. Although a better match has been achieved through molecular dynamics simulations, we cannot completely rule out the presence of multiple cationic isomers of the H-loss fragments of indene in the experiments.

          A search for periodic activity in multi-peaked long gamma-ray bursts

 - **Abstract**
 A sizeable fraction of gamma-ray burst (GRB) light curves (LCs) features a sequence of peaks, which holds information on the unknown way energy is dissipated into gamma-rays over time. Traditional searches for periodic signals in GRB LCs turned out to be inconclusive, partly because they are challenging as a consequence of the short-lived, coloured-noise, and non-stationary nature of the LCs themselves. Yet, recent claims have revived the issue. We searched for periodic components in GRB LCs through a new approach to GRBs, which escapes most of the issues faced by traditional techniques. We identified peaks through a well tested algorithm and selected GRBs with at least 10 peaks out of 5 GRB catalogues (Swift/BAT, CGRO/BATSE, Fermi/GBM, Insight-HXMT, BeppoSAX/GRBM). Each GRB was simply treated as a discrete point process, whose realisation coincides with the sequence of peak times. We searched for possible periodic recurrences based on the multinomial distribution, after accounting for the clustering of peaks due to the non-stationarity of the GRB signals. The best candidate has a p-value of 3e-4 that there is no periodic recurrence. However, accounting for the multiple trials of 555 searched GRBs, its statistical significance is demoted to 17%. The overall distribution of the p-values obtained for all GRBs is compatible with a uniform distribution in [0,1]. We found no robust evidence for multi-peaked GRBs with periodic recurrences. We can exclude that a sizeable fraction (>~ 0.75) of peaks of each GRB with at least 10 peaks are periodic. While our result does not necessarily clash with claimed periodicities based on Fourier techniques, it constrains the putative recurrent behaviour, which would not manifest itself through the sequence of peaks, but, evidently, in a more elusive way.

 - **Abstract**
 We provide an updated test for modifications of gravity from a sample of wide-binary stars from GAIA DR3, and their sky-projected relative velocities. Here we extend on our earlier 2023 study, using several updated selection cuts aimed at reducing contamination from triple systems with an undetected third star. We also use improved mass estimates from FLAMES, and we add refinements to previous modelling of the triple and other populations and the model-fitting. We fit histograms of observed vs Newtonian velocity differences to a flexible mixture of binary + triple populations with realistic eccentricity distributions, plus unbound flyby and random-chance populations. We find as before that Newtonian models provide a significantly better fit than MOND, though improved understanding of the triple population is necessary to make this fully decisive.

 - **Abstract**
 Classical Be stars are well known to eject mass, but the details governing the initial distribution and evolution of this matter into a disk are poorly constrained by observations. By combining high-cadence spectroscopy with contemporaneous space photometry from TESS, we have sampled about 30 mass ejection events in 13 Be stars. Our goal is to constrain the geometrical and kinematic properties of the ejecta, facilitating the investigation into the initial conditions and evolution, and understanding its interactions with preexisting material. The photometric variability is analyzed together with measurements of the rapidly changing emission features to identify the onset of outburst events and obtain information about the geometry of the ejecta and its evolution. All Be stars observed with sufficiently high cadence exhibit rapid oscillations of line asymmetry with a single frequency in the days following the start of the event. The emission asymmetry cycles break down after roughly 5 - 10 cycles, with the emission line profile converging toward approximate symmetry. In photometry, several frequencies typically emerge at relatively high amplitude at some point during the mass ejection process. In all observed cases, freshly ejected material was initially within a narrow azimuthal range, indicating it was launched from a localized region on the star. The material orbits the star with a frequency consistent with the near-surface Keplerian orbital frequency. This material circularizes into a disk configuration after several orbital timescales. This is true whether or not there was a preexisting disk. We find no evidence for precursor phases prior to the ejection of mass in our sample. The several photometric frequencies that emerge during outburst are at least partially stellar in origin. (Abstract abridged)

 - **Abstract**
 Many neutron star low-mass X-ray binaries (NS LMXBs) with short orbital periods (~hours) cycle between outburst and quiescent phases, and thus provide an excellent way to study the accretion process. The cause of such outbursts is believed to be thermal-viscous instability in the accretion disc. However, some of these transient sources show unusually long outbursts. For example, EXO 0748-676 remained in outburst for at least 23 years before entering a quiescence, only to re-emerge 16 years later. We aim to investigate if such long outbursts could be due to the usual disc instability, or if any other mechanism is required. In order to address this question, we systematically compare various properties of long outburst and short outburst NS LMXBs. For this, we analyze the long-term X-ray light curves of many short orbital period (hours) NS LMXBs, examining the outburst duration and the inferred accretion rate, and estimate the accretion disc mass. Our study shows that long outburst sources are well-separated from the short outburst ones in parameter spaces involving accretion rate, disc mass, outburst duration, etc. in four ways. This implies that the thermal-viscous instability in the disc cannot explain the long outbursts, but could explain the short ones. Moreover, we discuss that both donor star related and disc related models have difficulties in explaining long outbursts. Our finding will be crucial to understanding the accretion process of transiently accreting neutron stars and black holes.

 - **Abstract**
 The recent observational evidence of deviations from the $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model points towards the presence of evolving dark energy. The simplest possibility consists of a cosmological scalar field $\varphi$, dubbed quintessence, driving the accelerated expansion. We assess the evidence for the existence of such a scalar field. We find that, if the accelerated expansion is driven by quintessence, the data favour a potential energy $V(\varphi)$ that is concave, i.e., $m^2=d^2V/d\varphi^2<0$. Furthermore, and more significantly, the data strongly favour a scalar field that is non-minimally coupled to gravity (Bayes factor $\log(B) = 7.34 \pm 0.60$), leading to time variations in the gravitational constant on cosmological scales, and the existence of fifth forces on smaller scales. The fact that we do not observe such fifth forces implies that either new physics must come into play on non-cosmological scales or that quintessence is an unlikely explanation for the observed cosmic acceleration.

 - **Abstract**
 High order corrections to the perihelion precession are obtained in non-Newtonian central potentials, via complex analysis techniques. The result is an exact series expansion whose terms, for a perturbation of the form $\delta V=\frac{\gamma}{r^{s}}$, are calculated in closed form. To validate the method, the series is applied to the specific case of s=3, and the results are compared with those presented in literature, which are relate to the Schwarzschild metric. As a further test, a numerical simulation was carried out for the case where s=4. The algebraic calculations and numerical simulations were carried out via software with symbolic capabilities.

 - **Abstract**
 The extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and X-ray radiation emitted during solar flares has been shown to significantly increase the electron density of the Earth's ionosphere. During flares, quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs) in X-ray flux originating in the corona have previously been linked to subsequent pulsations in the Earth's ionospheric D-region. Similar pulsations have been detected in chromospheric EUV emission, although their impact on the Earth's ionosphere has not previously been investigated. Here, for the first time, synchronous pulsations were detected in solar EUV emission and ionospheric Total Electron Content (TEC) measurements. Using wavelet and periodogram analysis, we detect QPPs with approximately 85 second periods in chromospheric EUV emission lines (He II 304 Å, C III 977 Å and H I 972 Å) from the Solar Dynamics Observatory Extreme Ultraviolet Variability Experiment (SDO/EVE) during the impulsive phase of an X5.4 flare on March 7, 2012. These lines contribute to ionization in the ionospheric E- and F-regions, resulting in subsequent variations of electron density with the same periodicity, which was detected in TEC measurements. This work demonstrates that the Earth's ionosphere is responsive to fine-scale fluctuations in EUV emission during flares, with a time delay of approximately 30 seconds found. These findings may have applications in atmospheric modelling and solar-terrestrial studies, including the calculation of ionospheric recombination rates.

 - **Abstract**
 Fast moving celestial objects are characterized by velocities across the celestial sphere that significantly differ from the motions of background stars. In observational images, these objects exhibit distinct shapes, contrasting with the typical appearances of stars. Depending on the observational method employed, these celestial entities may be designated as near-Earth objects or asteroids. Historically, fast moving celestial objects have been observed using ground-based telescopes, where the relative stability of stars and Earth facilitated effective image differencing techniques alongside traditional fast moving celestial object detection and classification algorithms. However, the growing prevalence of space-based telescopes, along with their diverse observational modes, produces images with different properties, rendering conventional methods less effective. This paper presents a novel algorithm for detecting fast moving celestial objects within star fields. Our approach enhances state-of-the-art fast moving celestial object detection neural networks by transforming them into physical-inspired neural networks. These neural networks leverage the point spread function of the telescope and the specific observational mode as prior information; they can directly identify moving fast moving celestial objects within star fields without requiring additional training, thereby addressing the limitations of traditional techniques. Additionally, all neural networks are integrated using the mixture of experts technique, forming a comprehensive fast moving celestial object detection algorithm. We have evaluated our algorithm using simulated observational data that mimics various observations carried out by space based telescope scenarios and real observation images. Results demonstrate that our method effectively detects fast moving celestial objects across different observational modes.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents a study of the dependence of the simulated intensities of recombination lines from hydrogen and helium atoms on the number of $n\ell$-resolved principal quantum numbers included in the calculations. We simulate hydrogen and helium emitting astrophysical plasmas using the code Cloudy and show that, if not enough $n\ell$-resolved levels are included, recombination line intensities can be predicted with significant errors than can be more than 30\% for H~I IR lines and 10\% for He~I optical lines ($\sim$20\% for He~I IR recombination lines) at densities $\sim1\text{cm}^{-3}$, comparable to interstellar medium. This can have consequences in several spectroscopic studies where high accuracy is required, such as primordial helium abundance determination. Our results indicate that the minimum number of resolved levels included in the simulated hydrogen and helium ions of our spectral emission models should be adjusted to the specific lines to be predicted, as well as to the temperature and density conditions of the simulated plasma.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent DESI DR2 observations indicate that dark energy has crossed from phantom to quintessence regime, a behavior known as the quintom-B realization. In this work we constrain dynamical dark energy and modified gravity using the swampland Trans-Planckian Censorship Conjecture (TCC), which forbids eternal acceleration since in this case any trans-Planckian quantum fluctuation would eventually stretch beyond the Hubble radius, breaking the applicability of any effective field theory and cosmological techniques. By combining DESI DR2 data with the TCC criterion, we impose tight constraints on the dark energy equation of state and its parameter space in scenarios such as the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder, Barboza-Alcaniz, Jassal-Bagla-Padmanabhan, EXP and LOG parameterizations, significantly constraining the quintom-A behavior. Also we examine models within the framework of $f(T)$ and $f(Q)$ modified gravity theories, demonstrating that TCC is very powerful to constrain or exclude them, a result that indicates the necessity to consider infrared modifications on General Relativity apart from the usual ultraviolet ones. Our findings imply that viable dynamical dark energy scenarios must asymptotically transit to deceleration, shedding light on new physics consistent with both cosmological observations and quantum gravity principles.

 - **Abstract**
 Being one of the first exoplanets observed by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), WASP-39 b has become an iconic target and many transit spectra recorded with different instruments (NIRISS, NIRCAM, NIRSpec G395H, NIRSpec PRISM and MIRI) are currently available, allowing in-depth studies of its atmosphere. We present here a novel approach to interpret WASP-39 b's transit spectroscopic data, consisting of a multi-step process where ab initio equilibrium chemistry models and blind retrievals are used iteratively to find physically robust, optimal solutions. Following this approach, we have identified a new scenario to explain WASP-39 b's atmospheric composition, in which silicon-based chemistry plays a major role. In this scenario, SiO may explain the spectral absorption at 4.1 $\mu$m, currently interpreted as being due to SO$_2$. SiO and the other gas species identified by the retrieval models, i.e. H$_2$O, CO$_2$, Na and K, are consistent with an atmosphere in chemical equilibrium with a temperature-pressure profile constrained by H$_2$O and CO$_2$ absorption bands. In addition, silicate clouds and hazes can produce the spectral features observed by MIRI in the spectral window 5-12 $\mu$m. While we advocate the need for more data, possibly at higher spectral resolution, to confirm our results for WASP-39 b's atmospheric composition, we highlight a refined atmospheric retrieval strategy with pre-selection and post-reconstruction to guide the next generation of transit spectroscopy.

 - **Abstract**
 Affleck-Dine (AD) baryogenesis can produce the baryon asymmetry of the Universe through the $CP$-violating dynamics of AD field. The field generally fragments into Q-balls, whose rapid decay induces enhanced gravitational waves. In this Letter, we investigate the anisotropies in this gravitational wave background as a new essential observable for AD baryogenesis. The evolution of AD field causes non-Gaussian baryonic isocurvature perturbations, and the non-Gaussianity modulates the spatial distribution of Q-balls on large scales, resulting in large-scale anisotropies in the Q-ball-induced gravitational wave background. We present that the anisotropies can be significantly large with a reduced angular power spectrum $\sim 10^{-2}$, and can be detected by future experiments like LISA. Moreover, these anisotropies universally reveal the $CP$-violating dynamics of AD field, opening a novel road to explore the longstanding baryon asymmetry puzzle.

 - **Abstract**
 Binary black hole systems (BBHs) have become a vivid reality in astrophysics as stellar-mass black hole mergers are now detected through their related gravitational wave emission during the merger stage. If many studies were recently dedicated to the last stages of BBH where black holes are surrounded by a circumbinary disk (CBD), the structure of these systems prior to the formation of the CBD remains mostly unexplored. The aim of the present article is to investigate the potential modifications induced by the presence of a secondary black hole onto the structure of the accretion disk surrounding the primary black hole. We performed 2D classical hydrodynamical simulations of an accretion disk surrounding the primary black hole while taking into account all gravitational effects induced by both the primary black hole and the secondary black hole orbiting on circular orbits around the center of mass of the this http URL report three main effects of the presence of a secondary black hole orbiting a circular orbit beyond the outer edge of the accretion disk: 1/ the outer radius of the accretion disk is significantly reduced and its ratio to the black hole separation is directly linked to only the mass ratio of the black holes; 2/ two spiral arms are visible in the gas density structure of the disk and 3/ the outer edge of the accretion disk exhibits an elliptical shape that mainly depends on the mass ratio of the black holes. Our results show that an accretion disk orbiting a primary black hole in a pre-CBD BBH exhibits specific features induced by the gravitational force generated by the presence of a secondary black hole beyond its outer edge. Such features, directly linked to the binary separation and mass ratio, has therefore the potential to help in the search and identification of BBH in the pre-CBD stage.

 - **Abstract**
 The inflationary diffusion of (pseudo-)scalar fields with discrete symmetries can seed the formation of a gas of closed domain walls after inflation, when the distance between degenerate minima in field space is not too far from the inflationary Hubble scale. Primordial black holes (PBHs) can then be formed once sufficiently heavy domain walls re-enter the Hubble sphere. In this scenario, inflation determines a distinctive PBH mass distribution that is rather flat and can thus lead to a sizable total abundance of PBHs, while avoiding some of the downsides of PBH formation from critical collapse. We show that generic QCD axion models, with decay constant close to the inflationary Hubble scale, can yield up to $1\%$ of the dark matter (DM) today in the form of PBHs, while being compatible with isocurvature constraints from Cosmic Microwave Background observations. This occurs for values of axion decay constants around $f_a\simeq 10^{8}~\text{GeV}$, that is the region targeted by axion helioscopes and partially constrained by astrophysical observations. The resulting PBHs have \textit{stupendously} large masses, above $10^{11}M_\odot$, and their existence can be probed by Large Scale Structure observations. Larger PBH abundances can be generated by axion-like particles. Alternatively, in scenarios where isocurvature constraints can be relaxed, we find that the totality of the DM can be produced by the QCD axion misalignment mechanism, accompanied by a ${\cal O}(10^{-3})$ DM fraction in PBHs of masses $(10^5-10^6)~M_\odot$. These can act as seeds for the formation of massive black holes at large redshifts, as suggested by recent JWST observations.

 - **Abstract**
 (abridged) The black hole Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) is a prime target for next-generation Earth-space very-long-baseline interferometry missions such as the Black Hole Explorer (BHEX), which aims to probe baselines of the order of 20 G$\lambda$. At these baselines, Sgr A* observations will be affected by the diffractive scattering effects from the interstellar medium (ISM). Therefore, we study how different parameter choices for turbulence in the ISM affect BHEX's observational capabilities to probe strong lensing features of Sgr A*. By using a simple geometric model of concentric Gaussian rings for Sgr A*'s photon ring signal and observing at 320 GHz, we find that the BHEX-ALMA baseline has the required sensitivity to observe Sgr A* for a broad range of values of the power-law index of density fluctuations in the ISM and the inner scale of turbulence. For other baselines with moderate sensitivities, a strong need for observations at shorter scales of $\approx$ 13.5 G$\lambda$ is identified. For this purpose, an orbit migration scheme is proposed. It is modeled using both chemical propulsion (CP)-based Hohmann transfers and electric propulsion (EP)-based orbit raising with the result that a CP-based transfer can be performed in a matter of hours, but with a significantly higher fuel requirement as compared to EP, which however requires a transfer time of around 6 weeks. The consequences of these orbits for probing Sgr A*'s spacetime is studied by quantifying the spatial resolution, temporal resolution and the angular sampling of the photon ring signal in the Fourier coverage of each of these orbits. We show that higher orbits isolate spacetime features while sacrificing both, signal lost to scattering and temporal resolution, but gain greater access to the morphology of the photon ring.

          Double White Dwarf Tides with Multi-messenger Measurements

 - **Abstract**
 Short-period Galactic double white dwarf (DWD) systems will be observable both in visible light through photometric monitoring and in mHz-range gravitational waves (GWs) with forthcoming space-based laser interferometry such as LISA. When only photometric variability is used to measure DWD intrinsic properties, there is a degeneracy between the chirp mass and binary tidal interaction, as orbital frequency time derivative is set by both GW radiation and tides. Without expensive radial velocity data from spectroscopic monitoring, this degeneracy may be lifted in principle by directly measuring the second time derivative of the orbital frequency through photometric monitoring over an ultra-long time baseline. Alternatively, the degeneracy can be removed by exploiting information in both photometric variability and the coherent GW waveform. Investigating both approaches, we find that direct measurement of the second time derivative is likely infeasible for most DWDs, while the multi-messenger method will disentangle measurements of the chirp mass and the binary moments of inertia, for a large sample of tidally locked systems. The latter information will enable empirical tests of WD structure models with finite temperature effects.

 - **Abstract**
 We dig into the semi-classical description of gravity by studying one-loop corrections to primordial power spectra generated during cosmic inflation from gravitational nonlinear interactions. In the realm of the Effective Field Theory (EFT) of inflationary fluctuations, we renormalize the quadratic Lagrangian dictating the linear dynamics of gauge-invariant perturbations. Since gravity is a non-renormalizable theory, this procedure is performed perturbatively in terms of negative powers of the EFT strong coupling scales. Since the interactions we consider are purely gravitational, they are ubiquitous and independent of the details of the EFT. Our results are thus relevant for a large class of approximately scale-invariant inflationary scenarios, be them driven by a single scalar field with canonical kinetic terms, or with a non-canonical structure \textit{à la} $P(X,\phi)$, or for an effective single-field description at the level of fluctuations only and emerging from a covariant multifield theory. Using dimensional regularization, we show that time-dependent Ultra-Violet (UV) divergences appearing at the loop level can be canceled at all times by an appropriate splitting of the bare Lagrangian into renormalized operators and counterterms. Moreover, we explicitly compute all finite contributions to the loops and we prove that, taking into account backreaction, the final one-loop renormalized power spectra of both the primordial curvature perturbation and of gravitational waves are exactly conserved on super-horizon scales. Conclusions of our work imply that the scalar and tensor propagation speeds are immune to radiative corrections from gravitational nonlinearities. We discuss a first application to multifield inflation.

          What it takes to solve the Hubble tension through scale-dependent modifications of the primordial power spectrum

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate scale-dependent modifications to the primordial scalar power spectrum as potential solutions to the Hubble tension. We use the Fisher-bias formalism, recently adapted to examine perturbed recombination solutions to the Hubble tension, and extend its range of validity with an iterative method. We first analyze the Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy data, demonstrating the existence of modifications to the primordial power spectrum capable of fully resolving the tension between Planck and SH0ES. As a proof of concept, we interpret these solutions in terms of small, time-dependent variations in the first slow roll parameter or in the sound speed of curvature perturbations during a stage of primordial inflation. However, these solutions are associated with a low total matter density $\Omega_m$, which makes them inconsistent with baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) and uncalibrated supernovae (SNIa) data. When incorporating additional BOSS and PantheonPlus data, the solutions that reduce the Hubble tension tend to overfit Planck CMB data to compensate for the worsened fit to BAO and SNIa data, making them less compelling. These findings suggest that modifying the primordial power spectrum alone is unlikely to provide a robust resolution to the tension and highlight how the viability of such data-driven solutions depends on the specific datasets considered, emphasizing the role of future high-precision observations in further constraining possible resolutions to the tension.

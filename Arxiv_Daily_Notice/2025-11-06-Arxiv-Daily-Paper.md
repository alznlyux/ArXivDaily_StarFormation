- **Abstract**
 Solar-flare forecasting has been extensively researched yet remains an open problem. In this paper, we investigate the contributions of elastic distance measures for detecting patterns in the solar-flare dataset, SWAN-SF. We employ a simple $k$-medoids clustering algorithm to evaluate the effectiveness of advanced, high-dimensional distance metrics. Our results show that, despite thorough optimization, none of the elastic distances outperform Euclidean distance by a significant margin. We demonstrate that, although elastic measures have shown promise for univariate time series, when applied to the multivariate time series of SWAN-SF, characterized by the high stochasticity of solar activity, they effectively collapse to Euclidean distance. We conduct thousands of experiments and present both quantitative and qualitative evidence supporting this finding.

- **Abstract**
 Precise measurements of a star's radial velocity (RV) made using extremely stable, high resolution, optical or near infrared spectrographs can be used to determine the masses and orbital parameters of gravitationally-bound extra-solar planets (exoplanets). Indeed, RV surveys and follow up efforts have provided the vast majority of published exoplanet mass measurements and in doing so have enabled studies into exoplanet interior and atmospheric compositions. Here we review the current state of the RV field, with particular attention paid to: -The evolution of precise RV methodologies over the past two decades -Modern RV spectrograph designs that can be calibrated to a stability level of better than 50 cm/s over timescales of years -RV data reduction and post-processing techniques that minimize the impact of instrument systematics and stellar variability -Techniques for detecting exoplanets in RV data and disentangling planetary signals from stellar variability

- **Abstract**
 Be stars are rapidly rotating B-type stars that exhibit Balmer emission lines in their optical spectra. These stars play an important role in studies of stellar evolution and disk structures. In this work, we carried out a systematic search for Be stars based on LAMOST spectroscopic data. Using low-resolution spectra from LAMOST DR11, we constructed a data set and developed a classification model that combines long short-term memory networks and convolutional neural networks , achieving a testing accuracy of 97.86%. The trained model was then applied to spectra with signal-to-noise ratios greater than 10, yielding 55,667 B-type candidates. With the aid of the MKCLASS automated classification tool and manual verification, we finally confirmed 40,223 B-type spectra. By cross-matching with published H{\alpha} emission-line star catalogs, we obtained a sample of 8298 Be stars, including 3787 previously reported Be stars and 4511 newly discovered. Furthermore, by incorporating color information, we classified the Be star sample into Herbig Be stars and Classical Be stars. In total, we identified 3363 Classical Be stars and 35 Herbig Be stars. The B-type and Be star catalogs derived in this study, together with the code used for model training, have been publicly released to facilitate community research.

- **Abstract**
 We analyze the hierarchical structure in the Rosette Molecular Cloud (RMC) using $^{13}$CO J=1-0 data from the Milky Way Imaging Scroll Painting (MWISP) survey with a non-binary Dendrogram algorithm that allows multiple branches to emerge from parent structures. A total of 588 substructures are identified, including 458 leaves and 130 branches. The physical parameters of the substructures, including peak brightness temperature ($T_{\rm peak}$), brightness temperature difference ($T_{\rm diff}$), radius ($R$), mass ($M$), velocity dispersion ($\sigma_v$), and surface density ($\Sigma$), are characterized. The $T_{\rm peak}$ and $T_{\rm diff}$ distributions follow exponential functions with characteristic values above $5\sigma_{\rm RMS}$. The statistical properties and scaling relations, i.e., $\sigma_v$-$R$, $M$-$R$, and $\sigma_v$-$R\Sigma$ relations are in general consistent with those from traditional segmentation methods. The mass and radius follow power-law distributions with exponents of 2.2-2.5, with slightly flatter slopes for substructures inside the HII region. The velocity dispersion scales weakly with radius ($\sigma_v \propto R^{0.45\pm 0.03}$, $r = 0.58$), but shows a tighter correlation with the product of surface density and size ($\sigma_v \propto (\Sigma R)^{0.29\pm 0.01}$, $r = 0.73$). Self-gravitating substructures are found across scales from $\sim$0.2 to 10 pc, and nearly all structures with peak brightness above 4 K are gravitationally bound ($\alpha_{\rm vir} < 2$). The fraction of bound structures increases with mass, size, and surface density, supporting the scenario of global hierarchical collapse (GHC) for the evolution of molecular clouds, in which molecular clouds and their substructures are undergoing multiscale collapse.

- **Abstract**
 We present high sensitivity, low radio frequency continuum observations of the ELAIS-N1 field with 32 hours of observations of the uGMRT Band-2 ($120-250$ MHz) covering $5.86\,\text{deg}^2$ area, achieving a central off-source RMS noise of $237\,\mu\mathrm{Jy}/\mathrm{beam}$ with a resolution of $11.45''$ at the central frequency of 183 MHz. A radio source catalogue of 1027 sources statistically matches with similar observations at different frequencies within the sensitivity range of the uGMRT. The calibrated data is further used to characterise the dominant foreground, the Diffuse Galactic Synchrotron Emission (DGSE), in angular scale and frequency regime. We derived the angular power spectrum (APS) of DGSE in two ways: image-based estimator (i-APS) and visibility-based Tapered Gridded Estimator (TGE; hereafter as t-APS). We assess the characteristics of DGSE with a power-law form of $C_{\ell} = A({1000}/{\ell})^{\beta}$. Combining data from Band-2 and earlier Band-3 observations, we derived a spectral variation of $C_{\ell}$ in the form of $C_{\ell} = A{\nu^{-2{\alpha}}}{\ell^{-{\beta}}}$. Our result indicates a spectral break at $\nu = 230\,{\pm}\,5$ MHz, corresponding to a synchrotron age of $t_\text{syn} = 106\,{\pm}\,1$ Myr for the cosmic-ray electrons (CRe). This break result suggests a low-energy cutoff in the CRe population, leading to spectral curvature at low frequencies. Using both of the techniques, i-APS and t-APS, we find that the mean spectral index $\alpha$ and power-law index $\beta$ are consistent within the frequency range $120-500$ MHz.

          Nominal thresholds for good astrometric fits, and prospects for binary detectability, for the full extended \textit{Gaia} mission

- **Abstract**
 The full extended Gaia mission spans slightly over 10 years of data, whilst the current data releases represent only a fraction of that timescale (DR3, 34 months). The longer baseline improves the quality of astrometric fits, lowering the noise floor and making consistently bad fits (for example, due to binarity) more apparent. In this paper, we use simulated binaries from the Gaia Universe Model to examine the long-term astrometric behaviour of single stars and stellar binaries. We calculate nominal upper limits on the spread of goodness of astrometric fits for well-behaved single stars. Specifically, for the RUWE parameter, for upcoming DR4 ($\rm RUWE_{lim}=1.15$) and DR5 ($\rm RUWE_{lim}=1.11$), using the full mission nominal scanning law. These can be used to identify poor astrometric fits, and in particular can flag potential binary systems. We show the increase in the number and type of binaries detectable through RUWE. With our updated RUWE thresholds, the number of detectable low-period binaries increases by 5-10% with each subsequent data release, suggesting detections may be possible for orbital periods down to days. The number of detectable long-period systems increases by 10-20%, with periods up to 100 years, causing significant deviations in low moderate-eccentricity binaries. Very eccentric systems with much longer periods (thousands of years) can still be detected if they pass through periapse during the observing window. Finally, we compare our results to the analytic estimate for the spread in UWE, which we predict from a $\chi$-distribution moderated by the number of observations. These agree with our inferred population limits but suggest that we may be biased by a small number of poorly sampled systems. In regions of the sky that are more frequently observed, lower limits could be employed, potentially bringing even more binaries above the threshold for detectability.

- **Abstract**
 We present a detailed analysis of the early post-mass-transfer binary HD 698 (V742 Cas) combining high-resolution optical spectroscopy, long-baseline interferometry, and radiative-transfer modeling. Counter-phased radial-velocity curves yield a circular orbit with P=55.927+/-0.001 d and component masses M_Be=7.48+/-0.07 M_sun and M_comp=1.23+/-0.02 M_sun. The Be primary is traced by broad H alpha wings, while narrow metallic absorption lines arise from a slowly rotating companion. The interferometric separation implies a dynamical distance of 888+/-5 pc. The spectral energy distribution is reproduced with E(B-V)=0.321+/-0.016 and a viscous decretion disk of base density rho_0~5x10^12 g cm^-3 at r=R_eq, declining radially as rho(r)~r^-n with n=3.0. The companion is luminous and inflated, with T_eff=10.0(+0.2,-0.1) kK, R_comp=13.1+/-0.2 R_sun, and log(L/L_sun)=3.19, contributing significantly to the flux (L_comp/L_Be~0.3). Spectral line mismatches further suggest a hydrogen-poor, CNO-processed atmosphere, consistent with a stripped-envelope star. HD 698 thus adds to the emerging class of Be+bloated OB binaries, capturing a brief post-mass-transfer phase when the donor remains spectroscopically detectable prior to the subdwarf stage.

- **Abstract**
 We present an independent validation and recalibration of the Landolt 2013 (celestial equator and $\delta \sim -50^\circ$) and 2016 ($\delta \sim -50^\circ$) standard stars in the Johnson $UBV$ and Kron-Cousins $RI$ systems, using tens of thousands of XPSP data from the BEst STar (BEST) database. Our analysis reveals an overall zero-point offset between the 2016 and 2013 datasets. We further identify zero-point offsets for each standard field, ranging from 5 -- 14 mmag across all $UBVRI$ bands, with correlations between offsets in different bands. Additionally, we confirm the spatial structures up to 7 -- 10 mmag in the $BVRI$ bands. We also find that spatial structures are similar across bands for the same field, and similar across different fields for the same band. These similarities may arise from the averaged flat-fields from each observing run. The recalibrated results are consistent with the XPSP data within 48 mmag in the $U$ band, 11 mmag in the $B$ band, and 5 -- 6 mmag in the $VRI$ bands in the brightness $G<16$. Furthermore, based on stellar atmospheric parameters from LAMOST DR12 and Gaia DR3 photometry, along with the XPSP data, we derive temperature- and extinction-dependent extinction coefficients for the $UBVRI$ bands as well as a LAMOST \& Gaia-based catalog of 5.4 million standard stars in the $UBVRI$ bands, for which the U-band photometry of the vast majority of sources exhibits significantly higher precision than XPSP. The recalibrated Landolt standard stars and LAMOST \& Gaia-based standard stars will be available on the BEST website (this https URL) and (this https URL).

- **Abstract**
 Hot subdwarf B (sdB) and O (sdO) type stars are evolved helium-burning objects that lost their hydrogen envelope before the helium flash when their progenitors were close to the tip of the red giant branch. They populate the extreme horizontal branch (EHB) in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (HRD). Using the high-quality, homogeneous spectra of 336 hot subluminous star candidates from the Arizona-Montréal Spectroscopic Survey, we aim to improve our understanding of the atmospheric and stellar properties of hot subdwarf stars. We used large grids of model atmospheres to fit the observed spectra and derived their atmospheric parameters: effective temperature (Teff), surface gravity, and helium abundance. The model grids were further utilized to fit the spectral energy distribution of each star and the $Gaia$ parallax was used to compute the stellar parameters radius, luminosity, and mass. We detected helium stratification in six sdB stars with Teff around 30 kK, making them good candidates for also showing $^3$He enrichment in their atmospheres. The mass distributions of H-rich sdBs and sdOs are similar and centered around 0.47 $\text{M}_\odot$, consistent with the canonical formation scenario of helium ignition under degenerate conditions. Among the H-rich hot subdwarfs, we found no difference between the mass distributions of close binaries and apparently single stars. The He-sdOs have a significantly wider mass distribution than their H-rich counterparts, with an average mass of about 0.78 $\text{M}_\odot$. This strongly favors a merger origin for these He-rich objects. We identified a small number of candidate low-mass ($<$0.45$ \text{M}_\odot$) sdBs located below the EHB that might have originated from more massive progenitors. Finally, we identified more than 80 pulsating stars in our sample and found these to fall into well-defined $p$- and $g$-mode instability regions.

- **Abstract**
 In this paper, we estimated the physical and geometrical characteristics of the visually close binary stellar system Hip 45571, using Al-Wardat's method for analyzing binary and multiple stellar systems. We estimated the physical properties of the components of the system for the four measured parallax given by Gaia and Hipparcos, which gives a dynamical mass sum ranges between 2.43 and 2.52 solar mass using the new orbital parameters following Tokovinin's dynamical method. The method used is a spectrophotometrical computational technique that employs Kurucz plane-parallel line-blanketed model atmospheres for single stars. These model atmospheres are used to construct the synthetic spectral energy distributions (SED) of each component and for the entire system. To ensure the method's accuracy, we apply the fit between synthetic and observational photometry under different filters, including the recently published Gaia DR3 measurements. The positions of the components on the H-R diagram and the evolutionary tracks were used to estimate their masses and ages. We found that the system consists of 2.24 Gyr two F2.5 IV and F3.5 IV subgiant components with T_eff_A= 6800, T_eff_B= 6700, logg=4.19 m/s^2, logg=4.33 m/s^2, R_A=1.77 R_sun, R_B=1.34 R_sun, L_A=6.01 L_sun, L_B=3.25 L_sun and Z=0.011. Depending on the masses estimated by Al-Wardat's method, a new parallax value of 28.72+-0.30 mas was obtained. Which lies between the values given by DR2 and DR3. This research underscores the importance of precision and reliability in employing these methods and measurements in a dynamic context, deepening our understanding of such stellar systems.

- **Abstract**
 ASASSN-24fw is a main-sequence F-type star that experienced a rapid and long-lasting dimming event beginning in late 2024 and continuing until mid 2025. Its pre-dimming spectral energy distribution shows a persistent infrared excess with a fractional luminosity of approximately 0.5 percent. We model this excess using a two-component blackbody fit and find dust components with temperatures of about 1070 K and 390 K. Archival light curves indicate that ASASSN-24fw was photometrically stable prior to the event, suggesting that the dimming is caused by an external occulting body rather than intrinsic stellar variability. The event lasted about 275 days and exhibits a distinctive flat-bottomed profile of nearly 200 days, unlike most long-duration occultation events reported in the last decade. We analyze the light curve and spectra obtained during dimming to study the properties of both the star and the occulting material. A parametric light-curve model reveals multiple ingress phases, consistent with variations in the density and structure of the obscuring material. A second transit model favors an occulting body consistent with a gas giant or brown dwarf with a minimum mass of about 3.4 Jupiter masses and surrounded by an extended circumplanetary disk or rings of radius roughly 0.17 au. Near-infrared spectra taken during dimming show enhanced infrared excess and spectral features consistent with a late-type companion, approximately M8. We also detect variable H-alpha emission, suggesting evolving gas and dust in the occulting structure. Imaging from LCOGT identifies a nearby object within 3 arcsec, likely a bound companion at a projected separation of about 3000 au. Systems like ASASSN-24fw appear rare, and continued follow-up will help constrain the nature of the occulting body and the circumstellar environment.

- **Abstract**
 This is the second paper that proposes a simple method for estimating mass ratios using the derivatives of light curves for overcontact binaries. In the first paper (Kouzuma 2023, ApJ, 958, 84) , we presented a method to estimate the mass ratios for systems exhibiting a double-peak feature in the second derivatives of their light curves around eclipses. This second paper focuses on overcontact systems that are not addressed in the first paper, that is, systems lacking a double peak in the second derivative. A sample of synthetic light curves for overcontact binaries consists of 89670, covering a parameter space typical of overcontact systems. On the basis of a recent study that proposed a new classification scheme using light-curve derivatives up to the fourth order, the sample light curves were classified. We found that time intervals between two local extrema in the derivatives are associated with the mass ratio in systems that exhibit a high degree of eclipse obscuration. Using regression analysis for the identified associations, we derived empirical formulae to estimate the mass ratio and its associated uncertainty. The application of our proposed method to real overcontact binary data demonstrated its effectiveness in providing reliable estimates for both values.

          The First Occurrence Rate Estimates for Exoplanets in Small-Separation Binary Star Systems: Planet Occurrence is Suppressed in Binary Stars

- **Abstract**
 Exoplanet occurrence rates facilitate comparisons between observations of planets and theoretical models of planet formation. Despite their deductive power, exoplanet occurrence rates for half the stars in the sky are missing because occurrence rate studies systematically exclude binary star systems. We assembled a large sample of high-likelihood binaries from the Kepler mission to calculate occurrence rates for circumstellar (S-type) planets in small-separation binary star systems ($\lesssim 100$ au) for the first time. For a sample of high-likelihood small-separation binaries, we found binaries to host 58% fewer planets per system than single stars to 11.4$\sigma$ significance within 1-4 $R_{\oplus}$ and 1-50 d, and 50% fewer planets compared to single stars when integrating over the full parameter space of 1-10 $R_{\oplus}$ and 1-100 d to 3.8$\sigma$ significance.. We found no evidence for a radius valley or radius cliff, instead detecting a smooth decline in planet occurrence with increasing planetary radius. The difference between the single-star planet radius distribution and the binary-star planet radius distribution is 4.3$\sigma$ significant from a Kolomogorov-Smirnov test. These results suggest significantly different planet formation and survival outcomes in binaries compared to single stars, and support other studies that have measured a deficit of observed planets in binary star systems.

- **Abstract**
 Interstellar extinction is a major obstacle in determining accurate stellar parameters from photometry near the Galactic disk. It is especially true for globular clusters at low galactic latitudes, which suffer from significant amounts of, and spatially variable reddening. Although differential reddening maps are available for tens of clusters, establishing and validating the absolute zero point of relative maps is a challenge. In this study, we present a new approach to determine and evaluate absolute reddening zero-points for Galactic globular clusters by combining three-dimensional reddening maps with Gaia DR3 RR Lyrae data. As a first case study, we investigate the low-latitude globular cluster M9. We compare the Gaia photometry and color data of the cluster member RR Lyrae stars to field RR Lyrae stars with accurate parallaxes and whose photometric metallicities match that of M9, as well as to theoretical models. We calculate the dereddened Gaia colors for the M9 stars based on three zero points. We confirm that the original SFD map appears to be overcorrecting the reddening for at least some RR Lyrae stars, albeit not excessively. In contrast, the 3D Bayestar map and the recalibrated version of the SFD map provide physically plausible reddenings, which we accept as lower and upper limits for M9, respectively. Our results provide a physically motivated reddening range for M9, and outline a methodology that can be directly extended to other globular clusters that are accessible to the Gaia mission, and to other multicolor sky surveys, such as the Rubin Observatory.

- **Abstract**
 Standard visualizations of Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) solar imagery often fail to convey the full complexity of the Sun's corona, especially in faint off-limb regions. This can leave the misleading impression of the Sun as a bright ball in a dark void, rather than revealing it as the dynamic, structured source of the solar wind and space weather. A variety of enhancement algorithms have been developed to address this challenge, each with its own strengths and tradeoffs. We introduce the Radial Histogram Equalizing Filter (RHEF), a novel hybrid technique that optimizes contrast in high dynamic range solar images. By combining the spatial awareness of radial graded filters with the perceptual benefits of histogram equalization, RHEF reveals faint coronal structures and works out of the box -- without requiring careful parameter tuning or prior dataset characterization. RHEF operates independently on each frame, and it enhances on-disk and off-limb features uniformly across the field of view. For additional control, we also present the Upsilon redistribution function -- a symmetrized cousin of gamma correction -- as an optional post-processing step that provides intuitive programmatic tonal compression. We benchmark RHEF against established methods and offer guidance on filter selection across various applications, with examples from multiple solar instruments provided in an appendix. Implemented and available in both Python sunkit_image and IDL, RHEF enables immediate improvements in solar coronal visualization.

- **Abstract**
 We present Cesam2k20, the latest version of the hydrostatic stellar evolution code CESAM originally developed by P. Morel and collaborators. Over the last three decades, it has undergone many improvements and has been extensively tested against other stellar evolution codes before being selected to compute the first-generation grid of stellar models for the PLATO mission. Among all the developments made thus far, Cesam2k20 now implements state-of-the-art models for the transport of chemical elements and angular momentum. It was recently made publicly available with an ecosystem of other codes interfaced with it: 1D and 2D oscillation codes ADIPLS and ACOR, optimisation program OSM, and Python utility package pycesam. This paper recalls the numerical peculiarities of Cesam2k20, namely, the use of a collocation method where the structure variables are decomposed as piecewise polynomials projected on a B-spline basis. Here, we review the options available for modelling the different physical processes. In particular, we illustrate the improvements made in the transport of chemical elements and angular momentum with a series of standard and non-standard solar models.

          Cancellation of one-loop correction to soft tensor power spectrum

 - **Abstract**
 We demonstrate that there are no scale-invariant one-loop corrections to the superhorizon tensor perturbations from small-scale (potentially enhanced) scalar perturbations, irrespective of the details of inflationary background time evolution. For this purpose we derive a soft tensor effective field theory at leading order in the gradient expansion by integrating out small-scale scalar fluctuations in a general time-dependent background over the Schwinger-Keldysh contour, i.e., we perform loop calculations in the soft limit of external momentum. The absence of scale-invariant corrections originates from the diffeomorphism invariance of general relativity and is therefore unavoidable.

          Super-Eddington Growth Ceiling: Analytic Constraints on the Rapid Growth of Light-Seed Black Holes in Massive Clumps

 - **Abstract**
 The existence of $\sim10^{7-8}{\rm M}_\odot$ supermassive black holes at $z\gtrsim 8$ challenges conventional growth channels. One attractive possibility is that light seeds ($M_{\rm BH}\lesssim10^{3}{\rm M}_\odot$) undergo short, super-Eddington episodes when they cross, and are captured by, dense massive gas clumps. We revisit this ``BH-clump-capture'' model using analytic arguments supported by toy-model simulations that follow Bondi-scale inflow, radiative feedback, gas dynamical friction and the recently discovered forward acceleration effect caused by the ionised bubble. For substantial growth the black hole must remain trapped for many dynamical times, which imposes three simultaneous constraints. The clump must be heavier than the black hole (mass doubling condition); its cooling time must exceed the super-Eddington growth time (lifetime condition); and dynamical friction must dominate shell acceleration (BH-trapping condition). These requirements confine viable clumps to a narrow density-temperature region, $n_{\rm H}\simeq10^{7-8}{\rm cm}^{-3}$ and $T\simeq(2-6)\times10^{3}{\rm K}$, for a $10^{3}{\rm M}_\odot$ seed. Even inside this sweet spot a $10^{3}{\rm M}_\odot$ seed grow up at most $4\times10^{3}{\rm M}_\odot$; the maximum growth ratio $M_{\rm BH, fin}/M_{\rm BH}$ falls approximately as $M_{\rm BH}^{-0.4}$ and is negligible once $M_{\rm BH}\gtrsim10^{4}{\rm M}_\odot$. The forward-acceleration effect is essential, expelling the black hole whenever photon trapping fails. We conclude that BH-clump-capture model, and potentially broad super-Eddington models, cannot produce the $>10^{4}{\rm M}_\odot$ seeds required for subsequent Eddington-limited growth, suggesting that alternative pathways, such as heavy seed formation, remain necessary.

 - **Abstract**
 Horizon-scale imaging of supermassive black holes has opened a new window onto the studies of strong-field gravity and plasma physics in low-luminosity accretion flows. As future efforts aim to image fainter and smaller angular-size targets, primarily through space-based very long baseline interferometry (VLBI), it is important to identify optimal sources and observing strategies for such studies. In this work, we assess the prospects for imaging black hole shadows in a broad population of nearby supermassive black holes by modeling their accretion flows using a covariant semi-analytic model for the flow and general relativistic ray tracing. We explore the influence of black hole and accretion flow parameters on spectra, image morphology, and the critical frequency at which the flows become optically thin. We identify three general classes of sources: those that become transparent at traditional imaging frequencies; those requiring higher frequencies; and those unlikely to be transparent down to the black hole shadow in the submillimeter band. Our results will inform target selection and wavelength optimization for future VLBI arrays, where both resolution and transparency are essential for resolving black hole shadows.

          Weak Bursts on Slowly Accreting Neutron Stars

 - **Abstract**
 Nearly all observed thermonuclear X-ray bursts are thought to be triggered by the thermally unstable triple-alpha process. Unlike in accreting white dwarfs, the $\gtrsim10^{8} \mathrm{K}$ envelope temperature forces hydrogen burning to proceed via the $\beta$-limited, thermally stable hot CNO cycle. Recent observations of weak X-ray bursts from SAX J1808.4-3658 occurring within 1-3 days of the onset of an accretion outburst have raised the question that these bursts were triggered by thermally unstable hydrogen ignition, analogously to classical novae. Using the stellar evolution code MESA, we explore the unstable ignition of hydrogen on slowly accreting neutron stars. For solar metallicities, the burning is insufficiently vigorous to launch convection and the burst rise is on the envelope thermal timescale, with the hydrogen being consumed over hours. For elevated metallicities ($Z\gtrsim0.06$), however, the initial proton captures onto CNO nuclei heat the envelope enough to drive convection and produce a sharp peak in the luminosity. This peak can match that of the SAX J1808.4-3658 burst, for sufficient enrichment. Following this peak, the hydrogen burning stabilizes at a rate set solely by the ignition depth and CNO abundance in the accreted matter. This quasi-steady-state burning produces an extended tail of elevated emission that lasts until the hydrogen is exhausted. Observations of the tail's luminosity and duration measure the hydrogen and metallicity abundance of the accreted material, while the distance-independent ratio of peak-to-tail luminosities would suggest the presence of significant metallicity gradients prior to convection.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of Europa's leading hemisphere reveal elevated H2O2 in the warmer, low latitude chaos terrains compared to the colder, polar regions. This distribution disagrees with prior laboratory radiolysis studies of pure water ice, which show higher H2O2 yields at colder temperatures. The regions with higher peroxide abundance, Tara and Powys Regiones, also present increased amounts of CO2, possibly sourced from Europa's interior. To investigate whether CO2 influences radiolysis of water ice to boost H2O2 production, we irradiated water ice doped with varying amounts of CO2 with 10 keV electrons at 70 and 100 K. Our results indicate that CO2, even in trace amounts (< 3%), significantly enhances H2O2 yields at temperatures relevant to Europa. We discuss the mechanisms by which CO2 boosts peroxide synthesis and quantify H2O2 creation and destruction cross sections and G-values across different CO2 concentrations. These findings provide a plausible explanation for the perplexing H2O2 distribution on Europa and has implications for understanding peroxide on other icy bodies such as Ganymede and Charon, where it has been detected alongside CO2.

 - **Abstract**
 Among the various classes of fast optical transients (FOTs), kilonovae (KNe), which can emerge as a result of neutron star mergers, are extremely challenging to observe because of not only the rapid timescale on which they fade (on the order of days), but also due to the relative scarcity of their occurrence. This scarcity is compounded by the large number of other FOTs that may initially resemble the characteristic rise of a KNe. While these objects can be ruled out as candidate KNe by taking spectroscopy, a method of confidently ruling out transients based on photometric analysis alone would be incredibly valuable. We describe the compilation of various ``imposter" transients, including a plurality of IIb SNe, and investigate a number of comparative metrics by which one might be able to remove transients from consideration without the use of spectroscopy. We provide a list of these objects and their classifications as well as a glossary of the transient types included in the sample.

 - **Abstract**
 ComPair, a prototype of the All-sky Medium Energy Gamma-ray Observatory (AMEGO), completed a short-duration high-altitude balloon campaign on August 27, 2023 from Fort Sumner, New Mexico, USA. The goal of the balloon flight was the demonstration of ComPair as both a Compton and Pair telescope in flight, rejection of the charged particle background, and measurement of the background $\gamma$-ray spectrum. This analysis compares measurements from the balloon flight with Monte Carlo simulations to benchmark the instrument. The comparison finds good agreement between the measurements and simulations and supports the conclusion that ComPair accomplished its goals for the balloon campaign. Additionally, two charged particle background rejection schemes are discussed: a soft ACD veto that records a higher charged particle event rate but with less risk of event loss, and a hard ACD veto that limits the charged particle event rate on board. There was little difference in the measured spectra from the soft and hard ACD veto schemes, indicating that the hard ACD veto could be used for future flights. The successes of ComPair's engineering flight will inform the development of the next generation of ComPair with upgraded detector technology and larger active area.

 - **Abstract**
 We report on large-scale radio observations of the Chamaeleon star-forming region obtained with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) that led to the definite detection of five young stars and the tentative detection of five more. As in other regions surveyed in the radio domain, the majority of detected sources are fairly evolved low-mass T Tauri stars, but we also detect one protostellar object (Ced 110 IRS4) and one Herbig Ae/Be star. With the exception of the protostellar source, the radio emission mechanism is likely of non-thermal origin. The three brightest radio stars identified with ATCA were subsequently observed with the Australian Long Baseline Array (LBA) and one, J11061540-7721567 (Ced 110 IRS2), was detected at three epochs. This confirms the non-thermal nature of the radio emission in that specific case, and enabled accurate radio position measurements. Comparison with predictions from Gaia DR3 strongly suggests that this star is a binary system with an orbital period of order 40 years; additional LBA observations in the next decades would enable accurate determinations of the individual stellar masses in that system.

          The investigation of 84 TESS totally eclipsing contact binaries

 - **Abstract**
 Based on the eclipsing binary catalog provided by \cite{2022ApJS..258...16P}, 84 totally eclipsing contact binaries with stable light curves were selected. The TESS light curves of these 84 targets were studied using the Physics Of Eclipsing Binaries code. The results indicate that there are 18 deep contact binaries, 39 moderate contact binaries, and 27 shallow contact binaries. Among them, 43 targets exhibit the O'Connell effect, which is attributed to the presence of star-spot on the component's surface. 15 targets are low-mass ratio deep contact binaries and may be contact binary merging candidates. Based on the relationship between the period and semi-major axis of contact binaries, their absolute physical parameters such as mass, radius, and luminosity were derived. The evolutionary status of these 84 targets was studied using the mass-luminosity and mass-radius relation diagrams. Their initial masses were also estimated. Our results are compared with those of targets that have been historically studied. Among the 84 targets, 44 targets have been studied before, and 21 of these have mass ratios $q$ that are consistent with historical values within a 10\% difference. For the inconsistent targets, we conducted a detailed investigation and found that the main reasons are poor quality of historical data, or the fact that the machine learning methods used in historical studies might not accurately determine the physical parameters for individual targets.

          The Impact of $Ω_{m0}$ Prior Bias on Cosmological Parameter Estimation: Reconciling DESI DR2 BAO and Pantheon+ SNe Data Combination Results

 - **Abstract**
 Recent cosmological parameter analyses combining DESI DR2 Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data with external probes, such as Pantheon+ Supernovae (SNe) observations, have reported deviations of the dark energy equation-of-state parameters ($\oo, \oa$) from the standard $\Lambda$CDM model predictions ($\oo=-1, \oa=0$). A notable aspect of these results is the role of $\Omo$ prior information from SNe, which is known to exhibit tension with BAO-only constraints. In this study, we rigorously investigate this effect through a statistical analysis using 100 mock DESI DR2 BAO data realizations. We demonstrate that the strong degeneracy between $\oo$, $\oa$, and $\Omo$ causes significant biases in the estimated dark energy parameters when the $\Omo$ prior mean deviates from its true underlying value. Specifically, applying an $\Omo$ prior mean of 0.33 (consistent with some SNe-only constraints) to mock data, assuming a true $\Lambda$CDM universe ($\Omo=0.30, \oo=-1, \oa=0$), yields biased estimates such as $\oo \approx -0.82 \pm 0.06$ and $\oa \approx -0.82 \pm 0.4$. This systematic shift, driven by the $\Omo$ prior, moves the estimated parameters towards the non-$\Lambda$CDM region, offering a qualitative resemblance to outcomes reported in current combined DESI DR2 BAO + Pantheon+ SNe analyses (e.g., $\oo = -0.888^{+0.055}_{-0.064}$, $\oa = -0.17 \pm 0.46$). Our findings suggest that these observed non-$\Lambda$CDM parameters may largely arise from statistical biases due to $\Omo$ prior tensions between datasets. This study proposes a potential resolution to current cosmological tensions without necessarily invoking new physics.

          A Dichotomy of the Mass-Metallicity Relation of Exoplanetary Atmospheres Demarcated by their Birthplace

 - **Abstract**
 Atmospheric observations by JWST raise a growing evidence that atmospheric metallicity exhibits an anti-correlation with masses of giant exoplanets. While such a trend was anticipated by planetesimal-based planet formation models, it remains unclear what kind of atmospheric metallicity trends emerge from pebble-based planet formation. Moreover, while recent studies of solar system Jupiter suggest that uppermost observable atmosphere may not represent the bulk envelope composition, it remains uncertain how the envelope inhomogeneity influences the atmospheric metallicity trend. In this study, we develop disk evolution and planet formation models to investigate the possible atmospheric metallicity trends of giant exoplanets formed via pebble accretion and how they depend on the metallicity inhomogeneity within the envelope. We find that pebble-based planet formation produces two distinct mass-metallicity relations depending on planetary birthplace. Planets formed beyond the H2O snowline exhibit a mass-metallicity anti-correlation similar to that predicted by planetesimal-based models if their atmospheres are fully convective. This anti-correlation disappears if the convective mixing is inefficient. In contrast, planets formed inside the H2O snowline show a shallower mass-metallicity anti-correlation, regardless of the efficiency of atmospheric mixing. Many gas giants observed by JWST observations lie around the mass-metallicity relation predicted for formation at close-in orbits, although some planets with sub-stellar atmospheric metallicity appear to require unmixed envelopes and formation beyond the H2O snowline. We also examine the relationship between bulk and atmospheric metallicity and find a clear correlation that closely follows atmospheric metallicity that is comparable to bulk metallicity.

          (Re)-Defining Planets -- the Fundamental Plane of Planets

 - **Abstract**
 6000+ exoplanets are now detected using various techniques, with estimates of billions of planets existing in our Galaxy alone. They are called super-Earths, hot Earths, mini-Neptunes, hot Neptunes, sub-Neptunes, Saturns, Jupiters, hot Jupiters, gas giants, ice giants, rocky, terran, subterran, superterran, and so on. This prompted the emergence of many recent works on taxonomy, or classification, of exoplanets. However, there is still no basic, fundamental definition of 'What is a planet?'. IAU has forwarded a definition in 2006 which, however, raised more questions than it solved. The first ambitious task here is to establish if there are limits on the size/mass of planets. The lower mass limit may be assumed as of Mimas - approximately minimum mass required to attain a nearly spherical hydrostatic equilibrium shape. The upper mass limit may be easier - there is a natural lower limit to what constitutes a star: ~0.08 SU. But then there are brown dwarfs: IAU has defined brown dwarfs as objects that exceed the deuterium burning limit (~13 JU), and giant exoplanets generally have masses of ~0.3 to ~60 JU. The resolution requires assembling the basic physical parameters that define planets quantitatively. Mass and radius are the two fundamental properties, and we propose to use a third correlated parameter: the moment of inertia. Based on this, we create the fundamental planet plane where the two parameters are correlated with the third, similar to a fundamental galactic plane. The fundamental planetary plane with turn-off point diagrams is constructed for the first time in this work. We define a planet as 'A celestial spherical object, bound to a star or unbound, that lies on the fundamental planetary plane, within a mass range between 0.02 EU to 13 JU'.

          A Massive Yellow Supergiant in the Far Outer Disk of M31: Evidence for In Situ Massive Star Formation Beyond the Optical Radius

 - **Abstract**
 While massive stars are known to shape galactic ecosystems, their formation has long been assumed to require the high-density environments of inner galactic disks. This paradigm is challenged by mounting evidence of young massive stars in extended galaxy outskirts, yet direct confirmation of in situ massive star formation in such extreme low-density environments remains scarce. Here, we present the discovery of LAMOST J0048+4154, a massive yellow supergiant situated at a deprojected galactocentric distance of ~34 kpc in M31, making it the most distant massive star confirmed in this galaxy. Through spectroscopic and photometric analyses, we classify J0048+4154 as an F5-F8I supergiant with an effective temperature of $6357^{+121}_{-118}$ K and a luminosity of $\log L/L_{\odot} = 5.00^{+0.06}_{-0.06}$, corresponding to an ~18 $M_{\odot}$ progenitor and an age of ~10 Myr. FAST H I observations reveal close spatial and kinematic alignment between the star and a faint H I external arm, suggesting in situ formation in a region of low gas density. The presence of other UV-bright, early-type stars in the vicinity further supports low-level recent star formation in M31's very outer disk. These findings challenge the prevailing assumption that massive star formation is confined to inner disks or classical star-forming regions and underscore the need to re-examine the role of spiral galaxy outskirts in fueling and sustaining star formation. J0048+4154 thereby expands our understanding of the extent of M31's young stellar component and exemplifies how outer disks may harbor conditions conducive to forming massive stars, despite low-density environments.

 - **Abstract**
 Fireballs (bolides) are high-energy luminous phenomena produced when meteoroids and small asteroids enter Earth's atmosphere at hypersonic speeds, often resulting in fragmentation or complete disintegration accompanied by significant energy release. The resulting bolide light curves capture temporal brightness variations as these objects traverse increasingly dense atmospheric layers, providing essential information on meteoroid entry dynamics, fragmentation behavior, and atmospheric energy deposition processes. The Center for Near-Earth Object Studies' (CNEOS) continuously expanding fireball database offers a globally comprehensive archive of bolide events, including light curves and associated metadata. Events associated with infrasound detections allow direct correlations between acoustic signatures and light-curve features, therefore enabling detailed analyses of fragmentation dynamics and energy deposition. Here, we introduce BLADE (Bolide Light-curve Analysis and Discrimination Explorer), a robust and high-fidelity framework specifically designed to analyze bolide light curves for objects detected from space. BLADE incorporates a processing pipeline integrating Savitzky-Golay filtering, prominence-based peak detection, and gradient analysis, enabling systematic identification and classification of fragmentation events and their associated energy release characteristics. Preliminary results demonstrate that BLADE reliably distinguishes distinct bolide behaviors, providing an objective, scalable methodology for characterization and analysis of large bolide light curve datasets. This foundational work establishes a novel pathway for advanced bolide research, with promising applications in planetary defense and global atmospheric monitoring.

 Stellar parameters and abundances provide crucial insights into stellar and Galactic evolution studies. In this work, we developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) to estimate stellar parameters: effective temperature ($T_{\text{eff}}$), surface gravity (log $g$) and metallicity (both [Fe/H] and [M/H]) as well as six $\alpha$-elements (C, N, O, Mg, Si, Ca) and [$\alpha$/M]. We selected giant stars with \( 3500 \, \text{K} < T_{\text{eff}} < 5500 \, \text{K} \) and \( 0 \, \text{dex} < \log g < 3.6 \, \text{dex} \) from the LAMOST and APOGEE surveys, while requiring (S/N)$_g$ of the LAMOST low-resolution spectra $>$ 10, which leaves 1,100,858 giant stars. The spectral from LAMOST and the labels from APOGEE for 62,511 common stars were used as our training set. The corresponding test set yields scatters 50 K, 0.06 dex and 0.13 dex for $T_{\text{eff}}$, [Fe/H] and log $g$, respectively. For $\alpha$ elements O, Mg, Si and Ca, the scatters are 0.05 dex, 0.04 dex, 0.03 and 0.04 dex, respectively. For C and N elements, the scatters are 0.07 dex and 0.05 dex. For [$\alpha$/M] and [M/H], the scatters are 0.03 dex and 0.06 dex. The mean absolute error (MAE) of most elements are between 0.02 $-$ 0.04 dex. The predicted abundances were cross-matched with previously identified substructures PG1 and PG2, with their origins subsequently analyzed. Finally, the catalog is available at this https URL.

 We investigate constraints on the least explored, smallest mass scales of primordial black holes (PBHs), which evaporate prior to Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). Our study examines the impact of Planck-mass relics on the allowed fraction of dark matter composed of PBHs ($f_{PBH}$), as well as on the resulting stochastic gravitational wave background and the formation of primordial binaries. We discuss how these binaries and early mergers lead to longer PBH lifetimes, extending the reach of the stringent BBN constraints to smaller masses than usually expected. We make comprehensive constraint plots on the collapse fraction $\beta$ and $f_{PBH}$ (including relics), focusing on ultra-light PBHs.

 - **Abstract**
 Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) are space weather phenomena capable of causing significant disruptions to both space- and ground-based infrastructure. The timely and accurate detection and prediction of CMEs is a crucial steps towards implementing strategies to minimize the impacts of such events. CMEs are commonly observed using coronagraphs and heliospheric imagers (HIs), with some forecasting methods relying on manually tracking CMEs across successive images in order to provide an estimate of their arrival time and speed. This process is time-consuming, and the growing volume of available data makes manual identification of CMEs increasingly impractical. We investigate the application of machine learning (ML) techniques to the problem of automated CME detection, focusing on data from the HI instruments aboard the STEREO spacecraft. HI data facilitates the tracking of CMEs through interplanetary space, providing valuable information on their evolution along the way. Building on advances in image segmentation, we present the Solar Transient Recognition Using Deep Learning (STRUDL) model. STRUDL is designed to automatically detect and segment CME fronts in HI data. We address the challenges inherent to this task and evaluate the model's performance across a range of solar activity conditions. To complement segmentation, we implement a basic tracking algorithm that links CME detections across successive frames, thus allowing us to automatically generate time-distance profiles for all CMEs under study. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of applying ML-based segmentation techniques to HI data, while highlighting areas for future improvement, particularly regarding the accurate segmentation and tracking of faint and interacting CMEs.

 HD 209458b is the prototypical hot Jupiter and one of the best targets available for precise atmosphere characterisation. Now that spectra from both Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) are available, we can reveal the atmospheric properties in unprecedented detail. In this study, we perform a new data reduction and analysis of the original HST/WFC3 spectrum, accounting for the wavelength dependence of the instrument systematics that was not considered in previous analyses. This allows us to precisely and robustly measure the much-debated H$_2$O abundance in HD 209458b's atmosphere. We combine the newly reduced spectrum with archival JWST/NIRCam data and run free chemistry atmospheric retrievals over the 1.0 - 5.1 $\mu$m wavelength range, covering possible features of multiple absorbing species, including CO$_2$, CO, CH$_4$, NH$_3$, HCN, Na, SO$_2$, and H$_2$S. We detect H$_2$O and CO$_2$ robustly at above 7 $\sigma$ significance, and find a 3.6 $\sigma$ preference for cloudy models compared to a clear atmosphere. For all other absorbers we tested, only upper limits of abundance can be measured. We use Bayesian model averaging to account for a range of different assumptions about the cloud properties, resulting in a water volume mixing ratio of $0.95^{+0.35}_{-0.17} \:\times$ solar and a carbon dioxide abundance of $0.94^{+0.16}_{-0.09} \:\times$ solar. Both results are consistent with solar values and comparable to predictions from the VULCAN 1D photochemistry model. Combining these values with a prior on the CO abundance from ground-based measurements, we derive an overall atmospheric composition comparable to solar metallicity of $\mathrm{[M/H]} = 0.10^{+0.41}_{-0.40}$ and very low C/O of $0.054^{+0.080}_{-0.034}$ with a 3 $\sigma$ upper limit of 0.454. This indicates a strong enrichment in oxygen and depletion in carbon during HD 209458b's formation.

 - **Abstract**
 To investigate the interstellar medium (ISM) and Galactic cosmic rays (CRs) in the solar neighborhood, we analyzed ${\gamma}$-ray data by Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) for five nearby molecular cloud regions. Our data includes the MBM/Pegasus region (MBM~53, 54, 55 clouds and Pegasus loop), R CrA region (R Coronae Australis clouds), Chamaeleon region (Chamaeleon clouds), Cep/Pol region (Cepheus and Polaris flare), and Orion region (Orion clouds). The ISM templates are constructed by a component decomposition of the 21~cm {\HI} line, the Planck dust emission model, and the carbon monoxide (CO) 2.6~mm line. Through $\gamma$-ray data analysis the ISM gas is successfully decomposed into non-local {\HI}, narrow-line and optically thick {\HI}, broad-line and optically thin {\HI}, CO-bright {\Htwo}, and CO-dark {\Htwo} for all five regions. CR intensities evaluated by the ${\gamma}$-ray emissivity of broad {\HI} agree well with a model based on directly-measured CR spectra at the Earth, with a gradient giving a higher CR intensity toward the inner Galaxy at the 10\% level in ${\sim}$ 500~pc. The ratio of CO-dark {\Htwo} to CO-bright {\Htwo} anti-correlates with the {\Htwo} mass traced by the CO 2.6~mm line, and reaches 5--10 for small systems of ${\sim}$1000 solar mass.

 - **Abstract**
 The Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND) is an envisioned large-scale radio array designed to detect ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs, $E > 100$ PeV) and neutrinos. Employing cost-effective antennas distributed across vast areas, GRAND is optimized to observe the rare flux of ultra-high-energy particles with high precision. The GRANDProto300 (GP300) pathfinder array, currently under deployment, targets the $10^{16.5} - 10^{18}$ eV range and is anticipated to achieve approximately 15\% energy resolution and 20g/cm$^2$ $X_{\mathrm{max}}$ precision. This level of precision enables accurate measurements of the fine structure of the energy spectrum, mean logarithmic mass ($\langle \ln A \rangle$), and proton flux within this range. After five years of data collection, the sensitivity for detecting anisotropy could reach $5 \times 10^{-3}$ for energies below $10^{17.1}$ eV. With its substantially larger effective area, GRAND extends these capabilities to the highest energies ($\sim 10^{20}$ eV), offering enhanced statistics and sensitivity for spectral, composition, and anisotropy measurements within one year for UHECRs.

 - **Abstract**
 Forecasting cosmological constraints from halo-based statistics often suffers from instability in derivative estimates, especially when the number of simulations is limited. This instability reduces the reliability of Fisher forecasts and machine learning based approaches that use derivatives. We introduce a general framework that addresses this challenge by stabilizing the input statistic and then systematically identifying the optimal subset of summary statistics that maximizes cosmological information while simultaneously minimizing the instability of predicted constraints. We demonstrate this framework using the Voronoi volume function (VVF), a summary statistic that captures beyond two-point clustering information. Applying our two-step procedure -- random sub-sampling followed by optimization -- improves the constraining power by up to a factor of 2, while also enhancing the stability of the forecasts across realizations. As surveys like Euclid, DESI, and LSST push toward tighter constraints, the ability to produce stable and accurate theoretical predictions is essential. Our results suggest that new summary statistics such as the VVF, combined with careful data curation and stabilization strategies, can play a key role in next-generation precision cosmology.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the serendipitous detection of the SO $J_N=6_5-5_4$ (219.949 GHz) rotational transition in archival Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of the spiral hosting protoplanetary disks around CQ Tau (with $\approx4.9\sigma$ significance) and MWC 758 (with $\approx3.4\sigma$ significance). In the former, the SO emission comes in the shape of a ring, arises from the edge of the continuum cavity, and is qualitatively consistent, at the currently available spectral resolution, with being in Keplerian rotation. In the latter, instead, while arising primarily from inside the continuum cavity, the SO emission also extends to the continuum ring(s), and its morphology and kinematics are less clear. We put these sources in the context of the other protoplanetary disks where SO detections have been previously reported in the literature and discuss the possible origins of SO in terms of (thermal) desorption or formation in the gas phase. We argue that these processes might be fostered by dynamical perturbations caused by unseen embedded massive companions, shadows, or late-time infall, thus suggesting a possible link between perturbed dynamics and SO emission in (these) protoplanetary disks. If confirmed, our interpretation would imply that chemical evolution timescales could be significantly shorter in these systems than is commonly assumed, indicating that dynamical perturbations might influence the composition of newborn (proto-)planets by altering the volatile makeup of their formation environment.

          Disentangling Metallicity Effects in Hot Jupiter Occurrence Across Galactic Birth Radius and Phase-Space Density

 - **Abstract**
 We explore how the correlation between host star metallicity and giant planets shapes hot Jupiter occurrence as a function of Galactic birth radius (\rbirth) and phase-space density in the Milky Way disk. Using the GALAH and APOGEE surveys and a galaxy from the NIHAO simulation suite, we inject hot Jupiters around stars based on metallicity power laws, reflecting the trend that giant planets preferentially form around metal-rich stars. For \rbirth\ $\geq 5$ kpc, hot Jupiter occurrence decreases with \rbirth\ by $\sim -0.1%$ per kpc; this is driven by the Galaxy's chemical evolution, where the inner regions of the disk are more metal-rich. Differences in GALAH occurrence rates versus APOGEE's and the simulation's at \rbirth\ $< 5$ kpc arise from survey selection effects. APOGEE and the NIHAO simulation have more high-$\alpha$ sequence stars than GALAH, resulting in average differences in metallicity (0.2--0.4 dex), $\alpha$-process element enrichment (0.2 dex), and vertical velocities (7--14 km/s) at each \rbirth\ bin. Additionally, we replicate the result of \cite{Winter20}, which showed that over 92% of hot Jupiters are associated with stars in phase-space overdensities, or "clustered environments." However, our findings suggest that this clustering effect is primarily driven by chemical and kinematic differences between low and high-$\alpha$ sequence star properties. Our results support stellar characteristics, particularly metallicity, being the primary drivers of hot Jupiter formation, which serves as the "null hypothesis" for interpreting planet demographics. This underscores the need to disentangle planetary and stellar properties from Galactic-scale effects in future planet demographics studies.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a catalog of $\sim 10,000$ resolved triple star systems within 500 pc of the Sun, constructed using Gaia data. The triples include main-sequence, red giant, and white dwarf components spanning separations of 10 to 50,000 au. A well-characterized selection function allows us to constrain intrinsic demographics of the triple star population. We find that (a) all systems are compatible with being hierarchical and dynamically stable; (b) mutual orbital inclinations are isotropic for wide triples but show modest alignment as the systems become more compact; (c) primary masses follow a Kroupa initial mass function weighted by the triple fraction; (d) inner binary orbital periods, eccentricities, and mass ratios mirror those of isolated binaries, including a pronounced twin excess (mass ratios greater than 0.95) out to separations of 1000+ au, suggesting a common formation pathway; (e) tertiary mass ratios follow a power-law distribution with slope -1.4; (f) tertiary orbits are consistent with a log-normal period distribution and thermal eccentricities, subject to dynamical stability. Informed by these observations, we develop a publicly available prescription for generating mock triple star populations. Finally, we estimate the catalog's completeness and infer the intrinsic triple fraction, which rises steadily with primary mass: from $5\%$ at $\lesssim 0.5\,{\rm M_\odot}$ to $35\%$ at $2\,{\rm M_\odot}$. The public catalog provides a robust testbed for models of triple star formation and evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Cepheus A HW2 is a well-studied massive young stellar object (MYSO) featuring Class II methanol masers. Recently, certain maser components have been found to flare every five years. This period went undetected in (NEO)WISE photometry due to detector saturation. However, difference imaging revealed a light echo (LE), representing a variability record. Its periodicity is similar to that of the masers. Thereby, the mid-IR light curve since 2007 could be reconstructed. Phase and period maps provide information on the circumstellar dust distribution and viewing geometry. This is the first time an LE has been used for reverberation mapping of a YSO environment and expanding its light curve into the past.

 - **Abstract**
 Results from pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) show evidence of a gravitational wave background (GWB) consistent with a population of unresolved supermassive black hole binaries (BHBs). The observed spectrum shows a flattening at lower frequencies that can be explained by a population of eccentric BHBs. This study aims to determine the dynamical evolution and merger timescales of the most massive BHBs, which are potential sources of the GWB. We select successive galactic major mergers from the IllustrisTNG100-1 cosmological simulation and re-simulate them at high resolution with the N-body code Griffin, down to binary separations of the order of a parsec. Coalescence timescales are estimated using a semi-analytical model that incorporates gravitational wave emission and stellar hardening. Throughout our investigation, we consider the impact of prior mergers on the remnant galaxy in the form of core scouring and anisotropy, which can influence the subsequent formation and evolution of BHBs. We find that all the binaries in our sample enter the PTA band with an eccentricity e>0.85: such a large eccentricity can impact the shape of the PTA observed GWB spectrum, and it highlights the importance of including the eccentricity of binaries when interpreting the PTA signal. Furthermore, we find that: (i) starting from initial separations of a few tens of kpcs, the dynamical friction phase lasts for a few hundred Myrs; (ii) the binary formation time is not resolution dependent; (iii) the scatter on the eccentricity at binary formation decreases with increasing resolution; (iv) triple systems form whenever a third galaxy interacts with a binary which hasn't yet reached coalescence.

 - **Abstract**
 The horizontal branch (HB) phase of stellar evolution plays a critical role in understanding the life cycle of stars, particularly in the context of low-mass stars. However, generating theoretical evolutionary tracks for HB stars is computationally intensive, especially when attempting to match a wide range of observational data. This work presents an extensive grid of HB evolutionary tracks computed using the PGPUC code, covering a broad range of chemical compositions, progenitor masses, and alpha-element distributions. The aim is to provide a robust tool for interpreting HB stellar populations and advancing our understanding of their diverse properties. The evolutionary tracks are made publicly available through the PGPUC Online database for easy access and interpolation. We computed over 19,000 HB evolutionary tracks encompassing a wide range in terms of mass, metallicity, helium abundance, and alpha-element enhancement, along with different progenitor masses. Using these tracks, we calculated zero-age, middle-age, and terminal-age loci. The PGPUC database now includes a fine grid of HB evolutionary tracks, allowing for precise interpolation. Key findings include the dependence of HB morphology on progenitor mass, metallicity, and helium abundance.

 - **Abstract**
 We present high-resolution ($\sim$0.05"; 8 au) dust continuum and molecular line observations toward the Class I protostellar system IRAS 04169+2702 in the Taurus B213 region, as part of the ALMA Large Program Early Planet Formation in Embedded Disks (eDisk). The 1.3-mm dust continuum emission traces a circumstellar disk with a central depression toward the protostar. Our VLA observations of the same target reveal a single central peak dominated by the free-free emission, which coincides with the depression of the thermal dust emission. The mean spectral index of the thermal dust emission from 1.3 mm to 1.4 cm is approximately 2.8, suggestive of the presence of grains grown to millimeter or centimeter sizes in the disk. Velocity gradients along the disk major axis are seen in emission from $^{12}$CO (2-1), $^{13}$CO (2-1), and C$^{18}$O (2-1) molecular lines. The position-velocity diagrams of these lines unveil a Keplerian-rotating disk with a radius of $\sim$21 au around a 1.3 $M_{\odot}$ protostar, as well as an infalling and rotating envelope with the angular momentum conserved. In addition to the compact disk, large-scale infalling spiral structures extending up to approximately 1400 au, streamers, are discovered in C$^{18}$O (2-1), SO (6$_5$-5$_4$), and H$_2$CO (3$_{0, 3}$-2$_{0, 2}$) as well as in the 1.3-mm continuum emission. Notably, in the region closer to the protostar, the spatial coincidence of C$^{18}$O and SO may indicate the presence of a shock related to accretion through the spiral arms.

          Analysis of shape and angular orientation parameters of velocity-dependent dark matter annihilation signals in Galactic Centers for FIRE simulations

 - **Abstract**
 We use FIRE-2 zoom cosmological simulations of Milky Way size galaxy halos to characterize the shape of the J-factor emission signal on the sky. We find that, at a fixed dJ/d{\Omega} contour,the shape is well-fit by an ellipse, with semi-major axis Rmajor and semi-minor axis Rminor measured in degrees on the sky. We use least squares fitting to fit ellipses to the J-factor emission, viewed from the solar location. The ratio of minor to major axes (Rminor/Rmajor) allows us to characterize the shape of each contour, with ratio 1.0 corresponding to circular/spherical emission. These results provide new expectations for the shape of dark matter annihilation emission signals we might expect to see if dark matter is annihilating with its own anti-particle. We find that both the shape and angular orientation of the emission signal is different than results predict from dark matter only simulations. In terms of shape, we find that the ratios of semi-minor to semi-major axis is always consistently at 0.8, revealing a consistent circular emission shape, whereas with dark matter only emission signals the range of ratios from halo to halo is broader, and often closer to 0.5, showing a much more elliptical shape in general. In terms of angular orientation, we find that the major axis of the J-factor emission signal maps for FIRE halos are consistently aligned with the galactic plane within a few degrees, meaning that excess emission out of the plane would be hard to explain with a dark matter annihilation signal. However, we also find that the expected emission signal would be consistent with Fermi-LAT measurements showing a galactic center excess in full hydrodynamical simulations with stars and gas included, while dark-matter-only simulations do not produce the expected signal.

 - **Abstract**
 The classification of exoplanets has been a longstanding challenge in astronomy, requiring significant computational and observational resources. Traditional methods demand substantial effort, time, and cost, highlighting the need for advanced machine learning techniques to enhance classification efficiency. In this study, we propose a methodology that transforms raw light curve data from NASA's Kepler mission into Gramian Angular Fields (GAFs) and Recurrence Plots (RPs) using the Gramian Angular Difference Field and recurrence plot techniques. These transformed images serve as inputs to the Vision Transformer (ViT) model, leveraging its ability to capture intricate temporal dependencies. We assess the performance of the model through recall, precision, and F1 score metrics, using a 5-fold cross-validation approach to obtain a robust estimate of the model's performance and reduce evaluation bias. Our comparative analysis reveals that RPs outperform GAFs, with the ViT model achieving an 89.46$\%$ recall and an 85.09$\%$ precision rate, demonstrating its significant capability in accurately identifying exoplanetary transits. Despite using under-sampling techniques to address class imbalance, dataset size reduction remains a limitation. This study underscores the importance of further research into optimizing model architectures to enhance automation, performance, and generalization of the model.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we have developed a 6-dimensional joint probability density function for the 3-dimensional position and 3-dimensional velocity vectors of space objects in the Low Earth Orbit (LEO) based on the Principle of Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt), adhering to the principle of energy conservation. For the problem under consideration, maximizing entropy subject to energy conservation ensures that the derived probability density function (PDF) is the best representation of the uncertainty of a space object while the sampled position and velocity vectors from the PDF adhere to the orbital dynamics. We approach the entropy maximization by constructing a Lagrangian functional incorporating the energy conservation constraint and the normalization constraint of the PDF using Lagrange multipliers, setting the functional derivative of the Lagrangian to zero. This PDF can be used to generate position and velocity samples for space objects without any prior assumption and can further be utilized for orbital uncertainty propagation either using the Monte-Carlo method or by direct propagation of the PDF through the Fokker-Planck Equation.

          Analytical weak-lensing shear response of galaxy model fitting

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxy model fitting is widely employed to estimate properties such as galaxy shape, size, and color. Understanding how the outputs of galaxy model fitting respond to weak-lensing shear distortions is crucial for accurate shear estimation and mitigating shear-related systematics in weak lensing image analyses. In this paper, we investigate how the fitted parameters - specifically flux, size, and shape - respond to weak-lensing shear distortions within the AnaCal framework. To achieve this, we introduce quintuple numbers, a novel algebraic system inspired by dual numbers from automatic differentiation. Quintuple numbers enable the propagation of shear response information throughout the entire model-fitting process by linking analytical pixel shear responses to those of the fitted parameters. We integrate quintuple numbers into the AnaCal framework to derive the shear responses of shapes estimated with model fitting and validate the pipeline using image simulations that include realistic blending. Our results demonstrate that the multiplicative bias remains below 0.003 for ground-based, oversampled images.

 - **Abstract**
 We present high-resolution Keck Cosmic Web Imager (KCWI) and MUSE IFU spectroscopy of VV 114, a local infrared-luminous merger undergoing a vigorous starburst and showing evidence of galactic-scale feedback. The high-resolution data allow for spectral deblending of the optical emission lines and reveal a broad emission line component ($\sigma_{\rm{broad}} \sim$~100--300 km s$^{-1}$) with line ratios and kinematics consistent with a mixture of ionization by stars and radiative shocks. The shock fraction (percent ionization due to shocks) in the high velocity gas is anticorrelated with projected surface number density of resolved star clusters, and we find radial density profiles around clusters are well fit by models of adiabatically expanding cluster winds driven by massive stellar winds and supernovae (SNe). The total kinetic power estimated from the cluster wind models matches the wind+SNe mechanical energy deposition rate estimated from the soft band X-ray luminosity, indicating that at least 70\% of the shock luminosity in the galaxy is driven by the star clusters. \emph{Hubble Space Telescope} narrow band near-infrared imaging reveals embedded shocks in the dust-buried infrared nucleus of VV 114E. Most of the shocked gas is blueshifted with respect to the quiescent medium, and there is a close spatial correspondence between the shock map and the \emph{Chandra} soft band X-ray image, implying the presence of a galactic superwind. The energy budget of the superwind is in close agreement with the total kinetic power of the cluster winds, confirming the superwind is driven by the starburst.

 - **Abstract**
 We decomposed the G333 complex and the G331 giant molecular cloud into multi-scale hub-filament systems (HFs) using the high-resolution $^{13}$CO (3$-$2) data from LAsMA observations. We employed the filfinder algorithm to identify and characterize filaments within HFs. Compared with non-HFs, HFs have significantly higher density contrast, larger masses and lower virial ratios. Velocity gradient measurements around intensity peaks provide evidence of gas inflow within these structures. There may be an evolutionary sequence from non-HFs to HFs. Currently, non-HFs lack a distinct gravitational focusing process that would result in significant density contrast. The density contrast can effectively measure the extent of gravitational collapse and the strength of the gravitational center of the structure that definitively shape the hub-filament morphology. Combined with the kinematic evidence in our previous studies, we suggest that molecular clouds are network structures formed by the gravitational coupling of multi-scale hub-filament structures. The knots in the networks are the hubs, they are the local gravitational centers and the main star-forming sites. Actually, clumps in molecular clouds are equivalent to the hubs. The network structure of molecular clouds can naturally explain that feedback from protoclusters does not significantly change the kinematic properties of the surrounding embedded dense gas structures, as concluded in our previous studies.

 We introduce a geometric embedding method that directly constrains $H_0$ by exploiting the exact kinematic relation $\dot{z} = H_0(1+z) - H(z)$ in a unified observational framework. This approach reconstructs expansion history without requiring specific cosmological models, incorporating both existing Cosmic Chronometer data and forecasted Sandage-Loeb measurements. Through mathematical embedding of observational constraints, we achieve $\sim 1.6\%$ precision in $H_0$ determination, matching current Cepheid distance ladder accuracy while maintaining model independence. The method demonstrates how fundamental kinematic constraints enable precision cosmology, providing a promising pathway to address the Hubble tension as future redshift drift observations become available.

 - **Abstract**
 We present results of more than 13 years of Fermi-LAT data analysis for the Vela pulsar from 60 MeV to 100 GeV and its pulsar wind nebula (PWN), Vela-X, for E > 1 GeV in the off-pulse phases. We find the Vela-X PWN can be best characterized using two extended components: a large radial Gaussian accompanied by an off-set, compact radial disk, both with a similar spectral index, \Gamma \sim 2.3. The common spectral properties support a common PWN origin, but a supernova remnant component is plausible for the compact radial disk. With an updated Vela-X model, the phase resolved spectral properties of the Vela pulsar are explored through a phase-resolved analysis. The phase-resolved spectral properties of the pulsar are presented, such as the SED peak energy E$_p$, the width of the SED at its peak, d$_p$, and the asymptotic (low-energy) spectral index, $\Gamma_0$, are presented. The best-fit spectral models for each LAT pulse peak (Peak 1 and Peak 2) are extrapolated to UV energies and compared to archival, phase-resolved spectra at UV, X-ray, soft \gamma-ray and TeV energies. We also discuss the physical implications of our modeling and the data comparisons.

 - **Abstract**
 On 26 September 2022 the Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) spacecraft collided with Dimorphos, the moon of the near-Earth asteroid 65803 Didymos, in a full-scale demonstration of a kinetic impactor concept. The companion LICIACube spacecraft documented the aftermath, capturing images of the expansion and evolution of the ejecta from 29 to 243 s after the impact. We present results from our analyses of these observations, including an improved reduction of the data and new absolute calibration, an updated LICIACube trajectory, and a detailed description of the events and phenomena that were recorded throughout the flyby. One notable aspect of the ejecta was the existence of clusters of boulders, up to 3.6 m in radius, that were ejected at speeds up to 52 m/s. Our analysis of the spatial distribution of 104 of these boulders suggests that they are likely the remnants of larger boulders shattered by the DART spacecraft in the first stages of the impact. The amount of momentum contained in these boulders is more than 3 times that of the DART spacecraft, and it is directed primarily to the south, almost perpendicular to the DART trajectory. Recoil of Dimorphos from the ejection of these boulders has the potential to change its orbital plane by up to a degree and to impart a non-principal axis component to its rotation state. Damping timescales for these phenomena are such that the Hera spacecraft, arriving at the system in 2026, should be able to measure these effects.

          Expansion Signatures in 35 HII Regions traced by SOFIA [CII] Emission

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze the expansion signatures of 35 HII regions mapped in [CII] 158 micron emission by the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA). The [CII] emission primarily traces photodissociation regions (PDRs) at the transition between ionized and neutral gas. The brightness and narrow linewidth of [C II] allow us to measure PDR expansion. Bubble-shaped regions often exhibit expansion, while irregular-shaped ones are less likely to. Of the 35 HII regions, 12 (~34%) exhibit clear expansion in position-velocity (PV) diagrams, making them expansion candidates (ECs), with an average expansion velocity of ~12.2 km/s. The remaining 23 regions show no clear expansion signatures, though they may still be expanding below detection limits. Blueshifted expansion is more common (eight ECs solely blueshifted; one redshifted; three both), with mean velocities of ~10.9 km/s (blueshifted) and ~13.2 km/s (redshifted). A comparison of our observations to spherical expansion models supports expansion in eight of 12 ECs. Estimated dynamical ages are 10 to 100 times shorter than the ionizing star lifetimes, in agreement with the results of previous studies. Of the 35 regions, 14 (~40%) appear as [CII] bubbles; nine of the 12 ECs are bubble-shaped. Thermal pressure likely drives expansion in M43, while stellar winds dominate in M17, M42, RCW 120, and RCW 79. For other ECs, available data do not allow a definitive conclusion. Larger samples and more information about ionizing sources are needed to refine our understanding of HII region feedback and evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 The Indian Pulsar Timing Array (InPTA) employs unique features of the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) to monitor dozens of the International Pulsar Timing Array (IPTA) millisecond pulsars (MSPs), simultaneously in the 300-500 MHz and the 1260-1460 MHz bands. This dual-band approach ensures that any frequency-dependent delays are accurately characterized, significantly improving the timing precision for pulsar observations, which is crucial for pulsar timing arrays. We present details of InPTA's second data release that involves 7 yrs of data on 27 IPTA MSPs. This includes sub-banded Times of Arrival (ToAs), Dispersion Measures (DM), and initial timing ephemerides for our MSPs. A part of this dataset, originally released in InPTA's first data release, is being incorporated into IPTA's third data release which is expected to detect and characterize nanohertz gravitational waves in the coming years. The entire dataset is reprocessed in this second data release providing some of the highest precision DM estimates so far and interesting solar wind related DM variations in some pulsars. This is likely to characterize the noise introduced by the dynamic inter-stellar ionised medium much better than the previous release thereby increasing sensitivity to any future gravitational wave search.

 - **Abstract**
 The analysis of biorelevant molecules in returned mission samples such as from the carbonaceous asteroid (162173) Ryugu is key to unravelling the role of extraterrestrial organics in the evolution of life. Coordinated analyses using minimally destructive techniques at the finest length-scales on pristine samples are particularly important. Here, we identify the chemical signature of unique globular and nitrogen-containing diffuse organic matter in asteroid Ryugu and map the distribution of these biorelevant molecules with unprecedented detail. Using a novel electron-microscopy-based combination of vibrational and core-level spectroscopy, we disentangle the chemistry and nanoscale petrography of these organics. We show that some of these organics contain soluble and highly aliphatic components as well as NHx functional groups, that must have formed in outer solar nebula environments before parent body incorporation. These novel coordinated analyses will open up new avenues of research on these types of precious and rare asteroidal dust samples.

          The first phase of mass transfer in low-mass binaries: neither stable nor a common envelope

 - **Abstract**
 The masses of the white dwarfs in a binary carry information about previous mass-transfer phases. The core mass -- radius relation of low-mass giants gives the size of the progenitor of a helium white dwarf at the moment it last filled its Roche lobe. Previously, we used this information for a few observed systems to propose a new mass-transfer type, based on an angular momentum balance. Our aim is to investigate if stable mass transfer instead of the angular momentum prescription is consistent with the observed double helium white dwarf masses. We reconstruct the progenitor evolution of observed double helium white dwarfs using the core mass -- radius relation and evaluate if the periods at the start of the second phases of mass transfer are consistent with the outcome of stable mass transfer. More generally, we calculate the mass distribution of double helium white dwarfs for three different progenitors scenarios: double common envelope (with parameter $\alpha \lambda$), angular momentum prescription (with parameter $\gamma$) and stable mass transfer. We find that the observed systems are generally not consistent with stable mass transfer. Stable mass transfer leads to a tight correlation between the two white dwarf masses in a binary that is not consistent with the observed mass distribution. Double common envelope evolution is a particularly poor fit to the observations. The angular momentum prescription can populate the observed mass distribution, but not perfectly. We conclude that the first phase of mass transfer initiated on the red giant branch in low-mass systems does not generally proceed as stable mass transfer nor as common envelope, and thus is poorly understood. This may be related to the fact that for many observed binaries that have finished the first phase of mass transfer the orbit is eccentric, which is an unexpected outcome of mass transfer.

          On the evolution of the mass density profile of dense molecular clouds

 - **Abstract**
 We aim to obtain the equations which govern the evolution of the mass density profile of a dense irrotational molecular cloud (MC). Our study is based on the notion of "ensemble of MCs", introduced in our previous work. The MCs are modeled by use of the "ensemble abstract representative member": a spherically symmetric, isotropic and isothermal MC which accretes radially matter from its surroundings. Applying the equations of hydrodynamics to a self-gravitating isothermal spherical gas cloud, we obtain a system of 2 first-order non-linear partial differential equations, which govern the evolution of two unknown fields: the exponent of density profile and the accretion velocity. Assuming a steady-state flow, we get approximate solutions using the method of leading-order terms. Far from the cloud centre the obtained density profile is $\varrho=\ell^{-2}$ and the accretion velocity is constant, while near to the centre $\varrho=\ell^{-3/2}$ and $v_{\rm a}\propto\ell^{-1/2}$. Through our dynamical equations, the obtained solutions coincide completely with those found using the equation of energy conservation of a fluid element (in our previous work). Also, combining the equations of energy balance for a fluid element, we arrive at the conclusion that the cloud layers far from the centre are in a stable dynamical state if the accretion velocity flow is sub- or transsonic; otherwise they are marginally stable (moderately supersonic flow) or unstable (supersonic flow). Both solutions are consistent only if the accretion flow is subsonic and hence the outer layers are stable. Finally, under the assumption that both the accretion velocity and density scale with $\ell$ and their power-law exponents are position-independent, we show that the density scaling exponent far away from the centre is $p=2$ and this value is an attractor. Hence this value should be observable in dense MCs.

          Feasibility of interferometric observations and characterization of planet-induced structures at sub au to au scales in protoplanetary disks

 - **Abstract**
 Interferometric observations of protoplanetary disks by VLTI and ALMA have greatly improved our understanding of the detailed structure of these planetary birthplaces. These observations have revealed a variety of large-scale disk substructures, including rings, gaps, and spirals, spanning tens to hundreds of au, supporting the predictions of planet formation models. Recent instruments, such as MATISSE at the VLTI, allow one to resolve and investigate the inner few au of protoplanetary disks in nearby star formation regions, shedding light on the traces of planet formation and evolution at these small scales. The aim of this work is to assess the feasibility of interferometric observations of small-scale planet-induced substructures in protoplanetary disks in nearby star-forming regions. We aim to characterize these substructures in multi-wavelength and multi-epoch observations and subsequently differentiate between simulation parameters. On the basis of 3D hydrodynamic simulations of embedded planetary companions and subsequent 3D Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations, we calculated and analyzed interferometric observables, assuming observations with the VLTI in the K, L, M, and N bands. The hydrodynamic simulations exhibit mass-dependent planet-induced density waves that create observable substructures, most notably for the considered case of a 300 $M_{\oplus}$ planet. These substructures share similarities with observed large-scale structures and feature a prominent accretion region around the embedded planet. The visibilities show a detectable variability for multi-epoch VLTI/GRAVITY and VLTI/MATISSE observations, caused by the orbital motion of the planet, that are distinguishable from other sources of variability due to their unique combination of timescale and amplitude.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first IXPE spectro-polarimetric observation of the black hole candidate MAXI J1744$-$294, a transient X-ray source discovered during a bright 2025 outburst in the Galactic center region. During the $\sim$150 ks observation, the source was found in the soft state, and its spectrum was well described by an absorbed multicolor disk with a minor high-energy tail. No significant polarization was detected, and we derived a 3$\sigma$ upper limit on the polarization degree of $1.3\%$ in the 2--8 keV energy band. This result is consistent with previous findings for soft-state black hole binaries observed at low to intermediate inclination angles. By comparing the polarization degree upper limit with theoretical predictions for standard accretion disk emission, we constrain the disk inclination to $i \lesssim 38^\circ$--$71^\circ$, depending on the black hole spin and the disk atmosphere albedo.

 Around our Sun, terrestrial planets did not grow beyond Earth in mass, while super-Earths are found to orbit approximately every other solar-like star. It remains unclear what divides these super-Earth systems from those that form terrestrial planets, and what role wide-orbit gas giants play in this process. Here, we show that the key uncertainty is the degree of viscous heating in the inner disc, which regulates the pebble accretion efficiency. In this parameter study, we assume pebble sizes limited by fragmentation and radial drift. The initial seed planetesimals for embryo growth are taken from the top of the streaming instability mass distribution. We then evaluate the important role of the pebble scale height and the assumed pebble fragmentation velocity. In systems with maximally efficient viscous heating, where all the accretion heating is deposited in the disc midplane, pebble accretion in the terrestrial region is suppressed. More realistic levels of viscous heating, at higher elevations, allow terrestrial embryo formation at Earth-like orbits. We also find that the role of the water iceline is minor, unless it is paired with extreme volatile loss and a change in the pebble fragmentation velocity. Furthermore, we show that in systems with gas-giant formation, the role of mutual pebble filtering by outer pebble-accreting embryos is limited, unless some mechanism of delaying inner disc growth, such as viscous heating or the presence of an iceline, is simultaneously employed. This latter point appears to be consistent with the fact that no strong suppression is seen in the occurrence rate of super-Earths in systems with known gas giants in wider orbits. We conclude that the diversity in inner-disc systems may largely be driven by complex, and as of yet poorly understood, disc accretion physics inside the water iceline.

 - **Abstract**
 Detecting orbital eccentricity in a stellar-mass black-hole merger would point to a non-isolated formation channel. Eccentric binaries can form in dense stellar environments such as globular clusters or active galactic nuclei, or from triple stellar systems in the Galactic field. However, confidently measuring eccentricity is challenging -- short signals from high-mass eccentric mergers can mimic spin-induced precession, making the two effects hard to disentangle. This degeneracy weakens considerably for longer-duration signals. Here, GW200208_222617 provides a rare opportunity. Originating from a relatively low-mass binary with source-frame chirp mass $\sim20$ M$_\odot$, its gravitational-wave signal spanned $\sim14$ orbital cycles in band, with no indication of data quality issues. Previous analyses for quasi-circular binaries found no evidence for spin precession and, multiple subsequent studies found the data to favour an eccentric merger despite notable technical differences. All in all, we believe GW200208_222617 is the black-hole merger event from GWTC-3 with the least ambiguous detection of eccentricity. We present a critical discussion of properties and astrophysical interpretation of GW200208_222617 as an eccentric black-hole merger using models of field triples, globular clusters, and active galactic nuclei. We find that if GW200208_222617 was indeed eccentric, its origin is consistent with a field triple or globular cluster. Formation in the inner regions of an active galactic nucleus is disfavoured. The outer regions of such a disk remain a viable origin for GW200208_222617; we demonstrate how future detections of eccentric mergers formed in such environments could be powerful tools for constraining the disk geometry.

 - **Abstract**
 Time-varying dark energy is often modeled in observational analyses through generic parameterizations of its equation of state $w(z)$, which typically use two free parameters $\{w_0, w_a\}$ to span a broad range of behaviors as a function of redshift. However, this broad range of behaviors can only approximately capture the dynamics of any given microphysical theory of dark energy. A complementary approach is to use targeted parameterizations designed to model specific classes of dynamical dark energy with greater precision. Focusing on the class of thawing dark energy, we quantify and compare the precision with which nineteen generic and targeted parameterizations can capture the dynamics of physically motivated thawing quintessence theories. We find that a targeted parameterization derived from a Padé expansion of $w$ is the most reliable of these, producing accurate reconstructions of $w(z)$, the expansion history $H(z)$, and cosmological parameters such as $H_0$ and $\Omega_m$ for a broad range of microphysical theories.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational waves (GWs) from compact binary mergers have emerged as one of the most promising probes of cosmology and General Relativity (GR). However, a major challenge in fully exploiting GWs as standard sirens with current and future GW observatories is developing efficient and robust codes capable of analyzing the increasing data volumes that are, and will be, acquired. We present here \texttt{CHIMERA} 2.0, an advanced computational framework for hierarchical Bayesian inference of cosmological, modified gravity, and population hyperparameters using standard sirens and galaxy catalogs. This upgrade introduces novel GPU-accelerated algorithms to estimate the hierarchical likelihood, enabling the analysis of thousands of events - crucial for next-generation experiments - and includes the two-parameter ($\Xi_0-n$) modified GW propagation model. Using \texttt{CHIMERA} 2.0, we forecast cosmological and modified GW propagation constraints for the future LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA O5 run. We analyze three binary black hole populations of 300 events at SNR>20, each with a different value of $\Xi_0$: 0.6, 1 (corresponding to GR), and 1.8. Multiple analyses were performed each catalog, comprising a population of approximately 5000 events, thanks to \texttt{CHIMERA} 2.0, which is 10-1000 times faster depending on the settings and catalog size. We jointly infer cosmological, modified GW propagation, and population hyperparameters. With spectroscopic galaxy catalogs, the fiducial $\Xi_0$ is recovered with a precision of 22%, 7.5%, and 10% for $\Xi_0$ = 0.6, 1, and 1.8, respectively; while the precision on $H_0$ is 2-7 times worse than when $\Xi_0$ is not inferred. Finally,in the case of photometric redshifts the constraints degrade on average by 3.5 times in all cases, underscoring the importance of future spectroscopic surveys in maximizing the constraining power of standard sirens.
#### Title:
          Are quasars reliable standard candles?

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper we address the question whether the non-linear relation between the X-ray and UV emission of quasars can be used to derive their distances. In previous works of our group, we demonstrated that such a relation does not show any redshift evolution in its slope. The derived distances are in agreement with the standard flat $\Lambda$CDM model up to $z$$\sim$1.5, but they show significant deviations at higher redshifts. Yet, several authors suggested that this discrepancy is due to inconsistencies between the low- and high-redshift sources within the parent sample, or to a redshift evolution of the relation. Here, we discuss these issues through a quantitative comparison with supernova-derived distances in the common redshift range, complemented by simulations showing that all the claimed inconsistencies would naturally arise from any limitation of the cosmological model adopted for the data analysis, that is, from our ignorance of the true cosmology. We argue that the reliability of the method can only be based on a cosmology-independent evaluation of the hypothesis of non-evolution of the X-ray to UV relation at $z$>1.5, subsequent to a careful check of the sample selection and of the flux measurements for possible redshift-dependent systematic effects. Since we do not conceive any physical reason for a sudden change of the normalization of the relation at $z$>1.5, and we can exclude any severe systematic effect in the data selection and flux measurements, we conclude that the application of the X-ray to UV relation to cosmology is well motivated. To further strengthen this point, we need to achieve a better understanding of the physical process behind the observed relation and/or an independent observational proof possibly confirming the discrepancy with $\Lambda$CDM found with quasars, such as future supernova measurements at $z$$\sim$2 or higher.

          Weak-lensing tunnel voids in simulated light-cones: a new pipeline to investigate modified gravity and massive neutrinos signatures

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic voids offer a unique opportunity to explore modified gravity (MG) models. Their low-density nature and vast extent make them especially sensitive to cosmological scenarios of the class $f(R)$, which incorporate screening mechanisms in dense, compact regions. Weak lensing (WL) by voids, in particular, provides a direct probe for testing MG scenarios. While traditional voids are identified from 3D galaxy positions, 2D voids detected in WL maps trace underdense regions along the line of sight and are sensitive to unbiased matter distribution. To investigate this, we developed an efficient pipeline for identifying and analyzing tunnel voids, i.e., underdensities detected in WL maps, specifically in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the convergence. In this work, we used this pipeline to generate realistic SNR maps from cosmological simulations featuring different $f(R)$ scenarios and massive neutrinos, comparing their effects against the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Using the convergence maps and the 2D void catalogs, we analyzed various statistics, including the probability density function, angular power spectrum, and void size function. We then focused on the tangential shear profile around 2D voids, demonstrating how the proposed void-finding algorithm maximizes the signal. We showed that MG leads to deeper void shear profiles due to the enhanced evolution of cosmic structures, while massive neutrinos have the opposite effect. Furthermore, we found that parametric functions typically applied to 3D void density profiles are not suitable for deriving the shear profiles of tunnel voids. We, therefore, proposed a new parametric formula that provides an excellent fit to the void shear profiles across different void sizes and cosmological models. Finally, we tested the sensitivity of the free parameters of this new formula to the cosmological model.

          Transient gamma rays from the 2021 outburst of the recurrent nova RS Ophiuchi: the effect of gamma-ray absorption

 - **Abstract**
 In 2021, RS Ophiuchi was the first nova to be detected in the very-high-energy (TeV) gamma-ray domain, directly testifying of efficient acceleration of charged particles up to at least the TeV range at the nova shock. Surprisingly, the TeV gamma-ray signal peaks $\sim 2$ days after the GeV signal and the origin of this delay has still not been clearly understood. We investigate the possibility that this delay is due to the effect of gamma-ray absorption resulted from interactions between gamma rays and optical photons copiously emitted during the outburst. We model particle acceleration at a nova shock to obtain the gamma-ray emission produced in interactions between the accelerated particles and the shocked gas. The effect of gamma-ray absorption is then included in details using the radiative transfer equation. We find that this can naturally account for the delay between the peaks of GeV and TeV gamma-ray lightcurves. This result emphasizes the importance of gamma-ray absorption for interpreting gamma-ray observations of novae in the TeV range which, in turn, demonstrates the necessity of a multi-wavelength view for unraveling the underlying physics of particle acceleration in these systems.

 - **Abstract**
 Future telescopes will characterize rocky exoplanets in reflected light, revealing their albedo, which depends on surface, cloud, and atmospheric properties. Identifying these features is crucial for assessing habitability. We present reference spectra and phase curves for an unresolved Earth-like exoplanet in reflected and polarized light, showing how phase- and wavelength-dependent reflectance reveals key planetary properties. Using the 3D radiative transfer code MYSTIC, we enhance surface and cloud modeling with validated, wavelength-dependent albedo maps of Earth's seasonal and spectral features, alongside a novel treatment of sub-grid cloud variability using ERA5 reanalysis data. Our models, incorporating high-resolution 3D cloud structures, show that sub-grid cloud variability reduces total reflectance and increases phase curve variability, especially at large phase angles where ocean glint dominates. We also find that neglecting wavelength-dependent albedo maps overestimates the vegetation red edge in spectra. Comparing an Ocean planet to an Earth-like planet with seasonal cloud variability, we show that polarization is more sensitive than intensity alone in distinguishing both cases. Moreover, polarization captures richer surface details, making it a crucial tool for resolving retrieval degeneracies. Our simulations serve as a reference for observing Earth as an exoplanet and provide benchmarks for optimizing observational strategies and retrieval frameworks for future telescopes targeting small, rocky exoplanets.

          Near-Peak Spectrum of Gravitational Waves from Collapsing Domain Walls

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmological domain walls appear in many well-motivated extensions to the standard model of particle physics. If produced, they quickly enter into a self-similar scaling regime, where they are capable of efficiently sourcing a stochastic background of gravitational waves. In order to avoid a cosmological catastrophe, they must also decay before their enormous energy densities can have adverse effects on background dynamics. Here, we provide a suite of lattice simulations to comprehensively study the gravitational wave signatures of the domain wall network during this decay phase. The domain walls are initially formed through spontaneous breaking of a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, and subsequently decay through the action of a small bias term which causes regions of false vacuum to collapse. We find that gravitational waves are produced in abundance throughout this collapsing phase, leading to a shift in the peak frequency and increase in the overall amplitude of the spectrum by an $\mathcal{O}(100)$ factor when compared against simple analytic arguments. Importantly, we also find that the characteristic frequency of emitted gravitational waves increases as the network decays, which leads to a softening of the high frequency spectral index. This high frequency spectrum therefore carries key information related to the dynamics of the collapsing phase, and can be used to discriminate between different domain wall scenarios using upcoming data.

 - **Abstract**
 Context: Dust grains are key components of the interstellar medium and play a central role in star formation, acting as catalysts for chemical reactions and as building blocks of planets. Extinction curves are essential for characterizing dust properties, but mid-infrared (MIR) extinction remains poorly constrained in protostellar environments. Gas-phase line ratios from embedded protostellar jets provide a spatially resolved method for probing extinction through protostellar envelopes, complementing background starlight approaches. Aims: We aim to derive MIR extinction curves along sightlines toward a protostellar jet embedded in an envelope and assess whether they differ from those in dense molecular clouds. Methods: We analyze JWST NIRSpec IFU and MIRI MRS observations of four positions along the blue-shifted TMC1A jet. We extract observed [Fe II] line intensities and model intrinsic ratios using the Cloudy spectral synthesis code across a range of electron densities and temperatures. By comparing observed near-IR (NIR) and MIR line ratios to Cloudy predictions, we infer the relative extinction between NIR and MIR wavelengths. Results: Electron densities (ne) derived from NIR [Fe II] lines range from ~5 x 10^4 to ~5 x 10^3 cm^-3 at scales <~350 AU. MIR extinction values show stronger reddening than the empirical dark cloud curve from McClure (2009) at similar ne and temperatures (~10^3 to 10^4 K). If MIR emission arises from cooler, lower-density gas, extinction curves remain consistent with background starlight measurements. Conclusions: This method enables spatially resolved MIR extinction curves in embedded protostellar systems. Results suggest either a change in dust size distribution (e.g., from grain growth) or that MIR emission originates from cooler, less dense regions than NIR emission. (Abstract shortened for arXiv.

 - **Abstract**
 Ancient China recorded a wealth of astronomical observations, notably distinguished by the inclusion of empirical measurements of stellar observations. However, determining the precise observational epochs for these datasets poses a formidable challenge. This study employs the Generalized Hough Transform methodology to analyze two distinct sets of observational data originating from the Song and Yuan dynasties, allowing accurate estimation of the epochs of these stellar observations. This research introduces a novel and systematic approach, offering a scholarly perspective for the analysis of additional datasets within the domain of ancient astronomical catalogs in future investigations.

 - **Abstract**
 Ancient stellar observations are a valuable cultural heritage, profoundly influencing both cultural domains and modern astronomical research. The \textit{Shi's Star Catalog}, the oldest extant star catalog in China, faces controversy regarding its observational epoch. Determining this epoch via precession assumes accurate ancient coordinates and correspondence with contemporary stars, posing significant challenges. This study introduces a novel method using the Generalized Hough Transform to ascertain the catalog's observational epoch. This approach statistically accommodates errors in ancient coordinates and discrepancies between ancient and modern stars, addressing limitations in prior methods. Our findings date the \textit{Shi's Star Catalog} to the 4th century BCE, with 2nd-century CE adjustments. In comparison, the Western tradition's oldest known catalog, the Ptolemaic Star Catalog (2nd century CE), likely derives from the Hipparchus Star Catalog (2nd century BCE). Thus, the \textit{Shi's Star Catalog} is identified as the world's oldest known star catalog. Beyond establishing its observation period, this study aims to consolidate and digitize these cultural artifacts.

 - **Abstract**
 \ Nitrous oxide (N$_2$O) ice is likely to exist in trans-Neptunian objects such as Pluto and Triton, potentially formed through ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the Sun or cosmic ray irradiation of N$_2$ and CO ices. However, the mid-infrared spectral characteristics of N$_2$O ice in higher temperature regions (90-110 K), changes in mid-infrared spectra during UV irradiation, and the chemical network of nitrogen oxide (N$_x$O$_y$) ices remain insufficiently understood. This study aims to elucidate these aspects through in-situ mid-infrared spectral measurements of cryogenic particles using two-dimensional imaging Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Spectroscopic imaging confirmed strong absorption at 7.75 $\mu$m (N$_2$O $\nu_1$ vibrational mode), with weaker vibrational modes observed at 8.60 $\mu$m (N$_2$O 2$\nu_2$), 7.27 $\mu$m (N$_2$O torsion), and 5.29 $\mu$m (N$_2$O $\nu_1$+$\nu_2$). Annealing experiments simulating high-temperature conditions demonstrated that all vibrational modes irreversibly intensified with increasing temperature, indicating progressive crystallization. New spectral features appeared at approximately 12 $\mu$m and 14 $\mu$m at the condensed sample. N$_2$O ice was exposed to ultraviolet radiation (190-340 nm) using a D$_2$ lamp for 8.5 hours to investigate spectral changes during UV irradiation. After 60-90 minutes of irradiation, all N$_2$O vibrational modes disappeared, while absorption intensities of various nitrogen oxides, including NO, NO$_2$, N$_2$O$_3$, and O$_3$ increased. Beyond 180 minutes, vibrational modes of multiple nitrogen oxide ices exhibited intensity variations across different wavelengths, corresponding to other species such as cis-(NO)$_2$, N$_2$O$_4$, and N$_2$O$_5$.

 - **Abstract**
 The statistical characteristics of double main-sequence (MS) binaries are essential for investigating star formation, binary evolution, and population synthesis. Our previous study proposed a machine learning-based method to identify MS binaries from MS single stars using mock data from the Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST). We further utilized detection efficiencies and an empirical mass ratio distribution to estimate the binary fraction within the sample. To further validate the effectiveness of this method, we conducted a more realistic sample simulation, incorporating additional factors such as metallicity, extinction, and photometric errors from CSST simulations. The detection efficiency for binaries with mass ratios between 0.2 and 0.7 reached over 80%. We performed a detailed observational validation using the data selected from the Gaia Sky Survey and Galaxy Evolution Explorer. The detection efficiency for MS binaries in the observed sample was 65%. The binary fraction can be inferred with high precision for a set of observed samples, based on accurate empirical mass ratio distribution.

 - **Abstract**
 The statistical properties of double main sequence (MS) binaries are very important for binary evolution and binary population synthesis. To obtain these properties, we need to identify these MS binaries. In this paper, we have developed a method to differentiate single MS stars from double MS binaries from the Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST) Survey with machine learning. This method is reliable and efficient to identify binaries with mass ratios between 0.20 and 0.80, which is independent of the mass ratio distribution. But the number of binaries identified with this method is not a good approximation to the number of binaries in the original sample due to the low detection efficiency of binaries with mass ratios smaller than 0.20 or larger than 0.80. Therefore, we have improved this point by using the detection efficiencies of our method and an empirical mass ratio distribution and then can infer the binary fraction in the sample. Once the CSST data are available, we can identify MS binaries with our trained multi-layer perceptron model and derive the binary fraction of the sample.

 - **Abstract**
 White dwarfs are the final stage for most low and intermediate mass stars, which plays an important role in understanding stellar evolution and galactic history. Here we performed an asteroseismological analysis on TIC 231277791 based on 10 independent modes reported by Romero et al. Two groups of modes were identified with frequency splitting: mode identification$\_{1}$ with one $l$\,=\,1, $m$\,=\,0 mode, two $l$\,=\,2, $m$\,=\,0 modes, and three $l$\,=\,1 or 2, $m$\,=\,0 modes, and mode identification$\_{2}$ wtih one $l$\,=\,1, $m$\,=\,0 mode, three $l$\,=\,2, $m$\,=\,0 modes, and one $l$\,=\,1 or 2, $m$\,=\,0 mode. The rotation period is derived to be 41.64\,$\pm$\,2.73\,h for TIC 231277791. We established a large sample (7,558,272) of DAV star models using the White Dwarf Evolution Code (\texttt{WDEC}; 2018, v16), resulting of optimal models with model$\_{1}$ (mode identification$\_{1}$): $M_\mathrm{*}$\,=\,0.570\,$\pm$\,0.005\,$M_\mathrm{\odot}$, $T_\mathrm{eff}$\,=\,11300\,$\pm$\,10\,K, -log($M_\mathrm{H}/M_\mathrm{*}$)\,=\,9.15\,$\pm$\,0.01, -log($M_\mathrm{He}/M_\mathrm{*}$)\,=\,4.94\,$\pm$\,0.01, and $\sigma_{\textup{RMS}}$\,=\,0.06\,s, and model$\_{2}$ (mode identification$\_{2}$): $M_\mathrm{*}$\,=\,0.720\,$\pm$\,0.005\,$M_\mathrm{\odot}$, $T_\mathrm{eff}$\,=\,11910\,$\pm$\,10\,K, -log($M_\mathrm{H}/M_\mathrm{*}$)\,=\,6.11\,$\pm$\,0.01, -log($M_\mathrm{He}/M_\mathrm{*}$)\,=\,3.09\,$\pm$\,0.01, and $\sigma_{\textup{RMS}}$\,=\,0.04\,s. The central oxygen abundances are 0.71 (optimal model$\_{1}$) and 0.72 (optimal model$\_{2}$), respectively, which are consistent with the results of stellar structure and evolution theory.

 - **Abstract**
 Teegarden's star is a late-type M-dwarf planet host, typically showing only rather low levels of activity. In this paper we present an extensive characterisation of this activity at photospheric, chromospheric, and coronal levels. We specifically investigated TESS observations of Teegarden's star, which showed two very large flares with an estimated flare fluence between 10$^{29}$ and 10$^{32}$\,erg comparable to the largest solar flares. We furthermore analysed nearly 300 CARMENES spectra and 11 ESPRESSO spectra covering all the usually used chromospheric lines in the optical from the \ion{Ca}{ii} H \& K lines at 3930\,Å\, to the \ion{He}{i} infrared triplet at 10830\,Å. These lines show different behaviour: The \ion{He}{i} infrared triplet is the only one absent in all spectra, some lines show up only during flares, and others are always present and highly variable. Specifically, the H$\alpha$ line is more or less filled in during quiescence; however, the higher Balmer lines are still observed in emission. Many chromospheric lines show a correlation with H$\alpha$ variability, which, in addition to stochastic behaviour, also shows systematic behaviour on different timescales including the rotation period. Moreover, we found several flares and also report hints of an erupting prominence, which may have led to a coronal mass ejection. Finally, we present X-ray observations of Teegarden's star (i.e. a discovery pointing obtained with the \emph{Chandra} observatory) and an extensive study with the \emph{XMM-Newton} observatory; when these two large flares were observed, one of them showed clear signatures of the Neupert effect, suggesting the production of hard X-rays in the system.

 - **Abstract**
 The study of meteoroid streams reveals the full complexity of these structures. At present, we have no objective method of deciding whether the parameters of the observed meteoroid stream represent a further solution to an already known object or whether they relate to a new discovery. As result, the Meteor Data Center (MDC) database of the International Astronomical Union (IAU) contains duplicates and false duplicates of the meteor showers. It is desirable to detect questionable cases and, if possible, correct their status, thereby contributing to the improvement of the content of the IAU MDC database. The correct content of the MDC database is important in its applications, for example, in assessing the threat from meteoroids to Earth's artificial satellites. Two approaches were used, in the first the internal compatibility of geocentric and heliocentric parameters representing a given flux was verified. In the second, a comparison of two or more solutions of the same stream was made in as much detail as possible. Fifty-six streams were verified, for which clear suspicion of misclassification was established in our earlier work. For 43 streams, the misclassification was confirmed, with a proposal to change their status in the MDC to autonomous. In the remaining 13 cases, it was proposed to leave their status unchanged. Although we do not consider it 'definitive', our study clearly shows that repeated misclassification of new meteoroid flux solutions has occurred in the past. Correction of these cases will significantly improve the content of the MDC database. As an additional product, based on the approach proposed in this and our earlier work, relevant procedures have been proposed, which, available on the MDC database website, will make it possible to compare new meteoroid data with the contents of the database, thereby avoiding errors in their classification.

          Mass, Luminosity, and Stellar Age of Early-type Stars from the LAMOST Survey

 - **Abstract**
 Mass ($M$) and luminosity ($L$) are fundamental parameters of stars but can only be measured indirectly. Typically, effective temperature ($T_{\rm eff}$), surface gravity (${\rm log}\ g$) and metallicity ([M/H]) are derived from stellar spectra, then $M$, $L$ and stellar age ($t$) can be obtained by interpolating in the grid of stellar evolutionary models. In this paper, we use the Random Forest (RF) in combination with the evolutionary grid from PARSEC 1.2S to determine $M$, $L$, $t$ and initial mass ($M_{\rm i}$) for early-type main-sequence stars ($T_{\rm eff}\geq 7,000\ {\rm K}$) as identified from the LAMOST survey. The convex hull algorithm is employed to select the main-sequence stars. The results demonstrate that the prediction precision is $32\%$ and $9\%$ for $L$ and $M$, respectively, which is comparable to that achieved by fitting evolutionary tracks. Furthermore, the predicted $L$ also aligns with Gaia's observations, with a relative difference of $36\%$. The prediction for $t$ is relatively less accurate, indicating a difference of 0.44 Gyr for two components in wide binaries. This discrepancy is due to the inconsistent metallicity measurements. For the two sets of atmospheric parameters we used, the relative differences in $L$, $M$, $t$ and $M_{\rm i}$ are $29\%$, $7\%$, $36\%$ and $7\%$, respectively. The influence of metallicity on these parameters is analyzed, with the conclusion that metallicity has the greatest impact on $t$. Consequently, two catalogs are presented, which would be useful for studying stellar populations such as the luminosity function and initial mass function of early-type stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Whether the Sun is an ordinary G-type star is still an open scientific question. Stellar surveys by Kepler and TESS, however, revealed that Sun-like stars tend to show much stronger flare activity than the Sun. This study aims to reassess observed flare and spot activity of Sun-like Kepler stars by fine-tuning the criteria for a more robust definition of Sun-like conditions and better comparability between the current Sun and Sun-like stars. We update one of the recent stellar Sun-like star samples by applying new empirical stellar relations between the starspot size and the effective stellar temperature to derive more reliable starspot group sizes. From the 265 solar-type stars, we could select 48 stars supporting the Kepler 30-minute cadence light curves. These were analyzed by implementing the gradient of the power spectra method to distinguish between spot- and faculae-dominated stars. We employed the $\alpha$-factor to quantify the area ratio of bright and dark features on the stellar surface. We were able to group the 48 stars as being spot- or faculae-dominated, revealing a preferential distribution of the Kepler Sun-like stars towards the spot-dominated (44 stars) and transitional (four stars) regimes. As the current Sun is faculae-dominated, only the transitional stars were utilized for further evaluation. Additionally, accounting for comparability in stellar mass, radius, and rotation period, we show that only one of the utilized 265 Sun-like stars in the Kepler sample (i.e., KIC 11599385) allows for direct comparison to the current Sun. We further show that the single flare observed on KIC 11599385 falls right within the flare energy range estimated for the AD774/775 event observed in the cosmogenic radionuclide archives of $^{10}$Be, $^{14}$C, and $^{36}$Cl.

 - **Abstract**
 Quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs) in the Balmer continuum of solar white-light flares (WLFs) are rarely reported, and accurately pinpointing the spatial source of flaring QPPs remains a significant challenge. We present spatiotemporal characteristics of QPPs of an X2.8 two-ribbon solar WLF (SOL2023-12-14T17:02), which was well observed by the White-light Solar Telescope (WST) aboard the Advanced Space-based Solar Observatory, with high-cadence imaging (1--2 s) in the Balmer continuum at 3600 Å. Combined with additional multi-instrument data, we find that the enhancement of the WLF in both Balmer and Paschen continua shows strong spatiotemporal correlation with hard X-ray (HXR) emissions. Notably, the pulses in the WST Balmer continuum exhibited a near-zero time lag with most HXR pulses, whereas soft X-ray and extreme ultraviolet emissions showed a lag of 2--3 s. Interestingly, quasi-harmonic QPPs with periods of $\sim$11 s and $\sim$20 s were observed in multiple wavelengths in the rising phase of the white-light continuum. Furthermore, we employed Fourier transform to spatially locate the QPPs around 11 and 20 s, revealing that they primarily originated from the east flare ribbon, which exhibited the most substantial continuum enhancement. More interestingly, we find that the west ribbon contributed significantly to the 11-second QPP but had a weaker contribution to the 20-second QPP. Moreover, the occurrence of quasi-harmonic QPPs is temporally coincident with the rapid elongation and separation motions of flare ribbons. Possible mechanisms for the quasi-harmonic QPPs have been discussed. These observations provide valuable insights into QPP modeling for solar and stellar flares.

 - **Abstract**
 Domain walls (DWs) can be produced when a discrete symmetry is spontaneously broken, and long-lived DWs can dominate the energy density of the universe. In this work, we explore the possibility that a "domain wall dominant (DWD)" phase existed in the early universe and ended with DW decay. During the DWD phase, the universe undergoes a power-law accelerated expansion of the scale factor and exhibits temporal superhorizon evolution of the relevant frequency modes. We show that this can lead to distinct features imprinted on the stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background. Our findings provide a comprehensive framework for evaluating GW emission associated with DWD, leading to distinguishable long-lived DW-induced GWs from other cosmological sources, with significant implications for future GW observatories.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a modified Richardson-Lucy (RL) algorithm tailored for image reconstruction in MeV gamma-ray observations, focusing on its application to the upcoming Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI) mission. Our method addresses key challenges in MeV gamma-ray astronomy by incorporating Bayesian priors for sparseness and smoothness while optimizing background components simultaneously. We introduce a novel sparsity term suitable for Poisson-sampled data in addition to a smoothness prior, allowing for flexible reconstruction of both point sources and extended emission. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated using simulated three-month COSI observations of gamma-ray lines of $^{44}$Ti (1.157 MeV), $^{26}$Al (1.809 MeV), and positron annihilation (0.511 MeV), respectively, representing various spatial features. Our results demonstrate significant improvements over conventional RL methods, particularly in suppressing artificial structures in point source reconstructions and retaining diffuse spatial structures. This work represents an important step towards establishing a robust data analysis for studying nucleosynthesis, positron annihilation, and other high-energy phenomena in our Galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 Many astronomical questions require deep, wide-field observations at low radio frequencies. Phased arrays like LOFAR and SKA-low are designed for this, but have inherently unstable element gains, leading to time, frequency and direction-dependent gain errors. Precise direction-dependent calibration of observations is therefore key to reaching the highest possible dynamic range. Many tools for direction-dependent calibration utilise sky and beam models to infer gains. However, these calibration tools struggle with precision calibration for relatively bright (e.g. A-team) sources far from the beam centre. Therefore, the point-spread-function of these sources can potentially obscure a faint signal of interest. We show that, and why, the assumption of a smooth gain solution per station fails for realistic radio interferometers, and how this affects gain-calibration results. Subsequently, we introduce an improvement for smooth spectral gain constraints for direction-dependent gain-calibration algorithms, in which the level of regularisation is weighted by the expected station response to the sky model. We test this method using direction-dependent calibration method DDECal and physically-motivated beam modelling errors for LOFAR-HBA stations. The new method outperforms the standard method for various calibration settings near nulls in the beam, and matches the standard inverse-variance-weighted method's performance for the remainder of the data. The proposed method is especially effective for short baselines, both in visibility and image space. Improved direction-dependent gain-calibration is critical for future high-precision SKA-low observations, where higher sensitivity, increased antenna beam complexity, and mutual coupling call for better off-axis source subtraction, which may not be achieved through improved beam models alone.

 - **Abstract**
 Photo-evaporation shapes the observed radii of small exoplanets and constrains the underlying distributions of atmospheric and core masses. However, the diversity of atmospheric chemistries corresponding to these distributions remains unelucidated. We develop a first-principles carbon-hydrogen-oxygen-sulfur-silicon (CHOSSi) outgassing model that accounts for non-ideal gas behavior (via fugacities) at high pressures, as well as the tendency for water and hydrogen to dissolve in melt (via solubility laws). We use data-driven radius valley constraints to establish the relationship between the atmospheric surface pressures and melt temperatures of sub-Neptunes. Sub-Neptunes with less massive rocky cores retain less of their primordial hydrogen envelopes, which leads to less heat retention and diminished melt temperatures at the surfaces of these cores. Lower melt temperatures lead thermodynamically to the dominance of carbon-, oxygen-, sulfur- and silicon-bearing molecules over molecular hydrogen, which naturally produce a diversity of mean molecular weights. Our geochemical outgassing calculations robustly predict a gradient of mean molecular weight across the radius valley, where the strength of this gradient is primarily driven by the oxygen fugacity of the molten cores and not by the carbon enrichment (or "metallicity") of the atmosphere. Smaller sub-Neptunes are predicted to have less hydrogen-dominated atmospheres. The precise relationship between the observed and outgassed chemistries requires an understanding of how convection near the core interacts with large-scale atmospheric circulation (driven by stellar heating) near the photosphere, as well as the influence of photochemistry.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigated the use of a U-Net convolutional neural network for denoising simulated medium-resolution spectroscopic observations of stars. Simulated spectra were generated under realistic observational conditions resembling the Subaru Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS). We found that our U-Net model effectively captured spectral features, achieving an average relative error of around $1\%$ across a broad range of stellar parameters, despite a limited training set of only $1000$ observations and a relatively short training period. Although U-Net did not reach the performance previously demonstrated by fully-connected denoising autoencoders (DAEs) consisting of dense layers and trained extensively on larger datasets, it outperformed dense networks trained under similarly constrained conditions. These results indicate that the U-Net architecture offers rapid, robust feature learning and may be particularly advantageous in scenarios involving initial denoising, subsequently refined by more accurate, but otherwise slower deep-learning models.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first observations of a novel dipole signature imprinted on the CMB by transverse velocities. Cosmological peculiar velocities point towards gravitational wells and away from potential hills, reflecting a large-scale dipole in the gravitational potential, coherent over hundreds of Mpc. We predict large-scale dipoles in all fields correlated with the potential, observable via effects of gravitational lensing and the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW). The ISW dipole is distinct from the small-scale moving lens effect, which has a dipole of the opposite sign. We provide a unified framework for analysing these dipoles, and make the first detections in galaxy density, CMB lensing convergence and the ISW effect. We show that the observed signals are consistent with LCDM predictions, and set limits on modified gravity. The CMB dipole signal is independent of galaxy bias, and orthogonal to the monopole correlation function, so this new observable provides additional cosmological information (abridged).

 - **Abstract**
 Deuteration of hydrocarbon material, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), has been proposed to account for the low gas-phase abundances of D in the interstellar medium. JWST spectra of four star-forming regions in M51 show an emission feature, with central wavelength $\sim$4.647$\mu$m and FWHM 0.0265$\mu$m, corresponding to the C-D stretching mode in aliphatic hydrocarbons. The emitting aliphatic material is estimated to have (D/H)$_{\rm aliph}\approx 0.17\pm0.02$ -- a factor $\sim$$10^4$ enrichment relative to the overall interstellar medium (ISM). On $\sim$$50\,$pc scales, deuteration levels toward four H$\,$II regions in M51 are 2-3 times higher than in the Orion Bar photodissociation region (PDR), with implications for the processes responsible for the formation and evolution of hydrocarbon nanoparticles, including PAHs. The deuteration of the aliphatic material is found to anticorrelate with helium ionization in the associated H$\,$II, suggesting that harsh FUV radiation may act to lower the deuteration of aliphatics in PDRs near massive stars. No evidence is found for deuteration of aromatic material, with (D/H)$_{\rm arom} \lesssim 0.016$: deuteration of the aliphatic material exceeds that of the aromatic material by at least a factor 10. The observed levels of deuteration may account for the depletion of D observed in the Galactic interstellar medium. If so, the $4.65\mu$m feature may be detectable in absorption.

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of fluorine is still a debated question. AGB stars synthesise this element and likely contribute significantly to its synthesis in the present-day Universe. However, it is not clear whether other sources contribute, especially in the early Universe. We discuss variations of the surface abundances of fluorine coming from our massive star models and compare them with available present-day observations. We compute the contribution of massive stars in producing 19F over metallicities covering the whole cosmic history. We used models in the mass range of 9Msol < Mini < 300Msol at metallicities from Pop III up to super-solar while accounting for the required nuclear network to follow the evolution of 19F during the core H- and He-burning phases. Results from models with and without rotational mixing are presented. We find that rotating models predict a slight depletion of fluorine at their surface at the end of the MS phase. In more advanced evolutionary phases, only models with an initial mass larger than 25Msol at metallicities Z > 0.014 show phases where the abundance of fluorine is enhanced. This occurs when the star is a WR star of the WC type. WC stars can show surface abundances of fluorine ten times larger than their initial abundance. However, we obtained that the winds of massive stars at metallicities larger than Z=0.006 do not significantly contribute to fluorine production, confirming previous findings. In contrast, very metal-poor rapidly rotating massive star models may be important sources of fluorine through the mass expelled at the time of their SN explosion. Observations of WC stars at solar or super-solar metallicities may provide very interesting indications on the nuclear pathways that lead to fluorine production in massive stars. The possibility of observing fluorine-rich CEMPs is also a way to put constrains in present models at very low metallicities.

          Helium escape signatures are generally strongest during younger ages but this age dependence is lost in the diversity of observed exoplanets

 - **Abstract**
 Highly irradiated exoplanets undergo extreme hydrodynamic atmospheric escape, due to their high level of received XUV flux. Over their lifetime, this escape varies significantly, making evolution studies essential for interpreting the growing number of observations of escaping planetary atmospheres. In a previous work, we modelled this evolving escape, alongside one of its observable tracers, the helium triplet transit signature at 1083nm. Using hydrodynamic and ray-tracing models, we demonstrated that atmospheric escape and the corresponding He 1083nm signature are stronger at younger ages, for a 0.3$~M_\text{J}$ gas-giant. Yet, the current literature includes several young (<1Gyr) planets with weak or non-detections in He 1083nm. To understand this apparent discrepancy, we now perform detailed modelling for many of these systems. The resulting He 1083nm predictions align relatively well with the observations. From our two studies, we conclude that for any given planet, stronger atmospheric escape during younger ages produces deeper He 1083nm absorption. However, for a population of exoplanets, the relation between younger ages and stronger He absorptions is lost to the broad diversity of their various other system parameters. Accordingly, for the current sample of young, 1083nm-observed exoplanets, alternative trends take precedence. One such trend is that planets with deeper geometrical transits exhibit more favourable detections. Our modelling also agrees with the strong empirical trend in the literature between $ EW \cdot R_{*}^{2}$ and $F_{\text{xuv}} \cdot R_{\text{pl}}^2 / \Phi_{g}$. Additionally, we show that the coupling between the lower and upper atmospheres is necessary for a robust prediction of the 1083nm signature.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a numerical code that solves the Misner-Sharp system for a spherically symmetric cosmological model containing both a scalar field and a perfect fluid. While the code is capable of exploring general scenarios involving an minimally coupled scalar field and perfect fluid, we focus on the regime where the scalar field dominates the dynamics, particularly in the post-inflationary scalar field-dominated scenario, where the universe is governed by a rapidly oscillating scalar field for a period lasting a few $e$-folds. We analyse the threshold for PBH formation under quadratic and quartic potentials, evolving configurations from superhorizon scales. Our results confirm that a quartic potential behavior is similar to the radiation-dominated universe, resulting in a PBH formation threshold close to the well-established value in radiation backgrounds. Conversely, in the quadratic case, we observe a significant deviation from the expected dust-like behaviour, due to wave-like effects opposing the gravitational collapse. While numerical limitations prevent us from evolving a wide range of initial conditions to determine a precise threshold for PBH formation, our findings suggest that PBH formation may be suppressed with respect to the pure dust scenario, allowing the formation of stable solitonic structures instead. This study highlights the importance of properly accounting for wave dynamics in oscillating scalar fields when characterising PBH formation.

 - **Abstract**
 The ability to infer properties of primordial inflation relies on the conservation of the superhorizon perturbations between their exit during inflation, and their re-entry during radiation era. Any considerable departure from this property would require reinterpreting the data. This is why it is important to understand how superhorizon perturbations interact with the thermal plasma driving the radiation dominated Universe. We model the plasma by free photons in a thermal state and compute the one-loop correction to the power spectrum of primordial tensor perturbations. This correction grows in time and is not suppressed by any small parameter. While one-loop result is not reliable because it invalidates perturbation theory, it signals potentially interesting effects that should be investigated further.

 - **Abstract**
 4U 1820-30 is a ultracompact X-ray binary located in the globular cluster NGC 6624, consisting of a neutron star accreting material from a helium white dwarf companion characterized by the shortest known orbital period for this type of star (11.4 minutes). Despite extensive studies, the detection of the relativistic Fe K emission line, has been inconsistently reported and no measurement of the system inclination has been achieved. In this work, we investigate the broadband spectral and polarimetric properties of 4U 1820-30, exploring the presence of a reflection component and its role in shaping the polarization signal. We analyzed simultaneous X-ray observations from NICER, NuSTAR, and IXPE. The spectral continuum was modeled with a disk blackbody, a power law, and a Comptonization component with seed photons originating from a boundary layer. We detected a strong reflection component, described, for the first time, with two self-consistent models ({\tt Relxillns} and {\tt Rfxconv}), allowing us to provide a measurement of the system inclination angle (about 31 degrees), supporting the low-inclination hypothesis. Subsolar iron abundances were detected in the accretion disk and interstellar medium, probably related to the source location in a metal-poor globular cluster. The polarization increases from an upper limit of $1.2\%$ in the 2--4 keV band up to about $8\%$ in the 7--8 keV range. The disk is expected to be orthogonally polarized to these components, which may help to explain the decreasing of the observed polarization at low energies. However, the high polarization degree we found challenges the current models, also taking into consideration the relatively low inclination angle derived from the spectral analysis.

 - **Abstract**
 Based on well-grounded Galactic neutron star populations formed from radio pulsar population syntheses of canonical pulsars (CPs) and millisecond pulsars (MSPs), we use the latest Fermi-LAT catalog (4FGL-DR4) to investigate the implications of proposed $\gamma-$ray luminosity models. Using Monte Carlo techniques, we calculate the number of CPs and MSPs that would comprise the sample of pulsar-like unidentified sources (PLUIDs) in 4FGL-DR4. While radio beaming fractions were used to scale the sizes of the populations, when forming the mock 4FGL-DR4 samples, we make the simplifying assumption that all $\gamma-$ray pulsars are beaming towards the Earth. We then explore the observable outcomes of seven different $\gamma-$ray luminosity models. Four of the models provide a good match to the observed number of PLUIDs, while three others significantly over-predict the number of PLUIDs. For these latter models, either the average beaming fraction of $\gamma-$ray pulsars is more like 25--50\%, or a revision in the luminosity scaling is required. Most of the radio detectable MSPs that our models predict as part of the PLUIDs within 4FGL-DR4 are, unsurprisingly, fainter than the currently observed sample and at larger dispersion measures. For CPs, in spite of an excellent match to the observed radio population, none of the $\gamma-$ray models we investigated could replicate the observed sample of 150 $\gamma-$ray CPs. Further work is required to understand this discrepancy. For both MSPs and CPs, we provide encouraging forecasts for targeted radio searches of PLUIDs from 4FGL-DR4 to elucidate the issues raised in this study.

 - **Abstract**
 Moving groups in the solar neighborhood are ensembles of co-moving stars, likely originating due to forces from spiral arms, the Galactic bar, or external perturbations. Their co-movement with young clusters indicates recent star formation within these moving groups, but a lack of precise three-dimensional position and velocity measurements has obscured this connection. Using backward orbit integrations of 509 clusters within 1 kpc - based on Gaia DR3 and supplemented with APOGEE-2 and GALAH DR3 radial velocities - we trace their evolution over the past 100 Myr. We find that most clusters separate into three spatial groups that each trace one of the Pleiades, Coma Berenices, and Sirius moving groups. The same trend is not seen for the Hyades moving group. The young clusters of the Alpha Persei, Messier 6, and Collinder 135 families of clusters, previously found to have formed in three massive star-forming complexes, co-move with either the Pleiades (Alpha Persei and Messier 6) or Coma Berenices (Collinder 135). Our results provide a sharper view of how large-scale Galactic dynamics have shaped recent, nearby star formation.

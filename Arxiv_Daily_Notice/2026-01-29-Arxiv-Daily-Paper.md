- **Abstract**
 We present observations of HCN and HCO$^+$ J = $3 - 2$ in the central $424'' \times 424''$ region of the W40 massive star forming region. The observations were taken as part of a pilot project for the MAJORS large program at the JCMT telescope. By incorporating prior knowledge of N(H$_2$) and $T_K$, assuming a constant density, and using the RADEX radiative transfer code we found that the HCN and HCO$^+$ abundances range from $X$(HCN) = $0.4-7.0 \times 10^{-8}$ and $X$(HCO$^+$) = $0.4-7.3 \times 10^{-9}$. Additional modelling using the NAUTILUS chemical evolution code, that takes H$_2$ density variations into account, however, suggests the HCN and HCO$^+$ abundances may be fairly constant. Careful modelling of three different positions finds $X$(HCN) = $1.3-1.7 \times 10^{-8}$, $X$(HCO$^+$) = $1.3-3.1 \times 10^{-9}$. Cross-comparison of the two models also provides a crude estimate of the gas density producing the HCN and HCO$^+$ emission, with H$_2$ densities in the range $5 \times 10^4 - 5 \times 10^5$ cm$^{-3}$, suggesting that the HCN and HCO$^+$ emission does indeed arise from dense gas. High UV intensity (e.g. $G_o >$ a few thousand) has no effect on the abundances in regions where the visual extinction is large enough to effectively shield the gas from the UV field. In regions where $A_V < 6$, however, the abundance of both species is lowered due to destructive reactions with species that are directly affected by the radiation field.

- **Abstract**
 Inferring stellar parameters and chemical abundances by forward modeling stellar spectra usually requires a spectral synthesis code, or an emulator constructed from a curated training set. In these situations continuum normalization is often implemented as a pre-processing step that is independent of stellar parameters. This leads to results that are biased, or inconsistent across signal-to-noise ratios. A more justified approach is to forward model spectra with all nuisances simultaneously, but in practice this can be an expensive or non-convex optimization procedure. Here we describe a constrained linear model that can fit stellar absorption, telluric transmission, the joint continuum-instrument response. Stellar absorption and telluric transmission are each modeled by factorizing a grid of rectified theoretical spectra into two non-negative matrices with a chosen number of basis components. This model characterizes all possible spectra in many fewer parameters than comparable data-driven models. The non-negativity constraint ensures basis vectors are strictly additive, which limits rectified flux to less than or equal to unity, such that we can distinguish normalized spectra from the joint instrument-continuum response. The model requires no initial guess, and the linearity ensures that inference is convex, stable, and fast. This model allows us to reliably fit nuisances (e.g., tellurics, continuum), and is readily extensible to radial velocity and rotational broadening, without any prior knowledge about the fundamental stellar properties. We demonstrate our method by fitting ESO/HARPS high-resolution echelle spectra of BAFGKM-type stars. With repeat observations of $\alpha$-Centauri A we present results that are best in class: consistent across time to 0.2% at S/N ~ 100, and to better than 0.5% at S/N ~ 30.

- **Abstract**
 Long-period variables (LPVs) are evolved red giant and supergiant stars whose pulsations provide unique insights into late stages of stellar evolution and serve as essential tools in modern astrophysics. Their period-luminosity and period-age relations make them valuable distance and age indicators, while their light curve morphology, amplitudes, and multiperiodicity reveal the underlying physics of stellar interiors and mass-loss. In this review, we provide an overview of the current status of LPV studies, focusing on their observational properties and applications, including: - Modern classification of LPVs into Miras, semiregular variables (SRVs), and OGLE small-amplitude red giants (OSARGs), which occupy multiple period-luminosity sequences associated with different pulsation modes, chemical compositions, and evolutionary stages - Mira variables as reliable distance indicators across diverse stellar environments and their increasing role as standard candles - The increasing role of SRVs and OSARGs - Long secondary period (LSP) variables as potential tracers of exoplanets Together with advances in theoretical modeling, these developments establish LPVs as valuable tracers of Galactic structure, stellar populations, and the extragalactic distance scale.

- **Abstract**
 Context: The radial drift and fragmentation of small dust grains in protoplanetary discs impedes their growth past centimetre sizes. Several mechanisms have been proposed to overcome these planet formation barriers, such as dust porosity or the streaming instability (SI), which is today regarded as the most promising mechanism to form planetesimals. Aims: Here, we examine whether the conditions for the SI to lead to strong clumping, the first step in planetesimal formation, are realised in protoplanetary discs containing porous grains. Methods: We used results from previous simulations of the evolution of porous grains subjected to growth, fragmentation, compaction and bouncing in protoplanetary discs. In the ensuing disc structures, we determined the regions where the dust-to-gas ratio exceeds the critical value for strong clumping found in simulations of the SI including external turbulence. Results: We find that the conditions for strong clumping are met within the first hundred thousand years in large regions of protoplanetary discs containing porous grains, provided that the CO snow line is taken into account. If the CO snow line is neglected, the conditions are met only very close to the inner disc edge early on, or over large areas well after 200,000 yr.

- **Abstract**
 Theoretical models of low-mass stars continue to be discrepant with observations when used to examine the mass-radius relationship and other physical parameters of individual stars. High-resolution spectroscopy that leads to dynamical measurements of binary stars can directly improve these models. We have been using the Habitable-zone Planet Finder spectrograph to monitor binary stars with M dwarf components. Here, we measure the orbital and stellar parameters for three such systems: LSPM J0515+5911, NLTT 43564, and NLTT 45468. Each system has dozens of spectra obtained over a baseline of several years. None of the systems appear to be eclipsing, so our ability to turn them into true benchmark binaries with purely dynamical measurements is limited. We use literature photometry to estimate each system's spectral energy distribution and utilize models in combination with detection limits of our spectroscopic measurements to probe characteristics of the companions. LSPM J0515+5911 is a double-lined spectroscopic binary with period of $126.948 \pm 0.029$ days and derived minimum masses, $M_1\sin^3i =0.058 \pm 0.002$ $M_\odot$ and $M_2\sin^3i = 0.046 \pm 0.001$ $M_\odot$ for the primary and secondary components, respectively. We solved NLTT 43564 with period of $1877 \pm 24$ days and NLTT 45468 with period of $9.686 \pm 0.001$ days as single lined systems, and modeled the primary masses to be $M_1 = 0.32\pm{0.02}$ $M_\odot$ and $M_1 = 0.35^{+0.02}_{-0.07}$ $M_\odot$, respectively.

- **Abstract**
 This work describes the formalism for estimating thermonuclear reaction rates for astrophysical applications, emphasizing modern statistical approaches such as Monte-Carlo sampling and Bayesian models. We discuss related topics including the calculation of resonance energies from nuclear Q values, indirect estimates of particle partial widths, and matching of reaction rates at elevated temperatures to statistical-model results. We have evaluated available experimental data on cross sections, resonance energies and strengths, partial widths, life-times, spin-parities, and spectroscopic factors. Based on these results, we have estimated numerical values of 78 experimental charged-particle thermonuclear reaction rates for target nuclei in the A = 2 to 40 mass region, for temperatures ranging from 1 MK to 10 GK. For each reaction, three rate values are provided: low, median, and high, corresponding to the 16th, 50th, and 84th percentiles, respectively, of the cumulative reaction rate probability density distribution. Additionally, we present the factor uncertainty of each rate at each temperature grid point. These results enable users to sample the reaction rate probability density in nucleosynthesis calculations, facilitating uncertainty estimates of nuclidic abundances. The rates presented here refer to their laboratory values. For use in stellar model simulations, these values need to be corrected for the effects of thermal excitations of the interacting nuclei. For each reaction, we include graphs that illustrate the fractional contributions to the overall reaction rate along with the associated uncertainty. These visuals are designed to assist both stellar modelers and nuclear experimentalists by identifying the primary sources of rate uncertainty at specific stellar temperatures. A graphical comparison with earlier Monte-Carlo rates is also provided.

          H$_2^{18}$O in the terrestrial planet-forming regions of protoplanetary disks

- **Abstract**
 Isotopologues play an important role in solar system cosmochemistry studies, revealing details of early planet formation physics and chemistry. Oxygen isotopes, as measured in solar system materials, reveal evidence for both mass-dependent fractionation processes and a mass-independent process commonly attributed to isotope-selective photodissociation of CO in the solar nebula. The sensitivity of JWST's MIRI-MRS enables studies of isotopologues in the terrestrial planet-forming regions around nearby young stars. We report here on a search for H$_2^{18}$O in 22 disks from the JDISC Survey with evidence for substantial water vapor reservoirs, with the goal of measuring H$_2^{16}$O/H$_2^{18}$O ratios, and potentially revealing the predicted enhancement of H$_2^{18}$O caused by isotope-selective photodissociation. We find marginal detections of H$_2^{18}$O in six disks, and a more significant detection of H$_2^{18}$O in the disk around WSB 52. Modeling of the detected H$_2^{18}$O lines assuming an ISM ratio of H$_2^{16}$O/H$_2^{18}$O predicts H$_2^{18}$O features consistent with observations for four of the modeled disks, but stronger H$_2^{18}$O features than are observed in three of the modeled disks, which includes WSB 52. Therefore, these latter three disks require a higher H$_2^{16}$O/H$_2^{18}$O ratio than the ISM in the water-emitting region, in contrast to long-standing theoretical expectations. We suggest that either the H$_2^{18}$O-rich water has been removed from the emitting region and replaced by H$_2^{18}$O-poor water formed by reactions with $^{18}$O-poor CO, or that the gas-phase water is depleted in $^{18}$O via mass-dependent fractionation processes at the water snowline.

- **Abstract**
 (Abridged) Complex organic molecules (COMs) are considered essential precursors to prebiotic species. While COMs were once expected to be efficiently destroyed under UV-irradiated conditions, detections in photodissociation regions (PDRs) have challenged this view. However, the mechanisms by which UV radiation contributes to their formation are still uncertain. Here, we present moderately resolved maps of simple and complex organic molecules at the UV-illuminated edge of the Horsehead nebula, obtained by combining ALMA and IRAM 30m single-dish observations at $\sim 15^{\prime\prime}$ resolution. We analyze the spatial distribution of species such as C$^{17}$O, CH$_2$CO, CH$_3$CHO, HNCO, CH$_3$CN, and HC$_3$N. By incorporating previous C$^{17}$O and C$^{18}$O single-dish data as well as PdBI maps of H$_2$CO and CH$_3$OH, we derive profiles of gas density, temperature, thermal pressure, and column densities of the organic species as a function of distance from the UV source. Our results show that most organic species$-$particularly H$_2$CO, CH$_2$CO, CH$_3$CHO, HNCO, and CH$_3$CN$-$exhibit enhanced column densities at the UV-illuminated edge compared to cloud interiors, possibly indicating efficient dust-grain surface chemistry driven by the diffusion of atomic C and radicals produced via photodissociation of CO and CH$_3$OH, as supported by recent laboratory experiments. The exceptions, HC$_3$N and CH$_3$OH, can be attributed to inefficient formation on dust grains and ineffective non-thermal desorption into the gas phase, respectively. Additionally, contributions from gas-phase hydrocarbon photochemistry$-$possibly seeded by grain-surface products$-$cannot be ruled out. Further chemical modeling is needed to confirm the efficiency of these pathways for the studied species, which could have important implications for other cold, UV-irradiated environments such as protoplanetary disks.

- **Abstract**
 The 6.7 GHz methanol maser in a high-mass star-forming region G33.641$-$0.228 is known to exhibit burst-like flux variability due to an unknown mechanism. To investigate the burst mechanism, we conducted high-cadence flux and circular polarization monitoring observations, simultaneously using left- and right-hand circular polarizations. We found that the flux density increased and decreased on a short timescale of 0.3 d during a burst. We also found strong circular polarization, reaching up to 20\% in the component exhibiting the bursts. Circular polarization of 0--20\% was continuously observed from 2009 to 2016, even in the quiescent period. The polarization also varied on timescales of less than one day. When a burst occurred and the flux density increased, the circular polarization decreased to zero. To explain the observational properties of the flux variability and circular polarization, we propose a model in which an explosive event similar to a solar radio burst occurs on the line of sight behind the maser cloud, producing circularly polarized continuum emission due to gyro-synchrotron or gyro-resonance radiation, which is then amplified by the maser.

          Massive dusty multiphase outflow in local merger shows no sign of slowing on kiloparsec scales

- **Abstract**
 We use ALMA CO(1-0) observations and VLT/MUSE rest-frame optical data of the ultraluminous infrared galaxy (ULIRG) IRAS20100-4156 at $z=0.1297$ to characterize its powerful outflow in multiple phases using tracers of cold molecular, ionized, and neutral atomic gas and dust as well. Our analysis uses the correspondence with the stellar velocity field to split the complex emission line profiles of the CO(1-0) line into components in gravitational and non-gravitational motion. We find a massive ($8\times10^{9}\,M_\odot$) molecular outflow containing about 40% of the total molecular gas mass in the system. The outflow shows a bi-conical morphology centered on the brightest galaxy in the merger, oriented along its minor axis and extending to $\sim5\,\mathrm{kpc}$. This outflow has a characteristic velocity of $170\,\mathrm{km/s}$, an outflow mass rate of $700\,M_\odot/\mathrm{yr}$, a depletion time of $16\,\mathrm{Myr}$, and energetics consistent with star formation as a driver. The neutral atomic and ionized gas phases traced by NaI absorption and H$\alpha$ emission show counterparts to the blueshifted cold molecular outflow but are only 15% and 3% as massive. None of the three gas phases show any signs of slowing down over the extent at which we detected the outflow, suggesting an acceleration mechanism acting on the outflowing gas at kiloparsec scales. We also detect $3.5\times 10^7\,M_\odot$ of dust, traced by optical extinction in the MUSE data, in the blueshifted outflowing cold molecular gas. The ionization state of the non-outflowing gas is consistent with star formation, while the outflowing component shows shock-like ionization. We conclude that the multiphase outflow in IRAS20100-4156 originates in the southeast nucleus of the merger and is driven by the starburst activity there, with radiation pressure likely playing a significant role in its acceleration.

          Analyzing PAHs as a Tracer of Anomalous Microwave Emission Near the Galactic Plane Using the COSMOGLOBE DIRBE Reduction

- **Abstract**
 The physical mechanism producing Anomalous Microwave Emission (AME) has been an unresolved puzzle for close to 30 years. One candidate mechanism is rotational emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) which can have the necessary electric dipole moment and size distribution to account for the AME in representative interstellar environments. However, previous investigations have found that AME is better correlated with the far-infrared dust emission rather than the PAH emission. In this work we analyze the correlations between the AME and the PAH and far-infrared dust emission using the 3.3 $\mu$m PAH emission feature as observed by band 3 of the Diffuse Infrared Background Experiment (DIRBE). This analysis builds on previous work conducted in individual molecular clouds and extends it into fainter, more diffuse structures. In addition, we utilize the COSMOGLOBE DIRBE reduction for this work, building on previous studies that used the original DIRBE data set. We find that the AME is better correlated with far-infrared dust emission ($\rho\sim$0.9) than the PAH emission ($\rho\sim$0.7) in the central $|b|\leq$ 10\degree\ region of the sky. This could indicate either that non-PAH dust grains or an alternative physical emission mechanism is primarily responsible for the AME in the Galactic Plane, or that the excitation conditions for mid-infrared emission and for AME from PAHs differ substantially.

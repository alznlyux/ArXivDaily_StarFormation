- **Abstract**
 Sulfur dioxide (SO$_2$) ice has been tentatively detected in protostellar envelopes, but its reliability as a solid-state sulfur reservoir remains unclear. We present new measurements of SO$_2$ ice from 6.8-8.5 $\mu$m toward four Class 0 protostars observed with JWST's Mid-Infrared (MIRI) Medium Resolution Spectrometer, as part of the COMs ORigin Investigated by the Next-generation Observatory in Space (CORINOS) program. The sample spans a luminosity range from 1 $L_\odot$ (B335, IRAS 15398-3359) to 10 $L_\odot$ (L483, Ser-emb~7). To assess continuum placement uncertainty in absorption spectra, we apply randomized polynomial fits over the restricted region. We fit laboratory spectra from the Leiden Ice Database for Astrochemistry (LIDA) using the open-source Python library Omnifit. We detect the 7.7 $\mu$m CH$_4$ band in all sources and find its column density robust to baseline choice, providing a reference for evaluating the weaker SO$_2$ feature on its blue shoulder and quantifying baseline-related uncertainty. Three SO$_2$ laboratory ices were tested: pure SO$_2$ ice yields 0.3-1.2% of volatile sulfur may be locked in SO$_2$ ice (lower and upper limits); CH$_3$OH:SO$_2$ ice gives 0.02-0.18%, but with lower quality fitting. The best-fitting H$_2$O:SO$_2$ ice yields 0.2-0.9%, which we consider the most realistic. These ranges define plausible bounds on SO$_2$ ice abundances in our sample. We find evidence for SO$_2$ in Ser-emb 7, L483, and IRAS 15398-3359, but emphasize the noisy spectrum of B335 prevents a definitive detection. Comparing SO$_2$ ice abundances across the different environments, we assess how conditions influence role of SO$_2$ as a potential sulfur reservoir and implications for the longstanding ``missing sulfur'' problem.

- **Abstract**
 Star clusters have long been central to the study of stellar evolution due to their chemically and chronologically homogeneous populations. Asteroseismology, the analysis of stellar oscillations and pulsations, provides precise information about properties such as masses, radii, and ages of stars in the field. However, these stars lack calibration to an absolute scale, and so this project seeks to utilize the data from NASA's TESS mission and ESA's Gaia mission to identify additional cluster stars suitable for asteroseismic analysis and calibration. In this work we analyze 14 stars belonging to 3 well-populated clusters, 5 additional stars that are the only detected oscillators in their respective clusters, and 3 detected oscillators of unknown cluster membership. By significantly expanding the number of clusters with measured oscillating giants, this project increases the opportunity for cross-validation between classical stellar models and asteroseismic methods, allowing for improvements in both calibration techniques and age estimations across the galaxy.

          Asteroseismology and Dynamics Reveal Interior Structure and Coeval Evolution in the Triply Post-Main-Sequence system DG Leo

- **Abstract**
 $\delta$ Scuti stars in binary or multiple systems serve as crucial probes for studying stellar pulsation and evolution. However, many such systems are not ideal for asteroseismology due to uncertainties in mass transfer with close companions and the challenges of dynamically measuring all components' physical properties. The triple system DG~Leo, comprising an inner binary and a distant $\delta$ Scuti star, is an ideal target due to its well-separated pulsator. By combining new \textit{TESS} photometry with archival spectroscopy, our dynamical analysis shows that the system's three components share similar masses, radii, and luminosities within errors, occupying coincident Hertzsprung--Russell diagram positions, indicative of coeval evolution. By fitting seven observed $\delta$ Scuti frequencies through asteroseismic modeling with dynamically constrained theoretical grids, we simultaneously trace the pulsating star's evolution and constrain the triple system's evolutionary stage, with the derived fundamental parameters showing consistency with the dynamical solutions. Our analysis reveals that all three components of DG~Leo are in the post-main-sequence phase, with a system age of $0.7664^{+0.1402}_{-0.1258}$~Gyr. Additionally, the $\delta$ Scuti component shows multiple non-radial modes with significant mixed-character frequencies, providing precise constraints on its convective core extent ($R_{\mathrm{cz}}/R = 0.0562^{+0.0137}_{-0.0021}$).

          The disc instability model: original recipe and additional ingredients

- **Abstract**
 The disc instability model successfully reproduces many of the observed properties of cataclysmic variables. However, additional ingredients such as mass-transfer variations, disc irradiation, stream-disc overflow, or inner-disc truncation must be included to explain certain systems. The physics underlying these processes is often poorly constrained, and our lack of knowledge is typically absorbed into extra free parameters, much like the $\alpha$-prescription for viscosity. In this paper, I examine how each of these ingredients affects the predicted light curves and discuss the limitations that arise from the growing number of unconstrained parameters on the model's predictive power.

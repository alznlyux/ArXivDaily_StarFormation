#### Title:
          Land use and anisotropy of artificial light observed by night time satellite

 - **Abstract**
 Upward emission of artificial light has been investigated by researchers since the commissioning of the Visible/Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Day/Night Band (DNB) in 2011, with applications ranging from night time light mapping to quantifying socio-economical development. The wide swath of the VIIRS-DNB sensor enables detection of artificial light at multiple angles and was utilized to study emission of artificial light from cities at different angles as well as atmospheric properties. Existing studies of the relationship between the directionality and land surface features are not available for most of the Earth's surface due to the use of space-borne LiDAR as a source of proxy. To solve this problem, we compared the land use data published under the Coordination of Information on the Environment (CORINE) against the fit parameters of radiance of upward artificial light. In general, the quadratic term of the fit, which quantifies how the brightness changes when viewing closer from the horizon at a point on the Earth, is negative when the area is "Continuous urban fabric" or "Sparsely vegetated areas", and vice versa for all other investigated land use classes. However the quadratic term shifts towards negative values for brighter areas. These results indicate that while densely built areas emit more light towards the zenith than sideways, the VIIRS-DNB is unable to distinguish small densely built areas scattered around larger unbuilt areas. Therefore, sensors with higher spatial resolution will be required to resolve the light emission patterns of areas with complicated combinations of land uses.

          A systematic meta-analysis of physical parameters of Galactic supernova remnants

 - **Abstract**
 Supernova remnants (SNRs) are the aftermath of massive stellar explosions or of a white dwarf in a binary system, representing critical phases in the life cycle of stars and playing an important role in galactic evolution. Physical properties of SNRs such as their shock velocity, density and age are important elements for constraining models for their evolution and understanding the physical processes responsible for their morphological appearance and emission processes. Our study provides, for the first time, a comprehensive statistical analysis of the physical parameters in 64 Galactic SNRs both as a population as well as regions within individual objects. These 64 objects represent the subset of the 310 known Galactic SNRs for which there are published optical data, from which we compiled their physical parameters through an exhaustive literature survey. Through a systematic statistical analysis accounting for uncertainties and/or upper and lower limits in these parameters we obtain distributions of the electron density and shock velocity in the studied SNRs and regions within them. This information is combined with constraints on their age and type. Analysis of electron density and shock velocity distributions for the entire sample of SNRs shows that they are consistent with a log-normal distribution and a skewed log-normal distribution, respectively. Within individual remnants, our study reveals that electron density and shock velocity show larger scatter in younger objects, reflecting the varying conditions of the ambient medium immediately surrounding the explosion epicenter and their impact on SNR evolution. Comparison of the dependence of the shock velocity and density on the supernova age with expectations from theoretical models shows good agreement.

          DISCO-DJ II: a differentiable particle-mesh code for cosmology

 - **Abstract**
 The mildly non-linear regime of cosmic structure formation holds much of the information that upcoming large-scale structure surveys aim to exploit, making fast and accurate predictions on these scales essential. We present the $N$-body module of DISCO-DJ (DIfferentiable Simulations for COsmology - Done with Jax), designed to deliver high-fidelity, GPU-accelerated, and differentiable particle-mesh simulations tailored for cosmological inference. Theory-informed time integrators such as the recently introduced BullFrog method allow for accurate predictions already with few time steps (e.g. $6$ steps for per-cent-level accuracy in terms of the present-day power spectrum at $k \approx 0.2 \, h / \mathrm{Mpc}$ using $N = 512^3$ particles, which takes just a few seconds). To control discreteness effects and achieve high accuracy, the code incorporates a suite of advanced techniques, for example a custom non-uniform FFT implementation for force evaluation. Both forward- and reverse-mode differentiation are supported, with memory requirements independent of the number of time steps; in the reverse case, this is achieved through an adjoint formulation. We extensively study the effect of various numerical parameters on the accuracy. As an application of DISCO-DJ, we perform field-level inference by recovering $\sigma_8$ and the initial conditions from a noisy Gadget matter density field. Coupled with our recently introduced Einstein--Boltzmann solver, the DISCO-DJ ecosystem provides a self-consistent, fully differentiable pipeline for modelling the large-scale structure of the universe. The code is available at this https URL.

          QML-FAST - A Fast Code for low-$\ell$ Tomographic Maximum Likelihood Power Spectrum Estimation

 - **Abstract**
 We present a novel implementation for the quadratic maximum likelihood (QML) power spectrum estimator for multiple correlated scalar fields on the sphere. Our estimator supports arbitrary binning in redshift and multipoles $\ell$ and includes cross-correlations of redshift bins. It implements a fully optimal analysis with a pixel-wise covariance model. We implement a number of optimizations which make the estimator and associated covariance matrix computationally tractable for a low-$\ell$ analysis, suitable for example for kSZ velocity reconstruction or primordial non-Gaussianity from scale-dependent bias analyses. We validate our estimator extensively on simulations and compare its features and precision with the common pseudo-$C_\ell$ method, showing significant gains at large scales. We make our code publicly available. In a companion paper, we apply the estimator to kSZ velocity reconstruction using data from ACT and DESI Legacy Survey and construct full set of QML estimators on 40 correlated fields up to $N_{\text{side}}= 32$ in timescale of an hour on a single 24-core CPU requiring $<256\ \mathrm{Gb}$ RAM, demonstrating the performance of the code.

 - **Abstract**
 Hydrodynamic escape can strip the envelopes of close-in exoplanets, but most observations of atmospheric mass loss to date have been confined to planets orbiting K and M dwarfs. A growing body of detections of atmospheric escape from planets orbiting early-type stars indicates that they may have significantly stronger and more extended outflows than planets orbiting cooler stars. However, it is unclear whether this limited sample of planets is representative of all gas giants orbiting early-type stars. Motivated by this question, we initiated the first dedicated survey of atmospheric escape from gas giants orbiting F stars in order to understand how their distinct radiation environments shape planetary outflows. We observed ten transits of six planets in an ultra-narrowband filter centered on the metastable helium line using Palomar/WIRC. We report strong ($>3\sigma$) detections of atmospheric escape for WASP-12~b and WASP-180~A~b, tentative ($>2\sigma$) detections for WASP-93~b and HAT-P-8~b, and non-detections for WASP-103~b and KELT-7~b. We fit these measurements with a 1D Parker wind model to derive corresponding mass-loss rates, and combine our results with literature measurements to obtain an updated picture of mass loss from planets orbiting early-type stars. Our results indicate that the observed variation in mass-loss rates can be explained by a combination of Roche filling factor and XUV luminosity, and disfavors NUV-driven escape models.

          Ionization Sources of the Local Interstellar Clouds: Two B-stars, Three White Dwarfs, and the Local Hot Bubble

 - **Abstract**
 The dominant sources of photoionizing radiation in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) incident on the exterior of the local interstellar clouds include two nearby early B-type stars, $\epsilon$ CMa ($124\pm2$ pc) and $\beta$ CMa ($151\pm5$ pc), three hot dwarfs, and the local hot bubble (LHB). Line emission (170-912A) from highly ionized metals (Fe, Ne, Mg) in million-degree LHB plasma may be responsible for the elevated ionization fractions of helium ($n_{\rm HeII}/n_{\rm He} \approx 0.4$) compared to hydrogen ($n_{\rm HII} / n_{\rm H} \approx 0.2$) in the local clouds. We update the stellar parameters and ionizing flux for $\beta$ CMa, after correcting the EUV spectra for intervening HI column density, $N_{\rm HI} = 1.9\pm0.1\times10^{18}~{\rm cm}^{-2}$, and its hotter effective temperature, $T_{\rm eff} \approx 25,000$K vs. 21,000K for $\epsilon$ CMa. These two stars produce a combined H-ionizing photon flux $\Phi_{\rm H} \approx 6800\pm1400$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ at the external surface of the local clouds. The hot bubble could produce comparable fluxes, $\Phi_{\rm H} =$ 2000-9000 cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, depending on the amount of metal depletion into dust grains that survive sputtering. The radial velocities and proper motions of $\beta$ CMa and $\epsilon$ CMa indicate that both stars passed within $10\pm1$ pc of the Sun $4.4\pm0.1$ Myr ago, with 100-200 times higher local ionizing fluxes. At that time, the local clouds were likely farther from the Sun, owing to their transverse motion. Over the last few Myr, EUV radiation from these two stars left a wake of highly ionized gas in a hot, low-density cavity produced by past supernova explosions in the Sco-Cen OB association and connected with the LHB.

          Water solubility in silicate melts: The effects of melt composition under reducing conditions and implications for nebular ingassing on rocky planets

 - **Abstract**
 Rocky planet atmospheres form and evolve through interactions between the planet's surface and interior. If a growing rocky planet acquires enough mass prior to the dissipation of the nebular gas disk, it can gravitationally capture a `primary' atmosphere dominated by H2. At the same time, these young, rocky bodies are likely to have partial or global magma oceans as a result of the heat from accretion, core formation and radioactive decay of short-lived major element isotopes. During this magma ocean stage, the dissolution of volatile, life-essential elements, such as hydrogen in the form of water or H2, into the magma is critical in determining the extent to which a rocky planet can maintain these elements over time. However, our ability to quantify the amount of hydrogen dissolved in the magma oceans of rocky planets is limited by the lack of experimental constraints on H-bearing species' solubilities at relevant pressure and temperature conditions, including those expected for the early Earth. Here we experimentally determine the solubility of water in silicate melts of various compositions in the Ca-Mg-Al-Si-Fe-O system at a total pressure of 1 bar and temperatures from 1673-1823 K, synthesized in a H2-CO2 gas-mixing furnace. We use Bayesian parameter estimation to derive a robust water solubility law that includes the effects of melt composition and temperature. Using this solubility law, we estimate that ~100 ppm of hydrogen can dissolve into a 1 MEarth planet with a surface pressure of ~300 bars set by accretion of solar-like nebular gas. For rocky planets in general, ingassing of a primary atmosphere may be an important source and initial storage mechanism for hydrogen-bearing species in a planet's interior, provided it grew to a sufficient mass within the lifetime of the solar nebula.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the first polarimetric results of the neutron star (NS) low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) Z-source GX 17+2 using the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) and the Very Large Array (VLA). We find that the X-ray source was polarized at PD = 1.9 +/- 0.3 % (1-sigma errors) with a polarization angle of PA = 11 +/- 4 degree (1-sigma errors). Simultaneous Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) observations show that the source was in the normal branch (NB) during our IXPE observations. The X-ray spectro-polarimetry results suggest a source geometry comprising an accretion disk component, a Comptonization component, and a reflection component. The VLA radio polarization study shows a PD = 2.2 +/- 0.2 % with a Faraday-corrected intrinsic polarization angle of 1 +/- 5 degree, which is an indication of the jet axis. Thus, we find the estimated X-ray PA from the source is consistent with the radio PA. We discuss the accretion geometry of the Z-source in light of our X-ray spectro-polarimetry and radio findings.

 - **Abstract**
 Scalar-tensor gravity models are among the prime candidates to explain cosmic acceleration, and compact stars provide unique laboratories for testing such theories. Predictions of scalar-tensor gravity in compact stars can be examined during the evolution of neutron stars. Spontaneous scalarization in relativistic stars is influenced by different properties of stellar matter in various evolution regimes. In the present study, we investigate the scalarization of neutron stars in different stages of the evolvement. For this aim, we apply the isentropic equations of state for the neutron star matter including nucleons, hyperons, and $\Delta$- resonances in neutrino-trapped, neutrino diffusion, and neutrino-transparent stages as well as cold-catalyzed neutron star. Our equations of state are based on the relativistic model within the mean-field approximation. To emphasize the role of scalar-tensor theories in exploring the properties and structure of compact stars, we calculate the structure of neutron stars with hyperons and $\Delta$-resonances in different snapshots of the neutron star evolution in the scalar-tensor gravity. Our calculations confirm that the neutron star scalarization is affected by the hyperons as well as the $\Delta$-resonances. Moreover, the properties of scalarized neutron stars depend on the stage of the star evolution.

          On the statistical characterization of the synchrotron multi-zone polarization of blazars

 - **Abstract**
 Multiwavelength polarimetric observations of blazars reveal complex, energy-dependent polarization behavior, including a decrease in polarization fraction from X-rays to millimeter bands and significant variability in the electric vector position angle (EVPA). These trends challenge simple single-zone synchrotron models and suggest a more intricate, turbulent jet structure with multiple emission zones. We develop a statistical framework to model the observed energy-dependent polarization patterns in blazars, focusing on the behavior captured by IXPE in the X-ray band and RoboPol in the optical. The goal is to statistically characterize multi-zone models in terms of the distributions of cell size and the physical parameters of the electron energy distribution (EED). A Monte Carlo approach, implemented with the JetSeT code, is used to generate synthetic multi-zone synchrotron emission from a spherical region filled with turbulent cells with randomly distributed physical properties. Simulations explore scenarios ranging from identical cells to power-law distributions of cell sizes and EED parameters with variable cutoff and low-energy slopes. The results show that a purely turbulent, multi-zone model can reproduce the observed energy-dependent polarization without requiring correlations between cell size and EED parameters. The polarization degree is primarily determined by the effective, flux-weighted, number of emitting cells, modulated by the dispersion in cell properties, particularly the EED cutoff energy at high frequencies and the low-energy spectral index at low frequencies. With a fractional dispersion in cutoff energy of about 90% and a low-energy spectral index dispersion of ~0.5-1.5, the model reproduces the chromatic mm-to-X-ray polarization trends seen by IXPE and the optical polarization limiting envelope observed in the RoboPol dataset.

          Large-scale peculiar velocities in the universe

 - **Abstract**
 Observations have repeatedly confirmed the presence of large-scale peculiar motions in the universe, commonly referred to as ``bulk flows''. These are vast regions of the observable universe, typically spanning scales of several hundred Mpc, that move coherently with speeds of the order of several hundred km/sec. While there is a general consensus on the direction of these motions, discrepancies persist in their reported sizes and velocities, with some of them exceeding the predictions of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. The observed large-scale peculiar-velocity fields are believed to have originated as weak peculiar-velocity perturbations soon after equipartition, which have subsequently grown by structure formation and by the increasing inhomogeneity of the post-recombination universe. However, the evolution and the implications of these bulk velocity fields remain poorly understood and they are still a matter of debate. For instance, it remains a challenge for the theoreticians to explain the high velocities measured by several bulk-flow surveys, like those recently reported using the CosmicFlows-4 data. Such extensive and fast velocity fields could have played a non-negligible role during structure formation and they might have also ``contaminated'' our observations. After all, in the history of astronomy, there are examples where relative-motion effects have led us to a serious misinterpretation of reality (shortened abstract due to length limits).

 - **Abstract**
 The current cosmological paradigm, $\Lambda$CDM, is characterized its expansive description of the history of the Universe, its deep connections to particle physics and the large amounts of data that support it. Nonetheless, $\Lambda$CDM's critics argue that it has been falsified or must be discarded for various reasons. Critics and boosters alike do agree on one thing: it is the not the final cosmological theory and they are anxious to see it replaced by something better! I review the status of $\Lambda$CDM, provide my views of the path forward, and discuss the role that the ``Hubble tension'' might play.

          The Gamma-ray Luminosity Function of Flat-Spectrum Radio Quasars

 - **Abstract**
 We have utilized the largest sample of $\gamma$-ray selected Fermi flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) ever used (519 sources) to construct the luminosity function and its evolution through the cosmic history. In addition to spanning large redshift ($0<z\lesssim 4$) and luminosity ranges ($2.9\times10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$ - $7.3\times10^{48}$ erg s$^{-1}$), this sample also has a robust calculation of the detection efficiency associated with its observation, making its selection effects and biases well understood. We confirm that the local luminosity function is best explained by a double power law. The evolution of the luminosity function of FSRQs follows a luminosity-dependent density evolution. FSRQs experience positive evolution with their space density growing with increasing redshift up to a maximum redshift, after which the numbers decrease. This peak in redshift occurs at larger redshifts for higher luminosity sources and at lower redshifts for lower luminosity sources. We find an unexpected similarity between the luminosity function of FSRQs and that of BL Lacertae objects at intermediate luminosity. This could be a sign of a strong genetic link between the two blazar sub-classes or that BL Lac samples are contaminated by large amounts of FSRQs with their jets nearly perfectly aligned with our line of sight.

          Monitoring of 3C 286 with ALMA, IRAM, and SMA from 2006 to 2025: Stability, Synchrotron Ages, and Frequency-Dependent Polarization Attributed to Core-Shift

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results of multi-frequency monitoring of the radio quasar 3C 286, conducted using three instruments: ALMA at 91.5, 103.5, 233.0, and 343.4 GHz, the IRAM 30-m Telescope at 86 and 229 GHz, and SMA at 225 GHz. The IRAM measurements from 2006 to 2024 show that the total flux of 3C 286 is stable within measurement uncertainties, indicating long-term stability up to 229 GHz, when applying a fixed Kelvin-to-Jansky conversion factor throughout its dataset. ALMA data from 2018 to 2024 exhibit a decrease in flux, which up to 4% could be attributed to an apparent increase in the absolute brightness of Uranus, the primary flux calibrator for ALMA with the ESA4 model. Taken together, these results suggest that the intrinsic total flux of 3C 286 has remained stable up to 229 GHz over the monitoring period. The polarization properties of 3C 286 are stable across all observing frequencies. The electric vector position angle (EVPA) gradually rotates as a function of wavelength squared, which is well described by a single power-law over the full frequency range. We therefore propose using the theoretical EVPA values from this model curve for absolute EVPA calibration between 5 and 343.4 GHz. The Faraday rotation measure increases as a function of frequency up to (3.2+/-1.5)x10^4 rad m^-2, following RM proportional to nu^alpha with alpha = 2.05+/-0.06. This trend is consistent with the core-shift effect expected in a conical jet.

 - **Abstract**
 Late-stage infall onto protoplanetary disks can produce large scale spiral arms. In this paper we used 3D smoothed particle hydrodynamics and radiative transfer simulations to study the kinematic perturbations induced in disks by infalling material. We found that deviations from Keplerian rotation are predominantly in the radial and vertical velocity components, spatially correlated with spiral arms in the gas surface density. The infall produces observable wiggles in the channel maps, analogous to those produce by the gravitational instability (GI), along with large-scale arcs and filaments. GI induced spiral arms produce radial velocity perturbations that point towards the center of the spiral arm owing to their higher self-gravity. We found a similar signature from infall-induced spiral arms, despite not including self-gravity in our simulation. Our study suggests that recent evidence of GI in the kinematics of the disk around AB Aur may instead be due to the observed infall, without the need for invoking GI.

 - **Abstract**
 GW231123 is a binary black hole merger whose primary component lies within or above the pair-instability mass gap, while the secondary component falls within this gap. The standard theory of stellar evolution is significantly challenged by this event. We investigate the formation of candidate progenitors of GW231123 in Population III (Pop3) star clusters. We find that they could form through stellar mergers, binary black hole mergers, and mixed mergers. The mass distribution of these candidate progenitors covers the component masses of GW231123. Their predicted merger rate density spans the range of $0.001{\rm Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}}-0.26{\rm Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}}$, encompassing that of GW231123. These findings suggest that GW231123 may originate from Pop3 star clusters. Furthermore, such candidate progenitors are expected to be detectable by future gravitational wave detectors LISA/Taiji/TianQin/DECIGO/CE/ET, which would provide valuable insights into the formation scenarios of events like GW231123.

          Estimation of intrinsic fast radio burst width and scattering distributions from CRAFT data

 - **Abstract**
 The intrinsic width and scattering distributions of fast radio bursts (FRBs) inform on their emission mechanism and local environment, and act as a source of detection bias and, hence, an obfuscating factor when performing FRB population and cosmological studies. Here, we utilise a sample of 29 FRBs with measured high-time-resolution properties and known redshift, which were detected using the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) by the Commensal Real-time ASKAP Fast Transients Survey (CRAFT), to model these distributions. Using this sample, we estimate the completeness bias of intrinsic width and scattering measurements, and fit the underlying, de-biased distributions in the host rest-frame. We find no evidence for a down-turn towards high values of the intrinsic distributions of either parameter in the 0.01-40 ms range probed by the data. Rather, the intrinsic scattering distribution at 1 GHz is consistent with a log-uniform distribution above 0.04 ms, while the intrinsic width distribution rises as a Gaussian in log-space in the 0.03-0.3 ms range, and is then log-uniform above that. This is inconsistent with previous works, which assumed that these parameters have lognormal distributions. This confirms that FRB observations are currently strongly width- and scattering-limited, and we encourage FRB searches to be extended to higher values of time-width. It also implies a bias in FRB host galaxy studies, although the form of that bias is uncertain. Finally, we find that our updated width and scattering model - when implemented in the zDM code - produces 10% more FRBs at redshift $z=1$ than at $z=0$ when compared to alternative width/scattering models, highlighting that these factors are important to understand when performing FRB population modelling.

 - **Abstract**
 We present three cosmological radiation-hydrodynamic zoom simulations of the progenitor of a Milky Way-mass galaxy from the MEGATRON suite. The simulations combine on-the-fly radiative transfer with a detailed non-equilibrium thermochemical network (81 ions and molecules), resolving the cold and warm gas in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) on spatial scales down to 20 pc and on average 200 pc at cosmic noon. Comparing our full non-equilibrium calculation with local radiation to traditional post-processed photoionization equilibrium (PIE) models assuming a uniform UV background (UVB), we find that non-equilibrium physics and local radiation fields fundamentally impact the thermochemistry of the CGM. Recombination lags and local radiation anisotropy shift ions away from their PIE+UVB values and modify covering fractions (for example, HI damped Ly$\alpha$ absorbers differ by up to 40%). In addition, a resolution study with cooling-length refinement allows us to double the resolution in the cold and warm CGM gas, reaching 120 pc on average. When refining on cooling length, the mass of the lightest cold clumps decreases tenfold to $\approx 10^4\,M_\odot$, their boundary layers develop sharper ion stratification, and the warm gas is better resolved, boosting the abundance of warm gas tracers such as CIV and OIII. Together, these results demonstrate that non-equilibrium thermochemistry coupled to radiative transfer, combined with physically motivated resolution criteria, is essential to predict circumgalactic absorption and emission signatures and to guide the design of targeted observations with existing and upcoming facilities.

 - **Abstract**
 The abundance patterns of extremely metal-poor stars preserve a fossil record of the Universe's earliest chemical enrichment by the supernova explosions from the evolution of first generation of stars, also referred to as Population III (or Pop III). By applying Bayesian inference to the analysis of abundance patterns of these ancient stars, this study presents a systematic investigation into the properties and explosion mechanism of Pop III stars. We apply NLTE corrections to enhance the reliability of abundance measurements, which significantly reduces the discrepancies in abundances between observations and theoretical yields for odd-Z elements, such as Na and Al. Our Bayesian framework also enables the incorporation of explodability and effectively mitigates biases introduced by varying resolutions across different supernova model grids. In addition to confirming a top-heavy ($\alpha=0.54$) initial mass function for massive Pop III stars, we derive a robust mass--energy relation ($E\propto M^2$) of the first supernovae. These findings demonstrate that stellar abundance analysis provides a powerful and independent approach for probing early supernova physics and the fundamental nature of the first stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Extremely high-peaked BL Lac objects (or extreme blazars) are unique extragalactic laboratories where particle acceleration processes are pushed at their physical limits. In these blazars, synchrotron emission peaking above keV energies is reprocessed to very-high-energy (VHE, energies > 100 GeV) gamma rays, often resulting in very hard TeV spectra. Over the past two decades, they have attracted a growing interest from the scientific community, both experimentally and theoretically, as crucial targets for understanding the diversity within the blazar class. On the experimental side, new sources have been detected and characterized, populating the extreme blazars class. Notably, VHE campaigns have revealed evidence of emerging spectral differences in this energy band, suggesting inhomogeneity within this class of sources. Recent studies have also unveiled intriguing differences in the temporal evolution of their spectral emission. On the theoretical side, these spectral differences are challenging the current standard emission and acceleration models for blazars, suggesting the need for more complex theoretical frameworks. In this contribution, we present the latest results from recent MAGIC Collaboration observing campaigns aimed to enlarge the extreme blazars population at VHE and understand the origin of their extreme properties. Furthermore, we will present the results of the most recent observations, discussing analogies and differences with well-known sources such as the archetypal 1ES 0229+200, as well as interpretations of their non-conventional spectral emission.

 - **Abstract**
 The identification of $\gamma$-rays from the predominant hadronic-background is a key aspect in their ground-based detection using Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs). While current methods are limited in their ability to exploit correlations in complex data, deep learning-based models offer a promising alternative by directly leveraging image-level information. However, several challenges involving the robustness and applicability of such models remain. Designing model architectures with inductive biases relevant for the task can help mitigate the problem. Three such deep learning-based models are proposed, trained, and evaluated on simulated data: (1) a hybrid convolutional and graph neural network model (CNN-GNN) using both image and graph data; (2) an enhanced CNN-GNN variant that incorporates additional reconstructed information within the graph construction; and (3) a graph neural network (GNN) model using image moments serving as a baseline. The new combined convolution and graph-based approach demonstrates improved performance over traditional methods, and the inclusion of reconstructed information offers further potential in generalization capabilities on real observational data.

 - **Abstract**
 Collision broadening by molecular hydrogen of sodium and potassium is one of the major broadening mechanisms in the atmospheres of brown dwarf stars and exoplanets at an effective temperature of about 1000K. The accurate computation of line profiles from collision broadening at high density requires use of a Fourier transform of the autocorrelation function inside the model atmosphere code. We strongly warn that use of Lorentzian profiles at a high perturber density neglects radiation during close collisions and may lead to erroneous conclusions.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent measurements from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), particularly when combined with DESI baryon acoustic oscillation data, have reported a scalar spectral index $n_s$ slightly higher than that inferred by {\it Planck}~2018, suggesting a mild tension with the predictions of standard inflationary attractor models. In this work, we revisit the quantum-corrected Higgs inflation scenario within the framework of a non-minimally coupled scalar field theory. Starting from the one-loop effective action, we incorporate radiative corrections through the anomalous scaling parameter ${\bf A_I}$ and derive analytic expressions for the inflationary observables $n_s$ and $r$ in the Einstein frame. Our analysis demonstrates that quantum corrections naturally shift $n_s$ toward higher values while keeping the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ suppressed. For ${\cal N} = 60$, the model predicts $n_s \simeq 0.9743$ and $r \simeq 5.4\times10^{-3}$, in excellent agreement with the latest ACT+DESI (P-ACT-LB) data and fully consistent with the \textit{Planck}~2018 limit $r < 0.036$. The derived constraint $4.36\times10^{-10} < \lambda/\xi^{2} < 10.77\times10^{-10}$ confirms the robustness of the quantum-corrected Higgs framework and indicates that near-future CMB polarization experiments such as CORE, AliCPT, LiteBIRD, and CMB-S4 will be able to probe the predicted parameter space with high precision.

          Radio emission from beyond the light cylinder in millisecond pulsars

 - **Abstract**
 A striking aspect of the radio profiles of many millisecond pulsars (MSPs) is that they consist of components separated from each other by regions lacking in emission. We devise a technique for determining "disjoint" from "contiguous" components and show that 35% of MSPs have disjoint components as opposed to only 3% of the slow pulsar population. We surmise that the pulsars with these disjoint components show evidence for both emission above the polar cap and from the current sheet beyond the light cylinder, co-located with gamma-ray emission. For a sub-class of radio MSPs only the light cylinder emission is being observed. It is our contention that almost all of the current population of gamma-ray MSPs show evidence for co-located radio emission. A simple geometric explanation allows the presence (or not) of light cylinder emission and the relationship (or not) between the gamma-ray and radio profiles to be determined. The light-cylinder components have frequently very high polarization and typically flat position-angle traverses thus helping to explain the difficulties in determining the geometry of MSPs. In cases where the geometry can be determined the values broadly align with expectations. If our picture is correct, the beaming fraction of radio MSPs is higher than previously thought and a mechanism is required to produce coherent radio emission far from the stellar surface. This has implications for our understanding of the populations of radio-loud and radio-quiet rotation-powered millisecond pulsars, and could relate to the timing stability of some of these sources.

 - **Abstract**
 The mid-infrared (MIR) emitting regions of the individual protoplanetary disks in the binary system Z CMa are resolved by MATISSE/VLTI. The observations were obtained during a serendipitous large outburst of the HBe star that lasted more than 100 days, while the FUor companion is presumed to be in quiescence. The size of the MIR-emitting disk region of the more massive HBe star increases toward longer wavelengths from $<14$ mas at 3.5$\mu m$ to $\ll 50$ mas at 11.5$\mu m$ . The lack of substructures in the HBe disk might suggest that it is a continuous disk; however, this could be due to observational constraints. We also note a radial variation of the silicate absorption feature over the disk, where the optical depth increases inwards of $<$40~au radii. This contradicts the scenario of a carved, dusty cocoon surrounding the HBe star. In the case of the less massive FUor companion, the MIR-emitting region is much smaller with an angular size $\leq$15 mas (or else a physical radius $<9$ au) in all bands, suggesting a compact disk. Both disks are aligned within uncertainties, and their orientation agrees with that of the known jets. Furthermore, MATISSE data place the binary's separation at $117.88 \pm 0.73$ mas and a position angle of $139.16^o\,\pm\,0.29^o$ east of north. Our estimates for the orbital elements gave an eccentric orbit ($e\sim0.17$) with a moderate inclination ($i\sim 66$\degr). The derived total mass is $M_{\rm total} = 16.4^{+2.1}_{-2.3}$ M$_\odot$, while the period is approximately 950 years. Our MATISSE imaging of the Herbig disk during outburst indicates a temperature gradient for the disk, while imaging of the FUor companion's disk corroborates previous studies showing that FUor disks are rather compact in the MIR. We cannot infer any misalignment between the MATISSE results and earlier ALMA/JVLA data, nor can we infer any influence from the alleged flyby event.

 - **Abstract**
 We report a successful observation of a stellar occultation by asteroid (16583) Oersted, enabling a detailed physical characterization of its shape, spin state, and surface properties. Our goal is to determine the physical parameters of Oersted by combining multi-chord occultation timing, sparse optical photometry, and thermal infrared observations. Such asteroids (size$\sim$20 km) are rarely modeled in this detail due to observational limitations, making Oersted a valuable case study. We applied convex lightcurve inversion to sparse photometric data to derive an initial shape and spin state. This model was then refined and scaled using non-convex shape modeling with the ADAM algorithm, incorporating constraints from the occultation chord profile. Thermophysical modeling based on WISE thermal infrared fluxes was used to determine the asteroid's effective diameter, geometric albedo, and thermal inertia. The non-convex shape model reveals localized surface concavities and provides a size estimate consistent with radiometric measurements. The derived thermal inertia is typical for asteroids of comparable size. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of combining stellar occultations, photometry, and thermal infrared data for asteroid modeling and highlights the valuable contributions of citizen scientists, who played a key role in capturing the occultation and constraining the asteroid's profile.

 - **Abstract**
 The existence of a deficit of brown dwarfs (BDs) in close orbit around main-sequence stars is one of the most intriguing questions in stellar physics. This so-called BD desert may result from the transition between two different dominant formation processes occurring for different mass regimes. While the BD mass derived from radial-velocity measurements helps confirm the nature of the analyzed objects, the BD radius obtained from transits is important to better constrain the BD age, as BDs are believed to contract with age. Such objects with well-constrained parameters, although in small number, are of prime interest for deeper investigations of BD structure and chemical composition. The present document aims at presenting the first results of a search for BD transits among a sample of approximately 3300 host star candidates observed by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite during Cycle 6.

 - **Abstract**
 We report on the characterization of a coronal mass ejection (CME) observed on 22 October 2003 by the LASCO-C2 and C3 coronagraphs over a time interval of 6 hours. This CME clearly appears as an asymmetric flux-rope in self-similar expansion and in spite of having a single vantage point, this relatively simple morphology and the geometry of the observations allow us to reconstruct its shape and its trajectory. The images are first processed in order to remove most of the background or foreground coronal structures (essentially streamers) which are superimposed on the CME. The analysis is based on forward modeling of an asymmetric structure where the plasma is homogeneously distributed in a thin shell and synthetic images are calculated from Thomson scattering by the electrons. They are best fitted to the images to determine the exact shape of the flux rope, and to track its evolution characterized by a radial propagation in self-similar expansion. The analysis supports the forward propagation (over the backward one) characterized by constant accelerations of 76 and 46 m/sec^2 for the front and rear parts of the CME, respectively. The respective velocities at 20 Rsun reach 2000 and 1100 km/s, and its mass unbiased by projection effects is estimated at 1.7x10^16 g. Altogether, these are quite exceptionally large values among CMEs and imply a very energetic event. No erupting event could be identified at or near the calculated initial location of the CME. It lies 25° west of the active region NOAA 10484, the site of contemporary, violent, and recurrent solar eruptions (the ``Halloween event'') and a putative connection would require a strong deflection over a very short path. Therefore, the origin of this CME remains unclear.

          Transverse Velocities in Real-Time Cosmology: Position Drift in Relativistic N-Body Simulations

 - **Abstract**
 The era of real-time cosmology has begun. It is now possible to directly measure the apparent drift of high-redshift astronomical sources across the sky $\textit{in real time}$. This so-called $\textit{position drift}$ provides a valuable probe of the peculiar velocity field and cosmic structure formation by giving direct access to the transverse velocity that is otherwise currently not measurable and must be statistically reconstructed from the density field in a model-dependent way. To fully exploit this new window into the Universe, it is essential to understand how cosmological structures affect position drift measurements. Here we present the first position drift study based on the general relativistic N-body simulation code $\texttt{gevolution}$. We calculate the position drift directly from the past light cone for ten different observers and compare the results to predictions from linear perturbation theory. At linear order, the position drift is directly proportional to the transverse velocity on the sky. This linear approximation reproduces our non-linear simulation results to within about 5%. We calculate power spectra for the position drift, splitting the signal into an E- and B-mode and compare the former to linear expectations, finding good agreement. The B-mode is suppressed on linear scales, but has similar amplitude as the E-mode on non-linear scales. We further demonstrate that light-cone inhomogeneities induce biases in the dipole of the drift, introducing redshift dependence of both the amplitude and direction. Although our analysis is not yet sufficient for a firm conclusion, our results suggest that these effects alone cannot explain the possible redshift-dependent dipole in Gaia DR3 data reported in the literature.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate scalar-induced stochastic gravitational waves from adiabatic curvature perturbations sourced by a spectator field via the modulated reheating mechanism. We consider a spectator scalar with Higgs-like couplings and inflaton decay via shift symmetric dimension-five operators. The spectator is assumed to be in the Sitter vacuum and it sources blue-tilted, strongly non-Gaussian curvature perturbations which can dominate the spectrum on small scales $k \gg \rm{Mpc}^{-1}$. We find that the setup could generate a gravitational wave signal testable by surveys like BBO and DECIGO but only for large coupling values not expected in low-energy particle physics setups that can be perturbatively extrapolated up to the inflationary scale.

 - **Abstract**
 Very-high energy (VHE; $>$100 GeV) $\gamma$-ray emission originates via some of the most extreme particle acceleration processes in the universe. Considering beamed active galactic nuclei, i.e., blazars, only a small fraction, mainly high synchrotron peak BL Lacs, have been detected in the VHE band with the ground-based Cherenkov telescopes. We utilized $\sim$16 years of Fermi-Large Area Telescope (LAT) observations in the 0.1$-$2 TeV energy range to systematically search for potential VHE emitters in a sample of high synchrotron peaked ($\nu^{\rm peak}_{\rm syn}>10^{15}$ Hz) BL Lac sources. We identified, for the first time, 92 VHE emitting blazars at $\geq 5\sigma$ confidence level. A significant VHE emission was also detected from 52 objects, which have been previously reported to be a VHE blazar. Comparing with the general blazar population, these VHE emitting blazars are found to be located at low redshifts (mean $z=0.2 \pm 0.1$) and exhibit bright synchrotron emission ($\log F^{\rm peak}_{\rm syn}=-11.2 \pm 0.4$, in erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$). We also investigated the coincidence of VHE photon arrivals with the source activity states and found that Fermi-LAT has detected VHE photons during both quiescent and elevated activity epochs. These VHE emitting blazars represent promising targets for current and next-generation ground-based Cherenkov telescopes, and provide valuable laboratories for probing particle acceleration in relativistic jets, testing multi-messenger connections, and constraining extragalactic background light models.

 - **Abstract**
 During the late stages of massive stellar evolution, failed supernovae (FSN) may form through core-collapse processes. The traditional evaluation criterion $\xi_{2.5}$ $=$ 0.45, primarily established using non-rotating progenitor models, suffers from significant inaccuracies when applied to rotating pre-supernova systems. The effects of metallicity and rotation on the explodability landscapes of massive stars lack robust quantification. We aim to investigate how rotation and metallicity influence the explodability of massive stars. We investigate how rotation and metallicity affect stellar explodability using MESA simulations with initial rotational velocities of $0$, $300$, and $600~\mathrm{km,s^{-1}}$ at three metallicities ($Z_{\odot}$, $1/10,Z_{\odot}$, $1/50,Z_{\odot}$). Core-collapse phases are simulated with GR1D to determine critical heating efficiencies. Our results yield revised $\xi_{2.5}$ criteria: 0.45 for non-rotating models; 0.48 for $300~\mathrm{km,s^{-1}}$; 0.47 for $600~\mathrm{km,s^{-1}}$ at solar metallicity; and 0.59 for low-metallicity models. Chemically homogeneous evolution in rapidly rotating low-metallicity stars significantly raises the compactness limit for successful explosions and narrows the zero-age main sequence mass range for failed supernovae. Rotation substantially affects the explodability of low-metallicity massive stars, underscoring the importance of incorporating rotational effects in models of core-collapse supernova progenitors.

          The Influence of Central Body Tides on Catastrophic Disruptions of Close-in Planetary Satellites

 - **Abstract**
 We model the outcomes of catastrophic disruptions on small, gravity-dominated natural satellites, accounting for the tidal potential of the central body, which is neglected in classical disruption scaling laws. We introduce the concept of $Q^\star_\text{TD}$, the specific energy required to disperse half of the total mass involved in a collision, accounting for the tidal potential of a central body. We derive a simple scaling relation for $Q^\star_\text{TD}$ and demonstrate that for close-in planetary or asteroidal satellites, the tides from the central body can significantly reduce their catastrophic disruption threshold. We show that many satellites in the Solar System are in such a regime, where their disruption threshold should be much lower than that predicted by classical scaling laws which neglect tidal effects. Some notable examples include Mars' Phobos, Jupiter's Metis and Adrastea, Saturn's ring moons, Uranus' Ophelia, and Neptune's Naiad and Thalassa, among others. We argue that traditional impact scaling laws should be modified to account for tides when modeling the formation and evolution of these close-in satellites. Our derivation for $Q^\star_\text{TD}$ can easily be used in existing $N$-body and collisional evolution codes.

          On the Possibility of Melting Water Ice during the Recent Past of Mars. Application to the Formation of Gullies

 - **Abstract**
 The formation of gullies on Mars has often been attributed to the melting of (sub)surface water ice. However, melting-based hypotheses generally overlook key processes: (1) sublimation cooling by latent heat absorption, (2) the non-stability of ice where melting conditions can be reached, and (3) the particular microclimates of gullied slopes. Using state-of-the-art climate simulations, we reassess ice melting scenarios over the past four million years (obliquity $\le$35\textdegree)), beyond the estimated period of gully formation. We find that surface melting is impossible anywhere due to sublimation cooling, while (quasi-) stable subsurface ice is typically too deep to reach melting temperatures. We propose an alternative mechanism in which seasonal CO$_2$ frost sublimation destabilizes the regolith and brings the underlying water ice close to the surface, allowing rapid heating. Even under these optimal conditions, melting requires unrealistic assumptions. The only remaining possibility is solar absorption in dusty ice, though its occurrence remains uncertain.

 - **Abstract**
 Parity-odd four-point correlation functions, or trispectra, of cosmic matter density fields provide a unique probe of fundamental symmetries in cosmology. Trispectra of primordial matter density fluctuations produced in the early universe are modified by the subsequent nonlinear structure formation. In this paper, we compute the nonlinear evolution of the parity-odd matter trispectrum to one-loop order, i.e., to third order in density fluctuations, within the framework of effective field theory of the large-scale structure of the universe. By analyzing the different terms in the perturbation series, we demonstrate the structure of infrared divergence cancellations, as required by the equivalence principle. We also derive the forms of the counterterms required to renormalize the ultraviolet divergences. Adopting a specific model for a primordial parity-odd trispectrum, we numerically compute the leading-order effects of nonlinear gravitational evolution and study its impact on baryonic acoustic oscillations within the signal. These calculations are essential for comparing the observed trispectra of nonlinear cosmic density fields with theoretical expectations.

 - **Abstract**
 Theoretical studies have suggested using planetary infrared excess (PIE) to detect and characterize the thermal emission of transiting and non-transiting exoplanets, however the PIE technique requires empirical validation. Here we apply the PIE technique to a combination of JWST NIRSpec G395H transit and eclipse measurements of WASP-17b, a hot Jupiter orbiting an F-type star, obtained consecutively (0.5 phase or 1.8 days apart) as part of the JWST-TST program to perform Deep Reconnaissance of Exoplanet Atmospheres through Multi-instrument Spectroscopy (DREAMS). Using the in-eclipse measured stellar spectrum to circumvent the need for ultra-precise stellar models, we extract the first JWST nightside emission spectrum of WASP-17b using only transit and eclipse data thereby performing a controlled test of the PIE technique. From the WASP-17b nightside spectrum, we measure a nightside equilibrium temperature of $1005 \pm 256$ K and find tentative evidence for nightside SO2 absorption ($\ln B = 1.45$, $2.3\sigma$). In context with the dayside, the temperature of the nightside is consistent with (1) previous eclipse mapping findings that suggest relatively inefficient day-night heat transport, and (2) a non-zero bond albedo of $0.42^{+0.06}_{-0.10}$. SO2 on the nightside, if confirmed, would represent the first direct evidence for transport-induced chemistry, matching previous model predictions, and opening a new door into the 3D nature of giant exoplanets. Our results suggest that PIE is feasible with JWST/NIRSpec for two epochs separated in time by significantly less than the rotation period of the host star.

 - **Abstract**
 Time series foundation models (TSFMs) are increasingly being adopted as highly-capable general-purpose time series representation learners. Although their training corpora are vast, they exclude astronomical time series data. Observations of stars produce peta-scale time series with unique challenges including irregular sampling and heteroskedasticity. We introduce StarEmbed, the first public benchmark for rigorous and standardized evaluation of state-of-the-art TSFMs on stellar time series observations (``light curves''). We benchmark on three scientifically-motivated downstream tasks: unsupervised clustering, supervised classification, and out-of-distribution source detection. StarEmbed integrates a catalog of expert-vetted labels with multi-variate light curves from the Zwicky Transient Facility, yielding ~40k hand-labeled light curves spread across seven astrophysical classes. We evaluate the zero-shot representation capabilities of three TSFMs (MOIRAI, Chronos, Chronos-Bolt) and a domain-specific transformer (Astromer) against handcrafted feature extraction, the long-standing baseline in the astrophysics literature. Our results demonstrate that these TSFMs, especially the Chronos models, which are trained on data completely unlike the astronomical observations, can outperform established astrophysics-specific baselines in some tasks and effectively generalize to entirely new data. In particular, TSFMs deliver state-of-the-art performance on our out-of-distribution source detection benchmark. With the first benchmark of TSFMs on astronomical time series data, we test the limits of their generalization and motivate a paradigm shift in time-domain astronomy from using task-specific, fully supervised pipelines toward adopting generic foundation model representations for the analysis of peta-scale datasets from forthcoming observatories.

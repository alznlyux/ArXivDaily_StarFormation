          Origin of the IRAS Vela Shell: New Insights from 3D Dust Mapping

 - **Abstract**
 The IRAS Vela Shell (IVS) is a structure of enhanced FIR emission located towards the Gum Nebula, a prominent region of $\rm H\alpha$ emission in the local Milky Way shaped by various galactic stellar feedback over the past several million years. We constrain the 3D spatial geometry of the IVS using a parsec-resolution 3D dust map and contextualize it within the broader Gum Nebula. Our analysis reveals a dense, bowl-like IVS structure below the Galactic plane, with a more diffuse component above. We obtain a total shell mass of $5.1_{-2.4}^{+2.4}\times 10^{4}\;\rm M_{\odot}$ and, incorporating previous studies on shell expansion, a momentum of $6.0_{-3.4}^{+4.7}\times 10^{5}\;\rm M_{\odot}\;km\; s^{-1}$. We find a spatial correlation between the morphology of the dust-traced IVS and the Gum Nebula's $\rm H\alpha$ emission when projected onto the sky. We quantify contributions of feedback from stellar winds, an expanding HII region, and supernovae to the IVS formation, finding that stellar winds are subdominant. Our momentum analysis shows that both an HII region and supernova feedback could drive the shell's expansion. Using astrometric constraints from Gaia and Hipparcos, we trace back nearby feedback sources and find that the massive stars $\gamma2$ Velorum and $\zeta$ Puppis are currently within the IVS, producing enough ionizing luminosity to form an HII region of comparable size. Alternatively, if the IVS' momentum is primarily driven by supernovae, $1-2$ events would be required. We also identify several young massive clusters that could have hosted supernovae within the past 3 Myr.

 - **Abstract**
 Dark matter (DM) particles can interact with particles of the Standard Model. Although there exist constraints from direct and indirect detection experiments, the dynamical evolution of astrophysical objects could provide a promising probe for these interactions. Obtaining astrophysical predictions is challenging and limited by our ability to simulate scatterings between DM and baryonic particles within N-body and hydrodynamics simulations. We develop a novel scheme that allows simulating these interacting dark matter (IDM) models and accurately accounts for their angular and velocity dependence, as well as the mass ratio between the DM and baryonic scattering partners. To describe DM-baryon interactions, we use an N-body code together with its implementation of smoothed-particle hydrodynamics and meshless finite mass. The interaction itself is realised in a pairwise fashion by creating a virtual scattering partner from the baryonic particle and letting it interact with a DM particle using a scattering routine initially developed for self-interacting dark matter. After the interaction, the virtual particle is rejoined with the baryonic particle, fulfilling energy and momentum conservation. Through several test problems, we demonstrate that we can reproduce their analytic solutions with our IDM scheme. We comment on various numerical aspects and challenges as well as describe the limitations of our numerical scheme. Furthermore, we study the impact of IDM on halo formation with a collapsing overdensity. Overall, it is possible to accurately model IDM within N-body and hydrodynamics simulations, commonly used in astrophysics. In consequence, our scheme allows for making novel predictions and obtaining new constraints of DM-baryon scattering.

 - **Abstract**
 Multi-field inflation can be inherently non-predictive, with the exception of models with strong attractors. In this work, we focus on models with multiple scalar fields that are non-minimally coupled to the space-time Ricci curvature scalar, motivated by the expectation of a rich particle spectrum at high energies. We show that in this family of models, the single- and multi-field predictions for CMB observables are identical, as long as there exists at least one non-minimal coupling with $\xi \gg 1$. We provide simple expressions for the Hubble scale, the number of $e$-folds, and the turn rate for systems with an arbitrary number of fields and explore the statistical properties for different priors.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first contemporaneous X-ray and optical polarimetric measurement of the extremely high synchrotron peaked (EHSP) blazar H 1426+428. The X-ray polarimetric observations were undertaken using the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (\textit{IXPE}) on 2024 May 27, and 2024 July 5. The \textit{IXPE} pointings were accompanied by contemporaneous optical observations of the Observatorio de Sierra Nevada, Calar Alto Observatory and the Perkins Telescope Observatory. While we observed the X-ray degree of polarization to be $>20\%$, the polarization in the optical band was found to be only $1-3\%$. This trend has been observed in several HSP blazars with available optical and X-ray polarimetric data and is typically explained in terms of energy stratification downstream of a shock. However, we observed a significant difference between the optical and X-ray polarization angles, a feature that has been observed in certain HSP blazars, such as Mrk 421, but remains a relatively rare or underreported phenomenon. We discuss possible scenarios for these findings within the framework of a partially turbulent jet model.

          gwharmone: first data-driven surrogate for eccentric harmonics in binary black hole merger waveforms

 - **Abstract**
 We present gwharmone, the first data-driven surrogate model for eccentric harmonics (as well as the full radiation content) of the dominant quadrupolar mode in eccentric, non-spinning binary black hole mergers. Our model is trained on 173 waveforms, each $100,000M$ long (where $M$ is the total mass), generated for mass ratios $q \in [1,3.5]$ and eccentricities $e_{\rm ref} \in [0,0.2]$ (at the start of the waveform). The eccentric harmonics are extracted from the effective-one-body waveforms using the \texttt{gwMiner} package. We apply a singular value decomposition (SVD) to obtain a set of reduced basis vectors, necessary to construct a lower-dimensional representation of data, and use Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to interpolate SVD coefficients across parameter space, allowing for prediction at new parameter points. The model includes the effect of mean anomaly, its evaluation cost is only $\sim 0.1$ second and it achieves an average time-domain (validation) error of ~0.001 and frequency-domain (validation) mismatches below 0.01 for advanced LIGO sensitivity. Our model can therefore be useful in efficient searches and parameter estimation of eccentric mergers. gwharmone will be publicly available through the gwModels package.

 - **Abstract**
 Supernova 2023ixf is a type IIP supernova that was observed in May 2023 in the spiral galaxy Messier 101. This was the closest supernova observed of the decade, making this an exciting discovery. Combining the observed brightness and duration with theoretical scaling relations, we model the lightcurve of this supernova in order to reveal the properties of the progenitor star at the time of explosion, including its mass, radius, and explosion energy. We simulate these explosions using the stellar evolution and radiation-hydrodynamics codes MESA+STELLA. We find that SN2023ixf is not easily explained with "normal" stellar evolution, and only models with a small mass of H-rich ejecta can fit the lightcurve. We also find that the late time properties of the lightcurve are better fit by a higher initial-mass star with substantial mass loss during its lifetime, as compared to models with lower initial mass and less mass loss.

          Higher-Order Mean-Motion Resonances Can Form in Type-I Disk Migration

 - **Abstract**
 Type-I disk migration can form a chain of planets engaged in first-order mean-motion resonances (MMRs) parked at the disk inner edge. However, while second- or even third-order resonances were deemed unlikely due to their weaker strength, they have been observed in some planetary systems (e.g. TOI-178 bc: 5:3, TOI-1136 ef: 7:5, TRAPPIST-1 bcd: 8:5-5:3). We performed $>6,000$ Type-I simulations of multi-planet systems that mimic the observed {\it Kepler} sample in terms of stellar mass, planet size, multiplicity, and intra-system uniformity over a parameter space encompassing transitional and truncated disks. We found that Type-I migration coupled with a disk inner edge can indeed produce second- and third-order resonances (in a state of libration) in $\sim 10\%$ and 2\% of resonant-chain systems, respectively. Moreover, the fraction of individual resonances in our simulations reproduced that of the observed sample (notably, 5:3 is the most common second-order MMR). The formation of higher-order MMRs favors slower disk migration and a smaller outer planet mass. Higher-order resonances do not have to form with the help of a Laplace-like three-body resonance as was proposed for TRAPPIST-1. Instead, the formation of higher-order resonance is assisted by breaking a pre-existing first-order resonance, which generates small but non-zero initial eccentricities ($e\approx10^{-3}$ to 10$^{-2}$). We predict that 1) librating higher-order resonances have higher equilibrium $e$ ($\sim 0.1$); 2) be more likely found as an isolated pair in an otherwise first-order chain; 3) more likely emerge in the inner pairs of a chain.

          High-Time-Cadence Spectroscopy and Photometry of Stellar Flares on M-dwarf YZ Canis Minoris with Seimei Telescope and TESS. II. Statistical Properties of Blue/Red Asymmetries in the H$α$ Line

 - **Abstract**
 M-dwarfs frequently produce flares, and their associated coronal mass ejections (CMEs) may threaten the habitability of close-in exoplanets. M-dwarf flares sometimes show prominence eruption signatures, observed as blue/red asymmetries in the H$\alpha$ line. In Paper I, we reported four candidates of prominence eruptions, which shows large diversity in their durations and velocities. In this study, we statistically investigate how blue/red asymmetries are related with their flare and starspot properties, using the dataset from 27 H$\alpha$ flares in Paper I and previously reported 8 H$\alpha$ flares on an M-dwarf YZ Canis Minoris. We found that these asymmetry events tend to show larger H$\alpha$ flare energies compared to non-asymmetry events. In particular, 5 out of 6 blue asymmetry events are not associated with white-light flares, whereas all 7 red asymmetry events are associated with white-light flares. Furthermore, their starspot distributions estimated from the TESS light curve show that all prominence eruption candidates occurred when starspots were located on the stellar disk center as well as on the stellar limb. These results suggest that flares with lower heating rates may have a higher association rate with prominence eruptions and/or the possibility that prominence eruptions are more detectable on the limb than on the disk center on M-dwarfs. These results provide significant insights into CMEs that can affect the habitable world around M-dwarfs.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the nonlinear evolution of matter overdensities using the spherical collapse model in degenerate higher-order scalar-tensor (DHOST) theories beyond Horndeski, employing the effective field theory (EFT) of dark energy approach. We investigate the impact of the EFT parameters characterising DHOST theories on the formation of large-scale structure. We identify the parameter space in which the collapse of the spherical overdensity is prevented by the scalar field turning imaginary at some moment, which allows us to place constraints on the model parameters. We show how the collapse time and the critical density contrast depend on the EFT parameters. To assess the observational implications, we compute the halo mass function using the Press-Schechter formalism. We find that the number density of halos is suppressed compared to the $\Lambda$CDM model due to ``beyond Horndeski'' effects, upon imposing the stability of linear perturbations.

          Photon Calibration Performance of KAGRA during the 4th Joint Observing Run (O4)

 - **Abstract**
 KAGRA is a kilometer-scale cryogenic gravitational-wave (GW) detector in Japan. It joined the 4th joint observing run (O4) in May 2023 in collaboration with the Laser Interferometer GW Observatory (LIGO) in the USA, and Virgo in Italy. After one month of observations, KAGRA entered a break period to enhance its sensitivity to GWs, and it is planned to rejoin O4 before its scheduled end in October 2025. To accurately recover the information encoded in the GW signals, it is essential to properly calibrate the observed signals. We employ a photon calibration (Pcal) system as a reference signal injector to calibrate the output signals obtained from the telescope. In ideal future conditions, the uncertainty in Pcal could dominate the uncertainty in the observed data. In this paper, we present the methods used to estimate the uncertainty in the Pcal systems employed during KAGRA O4 and report an estimated system uncertainty of 0.79%, which is three times lower than the uncertainty achieved in the previous 3rd joint observing run (O3) in 2020. Additionally, we investigate the uncertainty in the Pcal laser power sensors, which had the highest impact on the Pcal uncertainty, and estimate the beam positions on the KAGRA main mirror, which had the second highest impact. The Pcal systems in KAGRA are the first fully functional calibration systems for a cryogenic GW telescope. To avoid interference with the KAGRA cryogenic systems, the Pcal systems incorporate unique features regarding their placement and the use of telephoto cameras, which can capture images of the mirror surface at almost normal incidence. As future GW telescopes, such as the Einstein Telescope, are expected to adopt cryogenic techniques, the performance of the KAGRA Pcal systems can serve as a valuable reference.

          Temporal Variation of Flare Occurrence Rates via the Spot Evolution on the Sun and Solar-type Stars

 - **Abstract**
 The spot evolution on the Sun and solar-type stars is important for understanding the nature of consequential flaring activity. This study statistically investigates the variance of flare occurrence rate through the time evolution of spots on the Sun and solar-type stars. We have compiled the 28-year catalogs of solar flares and their source sunspots obtained from solar surface observations by NOAA and GOES for the Sun. Also, we combined the cataloged stellar flares with the time evolution of starspots estimated by light curves obtained by the 4-year Kepler mission for solar-type stars. For the obtained 24124 solar flares and 180 stellar flares, we calculate the flare occurrence distribution with respect to $t_\mathrm{flare}-t_\mathrm{max}$, which represents the timing of flare through the spot evolution, where $t_\mathrm{flare}$ is the flare occurrence time, and $t_\mathrm{max}$ is the time when the source spot takes its maximum area. When normalized by the spot lifetime, we found that the flare occurrence distribution for $t_\mathrm{flare}-t_\mathrm{max}$ shows a similar distribution regardless of spot size or flare energy, suggesting that the Sun and the solar-type star share the same physical process in the spot-to-flare activity. On this basis, we propose a formula for the time variation of the flare occurrence rate per spot. Also, the correlation between the temporal variation of flare occurrence rate and the time evolution of spot area and the lack of difference in flare occurrence rate between the emergence and decaying phases provide a milestone for the nature of flare-productive spots.

          Skewness as a Probe of Gravity: Real and Redshift Space Counts-In-Cells

 - **Abstract**
 We study the counts-in-cells reduced skewness $s_3$ for dark matter, halo, and galaxy distributions in both real and redshift space, using the ELEPHANT ($\textit{Extended LEnsing PHysics with ANalytical ray Tracing}$) suite of $N$-body simulations. We compare General Relativity (GR) with two extended (EG) gravity models: $f(R)$ gravity with chameleon screening and the normal-branch Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (nDGP) model with Vainshtein screening. We quantify the suppression of $s_3$ by redshift-space distortions (RSD), finding that while small-scale skewness is strongly reduced, the $F5$ model retains a $\sim 4\%$ deviation from GR in galaxy samples, corresponding to a $2\sigma$ significance. We show that the ratio $s_3^{\mathrm{RSD}}/s_3^{\mathrm{real}}$ is approximately independent of the gravity model across tracers and redshifts. Our results demonstrate that real-space predictions can help reliably infer redshift-space skewness in both GR and extended gravity, providing a new tool for testing gravity with current and forthcoming galaxy redshift surveys.

          TOI-3493 b: A planet with a Neptune-like density transiting a bright G0-type star

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of TOI-3493 b, a sub-Neptune-sized planet on an 8.15-d orbit transiting the bright (V=9.3) G0 star HD 119355 (aka TIC 203377303) initially identified by NASA's TESS space mission. With the aim of confirming the planetary nature of the transit signal detected by TESS and determining the mass of the planet, we performed an intensive Doppler campaign with the HARPS spectrograph, collecting radial velocity measurements. We found that TOI-3493 b lies in a nearly circular orbit and has a mass of 9.0+/-1.2 M_earth and a radius of 3.22+/-0.08 R_earth, implying a bulk density of 1.47+/-0.23 g/cm^3, consistent with a composition comprising a small solid core surrounded by a thick H/He dominated atmosphere.

 - **Abstract**
 The astronomy communities are widely recognised as mature communities for their open science practices. However, while their data ecosystems are rather advanced and permit efficient data interoperability, there are still gaps between these ecosystems. Semantic artefacts (e.g., ontologies, thesauri, vocabularies or metadata schemas) are a means to bridge that gap as they allow to semantically described the data and map the underlying concepts. The increasing use of semantic artefacts in astronomy presents challenges in description, selection, evaluation, trust, and mappings. The landscape remains fragmented, with semantic artefacts scattered across various registries in diverse formats and structures -- not yet fully developed or encoded with rich semantic web standards like OWL or SKOS -- and often with overlapping scopes. Enhancing data semantic interoperability requires common platforms to catalog, align, and facilitate the sharing of FAIR semantic artefacts. In the frame of the FAIR-IMPACT project, we prototyped a semantic artefact catalogue for astronomy, heliophysics and planetary sciences. This exercise resulted in improved vocabulary and ontology management in the communities, and is now paving the way for better interdisciplinary data discovery and reuse. This article presents current practices in our discipline, reviews candidate SAs for such a catalogue, presents driving use cases and the perspective of a real production service for the astronomy community based on the OntoPortal technology, that will be called OntoPortal-Astro.

 - **Abstract**
 The European Space Agency's Ariel mission, scheduled for launch in 2029, aims to conduct the first large-scale survey of atmospheric spectra of transiting exoplanets. Ariel achieves the high photometric stability on transit timescales required to detect the spectroscopic signatures of chemical elements with a payload design optimized for transit photometry that either eliminates known systematics or allows for their removal during data processing without significantly degrading or biasing the detection. Jitter in the spacecraft's line of sight is a source of disturbance when measuring the spectra of exoplanet atmospheres. We describe an improved algorithm for de-jittering Ariel observations simulated in the time domain. We opt for an approach based on the spatial information on the Point Spread Function (PSF) distortion from jitter to detrend the optical signals. The jitter model is based on representative simulations from Airbus Defence and Space, the prime contractor for the Ariel service module. We investigate the precision and biases of the retrieved atmospheric spectra from the jitter-detrended observations. At long wavelengths, the photometric stability of the Ariel spectrometer is already dominated by photon noise. Our algorithm effectively de-jitters both photometric and spectroscopic data, ensuring that the performance remains photon noise-limited across the entire Ariel spectrum, fully compliant with mission requirements. This work contributes to the development of the data reduction pipeline for Ariel, aligning with its scientific goals, and may also benefit other astronomical telescopes and instrumentation.

 - **Abstract**
 The High Energy Cosmic-Radiation Detection (HERD) facility has been proposed as a leading experiment on China's Space Station (CSS). Scheduled for installation around 2027, HERD is expected to operate for at least a decade. The main scientific objectives include indirect detection of dark matter with unprecedented sensitivity, studying the cosmic-ray spectrum and composition up to the knee, and observing all-sky gamma rays with energies above 100 MeV. HERD is designed as a large-acceptance telescope with a unique design aimed at maximizing its efficiency. It comprises a central 3D imaging calorimeter (CALO) made of LYSO crystals, encircled by four complementary subdetectors on its top and four lateral faces: the scintillating fiber tracking detector (FIT), the plastic scintillator detector (PSD), the silicon charge detector (SCD), and a transition radiation detector (TRD) on one lateral side. To fully harness HERD gamma-ray detection capabilities down to 100 MeV, an advanced ultra-low-energy gamma-ray (ULEG) trigger system has been developed. We present an extensive overview of the design, performance, and optimization of the gamma-ray trigger system supported by software simulations and preliminary results from the successful implementation of the HERD prototype at CERN's PS and SPS beam test campaigns in Fall 2023.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the AGB population of the galaxy M31, based on available HST and Spitzer data, to characterize the individual sources in terms of mass, metallicity and formation epoch of the progenitors. Particular attention is dedicated to the derivation of the dust production rate of the stars, in the attempt of determining the global current dust production rate of the galaxy, divided between the silicates and the carbonaceous dust contributions. We use results from stellar evolution modelling complemented by the description of the dust formation process in the wind, to be used in a population synthesis approach, based on the star formation history and age-metallicity relationship obtained in previous investigations. The comparison between the results from synthetic modelling and the data available are used for the characterization of AGB stars in M31. We find that the bulk of the AGB population of M31 is composed by low-mass stars of different metallicity formed between 6 Gyr and 14 Gyr ago, with an additional, significant contribution from the progeny of 1.7-2.5Msun stars formed during the secondary peak in the star formation, which occurred between 1 and 2 Gyr ago. The dust production rate of the galaxy is mostly provided by carbon stars, whose contribution is of the order of 4x10^{-4} Msun/yr, completed by silicates production from massive AGB stars, occurring at a rate of 6x10^{-5} Msun/yr. The implications of the present results on the reliability of AGB modelling are also commented.

          Prospects for Detecting Signs of Life on Exoplanets in the JWST Era

 - **Abstract**
 The search for signs of life in the Universe has entered a new phase with the advent of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Detecting biosignature gases via exoplanet atmosphere transmission spectroscopy is in principle within JWST's reach. We reflect on JWST's early results in the context of the potential search for biological activity on exoplanets. The results confront us with a complex reality. Established inverse methods to interpret observed spectra-already known to be highly averaged representations of intricate 3D atmospheric processes-can lead to disparate interpretations even with JWST's quality of data. Characterizing rocky or sub-Neptune-size exoplanets with JWST is an intricate task, and moves us away from the notion of finding a definitive "silver bullet" biosignature gas. Indeed, JWST results necessitate us to allow "parallel interpretations" that will perhaps not be resolved until the next generation of observatories. Nonetheless, with a handful of habitable-zone planet atmospheres accessible given the anticipated noise floor, JWST may continue to contribute to this journey by designating a planet as biosignature gas candidate. To do this we will need to sufficiently refine our inverse methods and physical models for confidently quantifying specific gas abundances and constraining the atmosphere context.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper introduces two astronomical methods developed through computational simulation to evaluate the historical dating of ancient astronomical sources. The first identifies a 1151-year planetary cycle based on the recurrence of visible configurations of Mercury to Saturn, including the Sun and Moon, from a geocentric perspective. The second, called SESCC (Speed-Error Signals Cross Correlation), statistically estimates the epoch of star catalogs by analyzing the correlation between positional error and proper motion in ecliptic latitude. Both methods are reproducible, data-driven, and yield results that contradict key tenets of the New Chronology proposed by Fomenko and Nosovsky, most notably the claim that the Anno Domini began in 1152 CE. Open-source code and analysis tools are provided for independent verification.

 - **Abstract**
 The study of molecular line emission is crucial to unveil the kinematics and the physical conditions of gas in star-forming regions. Our aim is to quantify the reliability of using individual molecular transitions to derive physical properties of the bulk of the H2 gas, looking at morphological correlations in their overall integrated molecular line emission with the cold dust. For this study we selected transitions of H2CO, CH$_3$OH, DCN, HC$_3$N, CH$_3$CN, CH$_3$OCHO, SO, and SiO and compared them with the 1.38 mm dust continuum emission at different spatial scales in the ALMAGAL sample, that observed a total of 1013 targets covering all evolutionary stages of the high-mass star-formation process and different conditions of clump fragmentation. We used the method of the histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) implemented in the tool astroHOG to compare the morphology of integrated line emission with maps of the 1.38 mm dust continuum emission. Moreover, we calculated the Spearman's correlation coefficient, and compared it with our astroHOG results. Only H$_2$CO, CH$_3$OH, and SO show emission on spatial scales comparable with the diffuse continuum emission. However, from the HOG method, the median correlation of the emission of each of these species with the continuum is only $\sim$24-29%. In comparison with the dense fragments these molecular species still have low values of correlation. On the other hand DCN, HC$_3$N, CH$_3$CN, and CH$_3$OCHO show a good correlation with the dense dust fragments, above 60%. The worst correlation is seen with SiO, both with the extended continuum emission and with compact sources. From the comparison of the results of the HOG method and the Spearman's correlation coefficient, the HOG method gives much more reliable results than the intensity-based coefficient in estimating the level of similarity of the emission morphology.

 - **Abstract**
 Accurately estimating the statistical properties of noise is important in space-based gravitational wave data analysis. Traditional methods often assume uncorrelated noise or impose restrictive parametric forms on cross-channel correlations, which could lead to biased estimation in complex instrumental noise. This paper introduces a spline-based framework with trans-dimensional Bayesian inference to reconstruct the full noise covariance matrix, including frequency-dependent auto- and cross-power spectral densities, without prior assumptions on noise shapes. The developed software $\mathtt{NOISAR}$ can recover the features of the noise power spectrum curves with a relative error $\leq 10\%$ for both auto- and cross-one.

 - **Abstract**
 Self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) theories predict that dark matter halos experience core-collapse in late-stage evolution, a process where the halo's inner region rapidly increases in density and decreases in size. This process can be modeled by treating the dark matter as a gravothermal fluid, and solving the fluid equations to predict the density profile evolution. This model is incomplete without calibration to N-body simulations, through a constant factor $\beta$ included in the thermal conductivity for the long-mean-free-path limit. The value of $\beta$ employed in the gravothermal fluid formalism has varied between studies, with no clear universal value in the literature. In this work, we use the N-body code Arepo to conduct a series of isolated core-collapse simulations across a range of scattering cross-sections, halo concentrations, and halo masses to calibrate the heat transfer parameter $\beta$. We find that $\beta$ is independent of cross-section, halo concentration, and halo mass for velocity independent elastic scattering cross-sections. We present a model for an effective $\beta$ as a function of a dimensionless cross-section, to describe halo evolution in the long mean free path limit, and show that it accurately captures halo evolution as long as the cross section is not too large. This effective model facilitates comparisons between simulations and the gravothermal model, and enables fast predictions of the dark matter density profile at any given time without running N-body simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 Context: Recent JWST measurements allow access to the near-infrared spectrum of the sub-Neptune TOI-270 d, for which two different interpretations, a high-metallicity miscible envelope and a lower metallicity hycean world, are currently in conflict. Aims: Here, we reanalyze the published data and reproduce previously retrieved molecular abundances based on an independent data reduction and a different retrieval framework. The aim of this study is to refine the understanding of TOI-270 d and highlight considerations for JWST data analysis. Additionally, we test the impact of data resolution on atmospheric retrieval calculations. Methods: We reduce one JWST NIRSpec G395H and one NIRISS SOSS GR700XD transit dataset using the Eureka! pipeline and a custom MCMC-based light curve fitting algorithm at the instruments' native resolutions. The atmospheric composition is estimated with the updated BeAR retrieval code across a grid of retrieval setups and spectral resolutions. Results: Our transit spectrum is consistent with previous studies, except at the red end of the NIRISS data. Our retrievals support a higher mean molecular weight atmosphere for TOI-270 d. We provide refined abundance constraints and find statistically favored model extensions indicating either sulfur-rich chemistry with species such as CS2, CS, and H2CS, or the possible presence of CH3Cl or CH3F. However, Bayesian inference cannot distinguish between these scenarios due to similar opacities below 4 microns. Conclusions: Our analysis reinforces TOI-270 d as a highly interesting warm sub-Neptune for atmospheric studies, with a complex chemistry in a cloud-free upper atmosphere. However, its exact nature remains uncertain and warrants further detailed photochemical modeling and observations.

          General Analytic Solutions for Circumplanetary Disks during the Late Stages of Giant Planet Formation

 - **Abstract**
 Forming giant planets are accompanied by circumplanetary disks, as indicated by considerations of angular momentum conservation, observations of candidate protoplanets, and the satellite systems of planets in our Solar System. This paper derives surface density distributions for circumplanetary disks during the final stage of evolution when most of the mass is accreted. This approach generalizes previous treatments to include the angular momentum bias for the infalling material, more accurate solutions for the incoming trajectories, corrections to the outer boundary condition of the circumplanetary disk, and the adjustment of newly added material as it becomes incorporated into the Keplerian flow of the pre-existing disk. These generalizations lead to smaller centrifugal radii, higher column density for the surrounding envelopes, and higher disk accretion efficiency. In addition, we explore the consequences of different angular distributions for the incoming material at the outer boundary, with the concentration of the incoming flow varying from polar to isotropic to equatorial. These geometric variations modestly affect the disk surface density, but also lead to substantial modification to the location in the disk where the mass accretion rate changes sign. This paper finds analytic solutions for the orbits, source functions, surface density distributions, and the corresponding disk temperature profiles over the expanded parameter space outlined above.

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce a novel method to constrain the Hubble constant ($H_0$) by combining fast radio bursts (FRBs) and their persistent radio sources (PRSs) through the observationally validated Yang relation, $ L_{\nu} \propto | \mathrm{RM} | $, which links PRS luminosity to the rotation measure (RM) of the associated FRB. Using a mock sample of PRSs, we demonstrate that the Yang relation can help to unravel the degeneracies among $H_0$, baryon density parameter $\Omega_b$, and baryon fraction in the intergalactic medium $f_{\mathrm{IGM}}$ in the traditional approach of using dispersion measure only to perform cosmological analyses. Our method employs a two-stage Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis to constrain $H_0$. Using the available data of six observed PRS systems, we obtain a preliminary constraint of $H_0 = 75 \pm 30~\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$. We briefly discuss possible refinements of the method by reducing residual degeneracies and systematic uncertainties using future data and physical modeling. Our results indicate that the Yang relation can potentially become a new probe for performing FRB cosmology.

          Purely gravitational dark matter production in warm inflation

 - **Abstract**
 We consider an appealing scenario for the production of purely gravitational dark matter in the background of warm inflation, a mechanism that maintains stable thermal bath during inflation. Through systematic investigation of various gravitational production channels, we reveal distinctive features compared to the standard inflation scenario. Notably, the inflaton annihilation channel in warm inflation exhibits markedly different thermodynamics from the standard inflation paradigm, leading to a suppression on the production of sub-inflaton-mass dark matter. For the production channel of inflationary vacuum fluctuations, we find a correlation of $\rho_\chi\propto m_\chi^{5/2}$ for the conformally coupled dark matter, which expands the feasible range of dark matter mass. Our results also indicates that a minimum temperature threshold of $10^{-6}M_P$ is necessary for warm inflation, which allows adequate dark matter production. With observational constraints, our results provide stringent limits on the mass range of purely gravitational dark matter with sufficient density: $10^{-8}-10^{-2}M_P$ for minimal coupling and $10^{-14}-10^{-2}M_P$ for conformal coupling.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic birefringence$-$the rotation of the polarization plane of light as it traverses the universe$-$offers a direct observational window into parity-violating physics beyond the Standard Model. In this work, we revisit the anisotropic component of cosmic birefringence, which leads to the generation of $B$-mode polarization in the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Using an exact theoretical treatment beyond the thin last-scattering surface approximation, we constrain the amplitude of anisotropic birefringence with combined polarization data from SPTpol, ACT, POLARBEAR, and BICEP. The joint analysis yields a best-fit amplitude of $A_{\rm CB} = 0.42^{+0.40}_{-0.34} \times 10^{-4}$, consistent with zero within $2\sigma$, and we place a 95\% confidence-level upper bound of $A_{\rm CB} < 1 \times 10^{-4}$. The constraint is not dominated by any single experiment and remains robust under the inclusion of a possible isotropic rotation angle. These results provide leading constraints on anisotropic cosmic birefringence from CMB $B$-mode polarization and illustrate the potential of upcoming experiments to improve sensitivity to parity-violating effects in the early universe.

 - **Abstract**
 An important prediction of inflation is the production of a primordial stochastic gravitational wave background. Observing this background is challenging due to the weakness of the signal and the simultaneous presence of an astrophysical background generated by many unresolved late-time sources. One possible way to distinguish between the two is to examine their anisotropies. In this paper we calculate the primordial correlation function of gravitational wave anisotropies in the cosmological background generated by axion inflation, where the inflaton is a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson coupled to gauge fields. In this scenario, tensor modes arise not only from the standard amplification of vacuum fluctuations present in any inflationary model, but also from the inverse decay process of the produced gauge fields. The correlator of gravitational wave anisotropies consists therefore of two main components: the contribution from vacuum tensor modes and the contribution from tensor modes sourced by the gauge fields. Our analysis shows that, while the former, previously studied in the literature, is negligible, the one arising from the sourced tensor modes, normalized by the fractional energy density at interferometer frequencies, can reach values as large as $\mathcal{O}(10^{-1})$. This result shows that axion inflation can generate large anisotropies with the potential to be observed by gravitational wave detectors within a reasonable time frame.

          Discovery and Dynamics of the Nontransiting Planet Kepler-139f

 - **Abstract**
 Among the ways that an outer giant planet can alter the architecture of an inner planetary system is by tilting the orbits of the inner planets and reducing their mutual transit probabilities. Here, we report on an example of this phenomenon: we show that the Kepler-139 system contains a nontransiting planet just exterior to three transiting planets, and interior to a giant planet. This newly discovered planet, Kepler-139f, has an orbital period of $355 \pm 2$ days and a mass of $36 \pm 10 M_\oplus$ based on transit-timing and radial-velocity data. Through dynamical simulations, we show that gravitational perturbations on planet f's orbit from the outer giant planet reduce the probability for a randomly located observer to see transits of all four inner planets. Thus, Kepler-139 illustrates the role that outer giant planets can play in the apparent truncation of compact systems of multiple transiting planets.

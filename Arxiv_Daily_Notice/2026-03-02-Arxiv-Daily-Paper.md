#### Title:
          Worlds Next Door. III. Indirect Evidence for Enhanced Atmospheric Metallicity and/or the Presence of Water Clouds in the Nearest Jupiter-analog $ε$ Eri b

- **Abstract**
 We present the most sensitive direct imaging search for the nearest ($d = 3.2$ pc) Jupiter-analog exoplanet, $\epsilon$ Eri b, with JWST/NIRCam coronagraphy between 4-5 $\mu$m (F444W). We achieve a 5$\sigma$ contrast sensitivity $\approx3.0\times10^{-7}$ ($\Delta \approx 16.3$ mag) in the F444W filter at the expected planet separation of $\approx$1". This is the deepest 4-5 $\mu$m contrast performance achieved for any JWST/NIRCam observation to date at these separations (and $>10\times$ better than ground-based limits). Yet, the planet remains elusive to imaging. We update the star's age to $1.1\pm0.1$ Gyr, older than previous age estimates, using the latest gyrochronology relations. This significantly impacts $\epsilon$ Eri b's inferred effective temperature ($T_{\rm eff}$), which is now expected to lie between 150-200 K based on evolutionary models for a 1 $M_{\rm Jup}$ planet. Using cloud-free Sonora Flame Skimmer models and custom PICASO patchy cloud models in the above $T_{\rm eff}$ range, we find that the F444W non-detection of $\epsilon$ Eri b can be explained by a metal-enriched atmosphere and/or an atmosphere containing water ice clouds. Both possibilities suggest that $\epsilon$ Eri b's atmosphere is strikingly similar to that of Jupiter in our Solar System. Alternatively, if we do not enforce the dynamical mass ($0.98 \pm 0.09\;M_{\rm Jup}$), a solar metallicity, cloud-free, $\lesssim0.81\;M_{\rm Jup}$ planet would be consistent with the NIRCam upper limit based on the Sonora Flame Skimmer evolutionary models. Finally, we place limits on the size of a potential ring system using the NIRCam/F210M data and discuss the opportunity to directly image $\epsilon$ Eri b with additional JWST observations, the Roman Coronagraph Instrument, the ExtraSolar Coronagraph on the Lazuli Observatory, and EELT/METIS.

          Transient X-ray Sources as Extremely Eccentric Mass-Transfer Binaries with Compact Companions

- **Abstract**
 It has long been suggested that X-ray transients are produced at periastron of stellar-compact object binaries with eccentric orbits. Recoil of matter evaporated from the star by X-rays from matter transferred at periastron increases the orbital semi-major axis and eccentricity. After periastrons the object would be a transient X-ray source, a Galactic analogue of a tidal disruption event (TDE), but recurrent with a gradually increasing period rather than catastrophic.

- **Abstract**
 Interstellar objects provide a unique view into the formation of other star systems. Here we present spectroscopic observations of the recently discovered interstellar object 3I/ATLAS between a heliocentric distance of $3.7$ to $1.8$~au on either side of its travels through perihelion. We obtained several observations with the Keck-I/LRIS, Keck-II/NIRES, Gemini/GMOS, and UH88/SNIFS spectrographs, covering a wavelength range of $0.3 - 2.5~\mathrm{\mu m}$. We report the continued emission of both Ni and CN, along with post-perihelion detections of Fe and a weak detection of $\mathrm{C_3}$. We determine the spectral slope across optical and NIR wavelengths and find a positive spectral slope in the optical, with values ranging from $\sim 21 - 27\%$ in the blue regions ($0.4 - 0.55~\mathrm{\mu m}$) to $\sim 6 - 10\%$ in the red ($0.65 - 0.9~\mathrm{\mu m}$) regions. In contrast, the NIR showed a negative spectral slope of $\sim -0.9 \%$ between $0.9 - 1.5~\mathrm{\mu m}$ and $\sim -2.3\%$ between $1.9 - 2.5~\mathrm{\mu m}$. 3I/ATLAS shows a clear turnover in its spectral shape at $\sim 1.1~\mathrm{\mu m}$, corresponding to scattered light from the dusty coma. Finally, in the NIR, we do not find an increase in the depth of the water features identified in an earlier NIR observation of 3I/ATLAS. Our observations of 3I/ATLAS in the NIR show a similar shape to the NIR spectrum of 2I/Borisov as it approached perihelion.
#### Title:
          Can the dust eclipses in WR 104 provide constraints on the system's inclination?

- **Abstract**
 When two massive stars orbit each other, their winds create a shock cone. In some cases, an evolved, carbon-rich Wolf-Rayet (WR) star's wind collides with that of an orbiting OB star, condensing into dust downstream. This dust is then seen as large spiral structures that eventually move into the interstellar medium. Among these colliding wind binaries, the archetype system WR104 has become an enigma. Aperture masking interferometry with Keck revealed an evolving face-on dust spiral with multiple rungs of dust visible from years of observations. In contrast to direct imagery, recent spectroscopic results implied that the orbit must have an inclination quite different from the face-on geometry. We examined the ASAS and ASAS-SN photometry to put further constraints on the geometry of the orbit. Through a phase-binning of the light curve, we find that the recent g-band light curve is brightest at a time when the OB star is in front of the WR star in our line of sight, with the lowest flux happening at the opposite conjunction. We fit the light curve with an illustrative model for scattering eclipses, which then allows us to infer an inclination of the system of $(41.8^{+13.0}_{-14.9})^\circ$. This inclination agrees with the recent spectroscopic orbit and presents challenges to previous interpretations of high-angular resolution images of the dust plume. We provide a qualitative geometric model for the dust plume to reconcile these results and show how WR104 can provide a means to study the properties of WR dust in detail.

- **Abstract**
 Using the Spitzer and WISE images, we discovered 42 mid-IR luminous dusty supernovae with local integral-field spectroscopy data. The observed mid-IR emission indicates the presence of newly formed dust, or pre-existing dust heated by the radiation from the supernovae or circumstellar medium interactions. We carried out a systematic analysis of the supernova host environments and their dust properties, for understanding the dust-veiled exploding stars, and whether such an intense dust production process is associated with their local environments. We find that dusty supernovae prefer the locations with higher EW(H{\alpha}), lower metallicity, and heavier host extinctions compared to typical SN types, and they show the same increasing sequence in the values of EW(H{\alpha}) and oxygen abundance from hydrogen-rich, type IIn and hydrogen-poor dusty supernovae. These differences in environmental properties of different dusty SN types indicate the diversity of their progenitors. We also found that one marginal correlation is a negative correlation between the SN dust mass and star formation rate. This means that SNe would be more mid-IR luminous and more dust-rich at the region with lower star formation rate. However, the SN dust mass show no correlation with the metallicity and the host extinction, which were thought to be key factors affecting the mass-loss history of progenitors and the CSM environment of SNe. Therefore, the dust formation process in SNe might be insensitive to metallicity and the dust condition of their host environments.

          Probing inflationary features with galaxy ultraviolet luminosity function observables

- **Abstract**
 We use the galaxy ultraviolet luminosity function measurements at $z=6-9$ to constrain modification to standard inflationary power spectrum. These observables are sensitive to the matter power spectrum which itself depends on inflationary initial conditions. We consider specific models where a bump or oscillatory features are introduced to the standard power law inflation spectrum. We find that the galaxy luminosity observables can probe such modifications at wavenumbers $0.5\lesssim k \lesssim 20$ Mpc$^{-1}$. We obtain upper limits on the amplitude of bump-like features at the mentioned wavenumbers. We obtain constraints which are similar to previous constraints on these models using measurements of optical depth of reionization. However, the galaxy luminosity functions are a more direct probe for these type of models and, therefore, can complement indirect constraints coming from measurements of IGM properties.

- **Abstract**
 Wide binaries (WBs) offer a unique opportunity to test gravity in the low-acceleration regime, where modifications such as Milgromian dynamics (MOND) predict measurable deviations from Newtonian gravity. We construct a rigorous framework for conducting the wide binary test (WBT), emphasizing high quality sample selection, filtering of poor astrometric solutions, contamination mitigation, and uncertainty propagation. We show that undetected close binaries, chance alignments, and improper treatment of projection effects can mimic MOND-like signals. We introduce a checklist of best practices to identify and avoid these pitfalls. Applying this framework to Gaia DR3 data, we compile a high-purity sample of WBs within 130 pc with projected separations of 1 - 30 kAU, spanning the transition between the Newtonian and MOND regimes. We find that the scaled relative velocity distribution of wide binaries does not exhibit the 20% enhancement expected from MOND and is consistent with Newtonian gravity across all separations. A meta-analysis of previous WBTs shows that apparent MOND signals diminish as methodological rigour improves. We conclude that when stringent quality controls are applied, there is no observational evidence for MOND-induced velocity boosts in wide binaries. Our results place strong empirical constraints on modified gravity theories operating between a0/10 and 200 a0, where a0 is the MOND acceleration scale. Across this range of internal accelerations, Newtonian gravity is up to 1500x more likely than MOND for our cleanest sample.

          Discovery of a nearby radio relic in the low-mass, merging cluster Abell 4067

- **Abstract**
 Shock waves generated during cluster mergers offer a powerful probe of how large-scale structure grows and evolves in the Universe. As part of the MeerKAT-South Pole Telescope (SPT) survey, we report the discovery of a single arc-like radio relic in the galaxy cluster Abell 4067 ($z=0.099$), one of the lowest-mass clusters known to host such a structure. MeerKAT UHF-band (0.58--1.09 GHz) observations reveal a relic with a largest linear size of $\sim 1.48 \pm 0.02$ Mpc, located at a projected distance of 0.95 Mpc from the cluster centre. XMM-Newton X-ray data show that the relic's position and orientation relative to the intracluster medium (ICM) elongation are consistent with a merger-driven shock-wave scenario. The relic has an estimated radio power of $3.10 \pm 0.03 \times 10^{24}$ W Hz$^{-1}$ at 150 MHz. When placed in the $P_{150\,\mathrm{MHz}}$--$M_{500}$ scaling relation, the Abell 4067 relic appears less luminous compared to relics in more massive clusters, suggesting an association with weak merger shocks. This finding supports the idea that relics in low-mass clusters may form through less energetic merger events, leading to weak merger shocks. This is further supported by the absence of a detectable central radio halo in Abell 4067, reinforcing the idea that luminous radio halos are not a universal outcome of cluster mergers and highlighting the role of cluster mass, merger energetics, and evolutionary stage in shaping diffuse radio emission in the intracluster medium.

- **Abstract**
 Being the most massive known young stellar cluster in the Milky Way, Westerlund 1 (Wd1) constitutes an ideal benchmark for understanding the evolution of massive stars. However, the cluster age remains highly controversial (~4-10 Myr), hindering the use of Wd1 as a reference for massive star evolution. One of the main issues is high foreground extinction, which has so far prevented the detection of the main sequence. Using infrared spectroscopy we seek to detect the cluster's main sequence for the first time, to characterise the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, and to use the cluster's turn-off to obtain a robust age estimate. We obtained multi-epoch, near-infrared VLT/KMOS spectroscopic observations of Wd1 to map its population of massive stars. The spectra of ~110 members were analysed with CMFGEN models to derive stellar parameters, populate the cluster Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, and compare it with isochrones from evolutionary models. Our observations returned 47 new spectroscopically identified cluster members, with spectral types O9-B1 III-V. The cluster turn-off indicates an age of 5.5+/-1.0 Myr at a distance of 4.23+0.23-0.21 kpc, displaying a moderate degree of coevality. We demonstrate that our estimate of the age of Wd1 is robust against reasonable changes in the distance and extinction law, and the adopted rotational velocity and metallicity of the stellar isochrones. We further find that ~65% of the OB stars with multi-epoch coverage exhibit radial-velocity variability. Infrared observations of the unevolved stellar population support a single episode of star formation with an age of ~5.5 Myr, reinforcing its potential as a benchmark for massive star evolution and providing a reference sample for future binary population studies.

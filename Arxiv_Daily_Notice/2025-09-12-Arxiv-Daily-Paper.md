 - **Abstract**
 Zodiacal light -- arising from both the thermal emission and scattered sunlight by interplanetary dust -- is the dominant component of the sky background in NIRISS Single Object Slitless Spectroscopy (SOSS) observations. The GR700XD grism disperses the zodiacal background across multiple diffraction orders, producing a characteristic two-dimensional, spectral order-dependent background pattern on the detector that reflects the combined contribution of overlapping orders. Observations reveal significant variability in background intensity driven by JWST's sky pointing and seasonal changes, underscoring the need for precise background subtraction during SOSS data reduction. Current methods rely on a generic background template derived during commissioning, scaled to match individual exposures. However, mis-scaled templates can leave behind structured residuals that may compromise the precision of exoplanet transit depth measurements. To improve background modeling, we conducted two calibration programs (PID 4479 and 6658) using the FULL frame readout mode and a 5-row by 2-column mosaic pattern to sample a range of sky positions. These observations enable empirical reconstruction of the sky background and provide detailed insights into its spatial and spectral characteristics. We present a library of empirically derived background templates and evaluate their performance, alongside the current template, by benchmarking against the PID 2113 dataset, which includes contemporaneous background exposures. This work supports aims to enhance background subtraction for SOSS time-series to achieve higher-precision exoplanet spectroscopy with JWST.

          Relativistic Time Modeling for Lunar Positioning Navigation and Timing

 - **Abstract**
 Future lunar missions will depend on an internationally agreed upon timescale that remains accurate under the Moon's unique gravitational environment and its orbital dynamics. This thesis investigates the proposed Lunar Coordinate Time (TCL), derived analogously to Geocentric Coordinate Time (TCG) and thus aligned with current IAU proposals. We first formalise the TCL transformation and quantify its characteristics from solar system simulations. Next, we compute stationary surface-clock drifts caused by gravitational redshift and the Moon's changing orientation parameters, evaluating how accurate atomic clocks deployed on the surface of the Moon (much like for ESA's proposed NovaMoon mission) would have to be to measure these effects. Finally, we simulate relativistic proper time for ESA's Moonlight navigation satellites, identifying average drift and harmonic variations, to better understand the system that will comprise and enable a Lunar PNT (Positioning, Navigation and Timing) architecture. These kinds of investigations are an essential step toward a sustained internationally cooperative operation at the lunar south pole and beyond.

          The fate of Gaia's wide binaries: Interplay of white-dwarf recoil and tidal capture

 - **Abstract**
 White dwarfs (WDs) receive natal velocity boosts of $\sim 1 \, \mathrm{km \, s^{-1}}$ due to recoil from asymmetric mass loss during the late asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stage. In a wide binary, the acceleration of a proto-WD exerts a torque, modifying the orbital eccentricity. Potential signatures of this effect have been detected in Gaia's astrometric binary sample. At the same time, an AGB star's puffy envelope facilitates strong tidal interactions in binaries with periapsis separations of a few AU, capturing the companion into a tighter orbit and potentially driving the system towards a common-envelope phase. Using an analytical model for wide binary evolution under asymmetric AGB mass loss, we find that recoil can induce tidal interactions in up to $30\%$ of initially wide binaries on the AGB or post-AGB for initial separations of $\sim 100 \mbox{--} 1000$ AU. We relate these interactions to three recent observational puzzles: (i) The dearth of wide WD+MS and WD+WD binaries in Gaia DR3 with eccentricities $\gtrsim 0.9$. (ii) The formation of moderately eccentric WD+MS and WD+WD binaries with orbital periods of $\sim 100 \mbox{--} 1000$ days, which may happen via a high-eccentricity common-envelope phase. (iii) The origin of low-luminosity, long-timescale, dust-obscured transients towards AGB progenitors, such as the ongoing event WNTR23bzdiq in M31. Our findings have potential implications for the survival and dynamical evolution of planetary systems around WD progenitors, to be investigated in future works.

          A New Boundary Condition on Reionization

 - **Abstract**
 The epoch of reionization (EoR) marks the last phase transition of hydrogen in our Universe, as it evolves from cold and neutral to hot and ionized in the intergalactic medium (IGM). While its endpoint and duration can be estimated from current observations, albeit with large uncertainties, there is no known avenue to constrain its onset. We propose a novel method based on the Pearson cross-correlation coefficient between 21-cm brightness temperature maps and line-intensity maps tracing star-formation (e.g., OIII, CO, CII). This real-space estimator evolves from negative to positive as X-ray heating progresses, and saturates prior to the EoR. We predict a sharp turnover from saturation during the earliest EoR stages, when the IGM ionized fraction reaches $\bar{x}_{\rm HII}\sim 1\%-10\%$. We show that in standard scenarios, where the IGM heating precedes reionization, the turnover is a clear, model-robust signature. Its detection will provide a unique observational anchor for the EoR onset, complementing existing probes and tightening constraints on early galaxy formation models.

          Dusty Clump Survival in Supernova Ejecta: Dust-Mediated Growth vs. Crushing by the Reverse Shock

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the interaction of dense, cold ejecta clumps with a fast reverse shock, an instance of the "cloud-crushing" problem, is essential to assess whether core-collapse supernovae act as net dust factories or net dust destroyers. This work assesses whether dusty ejecta clumps are destroyed by the reverse shock or instead cool, condense, and grow in mass under realistic supernova-remnant conditions. Cloud-crushing timescales are computed and compared to radiative cooling timescales, including both gas-phase cooling and dust-induced cooling, for a large grid of clump densities, dust-to-gas mass ratios, and shock velocities. When the dust-to-gas mass ratio exceeds $10^{-3}$, gas-grain collisions become efficient enough that the cooling timescale $t_{\rm cool}$ falls below the cloud-crushing timescale $t_{\rm cc}$ over a broad span of clump densities and shock velocities, enabling dusty clumps to survive even fast reverse shocks. For example, at clump densities $\geq 2 \times 10^{4}$ cm$^{-3}$, dust-to-gas mass ratios $\sim 10^{-2}$, and shock velocities up to $2000$ km s$^{-1}$, enhanced gas-grain cooling drives the system into a regime where dusty clumps can gain additional cold mass and increase their dust masses. Strong radiative cooling can shield dust-rich clumps in supernova remnants, enabling a significant fraction of ejecta dust to be injected into the interstellar medium. These results mirror the "growth" regime found in studies of circumgalactic clouds and rapidly cooling shocked stellar winds, implying a larger dust survival in supernova remnants. Indeed, the dusty globules seen in the Crab Nebula occupy the predicted survival regime across a wide range of physical parameters.

 - **Abstract**
 Tidal disruption events (TDEs) occur when a star is disrupted by the tidal forces of a supermassive black hole (SMBH), producing bright multi-wavelength flares. Among these events, AT2020mot has so far exhibited the highest recorded optical polarisation, with tidal shocks proposed as the primary source of its polarised emission. We present a comprehensive analysis of 13 TDEs with available polarimetric observations, aiming to determine whether the unusually high polarisation of AT2020mot stems from unique physical processes or arises from mechanisms shared by other TDEs. We present new optical polarisation measurements of TDEs obtained from multiple ground-based telescopes, combining them with optical, UV, and X-ray light curves from the Zwicky Transient Facility and the Swift observatory, respectively. We derive intrinsic TDE properties, such as SMBH and stellar masses, using MOSFiT and TDEMass, and compare them with the ones of the sample population. Our population study reveals that AT2020mot agrees with the broader TDE sample in most physical properties, including blackbody temperature, luminosity, and rise timescales. However, its optical polarisation degree is exceptionally high compared to the low or undetected polarisation observed in other events. Additionally, AT2020mot appears to have an elevated column density from our MOSFiT fits, suggesting a more complex environment than is typically assumed. We conclude that although AT2020mot fits well within the general TDE population in terms of global characteristics, its extraordinarily high polarisation and higher column density challenge current models based purely on shock or reprocessing mechanisms. More extensive, time-resolved polarimetric monitoring of newly discovered TDEs will be critical to determine whether AT2020mot represents an outlier or the extreme end of a continuum of TDE properties.

          Exploring the History of Stellar Mergers with Chemistry: Examining the Origins of Massive $α$-Enriched Stars using Carbon Isotope Ratios

 - **Abstract**
 Recently discovered massive $\alpha$-enriched (MAE) stars have surface chemistry consistent with members of the older thick disk Milky Way population but high masses ($\sim$ 1.5 - 3 M$_{\odot}$) that suggest these stars are young. The origin of MAE stars is not fully understood although binary interactions are likely an important formation pathway. To better constrain the history of MAE stars, we have measured metallicities, carbon isotope ratios, and CNO abundances in 49 red clump stars and four red giants. Our sample included thin disk, thick disk, and MAE stars to best constrain different formation scenarios. We observed our sample stars using the Tull spectrograph on the McDonald 2.7m telescope and derived abundances using synthetic spectra created by the Turbospectrum radiative transfer code. Overall, we find that 10 of our red clump MAE stars are consistent with the average thick disk carbon isotope ratio of $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C = 8.2 $\pm$ 3.4. We find five MAE stars that have significantly higher carbon isotope ratios ($^{12}$C/$^{13}$C $>$ 15) than stars at similar metallicities. Two of the anomalous stars show abundance patterns consistent with AGB mass transfer while three MAE stars have $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratios similar to massive, single RC stars and show no clear signs of binarity from radial velocity monitoring or from the Gaia RUWE measurement. Overall, we find that carbon isotope ratio measurements provide a unique constraint when discerning the possible origins of MAE stars.

          Demonstrating Improved Contrast on the Roman Coronagraph with Spatial Linear Dark Field Control

 - **Abstract**
 The baseline contrast floor from the Roman Coronagraph's High-Order Wavefront Sensing and Control strategy likely degrades over the course of time, requiring periodic recalibration of the dark hole. Here, we propose to consider spatial linear dark field control (sLDFC) on a one-sided deep-contrast region of the focal plane as a potential test. Implementing sLDFC on CGI will likely require some unique data acquisition strategies given the EMCCD's high flux sensitivity in long exposures/high gain: we outline three possible approaches. However, if successful, sLDFC's advances are substantial: (1) enabling us to maintain a fainter, more temporally correlated dark hole which will improve CGI's contrast after post-processing and (2) efficiently providing a reliable signal (bright field) for accurate reconstruction of residual starlight in the dark field, further boosting CGI's detection limit for bright targets.

 - **Abstract**
 Radial differential rotation is an important factor in stellar dynamo theory. In the Sun, helioseismology has revealed a near surface shear layer in the upper 5 to 10% of the convection zone. At low to midlatitudes, the rotation velocity gradient decreases sharply near the surface. A depth gradient in rotational velocity was recently detected in the low photosphere using a differential interferometric method on spectroscopic data. Granular structures at different depths in the FeI 630.15 nm line showed a systematic retrograde shift compared to continuum structures, suggesting a height-related decrease in angular velocity, dependent on the assumed granulation coherence time. We use a more direct approach to measure the differential rotational velocity at different photospheric heights. We performed spectroscopic scans of the same granular region in FeI 630.15 nm and CaI 616.2 nm lines and measured displacements of images at different line chords between consecutive scans. These observations require excellent seeing, stable adaptive optics, and scanning times shorter than the granulation lifetime. Adaptive optics stabilizes continuum images but not higher-altitude rotation differences. We used THEMIS and HINODE SOT FeI data to measure formation height differences via perspective shifts observed away from the disk center with the slit radially oriented. Measurements at disk center and $\pm$25° latitude along the central meridian show a parabolic decrease in rotational velocity with height, reaching about 16% slower rotation at 80 km above the continuum. No significant difference is found between the equator and $\pm$25° latitudes. The low photosphere is a transition zone between the convective and radiative layers. Our measurements provide new constraints on its dynamical behavior and valuable boundary conditions for numerical simulations of the Sun s upper convection zone.

 - **Abstract**
 Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA; (Paxton2011, 2013, 2015, 2018, 2019, Jermyn 2023) is a widely used open-source software for modelling stellar evolution. In many studies, the computational grids covers thousands of models (e.g., Joyce et al 2024), which requires a tremendous amount of time and computational effort to process. To streamline data analysis, the mesalab package was developed. This Python-based pipeline is designed to simplify the post-processing of MESA outputs by automatically identifying various stellar evolutionary phases, with a specific focus on the ``blue loop'' -- a blue-ward excursion in the Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram (HRD) for intermediate-mass stars often associated with peculiar pulsational phenomena like ``strange modes.''

 - **Abstract**
 Precessing relativistic jets launched by compact objects are rarely directly measured, and present an invaluable opportunity to better understand many features of astrophysical jets. In this Letter we present MeerKAT radio observations of the neutron star X-ray binary system (NSXB) Circinus X-1 (Cir X-1). We observe a curved S-shaped morphology on $\sim 20''$ $(\sim1\:\text{pc})$ scales in the radio emission around Cir X-1. We identify flux density and position changes in the S-shaped emission on year timescales, robustly showing its association with relativistic jets. The jets of Cir X-1 are still propagating with mildly relativistic velocities $\sim1\:\text{pc}$ from the core, the first time such large scale jets have been seen from a NSXB. The position angle of the jet axis is observed to vary on year timescales, over an extreme range of at least $110°$. The morphology and position angle changes of the jet are best explained by a smoothly changing launch direction, verifying suggestions from previous literature, and indicating that precession of the jets is occurring. Steady precession of the jet is one interpretation of the data, and if occurring, we constrain the precession period and half-opening angle to $>10$ years and $>33°$ respectively, indicating precession in a different parameter space to similar known objects such as SS~433.

          On the Reliability of Quasars as Cosmological Distance Indicators

 - **Abstract**
 The goal of the present paper is to assess the usefulness of quasars as cosmological distance indicators. We calibrate, in a model-independent way, the non-linear relation between X-ray and UV emission to derive quasar luminosity distances. Using this calibration, we construct the Hubble diagram up to redshift $z \sim 7.5$, and test the ability of quasars to constrain the $\Lambda$CDM and $\omega$CDM models at low and high redshifts, in combination with the Type Ia supernova Pantheon Plus sample, as well as the latest results from DESI and Planck Compressed data. We find consistency with previous studies in the values of $\gamma$ and $\beta$ when using a quasar subsample with $z<1.43$. However, when the data is used to constrain the cosmological models, we find that quasars fail as reliable distance indicators, even when combined with other independent cosmological datasets.

          Snowball Bistability Vanishes at Moderate Orbital Eccentricity

 - **Abstract**
 Snowball episodes are associated with increases in atmospheric oxygen and the complexity of life on Earth, and they may be essential for the development of complex life on exoplanets. Sustained stable Snowball episodes require a Snowball bifurcation and climate bistability between the globally ice-covered Snowball state and a state with at least some open ocean. We find that climate bistability disappears for an aquaplanet with a slab ocean in the Global Climate Model ExoCAM when the orbital eccentricity is increased to 0.2-0.3. This happens because the Snowball state loses stability as seasonal insolation variations intensify, while the warm state remains stable due to the ocean's large heat capacity. We use a low-order ice-thermodynamic model to show that the Snowball state loses stability as seasonality increases because winter freezing at the ice bottom is reduced relative to summer melting at the ice top due to ice self-insulation. Combined with previous research showing that Snowball climate bistability diminishes for planets orbiting low-mass stars, ones with longer rotation periods, and disappears entirely for tidally locked planets, our work suggests that the Snowball climate bistability may not be as robust to planetary parameters as previously thought, representing one aspect of habitability more consistent with the Rare Earth Hypothesis than the Copernican Principle.

 - **Abstract**
 We assess archival high-energy data for key stars on the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) Target Stars and Systems 2025 list, as stellar radiation is critical to shaping and interpreting planetary atmospheres. Using a sample of 98 nearby stars (HWO Tier 1 targets), we compile and evaluate X-ray and ultraviolet (UV) data from archival eROSITA, Chandra, XMM-Newton, ROSAT, EUVE, Swift, FUSE, IUE, GALEX, and HST. We examine spectral and temporal coverage, assess data quality, and identify major gaps. UV data are moderately available, with most coverage coming from near-UV spectra from IUE. Far fewer stars have far-UV spectra, especially from HST. In the X-ray regime, some stars have high-quality spectra, while others are limited to shallow detections or broad-band photometry. A small fraction of the sample has both X-ray and UV spectra of sufficient quality to support full spectral energy distribution modeling. Truly comprehensive coverage across X-ray, extreme-UV, and both UV bands remains extremely rare. Most datasets are single-epoch, limiting assessments of variability and flares - key factors in atmospheric photochemistry and escape. Moreover, the lack of simultaneous or contemporaneous observations across bands adds further uncertainty. Our findings underscore the need for new space-based missions and coordinated multiwavelength campaigns, ideally with overlapping coverage, to improve stellar characterization for HWO. As several key observatories age and face potential decommissioning, there is a narrow window of opportunity to secure these critical data. Investing in this effort now will directly support the science goals of HWO and enhance future studies of planetary habitability.

          Cosmic Ray Spatial Distribution and the Galactic/Extragalactic Transition

 - **Abstract**
 Determining the spatial distribution of Galactic cosmic rays (CRs) is fundamental to understand how these particles propagate in interstellar space and to infer their source spectra. The most sensitive method of studying this problem is observing the gamma--ray and neutrino diffuse fluxes produced in the inelastic interactions of CR protons and nuclei with interstellar gas that encode the energy and spatial distributions of the interacting particles. Most theoretical models assume that the spatial and energy dependencies of the spectra of CR protons and nuclei are factorized, so that the CR energy spectra have the same shape at all points of the Milky Way. However, on the base of the Fermi--LAT observations, some authors have tentatively inferred that particles in the inner regions of the Milky Way have significantly harder spectra. Recently the ground--based telescopes Tibet--AS$\gamma$, LHAASO and HAWC have extended the measurements of the diffuse gamma--ray flux to much higher energies, and the IceCube neutrino telescope has obtained evidence for a $\nu$ flux from the Galactic disk. These new measurements allow for new tests of the factorization hypothesis, and disfavor models in which the spectral shape of CR protons and nuclei is harder in the inner part of the Galaxy. In fact, the LHAASO data above 30~TeV are in better agreement with the opposite hypothesis, that cosmic rays is the inner Galaxy have softer spectra than those in the outer Galaxy. This result, that has currently only modest significance due to large statistical and systematic uncertainties, could be explained by assuming that the CR confinement volume increases with energy. An alternative explanation is that a significant fraction of cosmic rays in the multi--PeV energy range is of extragalactic origin.

          Lyman-Alpha Emission from K and M Dwarfs: Intrinsic Profiles, Variability, and Flux in the Habitable Zone

 - **Abstract**
 Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) is the most prominent ultraviolet emission line in low-mass stars, playing a crucial role in exoplanet atmospheric photochemistry, heating, and escape. However, interstellar medium (ISM) absorption typically obscures most of the Ly$\alpha$ profile, requiring reconstructions that introduce systematic uncertainties. We present intrinsic Ly$\alpha$ profiles for 12 high radial velocity K and M dwarfs, where Doppler shifting minimizes ISM contamination, allowing direct measurements of $\sim$50-95\% of the line flux. Our sample spans the K-to-M spectral transition, enabling us to constrain the dependence of self-reversals in Ly$\alpha$ emission profiles on effective temperature ($T_{eff}$). The depth of self-reversal, driven by non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) effects, decreases with decreasing $T_{eff}$, with M dwarfs exhibiting little to none. Two stars, Ross 1044 and Ross 451, were observed over multiple days, revealing $\sim$20\% Ly$\alpha$ variability confined to the line core - implying that studies relying on reconstructions may underestimate temporal variability. We find strong correlations between Ly$\alpha$ flux, peak-to-trough ratio, and hydrogen departure coefficients with $T_{eff}$, providing empirical constraints for stellar atmosphere models. A comparison of Ly$\alpha$ flux in the habitable zone shows measured values for high radial velocity stars less than the reconstructed values for the rest of the sample, likely due to the older ages of the high-RV stars and/or overestimated reconstructed fluxes due to model deficiency (e.g., neglecting self-reversal). Our results establish an empirical foundation for Ly$\alpha$ emission in K and M dwarfs, reducing uncertainties in reconstructions and improving models of stellar UV emission relevant to exoplanetary studies.

          On the True Significance of the Hubble Tension: A Bayesian Error Decomposition Accounting for Information Loss

 - **Abstract**
 The Hubble tension, a persistent discrepancy between early and late Universe measurements of $H_0$, poses a significant challenge to the standard cosmological model. In this work, we present a new Bayesian hierarchical framework designed to meticulously decompose this observed tension into its constituent parts: standard measurement errors, information loss arising from parameter-space projection, and genuine physical tension. Our approach, employing Fisher matrix analysis with MCMC-estimated loss coefficients and explicitly modeling information loss via variance inflation factors ($\lambda$), is particularly important in high-precision analysis where even seemingly small information losses can impact conclusions. We find that the real tension component ($T_{real}$) has a mean value of 5.94 km/s/Mpc (95\% CI: [3.32, 8.64] km/s/Mpc). Quantitatively, approximately 78\% of the observed tension variance is attributed to real tension, 13\% to measurement error, and 9\% to information loss. Despite this, our decomposition indicates that the observed $\sim$$6.39\sigma$ discrepancy is predominantly a real physical phenomenon, with real tension contributing $\sim$$5.64\sigma$. Our findings strongly suggest that the Hubble tension is robust and probably points toward new physics beyond the $\Lambda$CDM model.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations of long period radio transients, such as GLEAM-X J0704-37 and ILTJ1101 + 5521, have revealed a previously unrecognized population of galactic radio transient sources associated with white dwarf - M dwarf binaries. It is an open question how to produce coherent radio emission in these systems, though a model driven by binary interaction seems likely given the nature and correlation of the emission with the binaries' orbital period. Using kinetic plasma simulations, we demonstrate that the relativistic electron cyclotron maser instability (ECMI) is a viable mechanism for generating radio pulses in white dwarf - M dwarf systems, akin to planetary radio emission, such as that from the Jupiter-Io system. We quantify the relativistic ECMI in the nonlinear regime under conditions relevant for white dwarf radio emission for the first time. Our simulations demonstrate that the ECMI can intrinsically produce partially linearly polarized emission relevant to explaining the observed emission spectrum of the two galactic sources, though the precise details will depend on the plasma composition. Our work paves the way for a systematic and fully nonlinear computational modeling of radio emission from interacting white dwarf sources.

 Within the standard six-parameter Lambda cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model, a $2$-$3\sigma$ tension persists between baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Although this tension has often been interpreted as evidence for dynamical dark energy or a sum of neutrino masses below the established minimum, recent studies suggest it may instead originate from an underestimation of the reionization optical depth, particularly when inferred from large-scale CMB polarization. Jhaveri et al. propose that a suppression of large-scale primordial curvature power could partially cancel the contribution of $\tau$ to the CMB low-$\ell$ polarization power spectrum, leading to a biased low $\tau$ measurement in standard analyses. In this work, we investigate whether punctuated inflation - which generates a suppression of primordial power on large scales through a transient fast-roll phase - can raise the inferred $\tau$ value and thereby reconcile the consistency between CMB and BAO. For simple models with step-like features in the inflaton potential, we find that the constraint on $\tau$ and the CMB-BAO tension remain nearly identical to those in the standard six-parameter $\Lambda$CDM model. We provide a physical explanation for this negative result.

 - **Abstract**
 The rapidly expanding catalog of gravitational-wave detections provides a powerful probe of the formation history of compact binaries across cosmic time. In this work, we extend the Binary Compact Object (BCO) phase-space framework to the full set of events in the GWTC-4 catalog to map the observed binary formation scenarios in a data-driven way. Applying this framework, we identify distinct regions of phase-space associated with different channels and discover for the first time a unique mass-cutoff scale in a data-driven way. The mapping of these on different formation channels reveals a population of first-generation (1G) black holes sharply truncated at approximately 45.5 $M_\odot$, consistent with the theoretically predicted pair-instability supernova (PISN) mass gap. These findings demonstrate the capability of the BCO phase-space to disentangle overlapping formation pathways, establish robust connections between gravitational-wave observations and binary evolution, and highlight the potential of upcoming observing runs to reveal rare populations and exotic origins.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate a class of interacting dark energy and dark matter (DM) models, where dark energy is modeled as a $k$-essence scalar field with an inverse-square potential. Two general forms of interaction are considered: one proportional to the Hubble parameter, and another independent of the Hubble parameter, depending instead on combinations of the energy densities and pressures of the dark sectors. The dynamics are analyzed using a dynamical system stability framework by constructing an autonomous system of equations. The models are tested against a wide range of observational datasets, including cosmic chronometers (CC), BAO measurements from DESI DR2, compressed Planck data (PLA), Pantheon+ (PP), DES supernovae, Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), and strong lensing data from H0LiCOW (HCW). The analysis shows that the models consistently reproduce all major cosmological epochs and yield statistically competitive results compared to the flat $\Lambda$CDM model. The models exhibit stable late-time de-Sitter solutions, ensuring ghost-free evolution, with the Hubble constant in the range $H_0 \sim 67$--$70$ km/s/Mpc.

          Modeling Long-Wavelength Amorphous Dust Emission Based on the Physically Motivated Soft-Potential Model

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a new amorphous dust emission model based on the soft-potential (SP) model, applicable in the long-wavelength range from the far-infrared to the microwave. The SP model is widely accepted in material physics to explain amorphous thermal properties and is an extension of the two-level systems (TLS) model, which has been applied in interstellar amorphous dust physics. In the SP model, by assuming that some atoms composing amorphous dust are trapped in a double-well potential (DWP) described by a quartic function, the electric interaction can be solved directly, allowing the absorption cross-section of the amorphous dust to be calculated. We present numerical and analytical solutions for the absorption cross-section of amorphous dust and compare these results, finding good agreement for the DWP with a sufficiently high potential barrier. Our findings show that the SP model can reproduce the observed spectrum of the Perseus molecular cloud with slightly better accuracy than the conventional TLS model. Additionally, the SP model can more effectively explain various long-wavelength dust emission features, such as the spectrum flattening in the submillimeter range and anomalous microwave emission (AME), compared to the TLS model. Further comparison and verification with observational data and laboratory measurements are necessary to refine the model.

 - **Abstract**
 Ref. [Symmetry 15 (2023) 709] introduced a Brans-Dicke-like framework wherein the scalar field $\phi$ is composed of both $G$ and $c$ which, for this reason, co-vary according to $c^{3}/G=\text{constant}$. In this paper, we use observational data to constrain the supposed co-varying $G$ and $c$. The datasets include SN Ia, BAO and the value of $\theta$ extracted from CMB data. A proxy function is demanded for the varying $c$ since the framework does not provide a closed set of equations for computing the functional form of either $G$ or $c$ uniquely. Accordingly, we choose three separate parameterizations for $c\left(z\right)$ inspired both by desirable properties of the varying speed of light (VSL) and by successful phenomenological models from the literature -- including the one by Gupta (CCC framework in e.g. Ref. [Mon. Not. R. Astron. Soc., 498 (2020) 4481-4491]. When combined with DESI, Pantheon+ data strongly favor a variable speed of light with more than $3\sigma$ confidence level for all parameterizations considered in this paper, whereas Union2.1 suggests no variation of the speed of light. As we shall demonstrate, this apparent discrepancy is due to a strong correlation that emerges between $H_0$ and VSL.

          Dust growth and planet formation by disc fragmentation

 - **Abstract**
 It is often argued that gravitational instability of realistic protoplanetary discs is only possible at distances larger than $\sim 50$ au from the central star, requiring high disc masses and accretion rates, and that therefore disc fragmentation results in the production of brown dwarfs rather than gas giant planets. However, the effects of dust growth on opacity can be very significant but have not been taken into account systematically in the models of fragmenting discs. We employ dust opacity that depends on both temperature and maximum grain size to evaluate analytically the properties of a critically fragmenting protoplanetary disc. We find that dust growth may promote disc fragmentation at disc radii as small as $\sim 30$ au. As a result, the critical disc masses and accretion rates are smaller, and the initial fragment masses are in the gas giant planet mass regime. While this suggests that formation of gas giant planets by disc fragmentation may be more likely than usually believed, we caution that numerical models of the process are needed to evaluate the effects not taken into account here, e.g., dust grain mobility and fragment evolution after disc fragmentation.

          High-resolution simulations of disc tearing in the GW Orionis triple system

 - **Abstract**
 The disc around the pre-main-sequence triple star system GW Orionis is known from observations to be warped and broken. Theoretical modelling has produced conflicting results regarding the mechanism responsible for breaking the disc. Analytical predictions for the measured parameters of GW Ori suggest the disc is only marginally stable to tearing. We present new high-resolution simulations of GW Ori that replicate the wavelike regime expected in thick, low-turbulence protoplanetary discs for the first time to settle this question. Using the most optimistic values of misalignment and stellar mass ratio allowed by observational constraints, we find that the GW Ori disc can be torn by stellar torques alone, without need for an embedded planet. Even if the disc retains a smooth warp in simulations with similar parameters, it is likely that any small perturbation in the density or temperature structure could cause the disc to break. The new simulations rule out retrograde disc rotation relative to the stellar orbits and tentatively suggest the thicker ($h/r = 0.04$) disc better matches observations. Going forward, we should take care to ensure models of GW Ori and similar systems appropriately represent the propagation of warps. Additionally, analytical predictions are derived from idealized (and often massless) discs and it is useful to assess how each observed disc might deviate from those assumptions, especially in the context of a young and active star-forming neighbourhood.

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) is one of the intriguing mysteries in astroparticle physics. In order to identify their sources, we need precise knowledge of the mass composition of UHECRs. The direct detection of UHECRs is not feasible at energies above 0.1 PeV, necessitating the use of mass-sensitive observables of extended air showers induced by UHECRs interacting with the atmosphere. One way to achieve high statistics for these mass-sensitive observables is to use ground-based detector arrays, such as the Surface Detector (SD) of the Pierre Auger Observatory. The SD consists of three sub-arrays of independent detector stations arranged in triangular grids with different spacings. Recently, it has been shown that neural networks (NNs) can extract mass-sensitive observables from data taken by the SD-1500, the largest sub-detector of the SD. In this contribution, we demonstrate the feasibility of using NNs to reconstruct a high-level shower observable, the depth of the shower maximum, from data simulated for and observed by the SD-750, the second-largest detector array nested within the SD-1500. A simulation study shows that the SD-750 NN exhibits behavior similar to that of an SD-1500 NN and outperforms the latter in the energy range [1, 10) EeV. Moreover, we show that, after performing a correction and calibration procedure, the predictions of the SD-750 NN are consistent with the measurement of the depth of the shower maximum obtained by the Fluorescence Detector of the Pierre Auger Observatory.

 - **Abstract**
 We present monitoring observations of quasar microlensing in the quadruple quasar HE0435-1223. The microlensing-induced light curves of the quasar images are chromatic, i.e. they depend on the applied filter band. Comparison with microlensing simulations allows us to infer properties of the accretion disk. We determine the R and V band light curves of the four images of HE0435-1223 from 79 and 80 epochs respectively, taken from 2014 to 2024 at the Las Cumbres Observatory using difference imaging analysis. We consider difference light curves to remove the intrinsic quasar variability. This reveals a prominent long-term chromatic microlensing event in image B. We use microlensing light curve simulations with both Gaussian and standard thin accretion disk brightness profiles to analyse this signal. The particularly strong signal observed in image B of HE0435-1223 makes it possible to detect a size ratio of the accretion disk in the R band compared to the V band of $1.24^{+0.08}_{-0.20}$ and $1.42^{+0.11}_{-0.22}$ for the Gaussian and the thin disk model, respectively. These values are in agreement with standard thin disk theory. For the absolute size we find large disk half-light radii of around 0.7 to 1.0 Einstein radii with an uncertainty of about 0.6 dex (depending on the filter bands and the models). Finally, our calculations show that image B undergoes caustic crossings about once per year.

 - **Abstract**
 We demonstrate a novel beam pattern measurement method for the side lobe characterization of cosmic microwave background telescopes. The method employs a power-variable artificial microwave source under feedback control from the detector under test on the telescope. It enables us to extend the dynamic range of the beam pattern measurement without introducing nonlinearity effects from the detector. We conducted a laboratory-based proof-of-concept experiment, measuring the H-plane beam pattern of a horn antenna coupled to a diode detector at 81 GHz. We achieved a dynamic range of 77.7 dB in the beam pattern measurement, with 60.3 dB attributed to the feedback control. In addition, we verified the measurement by comparing it with other reference measurements obtained using conventional methods. The method is also applicable to general optical measurements requiring a high dynamic range to detect subtle nonidealities in the characteristics of optical devices.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an implementation of Quantum Computing for a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method with an application to cosmological functions, to derive posterior distributions from cosmological probes. The algorithm proposes new steps in the parameter space via a quantum circuit whose resulting statevector provides the components of the shift vector. The proposed point is accepted or rejected via the classical Metropolis-Hastings acceptance method. The advantage of this hybrid quantum approach is that the step size and direction change in a way independent of the evolution of the chain, thus ideally avoiding the presence of local minima. The results are consistent with analyses performed with classical methods, both for a test function and real cosmological data. The final goal is to generalize this algorithm to test its application to complex cosmological computations.

          Impact of rotation on the accretion of entropy perturbations in collapsing massive stars

 - **Abstract**
 Convection in the innermost shells of massive stars plays an important role in initiating core-collapse supernovae. When these convective motions reach the supernova shock, they create extra turbulence, which helps energize the explosion. In our earlier work, we studied the effect of rotation on the hydrodynamic evolution of convective vortices in collapsing stars. This study focuses on how rotation influences the entropy perturbations, which naturally form in turbulent convection. As these perturbations are carried inward with the collapsing star, they generate both vorticity and sound waves. Using linear perturbation theory, we model entropy waves as small disturbances on top of a steady background flow. Our results show that stellar rotation has little effect on the evolution of entropy perturbations during collapse, prior to encountering the supernova shock. This outcome is consistent with our earlier findings on the limited influence of rotation in the accretion of convective eddies.

 We present a comprehensive Bayesian spectral analysis of the black hole X-ray binary 4U 1630-47 during its 2022 outburst, using simultaneous \textit{NICER} and \textit{NuSTAR} observations. Using the traditional frequentist approach, we build our model combining reflection spectroscopy with continuum fitting techniques and analyse the data. In the Bayesian framework, we jointly constrain the black hole's spin, mass, inclination, and distance within a unified framework. Employing nested sampling, we capture parameter degeneracies and rigorously propagate both statistical and systematic uncertainties. Our results yield robust and precise spin measurements from both approaches. Our Bayesian analysis fetches spin $a_*= 0.93_{-0.04}^{+0.05}$, mass $M_{\rm BH} = 9.0_{-2.0}^{+2.0} \, M_\odot$, distance $d_{\rm BH} = 10.5_{-1.2}^{+1.3}$~kpc, and inclination angle $i=53.8_{-1.3}^{+1.3}$~deg. It also demonstrates the power of Bayesian inference in fetching valuable insights into the complex physics of black hole accretion and enabling high-confidence measurements of fundamental parameters.

          Good things come to those who wait: Watching donor stars evolve towards a mass-transfer instability

 - **Abstract**
 Unstable mass transfer in binary systems can lead to transients such as luminous red novae (LRNe). Observations of such transients are valuable for understanding and testing models of mass transfer. For donor stars in the Hertzsprung gap, there can be a long phase of mass-transfer evolution before instability sets in. Only few case studies of such delayed dynamical instability (DDI) mass transfer exist. None consider the full pre-instability evolution and the effects thereof on the observable properties of a binary. We systematically analyse detailed models of stable and unstable mass transfer for Hertzsprung-gap donors. We focus on identifying observable evolutionary features characteristic of ultimately unstable mass transfer and not found in stable mass-transfer binaries. Our binary evolution models, calculated with the MESA code, cover initial donor masses between $2.5 M_{\odot}$ and $10 M_{\odot}$ and initial accretor-to-donor mass ratios between $0.1$ and $1$. We find that the pre-instability evolution is qualitatively the same for all DDI donor stars, consisting of a long slow dimming phase followed by a shorter phase of rapid brightening. The latter phase is powered by recombination of hydrogen and accompanied by a strong increase in effective temperature, unique to unstable mass-transfer binaries. We estimate that a significant fraction of the rapid brighteners should be detectable by Gaia throughout the Galaxy. We model the progenitors of LRNe M31-2015 and V838 Mon, find a higher initial donor mass for M31 2015 than past estimates, and propose a new scenario for V838 Mon in which the known tertiary star dominates the pre-outburst photometry and the outburst results from the DDI of a more massive primary star. This work provides a comprehensive framework linking theory to observations of transients and enables improved classification and prediction of mass-transfer events.

 We wish to confirm the nature of YSES 2b, a purportedly faint companion of the young star YSES 2. We used on-sky observations from SPHERE and GRAVITY to measure the astrometric position of 2b with respect to the star YSES 2, and examined the competing hypotheses of (i) a bound substellar companion versus (ii) a distant unrelated background source with a non-zero proper motion. YSES 2b appears to be a late-type M-dwarf star over 2 kiloparsecs behind the star YSES 2. It has a transverse velocity of about 300 km/s and is located within one of the spiral arms of the Galaxy. The main discriminant was multiple epochs of GRAVITY astrometry that identified the sub-milliarcsecond parallactic motion of the star.

          The simple way to measure evolving dark energy without prior-volume effects

 - **Abstract**
 We present a simple yet effective method to resolve prior-volume effects, also known as projection effects, in full-shape analyses of the power spectrum multipoles within the Effective Field Theory of Large-Scale Structure (EFTofLSS). By re-defining the EFTofLSS nuisance parameters to incorporate the contribution from the parameters impacting the amplitude of the EFTofLSS modelling components, we substantially mitigate projection effects. With the re-parametrisation the actual posterior maximum values are within the marginalised credible interval, eliminating significant shifts observed in the baseline analysis. We demonstrate the robustness of this method in full-shape $w_0w_a$CDM analyses on synthetic data in BOSS DR12 and DESI DR1 setups. For the evolving dark energy model, we then analyse the BOSS DR12 measurements, in combination with BAO information (from BOSS DR12, 6DF, SDSS DR7 MGS and eBOSS DR16 surveys) and 3$\times$2pt measurements from DES Y3 -- all data combinations are converging into the $w_0-w_a$ parameter region preferred by DESI+CMB+SNIa. From total combination of these large-scale structure probes without additional CMB information we find $w_0=-0.72 \pm 0.21, \, w_a=-0.91^{+0.78}_{-0.64}$. Despite the low significance of deviation from standard cosmology, this result underscores the potential of our re-parametrisation approach in delivering low-redshift cosmological constraints. We argue for the use of this approach in spectroscopic Stage IV surveys, where the potential deviation from standard cosmology can be detected with higher significance.

 - **Abstract**
 Astronomical observations at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths heavily depend on the amount of Precipitable Water Vapor (PWV) in the atmosphere, directly affecting the sky transparency and degrading the quality of the signals received by radio telescopes. Predictions of PWV at different forecasting horizons is crucial to support telescope operations, engineering planning, and observational scheduling and efficiency of radio observatories installed in the Chajnantor area in northern Chile. We developed and validated a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) deep learning-based model to predict PWV at forecasting horizons of 12, 24, 36, and 48 hours using historical data from two 183 GHz radiometers and a weather station in the Chajnantor area. We find the LSTM method is able to predict PWV in the 12 and 24 hours forecasting horizons with Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 22% compared to 36% of the traditional Global Forecast System (GFS) method used by Atacama Pathfinder EXperiment (APEX) and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) in mm are reduced by 50%. We present a first application of deep learning techniques for preliminary predictions of PWV in the Chajnantor area. The prediction performance shows significant improvements to traditional methods in 12 and 24 hours time windows. We also propose upgrades to improve our method in short (< 1 hour) and long (> 36 hours) forecasting timescales for future work.

 - **Abstract**
 Recently, the KM3NeT experiment reported the detection of a neutrino with exceptionally high energy E = 220 PeV, whose origin remains unclear. The corresponding value of the neutrino flux is in tension with the results of other high-energy neutrino experiments. In this study, we discuss the possibility that this neutrino is cosmogenic, i. e., produced by ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECR) during their propagation through the intergalactic medium. We adopt the UHECR flux models derived by the Telescope Array experiment, which features a predominantly light mass composition. We show that the predictions of the cosmogenic neutrino flux in these models are consistent with the measurements of the KM3NeT-only and with that of the "global neutrino observatory" at approximately 2${\sigma}$ level. Notably, this result is achieved in a minimal version of the UHECR flux models, that assume one source population with a standard cosmological evolution. We also estimate the corresponding cosmogenic gamma-ray flux and show that it is consistent with Fermi-LAT IGRB measurements and UHE gamma-ray limits; the improvement of the latter can probe these predictions in future.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of a new black-widow millisecond pulsar, PSR J1544-2555, associated with the Fermi-LAT source 4FGL J1544.2-2554. Optical, radio, and gamma-ray observations confirmed its nature as a compact spider binary system. Optical photometry from ULTRACAM revealed a \(\sim\)2.7-hour orbital period, guiding MeerKAT observations that detected \(\sim\)2.4-ms radio pulsations. Subsequent timing campaigns using the Murriyang Parkes Telescope, the Effelsberg 100-m Radio Telescope, and the Nançay Radio Telescope allowed us to obtain a preliminary timing solution, which enabled us to find gamma-ray pulsations. The final timing solution, spanning 16 years of Fermi-LAT gamma-ray data, also displays orbital period variations typical of spider pulsars. X-ray observations from eROSITA indicate non-thermal emission, but the relatively low count rate prohibits the search for X-ray pulsations. Optical light curve modelling using Icarus suggests the asymmetry is best explained by a spot model, where uneven heating creates localised temperature variations on the companion. While the optical spectra we obtained are compatible with the physical properties we infer for the companion star, they were not of sufficient signal-to-noise to allow for radial velocity measurements, thus limiting constraints on the neutron star's mass. The observed bluer colour near the light curve minimum suggests possible non-thermal emission from intra-binary shocks, supported by the presence of an X-ray source. This discovery exemplifies the proven capability of the Fermi-LAT catalogue in identifying millisecond pulsar candidates and highlights the role of optical surveys in detecting variable sources suitable for radio follow-up.

 Some of the most puzzling discoveries of NASA's JWST in the early Universe surround the surprising abundance of compact red sources, which show peculiar continuum shapes and broad hydrogen spectral lines. These sources, dubbed ``Little Red Dots'' or LRDs, have been the subject of intense inquiry in the literature. Any of the proposed explanations, from accreting super-massive black holes ensconced in ultra-dense gas to extremely compact star-systems, has significant implications for the earliest phases of galaxy evolution. Part of the difficulty in concretely identifying the physical mechanisms that drive their rest ultra-violet/optical spectral properties is the lack of bona fide signatures -- either star-formation or accreting super-massive black hole, that uniquely discriminate between competing interpretations. In this work, we report the discovery of several spectral features that strongly favor the existence of an accreting super-massive black hole in an LRD witnessed in the first 800 Myr of cosmic time, including several rare iron transitions and a possible [FeVII]. Additionally, we report on the properties of significant Balmer absorption and find that the small widths and relative depths of the absorption feature suggest the source of the absorber is at or beyond the outer edge of the broad-line region and does it fully cover the accreting SMBH in the center of the system. The detection of these iron features, coupled with the properties of the Balmer absorption, unveils an alternative scenario for LRDs -- one where there are direct sight-lines from the accretion disk to gas on scales at (or beyond) the broad-line gas region.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the trispectrum in a two-phase USR-SR setup of inflation in which the USR stage is extended in the initial phase of inflation while the second stage of inflation proceeds via a slow-roll phase. A key role is played by the sharpness parameter which controls how quickly the system reaches the final attractor phase after the USR stage. We employ both $\delta N$ and in-in formalisms and calculate trispectrum and the corresponding dimensionless parameters $g_{NL}$ and $\tau_{NL}$. We show that both approaches yield the same results and study the shapes of trispectrum in various configurations. It is shown that the maximum value of trispectrum occurs in the setup with an infinitely sharp transition to the attractor phase while much of trispectrum is washed out in the opposite limit of a mild transition.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent experiments have measured the Galactic $\gamma$-ray diffuse emission up to PeV energies, opening a window to study acceleration of Galactic cosmic rays and their propagation up to the cosmic-ray knee. Furthermore, these observations provide a powerful tool to set strong constraints into very-heavy dark matter particles, with masses in the TeV-PeV range. In this paper, we explore the potential of the newest observations of diffuse emissions at the Galactic plane from HAWC and LHAASO to probe this kind of dark matter over a wide mass range. Here, we model secondary emissions (inverse-Compton) from the electrons and positrons produced in the annihilation/decay of dark matter, on top of their prompt $\gamma$-ray emission, including the effects of absorption of high-energy photons via pair production. Furthermore, we show that including the astrophysical backgrounds (namely diffuse emission from cosmic-ray collisions or emission from unresolved sources) can significantly improve these limits. We find that the new measurements provided, specially by LHAASO with the combination of the WCDA and KM2A detectors, allow us to set strong constraints in decaying dark matter, being competitive and even improving the strongest constraints at the moment. We also highlight that these regions lead to constraints that are less affected by uncertainties from the dark matter distribution and discuss how CTA north and SWGO will be able to improve limits in this mass range.

 - **Abstract**
 JWST NIRCam and MIRI photometry of NGC 602, a low-metallicity young star cluster in the Small Magellanic Cloud, reveals an extended mid-infrared bright emission feature designated as MZS-1. This feature is prominent between 10 and 25.5 microns, but is extremely faint at 7.7 microns and entirely undetected at shorter wavelengths. MZS-1 exhibits an elliptical morphology with a major axis of approximately 8 arcseconds and a minor axis of about 4 arcseconds. Its elongated shape and multiple emission peaks in the two-dimensional flux map suggest a group of deeply embedded sources with blackbody-like temperatures ranging from 100 K to 140 K. SED fitting using the Robitaille 2017 model grids identifies these sources as Stage I young stellar objects (YSOs) with masses below approximately 3 solar masses and a total stellar mass of the protocluster of about 300 solar masses (based on a Salpeter IMF). The low YSO masses are consistent with their absence in Spitzer-based catalogs due to sensitivity limits. By revealing a deeply embedded, low-mass protocluster invisible in previous surveys, this work highlights JWST's unparalleled resolution and sensitivity in uncovering the earliest stages of low-mass cluster formation in the metal-poor regime.

 - **Abstract**
 Noise subtraction is a crucial process in gravitational wave (GW) data analysis to improve the sensitivity of interferometric detectors. While linear noise coupling has been extensively studied and successfully mitigated using methods such as Wiener filtering, subtraction of non-linearly coupled and non-stationary noise remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose a novel independent component analysis (ICA)-based framework designed to address non-linear coupling in noise subtraction. Building upon previous developments, we derive a method to estimate general quadratic noise coupling while maintaining computational transparency compared to machine learning approaches. The proposed method is tested with simulated data and real GW strain data from KAGRA. Our results demonstrate the potential of this framework to effectively mitigate complex noise structures, providing a promising avenue for improving the sensitivity of GW detectors.

 - **Abstract**
 Despite their importance, the dynamical properties of massive stars remain poorly understood. Rotation is a key driver of internal mixing and angular momentum transport, significantly influencing massive star evolution. However, constraining rotation from spectroscopy is challenging, as spectral lines often exhibit excess broadening beyond rotation. The origin of this additional broadening, typically attributed to large-scale velocity fields and commonly referred to as macroturbulence, remains uncertain and unconstrained. Here, we present the combined analysis of TESS photometry and rapid time-series spectroscopy using the high-resolution ESPRESSO instrument at the Very Large Telescope of the European Southern Observatory for the rapidly rotating and pulsating massive star Zeta Ophiuchi. Leveraging excellent temporal coverage, our analysis demonstrates that pulsation-induced variability leads to peak-to-peak scatter as large as 88 km/s in the observed macroturbulent velocity time series. We also demonstrate that time-averaged macroturbulent velocities are spectral line specific and can exceed 100 km/s . Furthermore, the macroturbulent velocities from shorter integration times are systematically lower than those derived from stacked spectra mimicking longer exposure times typically needed for fainter stars. These results highlight the role of pulsations in driving variable macroturbulence in massive stars, while also pointing to a potential bias in spectroscopic estimates of macroturbulence for fainter massive stars.

 - **Abstract**
 The Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST), the world's largest single-dish radio telescope, lists the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) as one of its key scientific objectives. In this work, we present a targeted SETI observation for 7 nearby active stars utilizing the FAST L-band multibeam receiver, employing a observational strategy that combines position switching with multibeam tracking to balance on-source integration time with the accuracy of the beam response. Using both pulsar and SETI backends, we perform a comprehensive search for narrowband drifting signals with Doppler drift rates within $\pm 4 \ \mathrm{Hz\ s^{-1}}$ and channel-width periodic signal with periods between 0.12 and 100 s and duty cycles between 10\% and 50\%. No credible radio technosignatures were detected from any of the target systems. Based on this null result, we place constraints on the presence of transmitters at a 95\% confidence level, ruling out narrowband transmitters with with EIRP above $3.98\times10^8 \,\mathrm{W}$ and periodic transmitter with EIRP above $1.80\times10^{10} \,\mathrm{W}$,respectively, within the observation band.

 - **Abstract**
 We extend field-level inference to jointly constrain the cosmological parameters $\{A,\omega_{\rm cdm},H_0\}$, in both real and redshift space. Our analyses are based on mock data generated using a perturbative forward model, with noise drawn from a Gaussian distribution with a constant power spectrum. This idealized setting, where the field-level likelihood is exactly Gaussian, allows us to precisely quantify the information content in the nonlinear field on large scales. We find that field-level inference accurately recovers all cosmological parameters in both real and redshift space, with uncertainties consistent with perturbation theory expectations. We show that these error bars are comparable to those obtained from a joint power spectrum and bispectrum analysis using the same perturbative model. Finally, we perform several tests using the Gaussian field-level likelihood to fit the mock data where the true noise model is non-Gaussian, and find significant biases in the inferred cosmological parameters. These results highlight that the success of field-level inference critically depends on using the correct likelihood, which may be the primary challenge for applying this method to smaller scales even in the perturbative regime.

          Cosmic $τ$ensions Indirectly Correlate with Reionization Optical Depth

 - **Abstract**
 The reionization optical depth $\tau_{\rm reio}$ has interesting connections to existing cosmological anomalies. As first studied in the context of the Hubble tension in our previous paper, a larger $\tau_{\rm reio}$, which could be achieved by removing the Planck low-$\ell$ polarization data, could boost $H_0$ slightly, resulting in a mild reduction of the tension between the early- and late-universe determinations of $H_0$. It has been shown later that a larger $\tau_{\rm reio}$ could also relieve other anomalies including: the tension between BAO and CMB data, the neutrino mass tension, and the latest DESI plus supernovae data's tension with the standard cosmological constant scenario. In this paper, we systematically analyze the correlations between $\tau_{\rm reio}$ and relevant cosmological parameters in the existing cosmic observation anomalies. In addition to Pearson correlation coefficients extracted directly from the covariance matrix, we also study partial correlation coefficients which measure intrinsic relationships between pairs of parameters removing the influence of other parameters. We show that $\tau_{\rm reio}$ has weak intrinsic correlations with the parameters responsible for the tensions and anomalies discussed. The large direct Pearson correlations that allow larger $\tau_{\rm reio}$ inferences to alleviate the cosmological tensions each arise from complicated networks through multiple parameters. As a result, the relationships between $\tau_{\rm reio}$ and each anomaly are not independent of each other. We also employ our method of computing correlations to clarify the impact of large scale polarization data, and comment also on the effects of CMB observations from ACT and SPT.

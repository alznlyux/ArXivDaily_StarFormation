- **Abstract**
 In this work, we explore in a consistent fashion the effects of fast flavor conversion (FFC) in 1D and 2D core-collapse supernova (CCSN) simulations. In addition, we investigate the impact of various angular reconstruction methods and compare the ``3-species'' and ``4-species'' neutrino transport schemes. We find that the FFC effects are insensitive to the different methods tested and that the FFC alters supernova hydrodynamics is only minor ways. We also present a ``quasi-equipartition'' approximation which can be used to estimate the FFC-altered neutrino properties by post-processing the neutrino signals extracted from no-oscillation CCSN simulations. The relative errors in neutrino number and energy luminosities of this phenomenological method are less than 2\% for 1D models, and less than 10\% for 2D models. This method provides a simple way to include the effects of FFC on neutrino signals without implementing a complex and expensive FFC scheme or redoing simulations.

- **Abstract**
 Protoplanetary disks are an essential component of the planet-formation process. The amount of dust and gas in the disk constrains the number and size of planets that can form in a system. We analyze 178 T-Tauri stars, 18 in Serpens and 160 in L1641/L1647, and measure their disk dust masses using spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling and multiwavelength data, including 1.3 mm (ALMA band 6) fluxes from the literature. The disk masses calculated in this work are up to $\sim$2 times higher than those previously reported. We conclude that this is because disks may be partially optically thick at millimeter wavelengths while most calculations of the disk mass assume that the disk is optically thin at 1.3 mm. We calculate optical depths at 1.3 and 7 mm for a subset of the Serpens and L1641/L1647 disk sample and show that the vast majority of disks become optically thin at longer millimeter wavelengths; thus, observations at 7 mm (i.e., ALMA band 1) are vital to better characterize disk dust masses.

- **Abstract**
 We report the detection of methanol (CH$_3$OH) toward interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS using the Atacama Compact Array of the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) on UT 2025 August 28, September 18 and 22, and October 1, and of hydrogen cyanide (HCN) on September 12 and 15. These observations spanned pre-perihelion heliocentric distances ($r_H$) of 2.6 -- 1.7 au. The molecules showed outgassing patterns distinct from one another, with HCN production being depleted in the sunward hemisphere of the coma, whereas CH$_3$OH was enhanced in that direction. Statistical analysis of molecular scale lengths in 3I/ATLAS indicated that CH$_3$OH included production from coma sources at $L_p>258$ km at 99% confidence, although low signal-to-noise on long baselines prevented definitively ruling out CH$_3$OH as purely a parent species. In contrast, HCN production was indistinguishable from direct nucleus sublimation. The CH$_3$OH production rate increased sharply from August through October, including an uptick near the inner edge of the H$_2$O sublimation zone at $r_H$ = 2 au. Compared to comets measured to date at radio wavelengths, the derived CH$_3$OH/HCN ratios in 3I/ATLAS of $124^{+30}_{-34}$ and $79^{+11}_{-14}$ on September 12 and 15, respectively, are among the most enriched values measured in any comet, surpassed only by anomalous solar system comet C/2016 R2 (PanSTARRS).

- **Abstract**
 The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission has observed hundreds of millions of stars, substantially contributing to the available pool of high-precision photometric space data. Among them are the relatively rare $\gamma$ Doradus / $\delta$ Scuti ($\gamma$ Dor / $\delta$ Sct) hybrid pulsators, which have been previously studied using Kepler data. These stars are perfect laboratories to probe both inner and outer interior stellar layers thanks to them exhibiting both pressure and gravity modes. We seek to classify an all-sky sample of AF stars observed by TESS to find previously undiscovered hybrid pulsators and supply them in a catalogue of candidates. We also aim to compare the light curves produced with the TESS-Gaia Light Curve (TGLC) pipeline, currently underused in variability studies, with other publicly available light curves. We compared dominant and secondary frequencies of confirmed hybrid pulsators in Kepler, extended mission Quick Look Pipeline (QLP) data, and nominal and extended mission TGLC data. We then used a feature-based positive unlabelled (PU) learning classifier to search for new hybrid pulsators amongst TESS AF stars and investigated the properties of the detected populations. We find that the variability of confirmed hybrids in TGLC agrees well with the one occurring in QLP light curves and has a high recovery rate of \kepler-extracted frequencies. Our `smart binning' method allows for robust extraction of hybrids from large unlabelled datasets, with an average out-of-bag prediction for test set hybrids at 93.04\%. The analysis of dominant frequencies in high-probability candidates shows that we find more pressure-mode dominant hybrids. Our catalogue includes 62,026 new candidate light curves from the nominal and extended TESS missions, with individual probabilities of being a hybrid in each available sector.

- **Abstract**
 Studying cold brown dwarfs is key to understanding the diverse characteristics of cold giant exoplanets atmospheres. COCONUTS-2, is a wide binary system composed of a T9 brown dwarf and an M3 star, which presents a unique opportunity to characterize a cold benchmark brown dwarf. As part of a JWST program to study the range of physical and atmospheric properties of the coldest brown dwarfs, we obtained NIRSpec G395H spectra (R~2700, 2.87-5.13 um) and MIRI F1000W, F1280W, and F1800W photometry for COCONUTS-2b. In this work, we find a 99% probability of the system belonging to the Corona of Ursa Major (414+/-23 Myr) using BANYAN Sigma and its full kinematics. We also re-estimate the astrometry of COCONUTS-2b using the MIRI data. We support the membership with a comparison of rotation period, metallicity and C/O ratio of the group with those of the COCONUTS-2 system. We also calculate its bolometric luminosity, which combined with our age estimation, allows us to derive its mass, effective temperature, surface gravity, and radius with high precision. As a result of our analysis, we support the conclusion that COCONUTS-2b is a planetary mass object (7.5+/-0.4 MJup) which was likely formed via the same mechanism as stars. In addition we compare the JWST spectrum to another object in the sample, J082507.35+280548.5 (0825+2805), a Y0.5 brown dwarf, which is a candidate member of the same moving group, but has a lower mass (3.7+/-0.2 MJup). We identify absorption feature differences which could indicate that 0825+2805 has stronger vertical mixing.

          High-order Gravity-mode Period Spacing Patterns of Intermediate-mass ($1.5 \, M_\odot < M < 3 \, M_{\odot}$) Main-sequence Stars I. Perturbative Analysis

- **Abstract**
 Theoretical study of high-order gravity-mode period spacing ($\Delta P_g$) pattern is relevant for the better understanding of internal properties of intermediate-mass ($1.5 \, M_\odot < M < 8 \, M_{\odot}$) main-sequence g-mode pulsators. In this paper, we carry out the first-order perturbative analysis to evaluate effects of a sharp, though not discontinuous, transition in the Brunt-Väisälä (BV) frequency on the $\Delta P_g$ pattern. Such a finite-width transition in the BV frequency, whose scale height can be comparable to the local wavelength of gravity waves, is expected to develop in relatively low-mass ($1.5 \, M_\odot < M < 3 \, M_{\odot}$) main-sequence stars, causing a bump in the second derivative of the BV frequency. Inspired by Unno et al.'s formulation, we treat the bump in the second derivative of the BV frequency as a small perturbation, which allows us to derive an analytical expression of the $\Delta P_g$ pattern. The analytical expression shows that the amplitude of the oscillatory $\Delta P_g$ pattern is determined by a weighted average of the bump in the second derivative of the BV frequency where the weighting function is given by the g-mode eigenfunction. Tests with low-mass ($\sim 2 \, M_\odot$) main-sequence stellar models show that the analytical expression can reproduce the $\Delta P_g$ patterns numerically computed reasonably well. The results of our perturbative analysis will be useful for, e.g., improving semi-analytical expressions of the $\Delta P_g$ pattern, which would enable us to investigate $\Delta P_g$ patterns of SPB stars and $\gamma$ Dor stars for inferring chemical composition profile and rotation rates.

- **Abstract**
 The Deep Extragalactic VIsible Legacy Survey (DEVILS) is a deep, high-completeness multi-wavelength survey based around spectroscopic observations using the Anglo-Australian Telescope's AAOmega spectrograph. The survey covers $\sim4.5$deg$^{2}$ over three extragalactic fields to Y$_{AB}<21.2$mag and probes sources at $0<z<1.2$, with a median redshift of $z=0.53$. Here we describe the DEVILS spectroscopic observations, data reduction and redshift analysis. We then describe and release to the community all DEVILS data in the 10h (D10, COSMOS) region including: i) catalogues of redshifts, photometry, SED fitting for physical properties, visual morphologies, structural decompositions and group environments/halo masses, ii) matched imaging in 28 bands from x-rays to radio continuum, and iii) reduced 1D spectra. All data are made publicly available through Data Central. Within D10 we obtain 5,442 new high-quality spectroscopic redshifts. When combined with existing, lower-quality, redshift information ($i.e.$ photometric redshifts) this is increased to 7,946. Of these, 3,122 have a spectroscopic redshift from another source (many that was not available at the time of the DEVILS observations). As such, DEVILS provides new unique high-quality spectroscopic redshifts for 4,824 faint sources in COSMOS. This increases the spectroscopic completeness at Y-mag$\sim$21 from $\sim$50% in other samples to $\sim$90% in DEVILS. Finally, we show the power of this dataset by exploring the suppression of star formation in over-dense environments, split by morphology and stellar mass, and highlighting the ubiquitous nature of environmental quenching.

- **Abstract**
 We report a narrowband technosignature search toward five Milky Way globular clusters (NGC 6171, NGC 6218, NGC 6254, NGC 6838, and IC 1276) using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) 19-beam L-band receiver (1.05-1.45 GHz). We adapt the MultiBeam Point-source Scanning (MBPS) strategy to extended targets by gating detections to generalized on-target windows (gOTWs), i.e. the time intervals when a beam main lobe intersects a buffered cluster mask, and by enforcing the deterministic multibeam illumination sequence as a geometry test. Dynamic spectra with frequency resolution about 7.5 Hz and time resolution about 10 s are searched with turboSETI over drift rates |nu_dot| <= 4 Hz s^-1 at signal-to-noise ratio S/N >= 10. From about 2.75e5 raw hits across both linear polarizations, none survive the gOTW gating, array-wide simultaneity veto, in-stripe ordering, and single-drift coherence checks, yielding a robust null result. With system equivalent flux density SEFD about 1.5 Jy and an effective 60 s per illuminated crossing, our per-crossing flux density threshold is S_min about 0.50 Jy, corresponding to minimum isotropic-equivalent radiated power EIRP_min in the range (0.72-1.8)e16 W for cluster distances 4-6.5 kpc; when multiple illuminated crossings occur, non-coherent stacking improves sensitivity by up to sqrt(N). To our knowledge this is the first FAST technosignature survey dedicated to globular clusters and the first to use MBPS as the primary observing strategy. These limits disfavor bright, persistent, isotropic L-band beacons above the stated thresholds during our epochs and establish a scalable blueprint, based on geometry-aware gating and verification, for multi-epoch MBPS campaigns that expand signal morphologies and combine passes to deepen constraints on transmitters in dense stellar systems.

- **Abstract**
 Current-day multi-object spectroscopic surveys are often limited in their ability to observe bright stars due to their low surface densities, resulting in increased observational overheads and reduced efficiency. Addressing this, we have developed a novel observing mode for WEAVE (William Herschel Telescope Enhanced Area Velocity Explorer) that enables efficient observations of low-surface-density target fields without incurring additional overheads from calibration exposures. As a pilot for the new mode, we introduce the WEAVE-TwiLight-Survey (WTLS), focusing on bright exoplanet-host stars and their immediate surroundings on the sky. High observational efficiency is achieved by superimposing multiple low-target-density fields and allocating the optical fibres in this configuration. We use a heuristic method to define fields relative to a central guide star, which serves as a reference for their superposition. Suitable guide fibres for each merged configuration are selected using a custom algorithm. Test observations have been carried out, demonstrating the feasibility of the new observing mode. We show that merged field configurations can be observed with WEAVE using the proposed method. The approach minimizes calibration times and opens twilight hours to WEAVE's operational schedule. WTLS is built upon the new observing mode and sourced from the ESA PLATO long-duration-phase fields. This survey will result in a homogeneous catalogue of approximately 6300 bright stars, including 62 known planet hosts, laying the groundwork for future elemental abundance studies tracing chemical patterns of planetary formation. This new observing mode (WEAVE-Tumble-Less) expands WEAVE's capabilities to rarely used on-sky time and low-density field configurations without sacrificing efficiency.

- **Abstract**
 The stellar origin of the elements molybdenum (Mo, Z=42) and ruthenium (Ru, Z=44) is still a matter of debate. Studying their abundances provides valuable insights into nucleosynthesis processes and the broader evolution of neutron-capture elements. We presented new observations of Mo and Ru, together with nearby neutron-capture elements strontium (Sr) and zirconium (Zr) for a new sample of 154 giant stars, located in the Galactic disk with metallicities -1 < [Fe/H] < +0.3. The abundances were determined under the assumption of the local thermodynamic equilibrium by fitting synthetic spectra. The abundances of Mo were derived from the Mo I lines at 5506 and 5533 A, the abundances of Ru were determined from Ru I lines at 4584, and 4757 A. For most of the giant stars observed in this work, Mo and Ru abundances were determined for the first time. We compare our observations with the signatures from different nucleosynthesis processes. Both the [Mo/Fe] and [Ru/Fe] in our stars show a decreasing trend with respect to increasing [Fe/H]. This pattern is similar to that of [Zr/Fe], whereas [Sr/Fe] exhibits a relatively flat trend with metallicity. Compared to the s-process ratios, all stars show a lower [Zr/Mo] and a higher [Ru/Mo], as expected from classical nucleosynthesis. Still, it is unclear if additional contributions from neutrino-wind components or the i-process is needed to explain the observed scatter of [Zr/Mo] and [Ru/Mo] in the Milky Way disk. Indeed, such a dispersion is consistent with the variations also seen in r-II stars at low metallicity and could therefore result from the combined contributions of r-process and s-process to galactic chemical evolution. The observed [Zr/Mo] and [Ru/Mo] scatter in r-II stars should be constrained by future investigations to define if any contributions of additional nucleosynthesis components are needed.

          Resonance locking and tidal evolution in rotating γ-Doradus binaries

- **Abstract**
 In binary systems, studying tidal interactions is key to understanding the evolution of binary populations. The primary dissipation process occurring in stars with radiative envelopes is believed to be radiative damping of high-radial-order tidally excited oscillations, which is in agreement with observations of most binary systems. However, recent studies have suggested that outside this dissipation regime, dynamical tides can act in the opposite manner (a phenomenon known as inverse tides), and resonance locking could significantly impact the orbital evolution of binary systems. We aim to study inverse tides and resonance locking by simultaneously including the effect of all the forcing frequencies and accounting for the effect of the rotation on the forced oscillations. We have developed an orbital evolution code that is coupled to a stellar oscillation code to compute on the fly the impact of dynamical tides on the rotational and orbital evolution of binary systems including multiple simultaneous forcing frequencies. We find that resonance locking can be stable over a long period of time and a source of long-term exchange of angular momentum for rapidly rotating stars. Long-term locking can increase the total angular momentum of a fast-rotating star by approximately 70% during the main sequence. For slow-rotating stars, resonance locking can slow down the rotational evolution of the system over most of the main-sequence phase, even in the presence of strong tidal interactions. This mechanism efficiently drives asynchronisation in binary systems where significant discrepancies already exist between the orbital and rotational frequencies.

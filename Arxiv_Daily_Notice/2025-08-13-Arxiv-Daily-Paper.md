 - **Abstract**
 Astrophysical high-energy (TeV-PeV) neutrinos were first discovered in 2013, but their origin remains largely unknown. Here we present SN 2023uqf, a supernova found in coincidence with high-energy neutrino IC231004A, as part of a systematic optical follow-up program with the Zwicky Transient Facility. SN 2023uqf had a luminous and rapidly-evolving lightcurve, and spectroscopic observations indicated that the source was a Type Ibn supernova. Spectroscopic signatures confirm ongoing interaction between the supernova ejecta and a dense circumstellar medium, as expected for high-energy neutrino production in a core-collapse supernova. Given the rare nature of Type Ibn supernovae, SN 2023uqf is unlikely to have been discovered by chance over the course of our program (p=0.3%). Our discovery of SN 2023uqf provides the first observational evidence to support long-held theories that interacting supernovae can serve as cosmic hadron accelerators.

          Milky Way's Metal-Poor Stars display Chemical Transition near the Solar Radius

 - **Abstract**
 The metal-poor stars of a galaxy offer insights into that galaxy's early formation processes and accretion history. Here, we investigate whether the metal-poor stars of our Milky Way galaxy exhibit any characteristic trends in Galactocentric distance versus chemical abundances -- i.e. in the space of $r_{\rm GC}$ vs. [Fe/H] and $r_{\rm GC}$ vs. [X/Fe] -- and if yes, then what is their implication for Galaxy formation. We combine the datasets of APOGEE DR17 and $\textit{Gaia}$ DR3, where the former provides stellar abundances and the latter provides stellar parallaxes. We analyze bright ($G<13$) and metal-poor ([Fe/H]$<-1.2$) stars located far from the disk ($|z|\geq1$ kpc), and explore a total of $19$ abundances. We find that $9$ different abundances exhibit a drastic transition in their distribution near the Solar radius $r_{\rm GC}=8$ kpc. This trend is very unlikely to be related to radial migration, as our metal-poor sample does not contain any disk star. We also analyze the Gaia-Sausage/Enceladus stars, which is a dominant metal-poor population of the Galaxy, and find that it alone cannot account for this trend. This suggests that the Milky Way's metal-poor populations inside and outside the Solar radius likely originated from distinct chemical enrichment scenarios and formation processes.

          White dwarfs in wide binaries: the strong effects of stellar evolution and mass loss

 - **Abstract**
 We examine the statistics of main-sequence / main-sequence, main-sequence / white-dwarf and white-dwarf / white-dwarf wide binaries at 10^2.5-10^4 AU separations in Gaia data. For binaries containing a white dwarf, we find a complex dependence of the wide binary fraction on the white dwarf mass, including a steep decline as a function of mass at >0.6Msun. Furthermore, we find that wide binaries containing white dwarfs have significantly lower eccentricities than main-sequence binaries at the same separations. To model these observations, we compute the effects of post-main-sequence mass loss on the orbital parameters of wide binaries in all regimes of timescales, from secular to impulsive, and incorporate this dynamics in a population synthesis model. We find that adiabatic expansion of the orbits in binaries with slow enough evolutionary processes is the most likely explanation for the puzzling eccentricity distribution of white dwarf wide binaries. The steeply declining white dwarf binary fraction as a function of mass requires that the timescale for mass loss must be significantly shorter for high-mass stars (10^3-10^4 years) than for the low-mass ones. We confirm previous studies that suggested that recoil in the range 0.25-4 km/s is required to explain the observed distribution of separations of white dwarf wide binaries. Finally, for low-mass white dwarfs (<0.5Msun), we see interesting signatures of their formation due to close binary evolution in their wide binary statistics. Our observations and modeling provide a novel dynamical constraint on the mass-loss stages of stellar evolution that are difficult to probe with direct observations.

 - **Abstract**
 In Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) data analysis, noise is typically assumed to be Gaussian, and the marginalized likelihood has a well-established analytical form derived within the framework of Gaussian processes. However, this Gaussianity assumption may break down for certain classes of astrophysical and cosmological signals, particularly for a gravitational wave background (GWB) generated by a population of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs). In this work, we present a new method for testing the presence of non-Gaussian features in PTA data. We go beyond the Gaussian assumption by modeling the noise or signal statistics using a Gaussian mixture model (GMM). An advantage of this approach is that the marginalization of the likelihood remains fully analytical, expressed as a linear combination of Gaussian PTA likelihoods. This makes the method straightforward to implement within existing data analysis tools. Moreover, this method extends beyond the free spectrum analysis by producing posterior probability distributions of higher-order moments inferred from the data, which can be incorporated into spectral refitting techniques. We validate the model using simulations and demonstrate the sensitivity of PTAs to non-Gaussianity by computing the Bayes factor in favor of the GMM as a function of the injected excess moments. We apply the method to a more astrophysically motivated scenario where a single SMBHB is resolved on top of a Gaussian GWB and show that significant non-Gaussianities are introduced by the individual source. Finally, we test our model on a realistic GWB generated from a simulated population of SMBHBs.

          Orbits and Masses for 156 Companions from Combined Astrometry and Radial Velocities, and A Validation of Gaia Non-Single Star Solutions

 - **Abstract**
 We combine absolute astrometry from Hipparcos and Gaia with archival radial velocities from the Keck/HIRES and ESO/HARPS spectrographs, as well as relative astrometry (when available), to derive masses and orbits for 156 companions around main-sequence stars, including 111 stellar companions, 12 brown dwarfs, and 33 planets. Although this sample is not compiled for occurrence-rate statistics due to systematic biases in non-uniform target selection and varied observing strategies, we nonetheless clearly detect the Brown Dwarf desert in the distribution of companion masses (as well as in mass ratio), out to separations of more than 10 AU. This work also enables a validation of Gaia DR3 non-single-star solutions by predicting Gaia's measured Right Ascension and Declination acceleration terms. For stars with Gaia astrometric acceleration solutions, we find qualitative agreement with Gaia DR3 results. Our predicted accelerations agree with the Gaia DR3 values overall, showing a median offset of 1.85 sigma, with a tail extending to about 10 sigma. These residuals suggest modestly underestimated uncertainties, broadly consistent with previous results for parallaxes and proper motions. Three of our systems have full Gaia orbital fits; however, their true orbital periods are long and all three Gaia solutions are spurious. Gaia DR4 will provide individual astrometric measurements and enable more detailed and extensive investigations of accelerating and orbital fits.

          Hot Jupiter formation in dense stellar clusters: A Monte Carlo model applied to 47 Tucanae

 - **Abstract**
 We study the efficiency of high-e migration as a pathway for Hot Jupiter formation in the dense globular cluster 47 Tuc. Gravitational N-body simulations are performed to investigate the orbital evolution of star-planet systems due to dynamical stellar perturbations. Planetary systems that have been scattered into orbits of sufficiently high eccentricity can undergo tidal circularisation, with Hot Jupiter formation being one possible stopping condition. We also account for the possibility of (i) ionisation due to high-energy encounters, (ii) tidal disruption of the planet by tidal forces inside the Roche limit and (iii) Warm Jupiter formation. The orbital evolution of a population of cold Jupiter progenitors, with initial semi-major axes between 1-30 au, is simulated over 12 Gyr using a simplified dynamical model of 47 Tuc. Our computational treatment of dynamical encounters yields an overall HJ occurrence rate of F_HJ = 5.9 x 10^-4 per cluster star (a 51 per cent enhancement relative to the analytic baseline). The probability of Hot Jupiter formation is highest in the core and falls off steeply beyond a few parsecs from the centre of the cluster, where the stellar density is too low to drive efficient eccentricity diffusion.

          Statistical significance of meteorite-asteroid pairs using geocentric parameters

 - **Abstract**
 Aims. We will test the statistical significance of meteorite-dropping fireballs and NEA clustering using the DN similarity function based on four geocentric quantities (U, theta, phi, and lambda). Methods. We calculated the cumulative similarity found between 46 meteorite falls, 535 potential meteorite-dropping fireballs, 20,516 NEAs maintained by NEODyS-2, along with 34,836 NEAs maintained by NASA/JPL HORIZONS. Statistical significance was estimated by either: (1) Kernel Density Estimation-based method to estimate the sporadic background distribution to draw random samples, or (2) applying a uniform random solar longitude (lambda). Each comparison to the synthetic sporadic population is repeated to estimate the 3-sigma region for which the cumulative similarity distribution is consistent with random association levels. Results. The observed DN cumulative similarity distribution between 46 instrumentally observed meteorite falls, 535 potential meteorite-dropping fireballs, and over 30k NEAs radiants (estimated using 6 different radiant methods) reveals no statistically significant excess of similarity between the populations consistent with streams. Conclusions. Based on nearly 600 fireball observations, there is no statistically significant clustering between meteorite falls and NEAs using geocentric impact parameters. If some meteorites arrive in streams, they make up less than ~0.1% of all falls. Recent asteroid or meteoroid physical processes could still explain features found in meteorites, but this activity is not producing distinguishable orbital streams or pairs.

          Strict limits on potential secondary atmospheres on the temperate rocky exo-Earth TRAPPIST-1 d

 - **Abstract**
 The nearby TRAPPIST-1 system, with its seven small rocky planets orbiting a late-type M8 star, offers an unprecedented opportunity to search for secondary atmospheres on temperate terrestrial worlds. In particular, the 0.8 Earth-radii planet TRAPPIST-1 d lies at the edge of the habitable zone (equilibrium temperature ~262 K). Here we present the first 0.6-5.2 micron NIRSpec/PRISM transmission spectrum of TRAPPIST-1 d from two transits with JWST. We find that stellar contamination from unocculted bright heterogeneities introduces 500-1,000 ppm visit-dependent slopes, consistent with constraints from the out-of-transit stellar spectrum. Once corrected, the transmission spectrum is flat within $\pm$100-150 ppm, showing no evidence for a haze-like slope or molecular absorption despite NIRSpec/PRISM's sensitivity to CH4, H2O, CO, SO2, and CO2. Our observations exclude clear, hydrogen-dominated atmospheres with high confidence (greater than 3$\sigma$). We leverage our constraints on even trace amounts of CH4, H2O, and CO2 to further reject high mean molecular weight compositions analogous to Titan, a cloud-free Venus, early Mars, and both Archean Earth and a cloud-free modern Earth scenario (greater than 95% confidence). If TRAPPIST-1 d retains an atmosphere, it is likely extremely thin or contains high-altitude aerosols, with water cloud formation at the terminator predicted by 3D global climate models. Alternatively, if TRAPPIST-1 d is airless, our evolutionary models indicate that TRAPPIST-1 b, c, and d must have formed with less than approximately 4 Earth oceans of water, though this would not preclude atmospheres on the cooler habitable-zone planets TRAPPIST-1 e, f, and g.

          Evolution of linear matter perturbations with error-bounded bundle physics-informed neural networks

 - **Abstract**
 We consider the evolution of linear matter perturbations in the context of the standard cosmological model ($\Lambda$CDM) and a phenomenological modified gravity model. We use the physics-informed neural network (PINN) bundle method, which allows to integrate differential systems as an alternative to the traditional numerical method. We apply the PINN bundle method to the equation that describes the matter perturbation evolution, to compare its outcomes with recent data on structure growth, $f\sigma_8$. Unlike our previous works, we can calculate a bound on the error of this observable without using the numerical solution of the equation. For this, we use a method developed previously by ourselves to calculate an exact bound on the PINN-based solution using only the outcomes of the network and its residual. On the other hand, the use of an updated data set allows us to obtain more stringent constraints on the plane $\Omega_m-\sigma_8$ than previous works.

 - **Abstract**
 Moment-based estimation filters have successfully aided spacecraft navigation for decades. However, future missions plan to venture into deep-space regimes with significant round-trip light-time telecommunication delays, operate in unstable, quasi-periodic orbits, and perform highly precise, low-altitude flybys of outer planet moons. These complex trajectories may necessitate ensemble-based filters for accurate estimation over realistic measurement cadences. To mitigate the inherent risk associated with testing novel navigation software, ensemble filters must be accurate, efficient, and robust. Grid-based, Bayesian Estimation Exploiting Sparsity, a high-dimensional Godunov-type finite volume method that propagates the full probability distribution function, demonstrates strong overall performance across all these criteria when compared with the contemporary landscape of filters. These qualities are exhibited via a Bayesian investigation in which the state uncertainty of a Saturn-Enceladus Distant Prograde Orbit is propagated, incorporating infrequent, nonlinear measurement updates. Along with root mean square error, we use the Bhattacharyya coefficient, a non-normal metric for measuring the dissimilarity between distributions, and the Effective Sampling Size, a measure of particle degeneracy, to quantitatively ascertain that in this application, Grid-based, Bayesian Estimation Exploiting Sparsity outperforms the other ensemble filters assessed, though it comes at a nontrivial computational cost.

 - **Abstract**
 We present observations of \epseri~with the JWST/NIRCam coronagraph aimed at imaging planets orbiting within this system. In particular, these observations targeted (1) the Jupiter-like planet, first detected orbiting at 3.5 AU with radial velocity observations, and (2) the planet postulated to be responsible for carving the edges of \epseri's outer ring, expected to orbit at 40-50 AU. However, no point sources were detected at a statistically significant level. We report new, improved upper limits at 4 $\mu$m: $\sim$1e-7~contrast at 1\arcsec, and $\sim$2e-8~beyond 5\arcsec. The latter contrast limit precludes Saturn-mass planets at separations $>$16~AU given current models. We also report upper limits for \epseri's disk emission at 4 $\mu$m. While the radial surface brightness profile shows no evidence of emission, we detect a 1-$\sigma$ surface brightness signal on the east side of the system, consistent with forward scattering emission expected for \epseri's disk inclination. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the 3-roll observation strategy, which was first employed in these observations: the gains in contrast are modest, with 20-30\% improvements with respect to the conventional 2-roll strategy.

          Optimized smoothing kernels for SPH

 - **Abstract**
 We present a set of new smoothing kernels for smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) that improve the convergence of the method without any additional computational cost. These kernels are generated through a linear combination of other SPH kernels, combined with an optimization strategy to minimize the error in the Gresho-Chan vortex test case. To facilitate the different choices in gradient operators for SPH in the literature, we perform this optimization for both geometric density average force SPH (GDSPH) and linear-corrected gradient SPH (ISPH). In addition to the Gresho-Chan vortex, we also perform simulations of the hydrostatic glass, Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, and the Sod shocktube case. At low neighbour numbers (< 128), there is a significant improvement across the different tests, with the greatest impact shown for GDSPH. Apart from the popular Wendland kernels, we also explore other positive-definite kernels in this paper, which include the "missing" Wendland kernels, Wu kernels, and Buhmann kernels. In addition, we also present a method for producing arbitrary non-biased initial conditions in SPH. This method uses the SPH momentum equation together with an artificial pressure, combined with a global and local relaxation stage to minimize local and global errors.

 - **Abstract**
 Spectator fields which provide additional tensor degrees of freedom, on top of the standard metric tensor perturbations, can produce significant amounts of gravitational waves (GWs). Employing the effective field theory approach for spin-2 fields, we find a universal prediction that linear mixing between the metric and extra tensor modes inevitably induces oscillatory features in the GW spectrum, reminiscent of the so-called neutrino oscillation. Moreover, parity-violating operators in the spin-2 sector can imprint chiral signatures on the resulting GW background. We consider a concrete scenario in which the spin-2 field generates observable chiral GWs with characteristic oscillatory patterns. These results provide a model-independent characterization of the key signatures and observational implications of such scenarios which can be detected with future GW detectors.

          Analytical modeling of the gravitational potential of irregularly shaped celestial bodies considering three distinct internal structures: application to (21) Lutetia

 - **Abstract**
 The classical polyhedral model is one of the most accurate methods currently used to represent the gravitational field of irregularly shaped bodies. However, it assumes a homogeneous density distribution, which may not accurately reflect the internal composition of real objects. This study aims to analyze the effects of the internal structure of asteroid (21) Lutetia on gravitational potential modeling by considering a three-layered composition with distinct densities. The gravitational approach adopted in this study is the Potential Series Expansion Method (PSEM), represents models the body as a polyhedron and decomposes it into tetrahedral elements to estimate of the total potential around the asteroid. This estimation involves summing the contributions of each tetrahedron using a direct triple integral over its volume. Although this method does not achieve the same level of accuracy as the classical polyhedral approach, it offers a reasonable degree of precision, expresses the potential in analytical form, significantly reduces computational time, and, due to the simplified algebraic manipulation of the potential, facilitates the analysis of the asteroid's internal structural composition.

          Possible detection of HFQPOs associated with 'unknown' variability class of GRS 1915+105

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive spectro-temporal analysis of GRS $1915+105$ observed with AstroSat during June, $2017$. A detailed study of the temporal properties reveals the appearance of an `unknown' variability class ($\tau$) during $\rho \rightarrow \kappa$ class transition of the source. This new `unknown' class ($\tau$) is characterized by the irregular repetition of low count `dips' along with the adjacent `flare' like features in between two successive steady count rate durations, resulting in uniform `$C$' shaped distribution in the color-color diagram. A detailed comparative study of the variability properties between the $\tau$ class and other known variability classes of GRS $1915+105$ indicates it as a distinct variability class of the source. Further, we find evidence of the presence of possible HFQPO features at $\sim 71$ Hz with quality factor $\sim 13$, rms amplitude $\sim 4.69\%$, and significance $3\sigma$, respectively. In addition, a harmonic-like feature at $\sim 152$ Hz is also seen with quality factor $\sim 21$, rms amplitude $\sim 5.75\%$ and significance $\sim 4.7\sigma$. The energy-dependent power spectral study reveals that the fundamental HFQPO and its harmonic are present in $3-15$ keV and $3-6$ keV energy ranges, respectively. Moreover, the wide-band ($0.7-50$ keV) spectral modelling comprising of thermal Comptonization component indicates the presence of a cool ($kT_{\rm e}\sim 1.7$ keV) and optically thick (optical depth $\sim 14$) Comptonizing `corona', which seems to be responsible in regulating the HFQPO features in GRS $1915$+$105$. Finally, we find the bolometric luminosity ($L_{\rm bol}$) to be about $42\% L_{\rm Edd}$ within $1-100$ keV, indicating the sub-Eddington accretion regime of the source.

          A 2821 Star Optical SETI Survey using ESO HARPS archival data

 - **Abstract**
 We examined archived observations of 2,821 stars taken by the high-resolution ESO HARPS spectrograph to search for potential narrow-band laser emissions from extraterrestrial sources. From one observation of each star, our search algorithm identified a total of 285 spectral peaks with line widths slightly larger than the instrument's point-spread function. After eliminating false positives (including cosmic rays, instrumental artifacts, and terrestrial airglow lines, we identified 8 sources worthy of follow-up observations. We then analyzed all 1,835 additional observations of these follow-up targets, looking for recurring signals. We found 1 additional unexplained candidate in this followup search, but no candidate spikes which repeated at the same wavelength as one of the initial candidates at a later time. Further analysis identified one candidate as a likely faint airglow line. The remaining seven candidates continued to defy all false positive categories, including interference by LiDAR satellites and adaptive optics lasers from neighboring observatories. However, observations of other stars on the same night showed identical spectral spikes (in the telescope's reference frame) for four of these seven candidates -- indicating an as-yet unknown terrestrial source. This leaves 3 final candidates which currently defy the prosaic explanations examined thus far, show no indication of a terrestrial origin and therefore warrant further investigation. Two of these three candidates originate from M-Type stars and one of them originates from an oscillating red giant, so follow-up work will need to disentangle natural astrophysical stellar processes from potential SETI sources.

          Particle physics models of interacting bosonic dark energy and fermionic dark matter in Einstein scalar Gauss-Bonnet gravity

 - **Abstract**
 We explore a cosmological framework in which a Gauss-Bonnet (GB) coupled scalar field, acting as dark energy, interacts with a fermionic dark matter field through a coupling obtained from the point of view of particle physics. This setup is inspired by string/M-theory, and two representative scalar field potentials are investigated: exponential and power-law. A distinctive feature of the GB-coupled models is their potential to alter the propagation speed of gravitational waves (GWs), a property with significant implications in light of recent multi-messenger astrophysical observations. To account for this, we analyze models under two scenarios: one where the GW speed differs from that of light and the other where they are equal, but all consistent with current observational constraints. The dynamical evolution of the system is investigated by reformulating the field equations into an autonomous dynamical system, enabling a detailed analysis of the Universe's long-term behavior, including the radiation-, matter- and dark energy-dominated epochs. We constrain the model parameters using a broad set of recent observational data, including mock high-redshift measurements from the Roman Space Telescope. Our findings indicate that both potentials yield cosmologies that are in excellent agreement with current data, closely tracking the expansion history predicted by the standard \(\Lambda\)CDM model, while still allowing room for subtle deviations that could be tested by future observations.

          C3PO V: Comoving Pairs Indicate Rotational Spin-Down Drives the Main-Sequence Li-Dip

 - **Abstract**
 The lithium-dip observed in mid-F dwarfs remains a long-standing challenge for stellar evolution models. We present high-precision stellar parameters and A(Li) for 22 new comoving pairs, primarily located on the hotter side of the Li-Dip. Combined with pairs from the C3PO catalog, our sample includes 124 stars with Teff between 6000 and 7300 K, encompassing and extending slightly beyond the Li-Dip. Among them, 49 comoving pairs (98 stars) have both components within the temperature range of interest. Using this expanded set of comoving pairs observed with high-resolution spectroscopy, we show that rotational spin-down is the dominant process responsible for Li depletion in the Li-Dip. First, within comoving pairs, the star with v sin i > 12 km/s shows higher A(Li) than its more slowly rotating companion within the Li-Dip, indicating that rotation-dependent mixing drives lithium depletion. Second, we observe a correlation between A(Li) and v sin i: fast rotators retain higher A(Li) with less scatter, while slow rotators show lower A(Li) and greater dispersion. Third, among slow rotators, A(Li) varies widely, suggesting that differences in initial rotation rates and spin-down histories influence how much Li is depleted. Some stars may have formed as fast rotators and spun down rapidly, leading to more Li depletion, while others may have started as slow rotators and retained more of their initial Li. These results demonstrate that rotational induced mixing plays an important role in shaping the Li-Dip beyond the effects of stellar age and mass.

 - **Abstract**
 Recently, the KM3NeT collaboration detected an astrophysical neutrino event, KM3-230213A, with an energy of approximately $220~\rm PeV$, providing unprecedented insights into the ultra-high-energy Universe. In this study, we introduce a novel likelihood framework designed to leverage this event to constrain the properties of super-heavy dark matter (SHDM) decay. Our approach systematically integrates multi-messenger constraints from galactic and extragalactic neutrino flux measurements by IceCube, the absence of comparable neutrino events at IceCube and Auger observatories, and the latest gamma-ray experiment upper limits. Our findings impose the most stringent constraints to date, placing a lower bound on the SHDM lifetime at $\gtrsim 5\cdot 10^{29}-10^{30} \rm s$. Importantly, we identify, for the first time, the significant potential of galactic neutrino flux measurements in advancing dark matter research. Future investigations targeting astrophysical neutrinos originating from the Galactic Center at energies above $10~\rm PeV$ will be crucial, not only for understanding the origin of the cosmic-ray knee but also for exploring the possible contributions of super-heavy dark matter to our Universe.

 - **Abstract**
 The simulation of extensive air showers is pivotal for advancing our understanding of high-energy cosmic ray interactions in Earth's atmosphere. The CORSIKA 8 framework is being developed as a modern, flexible, and efficient tool for simulating these interactions with a variety of high-energy hadronic models. We present the ongoing implementation and validation of Pythia 8/Angantyr within CORSIKA 8. Pythia 8, successfully used in collider physics, provides a detailed and well-tested treatment of hadronic interactions, while the Angantyr model extends its capabilities to describe heavy-ion collisions in a consistent manner. With the inclusion of Pythia 8, the CORSIKA 8 suite now enables further tuning possibilities, improving the exploration of hadronic interactions in air showers. In this contribution, we compare the capability of Pythia 8/Angantyr to reproduce fundamental observables of high-energy particle collisions $-$ inelastic cross-sections and multiplicities $-$ to that of several established high-energy interaction models in air shower simulations. We further compare the predictions for key air shower properties, including longitudinal shower development and muon content, for iron-induced shower.

 - **Abstract**
 The Solar Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (SUIT) is an instrument onboard Aditya--L1, the first solar space observatory of the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), India, launched on September 2, 2023. SUIT is designed to image the Sun in the 200--400 nm wavelength band in eight narrowband and three broadband filters. SUIT's science goals start with observing the solar atmosphere and large-scale continuum variations, the physics of solar flares in the NUV region, and many more. The paper elucidates the functioning of the instrument, software packages developed for easier calibration, analysis, and feedback, calibration routines, and the regular maintenance activity of SUIT during the first year of its operation. The paper also presents the various operations undergone by, numerous program sequences orchestrated to achieve the science requirements, and highlights some remarkable observations made during the first year of observations with SUIT.

 - **Abstract**
 3I/ATLAS, also known as C/2025 N$_1$ (ATLAS), is the third interstellar object (ISO) discovered in July 2025. ISOs are particularly interesting because characterizing their physical properties helps us understand and test our knowledge of Solar System formation. Several quick response observations of 3I/ATLAS were performed during the first few days after the discovery, and various results, such as reflectance spectra, have been reported. We performed simultaneous visible spectrophotometry of 3I/ATLAS from data taken using the TriColor CMOS Camera and Spectrograph (TriCCS) on the Seimei 3.8 m telescope. The Seimei/TriCCS observations of 3I/ALTAS were obtained in the $g$, $r$, $i$, and $z$ bands in the Pan-STARRS system on UTC July 15, 2025. Our lightcurves show no significant variations during the 2.3 h observation, which is in good agreement with previous studies. Visible color indices of 3I/ATLAS, $g-r=0.603\pm0.031$, $r-i=0.210\pm0.031$, $i-z=0.117\pm0.046$, and $r-z=0.327\pm0.035$ suggest it has a red surface similar to, or slightly redder than, that of D-type asteroids. Continuous observations of 3I/ATLAS before and after its perihelion passage in October 2025 are desired to investigate its physical properties.

 - **Abstract**
 Additive manufacturing (AM; 3D Printing), a process which creates a part layer-by-layer, has the potential to improve upon conventional lightweight mirror manufacturing techniques, including subtractive (milling), formative (casting) and fabricative (bonding) manufacturing. Increased mass reduction whilst maintaining mechanical performance can be achieved through the creation of intricate lattice geometries, which are impossible to manufacture conventionally. Further, part consolidation can be introduced to reduce the number of interfaces and thereby points of failure. AM design optimisation using computational tools has been extensively covered in existing literature. However, additional research, specifically evaluation of the optical surface, is required to qualify these results before these advantages can be realised. This paper outlines the development & metrology of an AM mirror for a CubeSat platform with a targeted mass reduction of 60% compared to an equivalent solid body. This project aims to incorporate recent developments in AM mirror design, with a focus on manufacture, testing & evaluation. This is achieved through a simplified design process of a Cassegrain telescope primary mirror mounted within a 3U CubeSat chassis. The mirror geometry is annular with an external diameter of 84 mm and an internal diameter of 32 mm; the optical prescription is flat for ease of manufacture. Prototypes were printed in AlSi10Mg, a low-cost aluminium alloy commonly used in metal additive manufacturing. They were then machined and single-point diamond turned to achieve a reflective surface. Both quantitative & qualitative evaluations of the optical surface were conducted to assess the effect of hot isostatic pressing (HIP) on the optical surface quality. The results indicated that HIP reduced surface porosity; however, it also increased surface roughness and, consequently, optical scatter.

 - **Abstract**
 In the following paper I have compared some typical mass-radius relations for main sequence stars by studying their level of agreement with DEBCat [this https URL], which is a recent catalogue by J. Southworth. Models chosen for testing were originally developed using older, smaller datasets than DEBCat. Each model follows a two-piece function structure, where each branch is a monomial power-law. This approach is motivated by theoretical considerations suggesting that low-mass and high-mass main sequence stars exhibit distinct behaviors in energy production and energy transport. Best level of agreement is found for Zamorano's model [this https URL]. Also a new empirical relation is proposed by fitting a two-piece monomial power-law to DEBCat main sequence stars.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a strictly line-by-line differential analysis of a moderately $r$-process-enhanced star ($r$-I: HD~107752) with respect to a strongly $r$-process-enhanced star ($r$-II: CS~31082-0001) to investigate the possible common origin of their heavy-element nucleosynthesis with high-precision abundances. This study employs ESO data archive high-resolution and high signal-to-noise spectra taken with the UVES (VLT) spectrograph. Considering only the lines in common in both spectra, we estimate differential abundances of 16 light/Fe-peak elements and 15 neutron-capture elements. Abundances of O, Al, Pr, Gd, Dy, Ho, Er, and detection of Tm in HD~107752 are presented for the first time. We found three distinct features in the differential-abundance pattern. Nearly equal abundances of light elements up to Zn are present for both the stars, indicating a common origin for these elements; in addition to no noticable odd-even differential pattern. In the case of neutron-capture elements, the $r$-I star exhibits mildly depleted light $r$-process elements and more depleted heavier $r$-process elements relative to $r$-II star. We also show that among $r$-I and $r$-II stars, the ratio of lighter-to-heavier $r$-process elements (e.g. [(Sr,Y,Zr)/Eu]) exhibits a decreasing trend with respect to the overall $r$-process enhancement, forming a continuous sequence from $r$-I and $r$-II stars. Finally, we discuss the necessity of multiple sites for the formation of $r$-I stars.

 - **Abstract**
 SST-1M is a prototype single mirror Small Sized Cherenkov Telescope designed for very high energy (VHE) gamma-ray astronomy. With a 4 meter primary mirror and a 5.6 meter focal length, it provides a wide 9 degree optical field of view, optimized for detecting VHE gamma-rays from 1 TeV to several hundred TeV. Its focal plane is equipped with DigiCam, a fully digital trigger and readout camera made of 1296 silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) pixels. The use of SiPM sensors enables observation under high night sky background (NSB) conditions, significantly enhancing the instrument's duty cycle and allowing observations under moonlight. Currently, two SST-1M telescopes are deployed at the Ond\v rejov Observatory in the Czech Republic, operating in stereo, at 510 m altitude, to observe astrophysical sources. This contribution presents the SiPM calibration procedure and performance validation of the instrument, based on updated results from Crab Nebula observations.

 We present the results of testing an iXonUltra 888 EMCCDcamera to determine the operating parameters for short-exposure photometry of stars. As a result of the testing, those camera modes were selected in which the temporal instability of the electron multiplication charge does not significantly affect the light curves. In addition, the photometry of the eclipsing variable star ZTFJ 0038+2030, obtained with the Zeiss-1000 telescope of the Special Astrophysical Observatory of the Russian Academy of Sciences, is presented. We have shown the advantages and disadvantages of 1-s exposures for studying variable stars.

 - **Abstract**
 The detection by the Carpet-3 Group of a 300 TeV photon, observed 4536 seconds after the prompt emission of the historic gamma-ray burst GRB 221009A, provides unprecedented opportunities to test Lorentz invariance violation (LV) at energy scales approaching the Planck regime. By analyzing the temporal and spatial properties of this ultra-high-energy photon in conjunction with lower-energy photons from other bursts and the same burst, we demonstrate consistency with subluminal LV scenarios characterized by an energy scale \( E_{\rm LV} \sim 3 \times 10^{17} \, \rm{GeV} \). This work bridges multi-year LV studies using GeV-TeV photons and establishes GRB 221009A as a pivotal laboratory for quantum spacetime phenomenology.

 - **Abstract**
 Gaia has recently revealed a population of over 20 compact objects in wide astrometric binaries, while LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) have observed around 100 compact object binaries as gravitational-wave (GW) mergers. Despite belonging to different systems, the compact objects discovered by both Gaia and the LVK follow a multimodal mass distribution, with a global maximum at neutron star (NS) masses ($\sim 1$-$2\,M_\odot$) and a secondary local maximum at black hole (BH) masses $\sim10\,M_\odot$. However, the relative dearth of objects, or ``mass gap," between these modes is more pronounced among the wide binaries observed by Gaia compared to the GW population, with $9^{+10}_{-6}\%$ of GW component masses falling between $2.5$--$5\,M_\odot$ compared to $\lesssim5\%$ of Gaia compact objects. We explore whether this discrepancy can be explained by the natal kicks received by low-mass BHs. GW progenitor binaries may be more likely to survive natal kicks, because the newborn BH has a more massive companion and/or is in a tighter binary than Gaia progenitor binaries. We compare the survival probabilities of Gaia and GW progenitor binaries as a function of natal kick strength and pre-supernova binary parameters, and map out the parameter space and kick strength required to disrupt the progenitor binaries leading to low-mass BHs in Gaia systems more frequently than those in GW systems.

          Theoretical Mass Function for Secondaries Forming via Gravitational Instability in Circumstellar Disks

 - **Abstract**
 This paper constructs a theoretical framework for calculating the distribution of masses for secondary bodies forming via gravitational instability in the outer regions of circumstellar disks. We show that several alternate ways to specify the mass scale of forming objects converge to the same result under the constraint that the parental disks are marginally stable with stability parameter $Q=1$. Next we show that the well-known constraint that the formation of secondary bodies requires rapid cooling is equivalent to that of opacity limited fragmentation. These results are then used to derive a mass function for secondary objects forming through disk instablity. The resulting distribution is relatively narrow, with log-normal-like shape, a characteristic mass scale of order $M_{\scriptstyle \rm P}\sim10M_{\scriptstyle \rm Jup}$ and an approximate range of $4-80M_{\scriptstyle \rm Jup}$. Current estimates for the occurrence rate suggest that these objects are outnumbered by both stars and planets formed via core accretion.

 - **Abstract**
 Primarily motivated by the Hubble tension, we analyze the varying electron mass model and axionlike early dark energy model (EDE) using baryon acoustic oscillation data from DESI DR2 data and including the recent results from ACT DR6. Our analysis indicates that $m_{e} / m_{e0} = 1.0081 \pm 0.0046 $ and the energy fraction of EDE is constrained as $f_\mathrm{EDE} < 0.016$. Since those cosmological models fit with different spectral index $n_s$, we show the posterior of those models on the ($n_s-r$) plane and point out that, for example, Starobinsky inflation works for varying electron mass model while the standard supersymmetric hybrid inflation is preferred in the EDE model.

 - **Abstract**
 The IceCube Neutrino Observatory at the South Pole detects neutrinos of astrophysical origin via their interactions with ice. The main array is optimized for the detection of neutrinos with energies above 1 TeV. A much smaller infill array, known as IceCube DeepCore, extends the sensitivity down to a few GeV. Neutrinos observed in both parts of the detector are used for astrophysical-source searches with multiple messengers. We present two analyses that follow up archival gravitational wave (GW) events from runs O1 through O3 of LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA. The first analysis uses two neutrino datasets: one with high-energy tracks and another consisting of low-energy tracks and cascades. These two neutrino datasets were previously used independently to follow-up GW events. In the analysis presented here, a combined likelihood search is performed using both datasets to search for neutrinos coincident with the GW events across a wide energy range, from a few GeV to several PeV. The second analysis, for the first time, uses a neutrino-induced cascade sample with events of energy above ~1 TeV for searches of coincident neutrino-GW emission. We present results from both analyses and discuss prospects for conducting these analyses in real time.

 - **Abstract**
 Modern radio interferometers are designed with increasingly sprawling geographical footprints, offering enhanced sensitivity and resolution. However, managing such extensive facilities presents operational challenges that can potentially impede or delay scientific progress. One solution to such obstacles is the `swarm telescope' concept which enables collaborative use of individual telescope systems, overseen by separate institutions, to create a more powerful and manageable facility. We present the design, construction, and commissioning of the Long Wavelength Array -- North Arm (LWA-NA) station, a prototype 64-element LWA Swarm telescope. LWA-NA is a cost-efficient, rapidly deployable platform for radio astronomy, and serves as a pathfinder for the larger LWA Swarm project.

 - **Abstract**
 Line intensity mapping (LIM) is an emerging technique for probing the large scale structure (LSS) in the post-reionisation era. This captures the integrated flux of a particular spectral line emission from multiple sources within a patch of the sky without resolving them. Mapping different galaxy line emissions, such as the HI $21$-cm and CO rotational lines via LIM, can reveal complementary information about the bias with which the line emitters trace the underlying matter distribution and how different astrophysical phenomena affect the clustering pattern of these signals. The stage where the structures in the cosmic web merge to form a single connected structure is known as the percolation transition. Using mock HI $21$-cm and CO($1-0$) LIM signals in the post-reionisation universe, we explore the connectivity of structures through percolation analysis and compare it with that of the underlying galaxy distribution. We probe the relative contributions of voids, filaments, and sheets to the galaxy density and line intensity maps using a morphological measure known as the local dimension. The CO($1-0$) map exhibits an increased filamentary behaviour and larger contribution from sheets than the $21$-cm map. We attempt to explain such an emission of the CO($1-0$) line from biased environments. The upcoming SKA-Mid will produce tomographic intensity maps of the $21$-cm signal at $z \lesssim 3$ in Band-1. CO maps can be produced at these redshifts in phase 2 of SKA-Mid, where the frequency coverage is expected to increase up to $\sim 50$ GHz. We present forecasts for the recovery of the local dimensions of these intensity maps contaminated by instrumental noise, considering SKA-Mid observations.

          Dynamical properties of high-[Mg/Fe] stars in the Milky Way bar region

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of the high-alpha component of the Galactic bulge remains debated, unlike the bar-driven origin of the low-alpha bulge. We examine the metallicity-dependent dynamical properties of high-[Mg/Fe] stars in the bar region, using samples of low- and high-[Mg/Fe] stars from APOGEE DR17, complemented by the PIGS catalogue of [Fe/H] $ < -1 $ stars. The mean Galactocentric rotational velocity $ \overline V_\phi(R) $ is nearly cylindrical for both low- and high-[Mg/Fe] stars across the bulge and outer bar. $\overline V_\phi(R)$ of high-[Mg/Fe] stars with [Fe/H] $ \ge -0.6 $ is similar within errors to low-[Mg/Fe] stars in the bulge, and $ 10-20\% $ lower in the outer bar. The mean radial velocity field of these stars exhibits a quadrupole pattern similar to low-[Mg/Fe] stars. Orbit integrations in realistic barred Galactic potentials show that these model-independent properties correspond to a peanut bulge in the orbital density distributions for high-[Mg/Fe] stars with [Fe/H] $ \ge -0.6 $, transitioning toward a more spheroidal structure at lower metallicities. Additionally, $ \overline V_\phi$ ([Fe/H]) increases steeply as metallicity rises from about [Fe/H] $ \sim -1.3 $, resembling the spin-up observed at larger Galactic radii. This is accompanied by a transition in the dominant orbit families, from co- and counter-rotating cloud A and $ \rm x_4 $ orbits at low metallicities to co-rotating bar-supporting $ \rm x_1 $ family tree, box, and cloud A orbits at solar metallicity. Our results strengthen the case that the bulk of the high-[Mg/Fe] component in the bar region evolved from an alpha-enhanced disc, while metal-poor stars with [Fe/H] $ < -1 $ trace a more turbulent origin.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents a follow-up to previous work on correcting PSF-induced Doppler artifacts in observations by the SPICE spectrograph on Solar Orbiter. In a previous paper, we demonstrated correction of these artifacts in the $y-\lambda$ plane with PSF Regularization, treating the forward problem with a method based on large sparse matrix inversion. It has since been found that similar apparent artifacts are also present in the $x-\lambda$ direction, i.e., across adjacent slit positions. This is difficult (although not impossible) to correct with the previous matrix inversion method due to the time variation between slit positions. We have therefore devised a new method which addresses both $x-\lambda$ and $y-\lambda$ artifacts simultaneously by applying wavelength dependent shifts at each $x-y$ plane of the spectral cube. This paper demonstrates the SPICE data issue, describes the new method, and shows a comparison with the previous one. We explore the time variation of the correction parameters for the SPICE data and show a clear orbit dependence. The results of the method are significantly higher quality derived Doppler signals, which we estimate at less than $\sim$ 5 km/s uncertainty for brighter lines in the absence of other systematics. Furthermore, we show the new SPICE polar observation results as a demonstration. The correction codes are written in Python, publicly available on GitHub, and can be directly applied to SPICE level 2 datasets.

 - **Abstract**
 Aims. We aim to identify and classify BCs using high-precision astrometric and kinematic data, and to investigate their physical properties, mutual gravitational interactions, and formation rates. Methods. We used a comprehensive star cluster catalog that contains 4,084 high-quality clusters. Based on spatial and kinematic proximity, we identified 400 cluster pairs involving 686 unique clusters. These pairs were classified into three types: primordial BCs, systems formed through tidal capture or resonant trapping, and hyperbolic encounter pairs. For each system, we calculated the tidal factor to quantify the strength of mutual tidal interaction. Additionally, we constructed multi-cluster systems by identifying transitive connections among cluster pairs. Results. Among the 400 identified cluster pairs, nearly 60.8% (243 pairs) are probably primordial BCs, exhibiting both similar ages and motions. This supports a scenario where they formed together in the same giant molecular cloud. We find that 82.5% of the cluster pairs have strong mutual tidal forces. In addition, 278 star clusters are identified as members of 82 multi-cluster systems, including 27 newly reported groups. Cross-matching with the literature confirms the recovery of previously reported systems and leads to the discovery of 268 new cluster pairs. In our sample, about 16.8% of star clusters are involved in some type of interaction with another cluster, and 9.94% of star clusters are likely born in primordial BCs. Conclusions. Our results provide a comprehensive, homogeneously identified sample of Galactic BCs. The high fraction of primordial BCs and their mutual tidal interaction suggest that cluster formation in pairs is a main outcome of star formation. This work offers new observational constraints on the formation and dynamical evolution of multiple star cluster systems.

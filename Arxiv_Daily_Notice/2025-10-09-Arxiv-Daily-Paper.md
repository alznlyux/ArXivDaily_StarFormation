 - **Abstract**
 In dwarf galaxy models, outflows expel metal-enriched interstellar medium (ISM) into the circumgalactic medium (CGM) to reproduce their observed low metallicities, but measurements of dwarf CGM properties are scarce. We present a study of the CGM of an isolated dwarf at $z=0.5723$ with a stellar mass of $\approx5\times10^7\rm\,M_{\odot}$ and star-formation rate ($\approx0.05\,\rm M_\odot\,yr^{-1}$) and ISM metallicity ($\rm [O/H]\approx-0.9$) consistent with the star-forming main sequence and mass-metallicity relation. A background quasar sightline with archival UV spectra probes the dwarf's CGM at a projected distance of 28 kpc, corresponding to approximately half of the estimated virial radius. The dwarf's CGM is detected in H I, intermediate metal ions of C III, O III, and O IV, and kinematically broader, highly-ionized O VI, but is undetected in N IV and Ne VIII. Photoionization modeling of the intermediate ions indicates a modest volume-filling factor ($\sim 6\%$ along the sightline or $\sim 2\%$ globally), and a mass of $\sim2\times10^8 {\rm\,M_\odot}$, $\sim4\times$ higher than the dwarf's stellar mass, but $\sim10\times$ less than the highly ionized CGM. The O VI kinematics are comparable to the dwarf's estimated virial velocity, suggesting it is likely associated with cool, photoionized, and volume-filling CGM, with bulk motion or turbulence dominating over thermal pressure. The metallicity inferred for the intermediate ions is $\rm [O/H]=-0.6$, but with low relative abundances of $\rm [C/O]=-0.6$ and $\rm [N/O]<-0.9$. The [N/O] is below levels expected of the dwarf's ISM, but consistent with core-collapse supernova ejecta, suggesting that supernova-enriched gas escaped the dwarf without mixing significantly with ISM enriched in nitrogen from evolved, low-mass stars.

 (Edited) We introduce a flexible framework for building gravitational wave (GW) event catalogs in hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy formation. Our framework couples the state-of-the-art binary population synthesis code SEVN with Arepo-GW -- a module fully integrated into the moving-mesh code Arepo -- to assign merger events of binary compact objects to stellar particles in simulations by stochastically sampling merger tables generated with SEVN. Arepo-GW supports both on-the-fly operation, producing event catalogs during simulations, and post-processing, using snapshots from existing runs. The algorithm is fully parallel and can be readily adapted to outputs from other simulation codes. To demonstrate the capabilities of our new framework, we applied Arepo-GW in post-processing to simulations from the MillenniumTNG suite, including its flagship box. We investigate key properties of the resulting GW event catalog, built on SEVN predictions, focusing on comoving merger rates, formation efficiencies, delay-time distributions, and progenitor mass and metallicity distributions. We also examine how these properties vary with simulated volume. We find that GW progenitor rates closely track simulated star formation histories and are generally consistent with current observational constraints at low redshift, aside from a factor of $\sim 4.5$ excess in binary black hole mergers. Moreover, our binary black hole merger rates decline more slowly with redshift than current observational estimates for $z \lesssim 1$. Finally, the analysis of progenitor mass functions across different formation channels reveals only mild redshift evolution, while the binary black hole mass function displays features compatible with current observational determinations. These findings highlight the potential of our novel framework to enable detailed predictions for upcoming GW surveys within a full cosmological context.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the equation of state for two classes of new ultralight particles, a scalar field coupling to electrons and a light $\mathbb{Z}_\mathcal{N}$ QCD axion field coupling to nucleons. Both are potential candidates for dark matter. Using the scalar modified equations of state, we calculate models for white dwarf stars and compare their radii and masses with observed mass-radius data. The comparison results in stringent constraints on the masses of the particles and the coupling parameters. For a wide range of particle masses and coupling parameters, constraints from the white dwarf equation of state surpass existing limits, outperforming also dedicated laboratory searches. The remarkable accuracy of modern white-dwarf mass-radius relation data, exemplified by Sirius B, now allows stringent tests of dense-matter physics and constraints on new particle scenarios.

 - **Abstract**
 Using high-precision observations from the space-based \textit{Gaia} and \textit{TESS} missions, complemented by ground-based spectroscopic data and multi-band photometric surveys, we perform a detailed investigation of the Galactic open cluster NGC~2506. We present a new analysis of the intermediate-age open cluster NGC~2506, using joint fits to the radial velocities (RVs) and spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of five double-lined binary systems, including two eclipsing binaries. The analysis yields self-consistent estimates of the cluster's age, distance, and extinction, based on 18 free parameters: 10 stellar masses, 5 orbital inclinations, and common values for age, distance, and $A_V$. The SED fitting incorporates stellar isochrones, and the resulting parameters are examined through HR diagrams (R--$T_{\rm eff}$, R--M, and M--$T_{\rm eff}$) to assess evolutionary consistency. The age we derive for the cluster is $1.94 \pm 0.03$ Gyr for an assumed [Fe/H] = -0.30, and a fitting formula is given for extrapolation to other metallicities. The distance we find from the SED fitting is $3189 \pm 53$ pc, and this is to be compared with our own inference from the Gaia data which is $3105 \pm 75$ pc, based on 919 stars identified as cluster members. Our results demonstrate the power of binary systems in tightly constraining cluster-wide age and distance at this evolutionary stage. This approach represents one of the most accurate characterizations of an intermediate-age open cluster using multiple binary systems.

 - **Abstract**
 Pulsar timing arrays have recently found evidence for nanohertz gravitational waves that are consistent with being produced by a cosmological population of binary supermassive black holes (SMBHs). However, the amplitude of this gravitational wave background is larger than predicted from theoretical and empirical models of SMBH binary populations. We investigate preferential accretion onto the secondary, less massive SMBH of the binary as a potential solution to this discrepancy. We carry out the first observationally-based analysis of the effect of preferential accretion on the SMBH binary population, and we find that preferential accretion onto the secondary SMBH increases the binary SMBH mass ratio, causing many minor galaxy mergers to lead to major SMBH mergers. The fraction of SMBH mergers that are major mergers increases by a factor of 2-3 when preferential accretion is included. Further, we find that only a small amount of preferential accretion (10% total SMBH mass growth) is needed to bring the predicted gravitational wave background amplitude into agreement with observations. Preferential accretion has an even larger effect on gravitational wave signals detected by LISA, which will probe SMBH binaries at higher redshifts where the environment is more gas-rich, and can also help explain the rapid build up of overmassive black holes at high redshifts observed by the James Webb Space Telescope. It also shortens the time to the first detection of an individual SMBH binary emitting continuous waves. Preferential accretion strengthens the gravitational wave signals produced by any binary embedded in a circumbinary disk, including LIGO sources.

          A Walk on the Retrograde Side (WRS) project. II. Chemistry to disentangle in situ and accreted components in Thamnos

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results of the first systematic and dedicated high-resolution chemical analysis of the Thamnos substructure, a candidate relic of the process of hierarchical merger of the Milky Way. The analysis is perfomed in comparison with the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE) remnant, within the fully self-consistent and homogeneous framework established by the WRS project. We analyse high-resolution and high signal-to-noise ratio spectra obtained with UVES at VLT for 212 Red Giant Branch stars classified as candidate members of Thamnos and GSE, based on selections in the space of the integrals of motion. We derive precise abundances for 16 atomic species. Compared to GSE, stars attributed to the Thamnos substructure are, on average, more metal-poor, yet most of them show relatively higher [X/Fe] abundance ratios in several elements, like Na, Mg, Al, Ca, Cu, Zn, as well as lower [Eu/Fe]. The majority of candidate Thamnos stars show chemical signatures more consistent with the in situ Milky Way halo rather than a typical low-mass accreted dwarf galaxy. Our findings are further supported by comparisons with tailored galactic chemical evolution models, which fall short in reproducing the observed enhancement in the $\alpha$-elements, but are able to fit the more metal-poor component present in the Thamnos substructure. These results confirm a high level of contamination in the Thamnos substructure from the in situ population and to a lesser degree from GSE, while still leaving room for a genuine accreted population from a small disrupted dwarf galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 The delay time distribution (DTD) of binary black hole (BBH) mergers encodes the evolutionary link between the formation history and gravitational-wave (GW) emission. We present a non-parametric reconstruction of the mass-dependent DTD using the BBHs from the GWTC-4 that avoids restrictive assumptions of only power-law forms. Our analysis reveals for the first time the signature for mass-dependent evolutionary pathways: lower-mass systems ($20$-$40\,M_\odot$) are consistent with a scale-invariant DTD, whereas higher-mass BBHs ($40$-$100\,M_\odot$) provide the first direct tentative evidence of DTD that deviate from simple power laws, with a pronounced preference for rapid mergers around $2-6$ Gyrs. These findings reveal the advantage of the non-parametric technique in reconstructing the mass-dependent DTD and discovering for the first-time the presence of a potential time-scale associated with high-mass GW events.

 - **Abstract**
 Little Red Dots (LRDs) are a new class of compact extragalactic objects, with a v-shaped optical spectral energy distribution breaking close to the Balmer break wavelength, and broad, typically exponentially-shaped lines. They are believed to be supermassive black holes surrounded by very dense, ionized gas, leading us to explore for any departures from Case B recombination by examining the ratios of multiple hydrogen Balmer lines: $H\alpha$, $H\beta$, $H\gamma$, and $H\delta$. We analyze a dozen high-S/N LRDs with JWST/NIRSpec, measuring Balmer ratios in the seven objects with coverage of at least three lines. We decompose the line ratios into their respective broad and narrow components. Broad line ratios are consistent with Case B plus dust extinction in all objects but one, RUBIES EGS-49140, which departs from Case B expectations by more than $5\sigma$. The narrow components are consistent with minimal dust attenuation, while two objects exhibit narrow $H\alpha$/$H\beta \approx 1.8$. Such low decrements are observed in highly ionized density bounded nebulae, associated with starburst environments. Nevertheless, both flat decrement cases can be reconciled assuming an unresolved absorption feature. RUBIES EGS-49140, shows a high broad $H\alpha$/$H\beta$, but $H\gamma$/$H\alpha$ and $H\delta$/$H\alpha$ ratios are lower than expected for extinction-modified Case B, hinting at an unphysically steep dust law. These line ratios may be due to increased optical depth in the Balmer lines, as a direct effect of high density (log$n_e$ > 9) gas surrounding the black hole. If Case B recombination does hold in most LRDs, they must be moderate-to-heavily dust obscured ($A_V\simeq1-8$) while the host-galaxy should be dust-free, suggesting that the extinction in the broad lines is local to the LRD and not due to the general ISM of the host galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 Ring systems have recently been discovered around several small bodies in the outer Solar System through stellar occultations. While such measurements provide key information on ring geometry and dynamical interactions, little is known about their composition, grain size distribution, origin, lifetime, or evolutionary pathways. Here we report near-infrared observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) of a stellar occultation by the Centaur (10199) Chariklo, providing unprecedented constraints on the material properties of a small-body ring system and offering insights into their origin and evolution. These measurements reveal that Chariklo's inner dense ring contains predominantly micrometer-sized particles and exhibits a significant increase in opacity compared to previous observations, suggesting active replenishment events. Most strikingly, the outer ring shows a much weaker near-infrared occultation signature than in earlier visible-light detections. This discrepancy may indicate ongoing material loss, implying that the outer ring is transient, or it may reflect wavelength-dependent opacity consistent with a dusty structure dominated by $0.2$-$0.5$ $\mu$m silicate grains. These scenarios, not mutually exclusive, point to an unprecedented level of complexity in small-body ring systems, unlike anything observed around other minor bodies in the Solar System.

 - **Abstract**
 We report on new Chandra ACIS-I observations of the X-ray knots located in the western and eastern lobes of W50 associated with the parsec-scale jets of the Galactic microquasar SS 433. These knots are likely counterparts of the recently detected very-high-energy ($E>100$ GeV) gamma-ray emission by HAWC and H.E.S.S. These findings, together with the ultra-high-energy signal recently reported by the LHAASO collaboration, have established the SS 433/W50 system as a unique jet-driven PeVatron candidate. Combining new and archival Chandra data, we perform the first proper motion search of the X-ray knot structures over a time interval spanning approximately 20 years. We found no statistically significant motion of these knots at the 3$\sigma$ confidence level, and place an upper limit of $<$ 0.019-0.033$c$ (5,800-9,800 km s$^{-1}$) for the speed of the innermost knots at an assumed distance $d=5.5$ kpc. Combined with the velocities reported in the literature, the upstream speed in the shock rest frame would reach several 10$^4$ km s$^{-1}$, suggesting that highly efficient particle acceleration, approaching the Bohm limit, is occurring. The absence of significant motion of the knots suggests the presence of a standing recollimation shock, formed by the balance between the jet pressure and the external pressure. This interpretation is consistent with the expected occurrence of such shocks at 20-30 pc from SS 433, matching the location of the observed knots.

 - **Abstract**
 Over the past decade, kinetic inductance detectors (KIDs) have emerged as a viable superconducting technology for astrophysics at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths. KIDs spanning 210 - 850 GHz across seven instrument modules will be deployed in the Prime-Cam instrument of CCAT Observatory's Fred Young Submillimeter Telescope at an elevation of 5600 m on Cerro Chajnantor in Chile's Atacama Desert. The natural frequency-division multiplexed readout of KIDs allows hundreds of detectors to be coupled to a single radio frequency (RF) transmission line, but requires sophisticated warm readout electronics. The FPGA-based Xilinx ZCU111 radio frequency system on chip (RFSoC) offers a promising and flexible solution to the challenge of warm readout. CCAT uses custom packaged RFSoCs to read out KIDs in the Prime-Cam instrument. Each RFSoC can simultaneously read out four RF channels with up to 1,000 detectors spanning a 512 MHz bandwidth per channel using the current firmware. We use five RFSoCs to read out the >10,000 KIDs in the broadband 280 GHz instrument module inside a testbed receiver. Here, we describe and demonstrate the readout software and pipeline for the RFSoC system. We also present the preliminary averaged spectral responses of the 280 GHz instrument module using KIDs from the TiN array and the first Al array as a demonstration of the end-to-end performance of the readout and optical systems. These measurements demonstrate the foundation that will enable us to simultaneously read out over 10,000 KIDs with the RFSoC and represent a critical step toward reading out the ~100,000 KIDs in Prime-Cam in its future full capacity configuration.

          Ensemble seismic study of the properties of the core of Red Clump stars

 - **Abstract**
 Red clump stars still pose open questions regarding several physical processes, such as the mixing around the core, or the nuclear reactions, which are ill-constrained by theory and experiments. The oscillations of red clump stars, which are of mixed gravito-acoustic nature, allow us to directly investigate the interior of these stars and thereby better understand their physics. In particular, the measurement of their period spacing is a good probe of the structure around the core. We aim to explain the distribution of period spacings in red clump stars observed by Kepler by testing different prescriptions of core-boundary mixing and nuclear reaction rate. Using the MESA stellar evolution code, we computed several grids of core-helium burning tracks, with varying masses and metallicities. Each of these grids have been computed assuming a certain core boundary mixing scheme, or carbon-alpha reaction rate. We then sampled these grids, in a Monte-Carlo fashion, using observational spectroscopic metallicities and seismic masses priors, in order to retrieve a period spacing distribution that we compared to the observations. We found that the best fitting distribution was obtained when using a "maximal overshoot" core-boundary scheme, which has similar seismic properties as a model whose modes are trapped outside a semi-convective region, and which does not exhibit core breathing pulses at the end of the core-helium burning phase. If no mode trapping is assumed, then no core boundary mixing scheme is compatible with the observations. Moreover, we found that extending the core with overshoot worsens the fit. Additionally, reducing the carbon-alpha reaction rate (by around 15%) improves the fit to the observed distribution. Finally, we noted that an overpopulation of early red clump stars with period spacing values around 250s is predicted by the models but not found in the observations.

 - **Abstract**
 A variety of processes in the very early universe can give rise to a population of primordial black holes (PBHs) with an extended mass spectrum. For certain mass spectra of this sort, it has been shown that the evaporation of these PBHs into radiation can drive the universe toward an epoch of cosmological stasis which can persist for a significant number of $e$-folds of cosmological expansion. However, in general, the initial mass spectrum which characterizes a population of PBHs at the time of production can subsequently be distorted by processes such as mergers and accretion. In this paper, we examine the effects that these processes have on the spectra that lead to a PBH-induced stasis. Within such stasis models, we find that mergers have only a negligible effect on these spectra within the regime of interest for stasis. We likewise find that the effect of accretion is negligible in many cases of interest. However, we find that the effect of accretion on the PBH mass spectrum is non-negligible in situations in which this spectrum is particularly broad. In such situations, the stasis epoch is abridged or, in extreme cases, does not occur at all. Thus accretion plays a non-trivial role in constraining the emergence of stasis within scenarios which lead to extended PBH mass spectra.

 - **Abstract**
 The CosmoCube project plans to deploy a global 21-cm spectrometer with 10-100 MHz observation band in a lunar orbit. The farside part of such an orbit, i.e. the part of orbit behind the Moon, offers an ideal site for accurately measuring the 21-cm signal from the Dark Ages, Cosmic Dawn and Epoch of Reionization, as the effects of the Earth's ionosphere, artificial radio frequency interference (RFI), and complex terrain and soil are all avoided. Given the limitations of a satellite platform, we propose a receiver calibration system design based on a Radio Frequency system-on-chip, consisting of a Vector Network Analyzer (VNA) sub-system, and a source switching sub-system. We introduce the measurement principle of the VNA, and discuss the effect of quantization error. The accuracy, stability and trajectory noise of the VNA are tested in laboratory experiments. We also present the design of the source-switching sub-system, generating mock datasets, showing that the imperfect return loss, insertion loss, and isolation of surface-mounted microwave switches have a minimal effect on the sky foreground fitting residuals, which are within $\pm10$ mK under optimal fitting condition. When all possible measurement errors in reflection coefficients and physical temperatures are taken into account, the foreground fitting residuals for the 50-90 MHz part of the spectrum remain around $\pm20$ mK.

          Revisiting the Orbital Dynamics of the Hot Jupiter WASP-12b with New Transit Times

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we examine the transit timing variations (TTVs) of the extensively studied hot Jupiter WASP-12b using a comprehensive dataset of 391 transit light curves. The dataset includes 7 new photometric observations obtained with the 1.3 m Devasthal Fast Optical Telescope, the 0.61 m VASISTHA telescope, and the 0.3 m AG Optical IDK telescope, along with 119 light curves from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), 97 from the Exoplanet Transit Database (ETD), 34 from the ExoClock Project, and 134 from previously published sources. To ensure homogeneity and precision, we modeled all 391 light curves and determined their mid-transit times. A detailed transit timing analysis revealed a significant orbital decay rate of $-30.31 \, \mathrm{ms \, yr^{-1}}$, corresponding to a stellar tidal quality factor of $Q'_\star = 1.61 \times 10^{5}$, thereby confirming that the orbit of WASP-12b is indeed decaying rapidly. Furthermore, the computation of model selection metrics ($\chi^2_r$, BIC, AIC) favors orbital decay as the most likely explanation. However, the presence of an eccentricity above the threshold value allows apsidal precession to remain a viable alternative. We also derived a planetary Love number of $k_p = 0.66 \pm 0.28$, consistent with Jupiter's value, suggesting a similar internal density distribution. Therefore, while orbital decay is strongly supported, apsidal precession cannot be ruled out as another contributing effect, highlighting the necessity of continued high-precision monitoring to resolve the system's orbital evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 We performed the first simultaneous NICER & NuSTAR spectral and timing study of the Sco-like Z source GX 17+2. The source traced the full Z track during four observations. We detect signatures of relativistic reflection in the broadband spectra and report results using a reflection framework. The disk is relatively close to the innermost stable circular orbit ($\sim$ 1-4 R$_{ISCO}$), which agrees with previous studies of GX 17+2, but the location of the inner disk is farther out in the horizontal branch (HB) and moves inward toward the flaring branch (FB). We find the FB to be the point of closest approach of the disk to the neutron star. We qualitatively conclude that the evolution of the source along the HID is that of a relatively truncated disk in the HB ($\sim$ 4 R$_{ISCO}$) that approaches the neutron star as it goes along the HID towards the normal branch (NB), soft apex (SA), and finally the FB. We attribute the source evolution along the Z track to varying mass accretion rate and disk instabilities. Rms variability increases from the NB towards the SA and then drops to a constant along the FB indicating that the observed variability likely originates from the disk/boundary layer rather than the corona.

 - **Abstract**
 The $r$-process enrichment in the Galaxy still remains elusive with regard to its nucleosynthesis conditions and the astrophysical sites where it occurs. As part of ongoing efforts to pinpoint the origin of chemically peculiar $r$-process-enhanced (RPE) stars, we concentrate in this study on the kinematics of RPE stars to investigate possible variations in the $r$-process enrichment among the Galactic components. We calculate the orbital parameters of a sample of 472 metal-poor RPE stars and associate them to the Galactic bulge, disk and halo populations using a physically motivated classification based on apocenter distance and maximum absolute vertical height of the orbit. We show that the Toomre diagram does not properly separate stars in the disk and halo components when they are on highly eccentric and/or retrograde orbits. The Galactic disk and halo share a similar fraction of RPE stars, in contrast to the earlier perception that the majority of RPE stars belong to the halo. We find that the stars most likely to be accreted belong to the halo. However, 3/4 of the stars lie in a mixed-zone. The inner disk, inner halo and outer halo stars exhibit similar abundance trends for the n-capture elements.

 Concomitant with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) observation of the Perseus cluster, we obtained optical spectropolarimetry of its central active galactic nucleus, NGC 1275, using the Alhambra Faint Object Spectrograph and Camera (ALFOSC) on the Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT). While the total-light spectrum confirms its edge-on, core obscured (type-2) classification, the polarized spectrum shows a polarization angle aligned with the arcsecond radio jet axis -- an exceptional behavior for type-2 objects. Our polarization analysis also reveals wavelength-dependent linear polarization at level 2-3% in the continuum, likely rising from a combination of variable syn

 - **Abstract**
 The potential of deep learning-based image-to-image translations has recently attracted significant attention. One possible application of such a framework is as a fast, approximate alternative to cosmological simulations, which would be particularly useful in various contexts, including covariance studies, investigations of systematics, and cosmological parameter inference. To investigate different aspects of learning-based cosmological mappings, we choose two approaches for generating suitable cosmological matter fields as datasets: a simple analytical prescription provided by the Zel'dovich approximation, and a numerical N-body method using the Particle-Mesh approach. The evolution of structure formation is modeled using U-Net, a widely employed convolutional image translation framework. Because of the lack of a controlled methodology, validation of these learned mappings requires multiple benchmarks beyond simple visual comparisons and summary statistics. A comprehensive list of metrics is considered, including higher-order correlation functions, conservation laws, topological indicators, and statistical independence of density fields. We find that the U-Net approach performs well only for some of these physical metrics, and accuracy is worse at increasingly smaller scales, where the dynamic range in density is large. By introducing a custom density-weighted loss function during training, we demonstrate a significant improvement in the U-Net results at smaller scales. This study provides an example of how a family of physically motivated benchmarks can, in turn, be used to fine-tune optimization schemes -- such as the density-weighted loss used here -- to significantly enhance the accuracy of scientific machine learning approaches by focusing attention on relevant features.

 - **Abstract**
 The 136 year long optical light curve of OJ~287 is explained by a binary black hole model where the secondary is in a 12 year orbit around the primary. Impacts of the secondary on the accretion disk of the primary generate a series of optical flares which follow a quasi-Keplerian relativistic mathematical model. The orientation of the binary in space is determined from the behavior of the primary jet. Here we ask how the jet of the secondary black hole projects onto the sky plane. Assuming that the jet is initially perpendicular to the disk, and that it is ballistic, we follow its evolution after the Lorentz transformation to the observer's frame. Since the orbital speed of the secondary is of the order of one-tenth of the speed of light, the result is a change in the jet direction by more than a radian during an orbital cycle. We match the theoretical jet line with the recent 12 $\mu$as-resolution RadioAstron map of OJ~287, and determine the only free parameter of the problem, the apparent speed of the jet relative to speed of light. It turns out that the Doppler factor of the jet, $\delta\sim5$, is much lower than in the primary jet. Besides following a unique shape of the jet path, the secondary jet is also distinguished by a different spectral shape than in the primary jet. The present result on the spectral shape agrees with the huge optical flare of 2021 November 12, also arising from the secondary jet.

 - **Abstract**
 H2 is the most abundant molecule in the interstellar medium and is a useful tool to study photodissociation regions, where radiative feedback from massive stars on molecular clouds is dominant. The James Webb Space Telescope, with its high spatial resolution, sensitivity, and wavelength coverage provides unique access to the detection of most of H2 lines and the analysis of its spatial morphology. Our goal is to use H2 line emission detected with the JWST in the Horsehead nebula to constrain the physical parameters (e.g., extinction, gas temperature, thermal pressure) throughout the PDR and its geometry. The study of H2 morphology reveals that FUV-pumped lines peak closer to the edge of the PDR than thermalized lines. From H2 lines, we estimate the value of extinction throughout the PDR. We find that AV is increasing from the edge of the PDR to the second and third H2 filaments. Then, we study the H2 excitation in different regions across the PDR. The temperature profile shows that the observed gas temperature is quite constant throughout the PDR, with a slight decline in each of the dissociation fronts. This study also reveals that the OPR is far from equilibrium. We observe a spatial separation of para and ortho rovibrational levels, indicating that efficient ortho-para conversion and preferential ortho self-shielding are driving the spatial variations of the OPR. Finally, we derive a thermal pressure in the first filament around P > 6x10$^6$ K cm$^{-3}$, about ten times higher than that of the ionized gas. We highlight that template stationary 1D PDR models cannot account for the intrinsic 2D structure and the very high temperature observed in the Horsehead nebula. We argue the highly excited, over-pressurized H2 gas at the edge of the PDR interface could originate from the mixing between the cold and hot phase induced by the photo-evaporation of the cloud.

 - **Abstract**
 Modern astronomical surveys deliver immense volumes of transient detections, yet distinguishing real astrophysical signals (for example, explosive events) from bogus imaging artefacts remains a challenge. Convolutional neural networks are effectively used for real versus bogus classification; however, their reliance on opaque latent representations hinders interpretability. Here we show that large language models (LLMs) can approach the performance level of a convolutional neural network on three optical transient survey datasets (Pan-STARRS, MeerLICHT and ATLAS) while simultaneously producing direct, human-readable descriptions for every candidate. Using only 15 examples and concise instructions, Google's LLM, Gemini, achieves a 93% average accuracy across datasets that span a range of resolution and pixel scales. We also show that a second LLM can assess the coherence of the output of the first model, enabling iterative refinement by identifying problematic cases. This framework allows users to define the desired classification behaviour through natural language and examples, bypassing traditional training pipelines. Furthermore, by generating textual descriptions of observed features, LLMs enable users to query classifications as if navigating an annotated catalogue, rather than deciphering abstract latent spaces. As next-generation telescopes and surveys further increase the amount of data available, LLM-based classification could help bridge the gap between automated detection and transparent, human-level understanding.

 - **Abstract**
 K2-18b lies near the radius valley that separates super-Earths and sub-Neptunes, marking a key transitional regime in planetary and atmospheric composition. The system offers a valuable opportunity to study how M-dwarf high-energy stellar radiation influences atmospheric stability and the potential for sustaining volatile species, especially important in the context of the upcoming ELT and its ANDES spectrograph. This study characterizes the high-energy environment of K2-18 with X-ray observations from eROSITA, the soft X-ray instrument on the Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG) mission, Chandra, and XMM-Newton. We derive a representative 0.2-2 keV X-ray flux with an APEC thermal plasma model fitted with the Bayesian X-ray Analysis (BXA). With the observed X-ray flux from the exoplanet host star, we estimate the photo-evaporation mass loss of exoplanet K2-18b using the energy-limited model. In addition, we examine the thermal structure of the system based on a hydrodynamic model. In 100 ks XMM-Newton observations we identified K2-18 as a very faint X-ray source with $\mathrm{F_X = 10^{-15}\ erg\,s^{-1}\,cm^{-2}}$, with an activity level of (Lx/Lbol) $\sim 10^{-5}$. A small flare has been detected during the observation. The planet is irradiated by an X-ray flux of $\mathrm{F_{pl,X} = 12\pm3\ erg\,s^{-1}\,cm^{-2}}$. The X-ray flux measurement of K2-18 gives important limitations for atmospheric escape and photochemical modeling of its exoplanets. Despite its near orbit around an M-dwarf star, K2-18b's low activity level environment suggests that it can retain an atmosphere, supporting recent tentative detections of atmospheres.

 - **Abstract**
 The formation of stars with light-element abundance variations in globular clusters and the subsequent dynamical evolution of these multiple populations remains an open question. One of the most widely discussed is the AGB scenario, in which chemically processed material from the envelopes of AGB stars mixes with re-accreted primordial gas flowing into the center of the cluster. Based on this scenario, more than two hundred MOCCA simulations of cluster evolution have been carried out, incorporating additional physical processes related to the external environment of globular clusters and the initial properties of multiple stellar populations. Analysis of the simulations shows that most observed properties of multiple stellar populations and the global parameters of Milky Way clusters are well reproduced, with the exception of the correlation between cluster mass and the fraction of second-population stars. We present a speculative scenario of globular cluster evolution that may account for the observed properties of Milky Way clusters, including the correlation between cluster mass and the fraction of enriched stars. The scenario further predicts that, under certain conditions, the pristine first population can be more centrally concentrated than the enriched second population, as observed in some clusters. \end{abstract

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive characterization of the on-orbit imaging performance of the three telescopes on board the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE). Each telescope comprises a Wolter-I mirror module assembly and a Gas Pixel Detector focal-plane detector unit (DU). We analyze data from point-like X-ray sources and fit a composite point spread function (PSF) model that we compare with ground calibrations. We study the dependence of the PSF parameters and of the angular resolution, in terms of half-power diameter (HPD), on the time and source counting rate. We find no significant secular evolution of PSF parameters or HPD over 30 months on orbit, with average HPDs of $26.1 \pm 0.5$ arcsec (Telescope 1), $32.1 \pm 0.5$ arcsec (Telescope 2), and $30.9 \pm 0.6$ arcsec (Telescope 3), and rate trends consistent with zero up to source counting rates of $\sim60$ cts s$^{-1}$ in the 2-3 keV energy band for all three telescopes. We set a 99% C.L. upper limit of 4.4% on the optics-induced polarization in the PSF halo, and find no measurable degradation of the polarization modulation factor in the wings versus the core due to mis-reconstructed photoelectron tracks. IXPE's imaging performance thus is consistent with the $\leq30$ arcsec observatory requirement with high stability, ensuring robust spatially resolved polarization measurements for the mission's projected lifetime through 2030.

          Understanding an origin of palladium in metal-poor stars based on the non-LTE analysis of Pd~I lines

 - **Abstract**
 Palladium is one of poorly observed neutron-capture elements. Abundance determinations for stellar samples covering a broad metallicity range are needed for better understanding the mechanisms of Pd synthesis during the Galaxy evolution. We aim to obtain accurate abundances of Pd for the Sun and the sample of metal-poor stars based on the non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) line formation for Pd~I. We present a new, comprehensive model atom of Pd~I. Abundances of Pd, Sr, Ba, and Eu were derived for 48 stars from the non-LTE analyses of high resolution and high signal-to-noise ratio spectra provided by the ESO archives. Non-LTE leads to weakened Pd~I lines and positive non-LTE abundance corrections growing from 0.2~dex for the solar lines up to 0.8~dex for the lines in the most luminous star of the sample. Depending on a treatment of inelastic collisions with hydrogen atoms, the solar non-LTE abundance amounts to log eps = 1.61+-0.02 to 1.70+-0.02 and agrees within the error bars with the meteoritic abundance log eps_met = 1.65. Non-LTE largely removes the discrepancies in the LTE abundances between the giant and dwarf stars of similar metallicities. Palladium tightly correlates with Eu in the -1.71 < [Fe/H] < -0.56 range indicating the r- and s-process contributions to Pd synthesis of approximately 70% and 30%, respectively. Palladium is of pure r-process origin in our two r-II stars, and a dominant contribution of the r-process to the Pd abundances is found for another two very metal-poor (VMP, [Fe/H] < -2) stars. The two VMP stars, which are strongly enhanced with Sr relative to Ba and Eu, reveal also enhancements with Pd. We propose that the source of extra Sr and Pd in these stars are VMP, fast rotating massive stars. Non-LTE is essential for obtaining the observational constraints to future models of the Galactic Pd evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Protoplanetary discs are the birthplaces of planets. Recent studies highlight the role of stellar mass sampling in determining disc lifetimes from the observed fraction of stars with discs. Low-mass stars tend to host longer-lived discs, allowing planet formation via solid accretion. Observations also reveal a strong correlation between stellar (and substellar) mass and accretion rate, typically following $\dot{M}\propto M_\star^2$. Aims. We aim to identify the optimal parameters of a disc evolution model that reproduces both the observed disc fractions and accretion rates in young stellar populations. Methods. We performed a population synthesis study exploring different dependencies of the viscosity parameter $\alpha$ on stellar mass. Disc evolution includes viscous accretion and photoevaporation (internal and external). Initial disc masses and radii were drawn from observationally motivated distributions, while stellar masses followed a given distribution and a time-dependent star formation rate (SFR) was introduced. Results. Matching observed disc fractions and accretion trends requires $\alpha$ to increase with stellar mass. External photoevaporation is necessary to produce low-mass discs with high accretion rates, and a time-dependent SFR enhances accretion in young clusters while extending disc lifetimes in older ones. A stellar mass cut-off reproduces the distance-dependent biases in observed disc fractions. Conclusions. Both stellar and environmental effects are essential to explain the observed properties of protoplanetary discs. A stellar-mass-dependent viscosity reproduces the $\dot{M}$-$M_\star$ relation, while external photoevaporation and extended star formation histories shape the accretion rate distribution across environments.

 - **Abstract**
 Context:Previous studies suggested that these frosts could result from the peculiar insolation driven by the geometry of these slopes, but this has never been quantitatively tested. We aim to investigate the origin, stability, and potential role in Pluto's volatile cycle of these localized frost deposits. Methods:We implemented a new sub-grid-scale slope parameterization in the Pluto Volatile Transport Model, which accounts for the specific solar irradiation and resulting surface and subsurface temperatures on sloped terrains. This parameterization also allows the condensation and sublimation of volatiles (either N2 or CH4) on slopes, including the effect of large-scale transport of these species, which is key to determining the amount of frost that forms or disappears. Results: Our simulations reproduce the observed CH4 frost on North-facing slopes as seasonal deposits currently sublimating, predict perennial CH4 frost on South-facing slopes, and show that slope microclimates should not alter global volatile cycles. Conclusions: Seasonal and perennial N2 and CH4 frosts can form across Pluto's slopes, even in its darkest and warmest regions, due to the locally reduced sunlight received on inclined terrain. Nevertheless, despite Pluto's abundance of sloped surfaces, slope microclimates appear to have only a minor effect on the planet's global volatile cycles.

 The Gaia collaboration announced the discovery of a massive black hole (BH) with a low-mass giant star companion, Gaia BH3, located in the ED-2 stellar stream. The properties of Gaia BH3 bridge the gap between known Milky Way BHs and extragalactic BHs found with gravitational waves (GWs). We aim to determine the most likely formation scenario for Gaia BH3 in the progenitor cluster of the ED-2 stream. We perform $N$-body simulations of that progenitor cluster and find that, most likely, Gaia BH3 formed from a stellar binary that formed during cluster formation, which then underwent multiple dynamical interactions that significantly altered its properties, including exchanging the companion star. We highlight the importance of cluster dynamics and discard a formation scenario where it evolved in quasi-isolation.

 - **Abstract**
 Extreme precision radial velocity (EPRV) surveys usually require extensive observational baselines to confirm planetary candidates, making them resource-intensive. Traditionally, periodograms are used to identify promising candidate signals before further observational investment, but their effectiveness is often limited for low-amplitude signals due to stellar jitter. In this work, we develop a machine learning (ML) framework based on a Transformer architecture that aims to detect the presence and likely period of planetary signals in time-series spectra, even in the presence of stellar activity. The model is trained to classify whether a planetary signal exists and assign it to one of several discrete period and amplitude bins. Injection-recovery tests on randomly selected 100 epoch observation subsets from NEID solar data (2020-2022 period) show that for low-amplitude systems ($<$1 ms$^{-1}$), our model improves planetary candidate identification by a factor of two compared to the traditional Lomb-Scargle periodogram. Our ML model is built on a Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture that processes reduced representations of solar spectrum observations to predict the period and semi-amplitude of planetary signal candidates. By analyzing multi-epoch spectra, the model reliably detects planetary signals with semi-amplitudes as low as 65 cms$^{-1}$. Even under real solar noise and irregular sampling, it identifies signals down to 35 cms$^{-1}$. Comparisons with the Lomb-Scargle periodogram demonstrate a significant improvement in detecting low-amplitude planetary candidates, particularly for longer orbital periods. These results underscore the potential of machine learning to identify planetary candidates early in EPRV surveys, even from limited observational counts.

 - **Abstract**
 Free-floating planetary-mass objects (FFPs) have been detected through direct imaging within several young, nearby star-forming regions. The properties of circumstellar disks around these objects may provide a valuable probe into their origin, but is currently limited by the small sizes of the sample explored. We aim to perform a statistical study of the occurrence of circumstellar disks down to the planetary-mass regime. We performed a systematic survey of disks among the population identified in the 5-10 Myr-old Upper Scorpius association (USC), restricted to members outside the younger, embedded Ophiuchus region and with estimated masses below 105 M_Jup. We took advantage of unWISE photometry to search for mid-infrared excesses in the WISE (W1-W2) color. We implemented a Bayesian outlier detection method that models the photospheric sequence and computes excess probabilities for each object, enabling statistically sound estimation of disk fractions. We explore disk fractions across an unprecedentedly fine mass grid, reaching down to objects as low as ~6 M_Jup assuming 5 Myr or ~8 M_Jup assuming 10 Myr, thus extending the previous lower boundary of disk fraction studies. Depending on the age, our sample includes between 17 and 40 FFPs. We confirm that the disk fraction steadily rises with decreasing mass and exceeds 30% near the substellar-to-planetary mass boundary at ~13 M_Jup. We find hints of a possible flattening in this trend around 25-45 M_Jup, potentially signaling a transition in the dominant formation processes. This change of trend should be considered with caution and needs to be confirmed with more sensitive observations. Our results are consistent with the gradual dispersal of disks over time, as disk fractions in Upper Scorpius appear systematically lower than those in younger regions.

 - **Abstract**
 Space-based gravitational-wave observatories will detect the early inspiral of stellar-mass binary black holes and can track their eccentricity evolution. However, untargeted searches in the space band are computationally demanding and require relatively high detection thresholds (signal-to-noise ratio $\sim 15$). Information from ground-based detections can significantly shrink the parameter space for space-band analyses and thereby substantially reduce the detection threshold. We present a Bayesian inference pipeline for ground-triggered archival space-band analyses that includes eccentricity. Using ground-informed priors, we demonstrate that with one year of LISA or TianQin data a GW190521-like source with signal-to-noise ratio $\sim 7$ can be distinguished and tightly constrained. In this setup, space observations sharpened the redshifted chirp mass from $\mathcal{O}(10^{-3})M_\odot$ to $\mathcal{O}(10^{-5})M_\odot$, and constrain the eccentricity to $\mathcal{O}(10^{-5})$ around the injected value $e_{0.01\mathrm{Hz}}=0.1$. These results demonstrate that inference of eccentric stellar-mass binary black holes in noisy space-band data is practically feasible, supports an expanded yield of multiband detections, and strengthens prospects for future astrophysical and gravitational tests.

 - **Abstract**
 A key challenge in debris-disc science is that we do not know the masses of debris discs, nor the sizes of the largest debris bodies. This is because modern observations can only detect objects up to centimetre sizes, whilst larger planetesimals, which dominate disc mass, remain hidden. We must therefore use other arguments, such as dynamics, to indirectly infer disc masses and body sizes. This paper presents a new method, applicable to narrow debris discs like Fomalhaut. We argue that such discs cannot be too massive, nor the largest bodies too large, otherwise they would self-scatter and the disc would be much broader than observed. Using n-body dynamics and collisional theory, we demonstrate that the mass of Fomalhaut's disc cannot be dominated by primordial Plutos. Instead, if the mass is dominated by primordial bodies, then they should have radii below $300^{+80}_{-70}$ km ($0.3 \pm 0.1$ RPluto) and above $5^{+20}_{-4}$ km. Such bodies would each have less than 1 per cent the mass of Pluto. Our conclusions are robust to additional physics, including shepherding planets and collisional damping. Our results provide independent, dynamical support for the idea that the masses of bright debris discs are dominated by objects smaller than Pluto.

 - **Abstract**
 Time-domain surveys such as the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) have opened a new frontier in the discovery and characterization of transients. While photometric light curves provide broad temporal coverage, spectroscopic observations remain crucial for physical interpretation and source classification. However, existing spectral analysis methods -- often reliant on template fitting or parametric models -- are limited in their ability to capture the complex and evolving spectra characteristic of such sources, which are sometimes only available at low resolution. In this work, we introduce SpectraNet, a deep convolutional neural network designed to learn robust representations of optical spectra from transients. Our model combines multi-scale convolution kernels and multi-scale pooling to extract features from preprocessed spectra in a hierarchical and interpretable manner. We train and validate SpectraNet on low-resolution time-series spectra obtained from the Spectral Energy Distribution Machine (SEDM) and other instruments, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in classification. Furthermore, in redshift prediction tasks, SpectraNet achieves a root mean squared relative redshift error of 0.02, highlighting its effectiveness in precise regression tasks as well.

          Testing new-physics scenarios with the combined LHAASO and Carpet-3 fluence spectrum of GRB 221009A: axion-like particles and Lorentz-invariance violation

 - **Abstract**
 From gamma-ray burst (GRB) 221009A, very high-energy photons were detected: >10 TeV with LHAASO and >100 TeV with Carpet-3. Such energetic photons are expected to be absorbed via electron-positron pair production on their way to the Earth. Their observation might be explained by new physics, including Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) or photon mixing with axion-like particles (ALPs). Here, we construct a joint fluence spectrum by combining flux measurements from both experiments, and fit it under these hypotheses. LIV can account for the Carpet-3 observation, providing a modest improvement over standard physics in the overall fit. ALP mixing improves the description of both LHAASO and Carpet-3 data, yielding a substantial enhancement in fit quality for a specific region of the ALP parameter space.

 - **Abstract**
 Young accreting planetary-mass objects are thought to draw material from a circumplanetary disk (CPD) composed of gas and dust. While the gas within the disk is expected to disperse within the first million years, strong accretion has nonetheless been detected in older systems, including the 30--45 Myr-old planetary-mass companion Delorme 1 AB b. We conducted spectroscopic observations with JWST/MIRI to investigate the presence of circumplanetary material around this young, accreting planet, and to characterize the planet's atmospheric properties and composition. We perform forward modeling using atmospheric models to characterize the planet's atmosphere. Beyond 10 microns, the SED becomes dominated by this CPD rather than the planet itself. We detect strong emission from HCN and C$_2$H$_2$, while no O-bearing species are observed in the CPD spectrum, suggesting the gas in the CPD has an elevated C/O. We also identify spatially extended H$_2$ emission around the planet, tracing warm gas, with indications that it may be at a higher temperature than the non-extended component. The mid-infrared spectrum of the planetary-mass companion Delorme 1 AB b reveals the first detection of bright C-bearing species in a CPD, together with an outflow traced by H$_2$ extended emission, that could be interpreted as a disk wind. The hot dust continuum emission suggests an inner cavity in the CPD. The presence of warm gas in the CPD provides constraints on the disk's chemical composition and physical conditions, opening up new avenues for disk studies. The study of these long-lived "Peter Pan" disks will enhance our understanding of how accretion persists in evolved low-mass systems, shedding light on their formation, longevity, and evolutionary pathways in planetary systems.

          The cosmic web's Lyman-$α$ glow at $z \approx 2.5$; varying hydrodynamic models, dust, and wide-field, narrow-band imaging detection

 - **Abstract**
 The diffuse glow of the cosmic web in Lyman-$\alpha$ emission has long been predicted, yet remained elusive to direct wide field detection. We present theoretical calculations that, when compared with recent observations made using the Condor Array Telescope in New Mexico reported in Lanzetta et al. 2024, point to its discovery at $z \approx 2.5$. Synthetic Lyman-$\alpha$ surface brightness maps are constructed from five state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulations (Illustris-TNG, SIMBA, EAGLE, CROCODILE, and Sherwood), incorporating dust attenuation, star formation, collisional excitation, and recombination physics. Our cosmic web Lyman-$\alpha$ surface brightness predictions are consistent with the UV excess detected at high significance in the recent deep, wide field, narrow-band imaging Condor data. The calculations presented here thus demonstrate that diffuse Lyman-$\alpha$ emission is observable with current (and next-generation) wide field low surface brightness facilities, opening the path to direct cartographic mapping of the cosmic web. These findings mark a turning point: for the first time, cosmology moves beyond inference from absorption and high-density peaks, into panoramic imaging of the faint intergalactic scaffolding that underpins structure formation in the Universe.

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-ray Bursts (GRBs) are valuable probes of cosmic star formation reaching back into the epoch of reionization, and a large dataset with known redshifts ($z$) is an important ingredient for these studies. Usually, $z$ is measured using spectroscopy or photometry, but $\sim80\%$ of GRBs lack such data. Prompt and afterglow correlations can provide estimates in these cases, though they suffer from systematic uncertainties due to assumed cosmologies and due to detector threshold limits. We use a sample with $z$ estimated via machine learning models, based on prompt and afterglow parameters, without relying on cosmological assumptions. We then use an augmented sample of GRBs with measured and predicted redshifts, forming a larger dataset. We find that the predicted redshifts are a crucial step forward in understanding the evolution of GRB properties. We test three cases: no evolution, an evolution of the beaming factor, and an evolution of all terms captured by an evolution factor $(1+z)^\delta$. We find that these cases can explain the density rate in the redshift range between 1-2, but neither of the cases can explain the derived rate densities at smaller and higher redshifts, which may point towards an evolution term different than a simple power law. Another possibility is that this mismatch is due to the non-homogeneity of the sample, e.g., a non-collapsar origin of some long GRB within the sample.

 Future gamma-ray survey instruments, such as newASTROGAM and AMEGO-X, will significantly improve previous and current all-sky surveys at MeV energies. In this paper we discuss the continuum emission from the Milky Way, two prominent large extended sources, the Fermi bubbles and Loop I, and the extragalactic gamma-ray background. We highlight the importance of measurements in the MeV to GeV energy range for understanding CR production and propagation in the Galaxy, for the determination of the nature of the Fermi bubbles and Loop I, and for exploring the origin of the extragalactic gamma-ray background.

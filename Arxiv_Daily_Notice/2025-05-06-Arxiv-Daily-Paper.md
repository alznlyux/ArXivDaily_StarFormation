 - **Abstract**
 In this paper we present the latest results of our ongoing multiplicity survey of (Community) TESS Objects of Interest, using astrometry and photometry from the latest data release of the ESA Gaia mission to detect stellar companions of these stars and to characterize their properties. A total of 92 binary and two hierarchical triple star systems are identified among the 745 target stars whose multiplicity is explored in this study, all at distances of less than 500pc around the Sun. As expected for components of gravitationally bound star systems, the targets and the detected companions are at the same distance and share a common proper motion, as shown by their accurate Gaia astrometry. The companions have masses of about 0.12 to 1.6$M_\odot$. and are most frequently found in the mass range up to 0.6$M_\odot$. The companions have projected separations from the targets between about 110 and 9600au. Their frequency is highest and constant from about 300 to 800au, decreasing at larger projected separations. In addition to main sequence stars, five white dwarf companions are detected in this study, whose true nature is unveiled by their photometric properties.

          A XRISM Observation of the Archetypal Radio-Mode Feedback System Hydra-A: Measurements of Atmospheric Motion and Constraints on Turbulent Dissipation

 - **Abstract**
 We present XRISM Resolve observations centered on Hydra-A, a redshift z = 0.054 brightest cluster galaxy which hosts one of the largest and most powerful FR-I radio sources in the nearby Universe. We examine the effects of its high jet power on the velocity structure of the cluster's hot atmosphere. Hydra-A's central radio jets have inflated X-ray cavities with energies upward of $10^{61}~\rm erg$. They reach altitudes of 225 kpc from the cluster center, well beyond the atmosphere's central cooling region. Resolve's $3\times3$ arcmin field-of-view covers $190\times190$ kpc, which encompasses most of the cooling volume. We find a one dimensional atmospheric velocity dispersion across the volume of $164\pm10\,\rm{km\,s}^{-1}$. The fraction in isotropic turbulence or unresolved bulk velocity is unknown. Assuming pure isotropic turbulence, the turbulent kinetic energy is $2.5\,\%$ of the thermal energy radiated away over the cooling timescale, implying that kinetic energy must be supplied continually to offset cooling. While Hydra-A's radio jets are powerful enough to supply kinetic energy to the atmosphere at the observed level, turbulent dissipation alone would struggle to offset cooling throughout the cooling volume. The central galaxy's radial velocity is similar to the atmospheric velocity, with an offset of $-37 \pm 23\,$ km s$^{-1}$.

          Seismic Oscillations Excited by Giant Impacts in Directly-Imaged Giant Planets

 - **Abstract**
 The radii and masses of many giant exoplanets imply their interiors each contain more than $\sim$100 $M_\oplus$ of solids. A large metal content may arise when a giant planet grows by colliding and merging with multiple $\sim$10 $M_\oplus$ solid cores. Here we show that a giant impact with a young gas giant excites long-lived seismic oscillations that can be detected photometrically. Mode lifetimes are close to the planet's Kelvin-Helmholtz time, a significant fraction of a young planet's age. Oscillation periods lie between tens of minutes to an hour, and variability amplitudes can exceed a percent for several million years. Beta Pictoris b is a young super-Jupiter known to be highly metal-enriched. If a Neptune-mass (17 $M_\oplus$) body impacted $\beta$ Pictoris b in the past $\sim$9--18 Myr, the planet could still be ringing with a percent-level photometric variability measurable with JWST.

          An extremely metal-poor Lyman-$α$ emitter candidate at $z=6$ revealed through absorption spectroscopy

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of a Lyman $\alpha$ emitter (LAE) candidate in the immediate foreground of the quasar PSO J158-14 at $z_{\rm QSO}=6.0685$ at a projected distance $\sim29\ {\rm pkpc}$ that is associated with an extremely metal-poor absorption system. This system was found in archival observations of the quasar field with the Very Large Telescope/Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (VLT/MUSE) and was previously missed in searches of absorption systems using quasar absorption line spectroscopy as it imparts no detectable metal absorption lines on the background quasar spectrum. The detected Ly$\alpha$ emission line at a redshift of $z_{\rm LAE}=6.0323$ is well aligned with the outer edge of the quasar's proximity zone and can plausibly cause its observed damping wing if it is associated with a proximate sub-damped Ly$\alpha$ absorption system with a column density of $\log {N_{\rm HI} / {\rm cm}^{-2}} \approx 19.8$. A $>10$ hour medium-resolution spectrum of the quasar observed with the Magellan/Folded-port InfraRed Echellette (FIRE) and VLT/X-Shooter spectrographs reveals a metallicity constraint of ${\rm [Z/H]} < -3$. Such low metallicity makes this system an extremely metal-poor galaxy candidate and provides an exciting site to study possible signatures of Population III stars.

 - **Abstract**
 As dark matter appears to comprise most of the Galactic mass, some of it may accumulate in the cores of stars, thereby making the Sun a laboratory for constraining various dark matter theories. We consider the effects on the solar structure arising from a general class of macroscopic dark matter candidates that include strange quark matter, compact dark objects, and others. We calibrate standard solar evolution models (i.e., models that reproduce the mass, luminosity, radius, and metallicity of the Sun at its present age) with variable compact dark core masses ranging from $10^{-8}$ to $10^{-2}~\rm{M}_\odot$ and assess their properties. We find that the weakest constraints come from solar neutrino flux measurements, which only rule out the most massive dark core comprising at least $\sim 1\%$ of the total solar mass. The Sun's acoustic oscillations impose stronger constraints, probing masses down to $\sim 10^{-5}~\rm{M}_\odot$. We find that a model with a $10^{-3}~\rm{M}_\odot$ dark core appears to improve the agreement with helioseismic observations. We nevertheless caution against interpreting this as evidence for dark matter in the solar interior, and suggest plausible effects that the dark core may instead be emulating. Finally, we show that future measurements of solar $g$~modes may constrain dark core masses down to $10^{-7}~\rm{M}_\odot$.

 - **Abstract**
 The evolution of binary stellar systems involves a wide range of physical processes, many of which are not yet well understood. We aim to build a general-purpose algorithm based on inverse population synthesis techniques, able to reconstruct the past history of binary systems. This algorithm will be applied to a sample of eclipsing binaries, aiming to ascertain their progenitors and past histories. Once validated, it was applied to a sample 30 white dwarf plus main-sequence eclipsing binaries observed by the Zwicky Transient Facility survey. We determined the input space parameters of the progenitors for the 30 eclipsing binary systems to which the algorithm was applied. These parameters included the initial primary and secondary masses, the orbital separation and eccentricity, the common-envelope efficiency ($\alpha_{\rm CE}$), and the age at which the system was formed. Furthermore, the analysis of the global properties revealed some important features: a mild anticorrelation between the common-envelope efficiency parameter and the secondary mass, the absence of a universal value of $\alpha_{\rm CE}$ along with no need for internal energy, although in the low-mass regime, the high values of $\alpha_{\rm CE}$ suggest a possible contribution, and an initial thermalized eccentricity distribution. Although a strong degeneracy among the input parameters exists in the reconstruction of post-common envelope binary systems, the high accuracy obtained for the eclipsing-binary systems analyzed here has allowed our algorithm to make a reasonable determination of the initial parameters without the need to include external constraints. The global properties found here so far, can be substantially improved when analyzing a future volume-complete sample.

          ACT DR6 Insights on the Inflationary Attractor models and Reheating

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the observational constraints on $\alpha$-attractor inflationary models and their post-inflationary reheating dynamics in light of the latest CMB data from ACT DR6 combined with Planck18, BICEP/$Keck$ 2018, and DESI (collectively denoted P-ACT-LB-BK18). Focusing on both E and T type attractor potentials, we analyze how inflationary observables namely the scalar spectral index $n_s$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ are indirectly influenced by reheating parameters such as the reheating temperature $T_{\text{RH}}$, the inflaton equation-of-state $w_\phi$, and the inflaton's couplings to Starndard Model particles. We incorporate indirect constraints from the overproduction of primordial gravitational waves (PGWs), particularly via $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ bounds on BBN, which become significant for stiff post-inflationary dynamics. Our results show that E-models permit a wide range of reheating scenarios, including matter-like reheating ($w_\phi = 0$), while T-models are viable only for $w_\phi \gtrsim 0.44$. We derive bounds on inflaton-Standard Model couplings for both decay and scattering channels and identify parameter regimes compatible with recent ACT data for successful reheating. These findings establish a robust connection between inflationary theory, thermal history, and particle phenomenology, and provide predictive targets for future CMB missions.

 - **Abstract**
 We present new {\it JWST}/MIRI MRS and Keck spectra of SN 1995N obtained in 2022--2023, more than 10,000 days after the supernova (SN) explosion. These spectra are among the latest direct detections of a core-collapse SN, both through emission lines in the optical and thermal continuum from infrared dust emission. The new infrared data show that dust heating from radiation produced by the ejecta interacting with circumstellar matter is still present, but greatly reduced from when SN 1995N was observed by the {\it Spitzer Space Telescope} and {\it WISE} in 2009/2010 and 2018, when the dust mass was estimated to be 0.4 M(Sun). New radiative-transfer modeling suggests that the dust mass and grain size may have increased between 2010 and 2023. The new data can alternatively be well fit with a dust mass of 0.4 M(Sun) and a much reduced heating source luminosity. The new late-time spectra show unusually strong oxygen forbidden lines, stronger than the H-alpha emission. This indicates that SN 1995N may have exploded as a stripped-envelope SN which then interacted with a massive H-rich circumstellar shell, changing it from intrinsically Type Ib/c to Type IIn. The late-time spectrum results when the reverse shock begins to excite the inner H-poor, O-rich ejecta. This change in the spectrum is rarely seen, but marks the start of the transition from SN to SN remnant.

          Physical properties and gas kinematics of massive star forming region G328.24$-$0.55

 - **Abstract**
 This study presents the results of ALMA band 6 archival data of G328.24$-$0.55, with the aim to pin down the physical and kinematic properties of young stellar objects (YSOs) in G328.24$-$0.55 star forming region. The dust continuum image reveals 5 protostellar objects (MM1a, MM1b, MM1c, MM2 and MM3), with MM1a dominating the region. The dust continuum peaks do not coincide with the strongest radio continuum peak previously detected in the region in a MeerKAT observation, but coincide with the weaker MeerKAT peak. The dust continuum objects are associated with faint unresolved infrared emission. We detected 70, 49, 26, 7 and 8 molecular transitions toward MM1a, MM1b, MM1c, MM2 and MM3, respectively. This variation in the number of detected molecular transitions supports different excitation conditions in these objects. The excitation temperatures estimated toward MM1a, MM1b and MM1c are $\sim$ 183, 168 and 110\,K, respectively. MM2 and MM3 lack multiple transitions of molecular lines to determine their excitation temperatures. The masses of MM1a, MM1b, MM1c, MM2 and MM3 were calculated to be 23.2, 16.1, 12.0, 9.8 and 14.9$M_{\odot}$, respectively. The velocity gradient of CH$_{3}$OH ($10_{2,8}-9_{3,7}$) emission traces a rotating structure, probably an envelope of gas around MM1a. Bipolar outflow traced by CO emission is seen towards MM1a. The properties of MM1a clearly point to the existence of a massive protostellar object that is still undergoing accretion and outflow in its early formative stage.

 - **Abstract**
 The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey uses an automatic spectral classification pipeline to classify spectra. QuasarNET is a convolutional neural network used as part of this pipeline originally trained using data from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS). In this paper we implement an active learning algorithm to optimally select spectra to use for training a new version of the QuasarNET weights file using only DESI data, specifically to improve classification accuracy. This active learning algorithm includes a novel outlier rejection step using a Self-Organizing Map to ensure we label spectra representative of the larger quasar sample observed in DESI. We perform two iterations of the active learning pipeline, assembling a final dataset of 5600 labeled spectra, a small subset of the approx 1.3 million quasar targets in DESI's Data Release 1. When splitting the spectra into training and validation subsets we meet or exceed the previously trained weights file in completeness and purity calculated on the validation dataset with less than one tenth of the amount of training data. The new weights also more consistently classify objects in the same way when used on unlabeled data compared to the old weights file. In the process of improving QuasarNET's classification accuracy we discovered a systemic error in QuasarNET's redshift estimation and used our findings to improve our understanding of QuasarNET's redshifts.

          Revisiting the Hubble constant, sound horizon and cosmography from late-time Universe observations

 - **Abstract**
 The Hubble tension has become one of the central problems in cosmology. In this work, we determine the Hubble constant $H_0$ and sound horizon $r_d$ by using the combination of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAOs) from DESI surveys, time-delay lensed quasars from H0LiCOW collaborations and the Pantheon supernovae observations. We consider two cosmological approaches, i.e., Taylor series and Padé polynomials, to avoid cosmological dependence. The reason for using this combination of data is that the absolute distance provided by strong gravitational lensing helps anchor the relative distance of BAO, and supernovae provide a robust history of universe evolution. {{Combining the 6 time-delay distance (6$D_{\Delta t}$) plus 4 angular diameter distance to the deflector (4$D_d$) measurements of time-delay lensed quasars,}} the BAO and the type Ia of supernovae (SNe Ia) datasets, we obtain a model-independent result of $r_d = 138.2_{-3.9}^{+3.3}$ Mpc and $H_0 = 72.9^{+1.8}_{-1.8}$ ${\mathrm{~km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}}$ for the Taylor series cosmography and $r_d = 137.0_{-3.7}^{+3.2}$ Mpc and $H_0 = 73.1_{-1.7}^{+1.8}$ ${\mathrm{~km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}}$ for the Padé polynomials cosmography. The determination of $r_d$ and $H_0$ prefers larger $H_0$ and smaller $r_d$ than Planck data under the assumption of flat-$\Lambda$CDM model. However, the values of $H_0$ are consistent with the $H_0$ determination from SH0ES collaboration.

 - **Abstract**
 We present high-resolution observations made with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) at 5.5 GHz and 9.0 GHz of a sample of twenty-eight massive protostars. These protostars were initially detected at radio wavelengths in the MeerKAT Galactic Plane Survey at 1.3 GHz, where they were unresolved with an angular resolution of approximately 8 arcseconds. The resolution of the ATCA observations at 5.5 GHz and 9.0 GHz are significantly higher at, 2.0 and 1.2 arc seconds, respectively. The highest angular resolution corresponds to a linear resolution of 1920 AU for our nearest object. This improvement in resolution enabled us to resolve the components of extended emission and to more accurately determine the nature of the objects. Approximately 80% of the detections were classified as jets with 68% of the jets found to be associated with non-thermal emission.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an investigation of the L-band emission from known massive young stellar objects (MYSOs) in the SARAO MeerKAT Galactic Plane Survey to search for non-thermal radio emitters in the sample. A total of 398 massive protostars, identified from the Red MSX Source (RMS) survey, are located within the survey region. Among these, 162 fields that host the protostars are isolated from nearby bright HII regions, allowing for the study of any ionized jets present. Seventy-one of these fields have jets with five-sigma detections or higher, corresponding to a detection rate of 44%. The MeerKAT fluxes of the detections, together with the upper limits of the non-detections and any other fluxes from previous observations, were used to estimate the spectral indices of the jets, and to search for the presence of non-thermal radiation. In cases where a source manifests as single in a given observation but is resolved into multiple components in observations of higher resolutions, the sum of the fluxes of the resolved components was used in estimating the indices. Any e!ects from missing flux in higher-resolution observations were incorporated into the index uncertainties. The spectral indices of the sample show that at least 50% of the jets emit non-thermal radiation. Additionally, the spectral energy distribution (SED) of some of the sources, as well as their radio luminosities exhibit evidence of non-thermal emission, especially in extended sources.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we carry out multiwavelength and multiview observations of the eruption of an intermediate prominence originating from the farside of the Sun on 2023 March 12. The southeast footpoint of the prominence is located in active region (AR) 13252. The eruption generates a B7.8 class flare and a partial halo coronal mass ejection (CME). The prominence takes off at 02:00 UT and accelerates for nearly three hours. Rotation of the southeast leg of the prominence in the counterclockwise direction is revealed by spectroscopic and imaging observations. The apex of the prominence changes from a smooth loop to a cusp structure during the rising motion and the northwest leg displays a drift motion after 04:30 UT, implying a writhing motion. Hence, the prominence eruption is most likely triggered by ideal kink instability. For the first time, we apply the Graduated Cylindrical Shell (GCS) modeling in three-dimensional reconstruction and tracking of the prominence for nearly two hours. Both the source region (110$\degr$E, 43$\degr$N) and northwest footpoint (162$\degr$E, 44$\degr$N) are located. The edge-on and face-on angular widths of the prominence are $\sim$6$\degr$ and $\sim$86$\degr$, respectively. The axis has a tilt angle of $\sim$70$\degr$ with the meridian. The heliocentric distance of the prominence leading edge increases from $\sim$1.26\,$R_{\sun}$ to $\sim$2.27\,$R_{\sun}$. The true speed of the CME increases from $\sim$610 to $\sim$849 km s$^{-1}$.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, the minimum orbit intersection distances (MOIDs) of near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) over the next 200 years were computed and analyzed in detail. It was shown that the MOID of a NEA relative to the Earth-Moon barycenter (EMB) is usually a superior metric for predicting a potential impact than that relative to the Earth. Subsequently, a novel MOID Evolution Index (MEI) spanning from 0.0 to 9.9 was proposed and the orbits of NEAs are classified into 100 distinct categories by considering the variations of the MOID over time, which is useful for quickly screening and prioritizing hazardous asteroids for future research. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that a linear fitting to the MOID evolution provides a simple yet valid approach for most of the NEAs, which is useful for quickly estimating the MOID value without the need to perform an orbit propagation. As a result, a scheme with several parameters was proposed to characterize the MOID variations as well as the relative position information of the critical points along the orbits associated with the minimum distances. A database incorporating these parameters and the MEI values was therefore established for the cataloged NEAs, enabling the derivation of statistically constrained upper bounds for secular MOID drift rate as function of the semi-major axes. Finally, some special orbital configurations and dynamical mechanisms that may lead to a large deviation from the linear fit or multiple orbit crossings were also investigated, indicating the intricate nature in the patterns of MOID evolution for some NEAs.

          RVSNUpy: A Python Package for Spectroscopic Redshift Measurement Based on Cross-Correlation

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce RVSNUpy, a new Python package designed to measure spectroscopic redshifts. Based on inverse-variance weighted cross-correlation, RVSNUpy determines the redshifts by comparing observed spectra with various rest-frame template spectra. We test the performance of RVSNUpy based on ~ 6000 objects in the HectoMAP redshift survey observed with both SDSS and MMT/Hectospec. We demonstrate that a slight redshift offset (~ 40 km/s) between SDSS and MMT/Hectospec measurements reported from previous studies results from the small offsets in the redshift template spectra used for SDSS and Hectospec reductions. We construct the universal set of template spectra, including empirical SDSS template spectra, carefully calibrated to the rest frame. Our test for the HectoMAP objects with duplicated observations shows that RVSNUpy with the universal template spectra yields the homogeneous redshift from the spectra obtained with different spectrographs. We highlight that RVSNUpy is a powerful redshift measurement tool for current and future large-scale spectroscopy surveys, including A-SPEC, DESI, 4MOST, and Subaru/PFS.

 - **Abstract**
 NGC2261 is a reflection nebula illuminated by the young star R Monocerotis. Objects moving near the star occasionally cast shadows on the nebula, giving rise to its alternative name: Hubble's Variable Nebula. For 7 years since Spring 2017 robotic telescopes have been used to compile a roughly twice-weekly record of changes in the object. The results, over 1000 images at separate epochs, have been compiled into a movie. This shows that, as well as the large scale but infrequent variability for which it is famous, the nebula is continually traversed by low level `ripples' of light and dark. These record changes in the light output from R Mon and analysis of their progress indicates that the reflecting material takes the form of a thin (<3x10^16cm) screen whose shape resembles a half paraboloid, rooted at the star and bowed towards us. The brightness of the screen in Herschel far-IR maps indicates a density n_H> 1.7x10^5cm^-3 and CO observations show the material is moving towards us at a few km/s relative to the rest cloud, consistent it with being a dense shell of material displaced by R~Mon's outflow. The results demonstrate the value of studying such objects in the time domain, and are a glimpse of what will be achieved by instruments like the Zwicky Transient Facility and Vera Rubin Observatory.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic rays and cosmic ray induced photons are vital components of chemical evolution in areas of interstellar medium that are impenetrable by external ultraviolet radiation. However, rates of reactions with cosmic ray induced photons used in astrochemical models were calculated for molecular clouds and can be different in protoplanetary discs, where dust grows up to larger sizes. Using ANDES astrochemical model, we study how an increase in both upper dust size and rates of reactions with cosmic ray induced photons can influence species abundances in protoplanetary discs. We show that the increase in these reactions' rates has a significant impact on the ice mass fraction in area between 2 and 20 au but has little impact on ionisation degree in disc.

 - **Abstract**
 Simultaneous optical and ionosonde detections of meteors offer a great opportunity to measure the transient physical properties of the meteor's ionization trail. One of the key parameters of the ionization trail is its true geometric height above the surface of the Earth, which can be determined from the trajectory of the optical meteors by multi-site measurements. During the peak of the 2019 Geminid shower we looked for optical meteors among the Konkoly Meteor Observatory Network data taken at ELTE Gothard Observatory, Szombathely, and contemporaneous meteor signals detected by the DPS-4D type ionosonde (Digisonde) operating at Széchenyi István Geophysical Observatory (SZIGO), Nagycenk, Hungary. From the 2 simultaneous detections we inferred the atmospheric height of the meteors using the method of intersecting planes. The results, about 90 and 85 km, are consistent with the detection limit (above 80 km) of the Digisonde.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first results from long-term high-cadence spectroscopic monitoring of 15 PG quasars with relatively strong Fe II emission as a part of a broader reverberation mapping campaign performed with the Calar Alto Observatory 2.2m telescope. The $V$-band, 5100 Å continuum, and H$\beta$ broad emission line light curves were measured for a set of quasars for between dozens to more than a hundred epochs from May 2017 to July 2020. Accurate time lags between the variations of the H$\beta$ broad line fluxes and the optical continuum strength are obtained for all 15 quasars, ranging from $17.0_{-3.2}^{+2.5}$ to $95.9_{-23.9}^{+7.1}$ days in the rest frame. The virial masses of the central supermassive black holes are derived for all 15 quasars, ranging between $0.50_{-0.19}^{+0.18}$ and $19.17_{-2.73}^{+2.98}$ in units of $10^7 M_\odot$. For 11 of the objects in our sample, this is the first reverberation analysis published. Of the rest, two objects have been the subject of previous reverberation studies, but we determine time lags for these that are only half as long as found in the earlier investigations, which had only been able to sample much more sparsely. The remaining two objects have previously been monitored with high sampling rates. Our results here are consistent with the earlier findings in the sense that the time lag and the line width vary inversely consistent with virialization.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the results of a long-duration high-cadence reverberation mapping campaign of a second batch of 11 PG quasars using the 2.2m telescope at the Calar Alto Observatory. This follows a similar earlier study of another sample of 15 objects reported by Hu et al. (2021). Among the 11 PG quasars, 8 objects have the H$\beta$ time lags measured for the first time, while the other 3 objects were observed in previous campaigns, but only had highly uncertain H$\beta$-lag measurements. Long-term light curves are presented of photometric $V$-band, spectroscopic 5100 Å continuum, and the H$\beta$ emission line, lasting for $\sim$3--6 years with a cadence of $\sim$6--14 days. Accurate H$\beta$ time lags ranging from $\sim$20 to 150 days in the rest frame are obtained. The estimated virial masses of the central supermassive black holes range from $\sim$(3--300)$\times10^7 M_\odot$. Combining these results with those reported in Hu et al. (2021), we now have 26 PG quasars, with representative properties, having reliable H$\beta$ time-lag measurements from our long-duration high-cadence campaign. A tentative fit to the relation between the H$\beta$ time lag and the continuum luminosity for these 26 objects gives a slope of 0.53.

 - **Abstract**
 The transformation of radiation signals (e.g., photon occupation number and integrated intensity) between moving frames is a common task is physics, astrophysics and cosmology. Here we show that the required boost operator, relating the frequency-dependent spin-weighted spherical harmonic coefficients of the considered observable between the frames, is directly given by the aberration kernel with the Doppler weight parameter being replaced by a differential operator. The aberration kernel has been previously studied in great detail, meaning that this simplification allows us to directly compute the boost operator using the expressions of the aberration kernel. As a preparatory step, we generalize the differential equation that determines the aberration kernel to general Doppler weight. This avoids the intermediate step of Doppler-weight raising and lowering operations in computations of the boost operator. We then clarify all the properties of the boost operator (e.g., raising and lowering operations, symmetries and commutation relations) and derive a formal operator differential equation for the boost operator. This differential equation allows us to quickly generate the boost operator for which we give exact expressions up to second order in v/c. For illustration, we then apply the boost operator to transformations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), validating that measurements of the lowest CMB multipoles do not allow determining the amplitude of the primordial CMB dipole. We also derive the kinematic corrections to the Thomson scattering process (to all orders in v/c), giving explicit expressions up to second order in v/c, showcasing an application of the boost operator in radiative transfer problems.

 - **Abstract**
 The new method for aerosol measurement using wide-field stellar photometry was originally developed for B-filter data. The dependence of VAOD (vertical aerosol optical depth) on wavelength can be used to understand the physical characteristics of aerosol. The method has been extended for V and R filters using the Gaia stellar photometric catalog as the reference. We calculated the coefficients of the equation describing molecular and aerosol extinction of the atmosphere. For data in a particular filter, they depend on the telescope's location. Light towards shorter wavelengths has higher extinction. The VAOD, calculated in B, V, and R filters does not show monotonous dependence on wavelength, and there is increased dependence on the photometric methods for V and R filters. We studied the possible reasons for this unexpected behavior.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent DESI DR2 baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurement shows inconsistency with the cosmic microwave background (CMB) observation in $\Lambda$CDM. We used the Bayesian suspiciousness and goodness-of-fit tension metrics to quantify the significance of the tension. Both tension metrics consistently confirm a $\sim2\sigma$ tension between DESI BAO and CMB. We identified the key assumptions of $\Lambda$CDM underlying the tension between BAO and CMB. If the tension is physical, one or multiple of the assumptions might need to be broken by the potential new physics addressing the tension. In particular, the analysis shows that if dynamical dark energy is the only new physics behind the tension, phantom crossing is required to restore concordance between CMB and BAO.

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the impact of finite-temperature quantum gravity effects on cosmological parameters, particularly the cosmological constant $\Lambda$, by incorporating temperature-dependent quantum corrections into the Hubble parameter. For that purpose, we modify the Cosmic Linear Anisotropy Solving System. We introduce new density parameters, $\Omega_{\Lambda_2}$ and $\Omega_{\Lambda_3}$, arising from finite-temperature quantum gravity contributions, and analyze their influence on the cosmic microwave background power spectrum using advanced machine learning techniques, including artificial neural networks and stochastic optimization. Our results reveal that $\Omega_{\Lambda_3}$ assumes a negative value, consistent with dimensional regularization in renormalization and that the presence of $\Omega_{\Lambda_2}$ as well as $\Omega_{\Lambda_3}$ significantly enhances model accuracy. Numerical analyses demonstrate that the inclusion of these parameters improves the fit to 2018 Planck data, suggesting that finite-temperature quantum gravity effects play a non-negligible role in cosmological evolution. Although the Hubble tension persists, our findings highlight the potential of quantum gravitational corrections in refining cosmological models and motivate further investigation into higher-order thermal effects and polarization data constraints.

 - **Abstract**
 Episodic accretion is a fundamental process in the build-up of the stellar mass. EX Lupi-type eruptive young stars (EXors) represent one of the main types of episodic accretion. We study the recently discovered EXor Gaia23bab during its 2023 outburst. We obtained optical and near-infrared photometry and spectroscopy to probe the variation of the physical properties of Gaia23bab during its recent outburst. We also collected archival photometry to study a previous outburst of the star. We used several accretion tracers, including the Ca II triplet, He I, and various hydrogen lines from the Paschen and Brackett series, to measure the accretion rate during the outburst. The accretion rate is consistent with $\sim 2.0 \times 10^{-7} M_\odot$ $\rm{yr}^{-1}$. Comparing the line fluxes of the hydrogen Brackett series to predictions of Case B theory suggests excitation temperatures of 5000 - 10000 K and electron densities of $10^9$-$10^{10}$ cm$^{-3}$. Comparison to the predictions of a model for T Tauri stars revealed that the fluxes of the Balmer series are consistent with temperatures of 5000 - 12500 K and a hydrogen density of $10^8$ cm$^{-3}$, while the fluxes of the Paschen series are consistent with temperatures in the range between 10000 and 12500 K and a hydrogen density of $10^{11}$ cm$^{-3}$. The derived temperatures and densities confirm that Gaia23bab is a prototypical EXor, not only due to its accretion rate, but also based on the best fit temperatures and densities revealed by the detected hydrogen lines.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the degeneracy between the effects of ultra-light axion dark matter and baryonic feedback in suppressing the matter power spectrum. We forecast that galaxy shear data from the Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) could limit an axion of mass $m = 10^{-25}\,\mathrm{eV}$ to be $\lesssim 5\%$ of the dark matter, stronger than any current bound, if the interplay between axions and feedback is accurately modelled. Using a halo model emulator to construct power spectra for mixed cold and axion dark matter cosmologies, including baryonic effects, we find that galaxy shear is sensitive to axions from $10^{-27}\,\mathrm{eV}$ to $10^{-21}\,\mathrm{eV}$, with the capacity to set competitive bounds across much of this range. For axions with $m \sim 10^{-25}\,\mathrm{eV}$, the scales at which axions and feedback impact structure formation are similar, introducing a parameter degeneracy. We find that, with an external feedback constraint, we can break the degeneracy and constrain the axion transfer function, such that LSST could detect a $10^{-25}\,\mathrm{eV}$ axion comprising 10\% of the dark matter at $\sim 3 \sigma$ significance. Direct reconstruction of the non-linear matter power spectrum provides an alternative way of analysing weak lensing surveys, with the advantage of identifying the scale-dependent features in the data that the dark matter model imposes. We advocate for dedicated cosmological hydrodynamical simulations with an axion dark matter component so that upcoming galaxy and cosmic microwave background lensing surveys can disentangle the dark matter-baryon transfer function.

 - **Abstract**
 Massive stars are extremely influential objects and multiplicity has the potential to dictate how they evolve over time by causing dynamical interactions, common-envelope evolution, mergers and more. While O-star multiplicity has been studied over a broad separation range, studies of B star multiplicity are lacking despite the fact that they dominate the production of core-collapse supernovae and neutron stars. We analyse interferometric data at high-angular resolution taken with PIONIER/VLTI for a sample of 32 B stars. Using parametric modelling of the closure phases and visibilities, we determine best-fit models to each of the systems and investigate whether each source is best represented by a single star or a higher-order system. Detection limits were calculated for companions to determine if they were significant. We then combined our findings from the interferometric data with results from a literature search to see if other companions were reported at different separation ranges. We find that, within the interferometric range, 72$\pm$8\% of the B stars are resolved as multiple systems. The most common type of system is a triple system, followed by binary systems, presumably single stars and then higher-order systems. The interferometric companion fraction derived for the sample is 1.88$\pm$0.24. When accounting for the spectroscopic companions confirmed in the literature and wide companions inferred from Gaia data in addition to companions we find with interferometry, multiplicity and companion fractions of 0.88$\pm$0.06 and 2.31$\pm$0.27 respectively are obtained for our sample. The number of triple systems in particular increases significantly when accounting for spectroscopic companions, suggesting that binarity and higher-order multiplicity are integral to the evolution of B stars, as they are for O stars.

 - **Abstract**
 We aim to detect activity cycles in young main-sequence stars, analogous to the 11-year solar cycle, using combined photometric survey data. This research will enhance our understanding of how cycle periods relate to rotation rates in fast-rotating stars. We measured activity cycles for 138 G-K-type main sequence stars using combined time-series photometry spanning ~14 years. The first set of 70 stars used data from Kepler Full Frame Images (FFIs)-ASAS-SN-ZTF, and the second set of 68 stars used data from Kepler-FFIs-ZTF. Additionally, we measured the activity cycles for 25 RS CVn candidates. For our sample, we analyzed the correlation or anti-correlation between flux variations and photospheric activity, which arises due to the presence of faculae or starspots. We identified fast-rotating K-type stars that are faculae-dominated by tracking spot or faculae evolution in Kepler RMS data. Our findings reveal that fast-rotating G-K-type stars show no strong correlation between cycle length and rotation period. Previous studies have identified active and inactive branches in the cycle-rotation diagram. However, we find that G-K-type stars do not show a clear trend aligning with the active branch, with 34 per cent of stars falling within the intermediate region between the two branches, where our Sun resides. Our results highlight that the proposed distinction between the two branches may not be as definitive as previously thought, particularly regarding the active branch. Furthermore, we also detected 23 per cent of young Sun-like stars in the intermediate region, where our Sun is located, implying that our Sun may not be unique in this regard.

 - **Abstract**
 The Higgs inflation model with nonminimal coupling, while disfavored by the 1$\sigma$ region of the latest Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) observational data, can be reconciled with the ACT data by incorporating the effects of reheating. In this paper, we consider reheating with a constant equation of state $w_{re}$. To simultaneously satisfy the ACT data and ensure that the temperature at the end of reheating is above the threshold required for Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, we find that the equation of state must satisfy $w_{re} \gtrsim 2/3$. For the special cases of $w_{ re} = 2/3$ and $w_{ re} = 1$, the number of e-folds during reheating must lie within the ranges $31.6 \leq N_{ re} \leq 32.8$ and $15.8 \leq N_{ re} \leq 27.3$, respectively. Our findings suggest that by considering reheating, a wide range of inflationary models, such as $R^2$ inflation, hilltop inflation, E-model inflation, and T-model inflation, can also be made consistent with the ACT observational data.

 - **Abstract**
 The formation of complex organic molecules in the interstellar medium (ISM) is central to astrochemistry and prebiotic chemistry, as these species may act as precursors to biomolecules essential for life. Although glyceraldehyde (HOCH2CH(OH)C(O)H, GCA) has not yet been detected in the ISM, the presence of structurally related compounds in various astronomical environments suggests that it may form under interstellar conditions. In this study, we employed the automated reaction discovery tool AutoMeKin to systematically explore the gas-phase chemical reaction networks (CRNs) of C3H6O3 (GCA), C3H7O3 (a hydrogenated analog), and C2H5O2. Reaction pathways were characterized at the wB97XD/Def2-TZVPP level of theory, and rate coefficients for key processes were computed using the competitive canonical unified statistical (CCUS) model, which accounts for multiple dynamic bottlenecks. Our analysis revealed several barrierless pathways leading to GCA or to GCA and a leaving group. Notably, the reaction between glyoxal (HCOHCO) and the HOCHCH2OH radical, though neither has yet been detected in the ISM, was found to efficiently produce GCA and a formyl radical. However, aside from the aforementined exception, most GCA formation channels result in highly vibrationally excited intermediates that are more likely to undergo rapid unimolecular decomposition than to be stabilized by radiative emission under typical ISM conditions. These results suggest that while gas-phase GCA formation is chemically feasible, it is likely transient and difficult to detect directly. In contrast, alternative products such as formaldehyde, glycolaldehyde, and (Z)-ethene-1,2-diol dominate many pathways and align better with current astronomical observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Tidal disruption events (TDEs) are luminous black hole (BH) transient sources, which are detected mainly in X-ray and optical bands. It is generally believed that the X-ray emission in TDEs is produced by an accretion disc formed as the stellar debris accreted onto the central BH. The origin of the optical emission is not determined, but could be explained by the `reprocessing' model with the X-ray emission reprocessed into optical band by a surrounding optically thick envelope or outflow. In this paper, we performed radiation hydrodynamic simulations of super-Eddington accretion flow with Athena++ code in the environment of TDEs, i.e., injecting a continuous mass flow rate at the circularization radius in the form of $\dot M_{\rm inject} \propto t^{-5/3}$ for the mass supply rate. We show that a significant fraction of the matter in the accretion inflow are blowed off forming outflow, and the properties of the outflow are viewing-angle dependent. We further calculate the emergent spectra of such an inflow/outflow system for different viewing angles with the method of Monto Carlo radiative transfer. Based on the emergent spectra, we show that the observed features of TDEs, such as the X-ray and optical luminosities, the blackbody temperature of X-ray and optical emission and the corresponding emission radii, the ratio of X-ray luminosity to optical luminosity, as well as the evolution of these quantities can be explained in the framework of viewing-angle effect of super-Eddington accretion around a BH.

 - **Abstract**
 Water vapour is delivered to Saturn's stratosphere by Enceladus' plumes and subsequent diffusion in the planet system. It is expected to condense into a haze in the middle stratosphere. The hot stratospheric vortex (the `beacon') that formed as an aftermath of Saturn's Great Storm of 2010 significantly altered the temperature, composition, and circulation in Saturn's northern stratosphere. Previous photochemical models suggested haze sublimation and vertical winds as processes likely to increase the water vapour column density in the beacon. We aim to quantify the temporal evolution of stratospheric water vapour in the beacon during the storm. We mapped Saturn at 66.44 and 67.09 $\mu$m on seven occasions from July 2011 to February 2013 with the PACS instrument of the Herschel Space Observatory. The observations probe the millibar levels, at which the water condensation region was altered by the warmer temperatures in the beacon. Using radiative transfer modelling, we tested several empirical and physically based models to constrain the cause of the enhanced water emission found in the beacon. The observations show an increased emission in the beacon that cannot be reproduced only accounting for the warmer temperatures. An additional source of water vapour is thus needed. We find a factor (7.5$\pm$1.6) increase in the water column in the beacon compared to pre-storm conditions using empirical models. Combining our results with a cloud formation model for July 2011, we evaluate the sublimation contribution to 45-85% of the extra column derived from the water emission increase in the beacon. The observations confirm that the storm conditions enhanced the water abundance at the millibar levels because of haze sublimation and vertical winds in the beacon. Future work on the haze temporal evolution during the storm will help to better constrain the sublimation contribution over time.

 We study the secular periodic evolution of quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) for GSN069 and eRO-QPE2 assuming that they are driven by star-disc collisions. We set up numerical simulations and compared them with the observed periodic decay of $\sim -3160\pm720$ s yr$^{-1}$ in GSN069 and $\sim -370\pm40$ s yr$^{-1}$ in eRO-QPE2. We find that: (1) Stellar mass black holes are unlikely the orbiters in these two sources, as their periodic decay are on the order of $<10$ s yr$^{-1}$; (2) A naked degenerate core (including white dwarf) is unlikely the orbiter in GSN069, as the decay is on the order of $<200$ s yr$^{-1}$. However, it is possible in eRO-QPE2, although the required surface density of the accretion disc is relatively high (e.g., $\Sigma\gtrsim10^7\sim 10^8$ g cm$^{-2}$); (3) Both the orbiters in GSN069 and eRO-QPE2 can be solar-like main-sequence stars (MSs). However, each collision can lead to gradual ablation of the stellar envelope in the order of $10^{-5}\sim 10^{-3}M_\odot$. To reproduce the observed decay while surviving for $\gtrsim 3$ yr, the surface density of the disc needs to be within a certain range. For example, given a $1M_\odot$ MS orbiter the surface density of the disc gas should be in the range of $3\times10^5\sim 2\times10^6$g cm$^{-2}$ for GSN069 or $5\times10^4\sim 10^6$ g cm$^{-2}$ for eRO-QPE2. In both of these two sources, the MS can not survive for more than $\sim 12$ yr. We expect that future observations of these two sources can help to distinguish whether the orbiters are degenerated compact objects or gaseous stars.

 - **Abstract**
 We describe a new method to incorporate thermonuclear heating in the envelope of accreting neutron star into long term simulations of their thermal evolution. We obtain boundary conditions for the heat exchange between the envelope and the crust based on stationary models which include nuclear burning and validate these values comparing to the results of the time-dependent code \texttt{MESA}. These simple boundary conditions allow us to explore a large parameter space. We quantify the amount of heat flowing from the envelope into the crust, or viceversa, depending on the mass accretion rate, outburst duration and duty cycle, and especially crust/core physical parameters such as impurities, crustal heating, and neutrino cooling rate.

 - **Abstract**
 Supernova observations imply the presence of a dense and asymmetric circumstellar environment around SN Type II progenitors, whereas the mass loss from these progenitors, namely, red supergiants, is still poorly constrained. We aim to characterise the dust and gas in the circumstellar environment of the extreme Galactic red supergiant \nmlcyg in terms of mass, morphology, and kinematics. Based on interferometric observations with NOEMA at 230 GHz we estimated dust masses and temperatures, and measured the extent and morphological complexity of the circumstellar environment. We detected two strong continuum components, amounting to an estimated total dust mass of $\sim2\times10^{-3}M_{\odot}$ located out to ~2000 AU from the star, largely beyond the dust detected at optical/infrared wavelengths. The extent of the detected CO emission supports the notion that the outflow is formed by a mass-loss rate of several $10^{-4}\,M_{\odot}$/year and that it is not primarily shaped by extreme irradiation from the Cyg OB2 cluster it has been associated with. We have detected, but not resolved, previously unseen high-velocity components close to the star. The observations reveal a very complex circumstellar morphology and we propose that some of the detected components could be the imprint of a hitherto unknown binary companion.

 - **Abstract**
 We show that the latest empirical constraints on cosmology from a combination of DESI, CMB and supernova data, can be accounted for if a small component of dark matter has an evolving and oscillating equation of state within $-1<w<1$. From a fundamental physics perspective, this interpretation is more appealing than an evolving phantom dark energy with $w<-1$, which violates the null energy condition.

          Baryon Acoustic Oscillations from a Different Angle

 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents an alternative way of analysing Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) distance measurements via rotations to define new quantities Dperp and Dpar. These quantities allow simple tests of consistency with the Planck LCDM cosmology. The parameter Dperp is determined with negligible uncertainty from Planck under the assumption of LCDM. Comparing with measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), we find that the measurements of Dperp from Data Release 2 (DR2) move into significantly better agreement with the Planck LCDM cosmology compared to DESI Data Release 1 (DR1). The quantity in the orthogonal direction Dpar provides a measure of the physical matter density omega_m in the LCDM cosmology. The DR2 measurements of Dpar\ also come into better agreement with Planck LCDM compared to the earlier DR1 results. From the comparison of Planck and DESI BAO measurements, we find no significant evidence in support of evolving dark energy. We also investigate a rotation in the theory space of the w_0 and w_a parameterization of the dark energy equation-of-state w(z). We show that the combination of DESI BAO measurements and the CMB constrain w(z=0.5) = -0.996 pm 0.046, i.e. very close to the value expected for a cosmological constant. We present a critique of the statistical methodology employed by the DESI collaboration and argue that it gives a misleading impression of the evidence in favour of evolving dark energy. An Appendix shows that the cosmological parameters determined from the Dark Energy Survey 5 Year supernova sample are in tension with those from DESI DR2 and parameters determined by Planck.

          A random walk model for the evolution of the halo spin vector

 - **Abstract**
 We follow the spin vector evolutions of well resolved dark matter haloes (containing more than 300 particles) in merger tree main branches from the Millennium and Millennium-II N-body simulations, from z about 3.3 to z = 0. We find that there seems to be a characteristic plane for the spin vector evolution along each main branch. In the direction perpendicular to it, spin vectors oscillate around the plane, while within the plane, spin vectors show a coherent direction change as well as a diffusion in direction (possibly corresponds to a Gaussian white noise). This plane may reflect the geometry of surrounding large-scale structures. We also construct a simple stochastic model in which halo spin vector evolution is assumed to be driven by accretion of halo mass and angular momentum. This model can reproduce major features of the results from N-body simulations.

          Noble gas depletion on Titan: Clathrate sequestration during the open ocean phase

 - **Abstract**
 A plausible explanation for the absence of primordial argon, krypton, and xenon in Titan's current atmosphere is that these gases were sequestered in clathrate hydrates during Titan's "open-ocean" phase. We examine how clathrate hydrate formation at Titan's ocean surface in its early history may have contributed to noble gas depletion in the primordial atmosphere. Starting with vapor-liquid equilibrium modeling between water and volatiles, we used a statistical thermodynamic model to determine the clathrate hydrate crust thickness needed to deplete the primordial atmosphere of noble gases. Our computations suggest that if Titan's volatile budget was delivered by icy planetesimals with a comet-like composition, its primordial atmosphere should be rich in CO$_2$ and CH$_4$, with NH$_3$ largely retained in water as ions. We show that at 273.15 K, a clathrate crust tens of kilometers thick would deplete the primordial atmosphere of xenon and krypton. The lack of primordial argon in Titan's atmosphere may result from the partial de-volatilization of its accreted materials.

 - **Abstract**
 We report discoveries of bow-shock nebulae, seen in Halpha and [O III] 5007, around two cataclysmic variables (CVs): LS Pegasi and ASASSN-V J205457.73+515731.9 (hereafter ASASJ2054). Additionally, both stars lie near the edges of faint extended Halpha-emitting nebulae. The orientations of the bow shocks are consistent with the directions of the objects' proper motions. The properties of LS Peg and ASASJ2054, and of their nebulae, are remarkably similar to those of SY Cancri, which we described in a recent paper; SY Cnc is a CV likewise associated with a bow shock and an off-center Halpha nebula. These objects join V341 Arae and BZ Camelopardalis, CVs that are also accompanied by similar nebulae. All five stars belong to the nova-like variable (NLV) subclass of CVs, characterized by luminous optically thick accretion disks that launch fast winds into the surrounding space. We suggest that the bow shocks and nebulae result from chance encounters of the NLVs with interstellar gas clouds, with the stars leaving in their wakes Stromgren zones that are recombining after being photoionized by the CVs' ultraviolet and X-ray radiation. Our discoveries illustrate the power of small telescopes equipped with modern instrumentation, and used to accumulate extremely long exposure times, for the detection of very low-surface-brightness nebulae.

 - **Abstract**
 The detection and characterization of habitable planets around nearby stars persist as one of the foremost objectives in contemporary astrophysics. This work investigates the synergistic integration of astrometric and direct imaging techniques by capitalizing on the complementary capabilities of the Closeby Habitable Exoplanet Survey (CHES) and Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO). Planetary brightness and position vary over time due to phase effects and orbital architectures, information that can be precisely provided by CHES's astrometric measurements. By combining the precise orbital constraints from CHES with the imaging capabilities of HWO, we evaluate the improvements in detection efficiency, signal-to-noise ratio and overall planet yield. Completeness is quantified as the fraction of injected planets that are successfully detected, while yields are estimated for various scenarios using terrestrial planet occurrence rates derived from the Kepler dataset. Our results indicate that prior astrometric data significantly enhance detection efficiency. Under the adopted detection limit, our analysis indicates that prior CHES observations can increase completeness by approximately 10% and improve detection efficiency by factors ranging from two to thirty. The findings underscore the importance of interdisciplinary approaches in the search for and characterization of habitable worlds.

 We present a measurement of the $B$-mode polarization power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background anisotropies at 32 $\le$ $\ell$ $<$ 502 for three bands centered at 95, 150, and 220 GHz using data from the SPT-3G receiver on the South Pole Telescope. This work uses SPT-3G observations from the 2019 and 2020 winter observing seasons of a $\sim$1500 deg$^2$ patch of sky that directly overlaps with fields observed with the BICEP/Keck family of telescopes, and covers part of the proposed Simons Observatory and CMB-S4 deep fields. Employing new techniques for mitigating polarized atmospheric noise, the SPT-3G data demonstrates a white noise level of 9.3 (6.7) $\mu$K-arcmin at $\ell \sim 500$ for the 95 GHz (150 GHz) data, with a $1/\ell$ noise knee at $\ell$=128 (182). We fit the observed six auto- and cross-frequency $B$-mode power spectra to a model including lensed $\Lambda$CDM $B$-modes and a combination of Galactic and extragalactic foregrounds. This work characterizes foregrounds in the vicinity of the BICEP/Keck survey area, finding foreground power consistent with that reported by the BICEP/Keck collaboration within the same region, and a factor of $\sim$ 3 higher power over the full SPT-3G survey area. Using SPT-3G data over the BICEP/Keck survey area, we place a 95% upper limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio of $r < 0.25$ and find the statistical uncertainty on $r$ to be $\sigma(r) = 0.067$.

          The Rapidly--Changing Period of the QPE Source 1ES~1927+654

 - **Abstract**
 Several low--mass galaxy nuclei are observed to produce quasiperiodic eruptions (QPEs). Recently one of these systems, 1ES~1927+654, changed its quasiperiod drastically, from $\sim 18$ minutes to $\sim 7.1$ minutes, over a span of just two years. I suggest that this is an effect of von Zeipel -- Lidov -- Kozai (ZLK) cycles, where a more distant star orbits the QPE `binary' in which a white dwarf orbits a moderately massive central black hole. I show that in 1ES~1927+654 the white dwarf's orbital plane oscillates with angular amplitude $\simeq 71^{\circ}$ each side of the orbital plane of the distant star. This causes correlated changes of the orbital eccentricity and quasiperiod, and of the accretion luminosity driven by gravitational radiation losses. The GR luminosity has the characteristic property that it is inversely proportional to the instantaneous binary quasiperiod in all cases. The QPE system is probably just one of the effects produced by a complex infall event involving several stars. The whole system is likely to evolve rapidly, and will repay further monitoring.

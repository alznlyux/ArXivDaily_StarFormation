          Determining the impact of post-main-sequence stellar evolution on the transiting giant planet population

- **Abstract**
 The post-main sequence evolution of stars is expected to impact the exoplanets residing on close-in orbits around them. Using photometric data from the TESS Full-Frame-Images we have performed a transit search for exoplanets with post-main sequence hosts to search for the imprints of these impacts on the giant planet population. We detect 130 short period planets and candidates, thirty-three of which are newly discovered candidates, from a sample of \Ntotal\ post-main sequence stars spanning the evolutionary stages from the end of the main sequence to the bottom of the red giant branch. We measure an occurrence rate of $0.28 \pm 0.04$% for short period giant planets orbiting post-main sequence stars. We also measure occurrence rates for two stellar sub-populations, measuring values of $0.35 \pm 0.05$% for a sub-population representing the earliest stages of post-main sequence evolution and $0.11^{+0.06}_{-0.05}$% for a sub-population of more evolved stars. We show that the giant planet occurrence rate decreases with increasing stellar evolution stage, with a larger occurrence rate decrease observed for shorter period planets. Our results are clear evidence that the population of short period giant planets is being sculpted by the post-main sequence evolution of the host stars, and we conclude that this is most likely through the destruction of these giant planets through the increased strength of planet-star tidal interactions resulting in the rapid tidal decay of the planets' orbits.

          Distributions and evolution of the equatorial rotation velocities of 2937 BAF-type main-sequence stars from asteroseismology

- **Abstract**
 Studies of the rotational velocities of intermediate-mass main-sequence stars are crucial for testing stellar evolution theory. They often rely on spectroscopic measurements of the projected rotation velocities. These not only suffer from the unknown projection factor but tend to ignore additional line-profile broadening mechanisms aside from rotation, such as pulsations and turbulent motions near the stellar surface. This limits the accuracy of Veq distributions. We use asteroseismic measurements to investigate the distribution of the equatorial rotation velocity, its ratio with respect to the critical rotation velocity, and the specific angular momentum for several thousands of BAF-type stars, covering a mass range from 1.3M$_\odot$ to 8.8M$_\odot$ and almost the entire core-hydrogen burning phase. We rely on high-precision model-independent internal rotation frequencies, as well as on masses and radii from asteroseismology to deduce Veq, Veq/Vcrit, and J/M for 2937 gravity-mode pulsators in the Milky Way. The sample stars have rotation frequencies between almost zero and 33$\mu$Hz, corresponding to rotation periods above 0.35d. We find that intermediate-mass stars experience a break in their J/M occurring in the mass interval $[2.3,2.7]\,$M$_\odot$. We establish unimodal Veq and Veq/Vcrit distributions for the mass range $[1.3,2.5[$M$_\odot$, while stars with $M\in[2.5,8.8]$M$_\odot$ reveal some structure in their distributions. We find that the near-core rotation slows down as stars evolve, pointing to very efficient angular momentum transport. The kernel density estimators of the asteroseismic internal rotation frequency, equatorial rotation velocity, and specific angular momentum of this large sample of intermediate-mass field stars can conveniently be used for population synthesis studies and to fine-tune the theory of stellar rotation across the main sequence evolution.

- **Abstract**
 In the era of large spectroscopic surveys, a vast amount of spectra of massive stars will be gathered and supplemented by the wealth of astrometric and photometric data provided by the Gaia satellite. Released data will mean a major step forward in the study of massive stars, giving us the chance to create statistically significant samples to explore the role of almost any parameter. In this contribution, I introduce to the community the Multi-wavelength Exploration of massIve star-forminG regions and ASsociations project (MEIGAS) and long-term plans for conducting comprehensive studies in the major galactic and near extragalactic star-forming regions and OB associations. Benefiting from current and forthcoming data from large scale spectroscopic surveys such as WEAVE and 4MOST (among others), as well as complementary observations at different wavelength ranges, the project aims to achieve crucial and complementary information to adequately characterize these regions and their stellar content, something imperative to improve our understanding of star formation and poorly known evolutionary pathways of massive stars.

- **Abstract**
 Massive stars play a fundamental role in galactic evolution through their strong stellar winds, chemical enrichment, and feedback mechanisms. Accurate modelling of their atmospheres and winds is critical for understanding their physical properties and evolutionary pathways. Traditional spectroscopic analyses often rely on the $\beta$-law approximation for wind-velocity profiles, which may not capture the complexity of observed phenomena. This study aims to introduce and validate the grId of Stellar atmOSphere and hydrodynamiC modELs for massivE Stars (ISOSCELES), a grid-based framework for the quantitative spectroscopic analysis of massive stars. The project leverages hydrodynamic wind solutions derived from the m-CAK theory, including both fast and $\delta$-slow solutions, to improve the accuracy of derived stellar and wind parameters. We constructed a comprehensive grid of models based on hydrodynamic wind solutions from the Hydwind code and synthetic spectral line profiles generated by the Fastwind code. The grid spans a broad parameter space covering OBA-type stars with solar metallicity. A semi-automatic fitting procedure was developed to analyse key spectral lines and derive the stellar and wind parameters. Applying ISOSCELES to six stars demonstrates its ability to reproduce observed spectral profiles with high fidelity. The $\delta$-slow solution proved effective for two early-type B supergiants. The grid also highlights the difference of using the $\beta$-law in modelling stellar winds compared with the m-CAK wind solutions. The ISOSCELES database represents a step forward in quantitatively analysing massive stars, offering an alternative to the $\beta$-law approximation. Future work will address the inclusion of UV lines and metallicity effects to further refine its applicability across diverse stellar populations.

          The Distribution of Earth-Impacting Interstellar Objects

- **Abstract**
 In this paper we calculate the expected orbital elements, radiants, and velocities of Earth-impacting interstellar objects. We generate a synthetic population of $\sim10^{10}$ interstellar objects with M-star kinematics in order to obtain $\sim10^4$ Earth-impactors. The relative flux of impactors arriving from the direction of the solar apex and the galactic plane is enhanced by a factor of $\sim2$ relative to the mean. The fastest impactors also arrive from these directions, although Earth-impactors are generally slower than objects in the overall population. This is because the Earth-impacting subset contains a higher fraction of low-eccentricity hyperbolic objects which are more strongly affected by gravitational focusing. Earth-impacting interstellar objects are more likely to have retrograde orbits close to the ecliptic plane. A selection effect makes the distribution of inclination of Earth-impacting interstellar objects uniform/sinusoidal at low/high perihelion distances. In turn, low perihelion impactors have higher impact probability towards the ecliptic plane. The overall impactor population therefore exhibits an intermediate inclination distribution between uniform and sinusoidal. The highest velocity impacts are most likely to occur in the spring when the Earth is moving towards the solar apex. However, impacts in general are more likely to occur during the winter when the Earth is located in the direction of the antapex. Interstellar objects are more likely to impact the Earth at low latitudes close to the equator, with a slight preference for the Northern hemisphere due to the location of the apex. These distributions are independent of the assumed interstellar object number density, albedos, and size-frequency distribution and are publicly available.

          Life in the dark: Potential urability of moons of rogue planets

- **Abstract**
 Free-floating planets are thought to be numerous in the Galaxy and may retain their moons after ejection from their natal systems. If those satellites acquire or preserve orbital eccentricity, tidal dissipation could provide a long-lasting internal heat source, potentially creating urable environments (capable of enabling abiogenesis) in the absence of stellar radiation. We explore (i) whether moons remain bound to planets expelled by a core-collapse supernova, (ii) how the explosion reshapes their orbits, and (iii) under which circumstances tidal heating can sustain urable subsurface oceans. We carried out three-dimensional N-body simulations with an 8th-order Runge-Kutta scheme, modelling homologous stellar mass loss for progenitors of 10 M$_{\odot}$. Post-explosion orbital elements of single moons and resonant moon systems were analysed, and tidal heating power was estimated with a constant phase-lag model for several tidal dissipation functions and moon densities. All simulated moons survive the supernova and remain bound to their planets. The explosion excites moon eccentricities up to $\sim7\times10^{-4}$ and $\sim3\times10^{-3}$ for single moons of planets with circular and eccentric orbits, respectively. For resonant pairs, an eccentricity of $\leq2\times10^{-2}$ is preserved. The semi-major axis of the moons changes by $\leq0.2\%$. For 12-15\% of cases -- preferentially moons at $a\leq15\,R_{\mathrm{planet}}$ and with $e\geq10^{-3}$ -- the specific tidal heating power lies between 0.1 and 10 times what is estimated on Europa or Enceladus, sufficient to maintain liquid oceans beneath an ice crust. Eccentricity damping timescales exceed the age of the Solar System for $a\geq10\,R_{\mathrm{planet}}$, implying billions of years of continuous heating on the moons. Such worlds represent promising targets for future searches for extraterrestrial life.

- **Abstract**
 Shocks driven by coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are the most powerful accelerators of gradual solar energetic particles (SEPs) in the inner heliosphere. On 2023 March 13, a halo CME, as seen from the Solar Heliospheric Observatory (SoHO) and the Sun TErrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO), gave rise to a strong SEP event. In this work, we aim to analyze this CME-driven shock from multiple spacecraft, using both remote sensing observations from STEREO-A/COR2 and in-situ data from Parker Solar Probe (PSP), Solar Orbiter (SolO), and Wind. In order to determine its direction of propagation and kinematic properties, we model the shock geometry using STEREO-A/COR2 and SoHO/LASCO/C3 observations as an expanding ellipsoid. The density compression ratio of the shock is determined by fitting the brightness profile from the coronagraphic images with that obtained from raytracing simulations of a double-Gaussian shock density profile. We compare physical quantities such as compression ratio and Alfvénic Mach number derived from remote sensing observations with in-situ measurements by PSP, SolO, STEREO-A, and Wind. From STEREO-A/COR2, we determine the compression ratio around the entire shock front in the corona, finding significant non-homogeneities that can impact the values found during in-situ crossings. Following the evolution of the parameters characterizing the CME from the source to space, we find that closer to the Sun, both the gas compression ratio and the Alfvénic Mach number remain almost constant, while they increase at larger radial distances. This indicates a non-trivial evolution of the shock parameters during its journey through the interplanetary space.

- **Abstract**
 NGC 1333 IRAS4A is a well-studied low-mass sun-like proto-binary system. It has two components, A1 and A2, which are diverse according to their physical and chemical properties. We modeled this hot corino using the RATRAN radiative transfer code and explained different spectral signatures observed towards A1 and A2, specifically for CH3OH and H2CO. Our main goal is to understand the kinematical and chemical differences between A1 and A2 and to classify their dust emission and absorption properties. We considered a simple 1D spherical infalling envelope consisting of collimated outflow in the source. Recent high-resolution interferometric observations of ALMA shed new light on why the same molecular transitions towards A1 and A2 show different spectral profiles. The significant difference between spectral profiles observed towards A1 and A2 is mainly due to the dust opacity effect. Dust continuum emission toward A1 is optically thick, causing the transitions observed in absorption. Meanwhile, A2 is optically thin, leading to the observed emission profiles, and an inverse P-Cygni profile suggests the presence of an infalling envelope. Using high-resolution observations from ALMA and VLA, we expanded our model from the millimeter wavelength range to the centimeter wavelength range. This expansion demonstrates the opacity effect, which is reduced in the centimeter wavelength range, causing us to observe the lines in emission. Using our model, we reproduced the population inversion causing maser emission of methanol 44 GHz and 95 GHz transitions.

- **Abstract**
 The isotopic ratios of deuterated methanol derived around protostars are commonly used to infer the physical conditions under which they formed in the earlier prestellar stage. However, there is a discrepancy in the ratio of the singly deuterated methanol isotopologues, CH2DOH/CH3OD, between low- and high-mass protostars, which puts into question whether prestellar isotopic ratios are generally preserved during the star- and planet-forming process. Resolving this puzzle is only made harder by the complete lack of data on this ratio in the prestellar stage. This work presents observations with the IRAM 30m telescope that securely detect CH3OD in the prestellar core L1448 in Perseus and tentatively in B213-C6 in Taurus. This work constrains the ratio of CH2DOH/CH3OD and the D/H ratios for both singly deuterated methanol isotopologues for the first time at the prestellar stage. Column densities calculated under the assumption of local thermal equilibrium lead to a CH2DOH/CH3OD ratio of 2.8-8.5 in L1448 and $\leq$ 5.7 in B213-C6. The values are marginally consistent with the statistically expected ratio of 3, but most assumptions put the values in an elevated range in line with values found around low-mass protostars. The D/H ratio in CH2DOH is between 3.6% and 6.8% in L1448 and in the range of 2.4-5.8% in B213-C6. The D/H ratio derived for CH3OD is lower, namely 1.4-4.4% in L1448 and $\leq$ 3.8% in B213-C6.

- **Abstract**
 Full spectrum fitting is the prevailing method for extracting stellar kinematic and population measurements from 1D galaxy spectra. 3D methods refer to analysis of Integral Field Spectroscopy (IFS) data where spatial and spectral dimensions are modelled simultaneously. While several 3D methods exist for modelling gas structures there has been less investigation into the more computationally demanding problem of 3D full spectrum fitting for stellar recoveries. This work introduces and compares two algorithms for this task: the Projected Nesterov Kaczmarz Reconstruction method (PNKR) and a version of the Bayes-LOSVD software which has been modified to account for spatial correlations. We aim to understand strengths and weaknesses of both algorithms and assess the impact of 3D methods for stellar inferences. We apply both recovery algorithms to a mock IFS data over a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) range from 20-200 and evaluate the quality of the recoveries compared to the known ground truth. Accounting for spatial correlations in Bayes-LOSVD significantly improved the accuracy and precision of kinematic recoveries. 3D modelling with PNKR did not provide any significant improvement over 1D fits however, for SNR>40, PNKR did recover the most accurate kinematics overall. Additionally, by modelling the joint distribution over kinematics and populations, PNKR could successfully infer trends between these quantities e.g. inferring local metallicity-velocity trends, albeit with a significant bias on the absolute metallicity. Having demonstrated advantages of (i) 3D modelling with Bayes-LOSVD, and (ii) joint kinematic-population analyses with PNKR, we conclude that both methodological advances will prove useful for detecting and characterising stellar structures from IFS data.

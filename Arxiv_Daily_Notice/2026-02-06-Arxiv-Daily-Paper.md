- **Abstract**
 Hydrocarbons play a key role in shaping the chemistry of the interstellar medium (ISM), but their enrichment and relationship with carbonaceous grains and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) still lack clear observational constraints. We report JWST NIRSpec+MIRI/MRS infrared (IR; 3-28 micron) observations of the local ultra-luminous IR galaxy (ULIRG) IRAS 07251-0248, revealing the extragalactic detection of small gas-phase hydrocarbons such as benzene (C$_6$H$_6$), triacetylene (C$_6$H$_2$), diacetylene (C$_4$H$_2$), acetylene (C$_2$H$_2$), methane (CH$_4$), and methyl radical (CH$_3$) as well as deep amorphous C-H absorptions in the solid phase. The unexpectedly high abundance of these molecules indicates an extremely rich hydrocarbon chemistry, not explained by high-temperature gas-phase chemistry, ice desorption or oxygen depletion. Instead, the most plausible explanation is the erosion and fragmentation of carbonaceous grains and PAHs. This scenario is supported by the correlation between the abundance of one of their main fragmentation products, C$_2$H$_2$, and cosmic ray (CR) ionization rate for a sample of local ULIRGs. These hydrocarbons are outflowing at $\sim$160 km/s, which may represent a potential formation pathway for hydrogenated amorphous grains. Our results suggest that IRAS 07251-0248 might not be unique but represents an extreme example of the commonly rich hydrocarbon chemistry prevalent in deeply obscured galactic nuclei.

- **Abstract**
 We use data from the JWST ASPIRE Wide Field Slitless Spectroscopy (WFSS) program to measure the auto-correlation function of [O,{\sc iii}] emitters at 5.3$<z<$7.0 and the quasar--[O,{\sc iii}] emitter cross-correlation around 25 ASPIRE quasars (6.51$<z<$6.82; $\langle z\rangle=6.6$). We use synthetic source injection to calibrate the selection function, which we combine with the large-volume FLAMINGO-10k simulation (2.8,cGpc box) to construct realistic mock observations. Our simulation-based approach captures nonlinear structure growth and scale-dependent bias on small scales and derives covariance matrices that include cosmic variance. The clustering yields correlation lengths of $r_0^{\rm GG}=4.7^{+0.4}{-0.5},h^{-1}$,cMpc for the [O,{\sc iii}] auto-correlation with fixed slope $\gamma{\rm GG}=1.8$, and $r_0^{\rm QG}=8.7^{+0.8}{-0.9},h^{-1}$,cMpc for the quasar--[O,{\sc iii}] cross-correlation with $\gamma{\rm QG}=2.0$. We infer $\log(M_{h,{\rm min}}^{[{\rm O,III}]}/M_\odot)=10.5^{+0.1}{-0.1}$ for [O,{\sc iii}] emitters and $\log(M{h,{\rm min}}^{\rm QSO}/M_\odot)=12.1^{+0.3}{-0.4}$ for quasars. These imply duty cycles of $2.5^{+1.0}{-0.8}$,per,cent for [O,{\sc iii}] emitters and $0.3^{+4.0}{-0.3}$,per,cent for quasars, corresponding to UV-bright lifetimes of $t{\rm Q}=2.6^{+30}_{-2.5}$,Myr (less than 10,per,cent of a Salpeter $e$-folding time). The results indicate that the observed UV-luminous phase contributes little to total SMBH growth, placing tight constraints on early black-hole formation.

- **Abstract**
 Long-period binary systems containing a B-type hot subdwarf (sdB) and a main-sequence companion are thought to originate from binary interactions involving stable mass transfer from the red giant, the progenitor of the sdB, to the MS companion. However, despite the recent progress in modelling their population, some of their observed properties are not entirely understood. Because determining their orbits requires extended campaigns of high-resolution spectroscopic observations, only a limited number of long-period sdB binaries have been studied with completely determined orbital parameters. A sample of 32 wide binary systems containing sdB stars was selected for the analysis of the radial velocity curves of both companions. The dataset consisted of high-resolution spectra obtained with the HERMES and UVES spectrographs. The orbital parameters were derived by simultaneously fitting Keplerian orbits to the radial velocities of the sdB and its companion. The atmospheric parameters of the cool companions were determined using the GSSP code, which analyses the master spectra of the systems with a grid of LTE atmospheric models. An additional sample of wide sdB binaries was built up by cross-matching the Gaia NSS catalogue with catalogues of sdB candidates and spectroscopically confirmed systems reported by Culpan2022A&A catalogues. The outcomes from both samples were compared with existing theoretical models to assess their consistency with current formation and evolutionary scenarios.

- **Abstract**
 We performed a comprehensive analysis of 27 short period contact binary systems for which no light curve analysis had previously been reported. Photometric time-series data from the TESS mission were used in this analysis. The observational results were validated using additional TESS sectors, along with complementary photometric observations from the ASAS-SN survey. The photometric light curves of the 27 contact binary systems were analyzed with the BSN application. Model solutions were obtained through iterative fitting followed by MCMC-based refinement to derive reliable system parameters, and starspot configurations were incorporated for seven targets exhibiting O'Connell effect asymmetries. The absolute parameters of the target systems were derived using the empirical parameter relationship between orbital period and semi-major axis. Based on the results of the light curve solutions and the estimated absolute parameters, five of the analyzed systems are identified as A-subtype, while the remaining targets belong to the W-subtype. We analyzed a sample of 484 W UMa contact binaries to identify the physical and orbital parameters that most effectively distinguish A-subtype from W-subtype systems using t-statistics. Three targets exhibited extremely low mass ratios, and their orbital analysis confirmed that they are dynamically stable. The evolutionary states of the systems were examined, showing that lower-mass companions are generally more evolved, while more massive components remain less evolved. The positions of the systems and their stellar components were compared across four diagrams derived from empirical parameter relationship studies, showing good agreement with the linear fits.

- **Abstract**
 At a 112.4 pc distance, the PDS70 protoplanetary disk is a rare case that has been confirmed to host two accreting planets. This makes it the most important laboratory for studying dust growth in the context of planet formation. Here we present the first deep, full polarization observations at 873 $\mu$m wavelength. We detected $\sim$1%-2.5% linear polarization over the bulk of the $\sim$55-100 AU (sub)millimeter ring. The polarization position angles align preferentially with the projected minor axis of the disk. The standard interpretation is that the observed polarization is caused by dust self-scattering, with a maximum dust grain size of $\sim$100 $\mu$m. On $\gtrsim$10 AU scales, which can be resolved by the presented 873-3075 $\mu$m observations, the ring is marginally optical thick at 873 $\mu$m wavelength. Using Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations, we found that an azimuthally asymmetric, marginally optically thick ring with a maximum dust grain size of $\sim$87 $\mu$m can reproduce the observed 873 $\mu$m polarization position angles and percentages. This study indicates that the coagulation of ice-coated dust in the protoplanetary disk may be limited by fragmentation or bouncing.

- **Abstract**
 Prior to its infall, the Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf galaxy was a major satellite with a mass of $M_{\rm sgr}\sim 10^{11}$ M$_\odot$. For the past $5-6~\mathrm{Gyr}$ , it has been heavily stripped by the Milky Way (MW), losing most of its mass while crossing the MW disc multiple times. Recent models of Milky Way disc perturbations $-$ including the spiral arms, the stellar bar, the Gaia phase spiral, and stellar and gaseous disc corrugations $-$ have identified these crossings as possible formation triggers, but have generally treated each perturbation in isolation. Here, we adopt a holistic perspective and ask whether a single disc-crossing impulse can simultaneously account for these features as observed today. We focus on simulations of single disc-crossing events by a Sgr-like perturber, and present a forensic analysis of the role of the powerful impulse in forming spiral arms, disc corrugations, the phase spiral and the `$L_{z}-\bar{V}_{R}$ wave', determined from a star's angular momentum and radial velocity, respectively. We find that a single disc crossing can reproduce reasonably well (e.g. structure, amplitude, phase) the observed local disc corrugation, and the Outer, Local and Sagittarius-Carina arm segments, implying that the last significant impulse due to a transit took place $700-1200~\mathrm{Myr}$ ago. Moreover, the $L_{z}-\bar{V}_{R}$ wave and phase spiral appear within the simulations over the same epoch and their general structure is reasonably well replicated, but not in detail. We conclude that Sgr's last significant crossing roughly a Gyr ago could be the primary cause of large-scale MW disc perturbations, but it cannot fully account for the $L_{z}-\bar{V}_{R}$ wave. Consequently, other triggers, possibly the Galactic bar or interactions with other satellites, must be considered in order to fully explain the current dynamical state of the MW's disc.

- **Abstract**
 The chemical evolution in star forming regions is driven by the interplay between gas and ice mantles. Identifying the ice compositions at the early stage of star formation thus provides constraints on the chemical processes inaccessible from gas-phase characterizations. As part of the CORINOS program, spectra from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) MIRI MRS were taken toward four Class 0 protostars: IRAS 15398-3359, Ser-emb7, L483, and B335. The spectra were processed with simultaneous fitting of a continuum and silicate absorption to produce optical depth mid-infrared spectra of the ices at 5-28 $\mu$m (360-2000 cm$^{-1}$) toward these four sources. Simple molecules such as water (H$_2$O), carbon dioxide (CO$_2$), methanol (CH$_3$OH), formic acid/formate (HCOOH/HCOO$^-$), ammonia/ammonium (NH$_3$/NH$_4$$^+$), and formaldehyde (H$_2$CO) are the most abundant features in these ices, while complex organic molecules (COMs) represent a smaller contribution. Likely COMs include hydroxylamine (NH$_2$OH), methylamine (CH$_3$NH$_2$), and ethanol (CH$_3$CH$_2$OH). Absorption features belonging to functional groups such as -CH$_3$ and -OH suggest that additional COMs are present, but these cannot be unambiguously assigned due to overlapping bands. Formation pathways toward these COMs utilizing radical-radical combination reactions based on laboratory simulation experiments is presented. By extension, COMs predicted by these reactions, but absent from the spectra, are discussed. The results provide insight into the chemical environment of these ices and also highlight the critical need for caution and sufficient evidence in order to confidently identify COMs in ice.

- **Abstract**
 Integral field spectroscopy (IFS) provides spatially resolved spectra, enabling detailed studies that address the physical and kinematic properties of the interstellar medium. A critical step in analyzing IFS data is the decomposition of emission lines, where different velocity components are often modeled with Gaussian profiles. However, conventional fitting methods that treat each spectrum independently often yield spatial discontinuities in the fitting results. Here, we present Emission Line Fitting Optimization (ELFO), a Python package for IFS spectral fitting. ELFO uses the results of neighboring spectra to determine multiple initial guesses and selects the result that exhibits spatial smoothness. We tested ELFO on IFS data of two quasars obtained from the Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer, where it successfully corrected anomalous fits, revealed previously unresolved substructures, and made large-scale kinematic structures more evident. With minor modifications, this method can also be easily adapted to other IFS data and different emission lines.

- **Abstract**
 Wide-orbit binaries serve as crucial laboratories for understanding stellar evolution and identifying quiescent compact objects. In this work, we search for compact objects in wide-orbit binaries by merging the LAMOST multi-epoch catalogs from LRS and MRS in the 12th data release. We specifically focus on sources with at least 20 observation epochs that clearly exhibit long-term radial velocity (RV) variations while remaining stable over short time scales. By constraining the mass function with Lomb-Scargle periods and RV ranges, we identified 76 single-lined spectroscopic binary candidates harboring potential compact objects with robust orbital solutions. These systems exhibit orbital periods ranging from 10 to 1000 days, with semi-amplitudes of velocity $K_1 \lesssim 50$ km/s and mass functions $f(M_2)$ between 0.05 and 0.6 $M_{\odot}$. Combining $f(M_2)$ with SED-derived stellar parameters, we identify 6 strong compact object candidates with main-sequence companions (Class A), 24 systems likely consisting of either compact objects with giant/subgiant companions or mass-inverted Algol-type binaries (Class B), and 46 candidates with relatively lower mass ratios (Class C). Cross-matching with the Gaia DR3 nss_two_star_orbit catalog yields 16 sources, all of which exhibit orbital solutions consistent with our results. This study demonstrates the essential role of long-term spectroscopic monitoring in searching for compact objects in wide-orbit binaries and validating orbital solutions. The strategy of leveraging extended time baselines will be increasingly effective as spectroscopic databases continue to grow, enabling the systematic discovery of compact objects in wide orbits across the Galaxy.

- **Abstract**
 We present MESS, a fully automated algorithm for identifying and characterizing double-lined spectroscopic binaries (SB2) in large databases of multi-epoch spectra. MESS extends the two-dimensional TODCOR approach to a global multi-epoch formalism, deriving the radial velocities (RVs) of both components at each epoch while optimizing the templates jointly across all observations. Template optimization searches a continuous synthetic-spectra manifold spanning an eight-dimensional parameter space: effective temperature, surface gravity, and rotational broadening for each star, together with a common metallicity and the flux ratio. Single-lined spectroscopic binaries (SB1) and single stars (S1) are handled within the same framework by fitting one optimized template, with either epoch-dependent RVs (SB1) or a single shared RV (S1). Model selection among S1/SB1/SB2 uses the Bayesian information criterion with an effective sample size that accounts for intra-spectrum correlations, and is complemented by the Wilson relation between the two RVs to infer the mass ratio and systemic velocity without a full orbital solution. We validate MESS on 1500 simulated LAMOST MRS systems (SNR=50), with primary RV semi-amplitudes predominantly below the instrumental resolution, achieving an overall classification accuracy of ~95%. We also derive full orbital solutions for two SB2 systems detected in our LAMOST analysis, including a faint-secondary case with flux ratio ~0.1, and present example outputs for one SB1 and three constant-velocity stars. A companion paper will report the survey-wide application to LAMOST DR11 and the resulting SB1/SB2 catalogs.

- **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive analysis of the photometric variability of (presumably single) nitrogen-rich Wolf-Rayet (WN) stars in the Magellanic Clouds, using long-term observations from the OGLE survey. Our sample comprises 47 stars with no nearby Gaia counterparts. We characterize both overall and short-term variabilities, examining data dispersion and identifying periodicities. To validate our findings, we also compare the OGLE light curves with data from the MACHO and TESS missions. Variability is ubiquitous in our WR sample: about one third of stars display high variability, or four fifths if we include cases with moderate variations. The observed changes are found to be periodic in 11 cases, with timescales of 2-56 d. Such periodic variations originate in corotating wind structures, binary effects, or pulsations, thereby increasing the number of systems known to show these phenomena. Surprisingly, nine targets display (quasi-periodic) outbursts, making such changes a new type of WR variability. The variability shows a transient character, in about 30$\%$ of the sample, with changing amplitudes for periodic signals or for outbursts (they even sometimes completely disappear from view). Finally, we identified six long-period variables, four of which have been confirmed by at least two independent surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the relevance of {\sl self-organized criticality (SOC)} models in previously published empirical datasets, which includes statistical observations in astrophysics, geophysics, biophysics, sociophysics, and informatics. We study 25 interdisciplinary phenomena with five different event detection and power law fitting methods. The total number of analyzed size distributions amounts to 64 cases, of which 80\% are found to be nearly consistent ($\alpha_s=1.99\pm0.30$) with the SOC model predictions. The fractal-diffusive SOC model predicts power law slopes of $\alpha_F=(9/5)=1.80$ for the flux $F$, $\alpha_E=(5/3)\sim1.67$ for the fluence or energy $E$, and $\alpha_T=2.00$ for the avalanche duration $T$. We find that the phenomena of solar flares, earthquakes, and forest fires are consistent with the theoretical predictions, while the size distributions of other phenomena are not conclusive due to neglected background treatment, inadequacy of power law fitting range, small-number statistics, and finite-system size effects.

          Can planet-planet binaries survive in star-forming regions?

 - **Abstract**
 Significant numbers of free-floating planetary-mass objects have been discovered in nearby star-forming regions by the James Webb Space Telescope, including a substantial number (42) of Jupiter Mass Binary Objects ('JuMBOs') in the Orion Nebula Cluster. The JuMBOs have much wider separations than other populations of substellar binaries, and their existence challenges conventional theories of substellar and planetary-mass object formation. Whilst several theories have been proposed to explain their formation, there has yet to be a study that determines whether they could survive the dynamical encounters prevalent within a dense star-forming region. We place a population of planet-planet binaries in N-body simulations of dense star-forming regions and calculate their binary fraction over time. We find that between 50-90 per cent of planet-planet binaries are destroyed on timescales of a few Myr, which implies that many more must form if we are to observe them in their current numbers. Furthermore, if the ONC was much more dense at formation, the initial separation distribution of the JuMBOs must have been even wider (and less similar to other substellar binaries) than the observed distribution.

 - **Abstract**
 Adaptive optics systems are critical in any application where highly resolved imaging or beam control must be performed through a dynamic medium. Such applications include astronomy and free-space optical communications, where light propagates through the atmosphere, as well as medical microscopy and vision science, where light propagates through biological tissue. Recent works have demonstrated common-path wavefront sensors for adaptive optics using the photonic lantern, a slowly varying waveguide that can efficiently couple multi-moded light into single-mode fibers. We use the SCExAO astrophotonics platform at the 8-m Subaru Telescope to show that spectral dispersion of lantern outputs can improve correction fidelity, culminating with an on-sky demonstration of real-time wavefront control. To our best knowledge, this is the first such result for either a spectrally dispersed or a photonic lantern wavefront sensor. Combined with the benefits offered by lanterns in precision spectroscopy, our results suggest the future possibility of a unified wavefront sensing spectrograph using compact photonic devices.

          Characterizing the Radiative-Convective Structure of Dense Rocky Planet Atmospheres

 - **Abstract**
 We use a one-dimensional line-by-line radiative-convective model to simulate hot, dense terrestrial-planet atmospheres. We find that strong shortwave absorption by H2O and CO2 inhibits near-surface convection, reducing surface temperatures by up to approximately 2000 K compared to fully convective predictions. Pure CO2 atmospheres are typically 1000 K cooler than pure H2O atmospheres, with only a few percent of H2O needed to elevate surface temperatures by hundreds of kelvin for a fixed incident stellar radiation. We also show that minor greenhouse gases such as SO2 and NH3 have a limited warming effect when H2O is abundant. Even at insolation values as high as 12,500 W/m2 (about 37 times Earth's current solar flux), planets with mixed CO2-H2O envelopes have surface temperatures in the 1200 to 2000 K range, limiting surface melting. Our results highlight the critical role of shortwave heating on magma ocean planets and the need for improved high-temperature spectroscopy beyond 20,000 cm-1.

          Determining the Scale Length and Height of the Milky Way's Thick Disc Using RR~Lyrae

 - **Abstract**
 Using the RR Lyrae surveys Gaia DR3 Specific Objects Study, PanSTARRS1 and ASAS-SN-II, we determine the Milky Way's thick disc scale length and scale height as well as the radial scale length of the galaxy's inner halo. We use a Bayesian approach to estimate these values using two independent techniques: Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling, and importance nested sampling. We consider two vertical density profiles for the thick disc. In the exponential model, the scale length of the thick disc is $h_R=2.14_{-0.17}^{+0.19}$ kpc, and its scale height is $h_z=0.64_{-0.06}^{+0.06}$ kpc. In the squared hyperbolic secant profile $sech^2$, those values are correspondingly $h_R=2.10_{-0.17}^{+0.19}$ kpc and $h_z=1.02_{-0.08}^{+0.09}$ kpc. The density distribution of the inner halo can be described as a power law function with the exponent $n =-2.35_{-0.05}^{+0.05}$ and flattening $q =0.57_{-0.02}^{+0.02}$. We also estimate the halo to disc concentration ratio as $\gamma=0.19_{-0.02}^{+0.02}$ for the exponential disc and $\gamma=0.32_{-0.03}^{+0.03}$ for the $sech^2$ disc.

          The JWST weather report from the nearest brown dwarfs II: Consistent variability mechanisms over 7 months revealed by 1-14 $μ$m NIRSpec + MIRI monitoring of WISE 1049AB

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new epoch of JWST spectroscopic variability monitoring of the benchmark binary brown dwarf WISE 1049AB, the closest, brightest brown dwarfs known. Our 8-hour MIRI low resolution spectroscopy (LRS) and 7-hour NIRSpec prism observations extended variability measurements for any brown dwarfs beyond 11 $\mu$m for the first time, reaching up to 14 $\mu$m. Combined with the previous epoch in 2023, they set the longest JWST weather monitoring baseline to date. We found that both WISE 1049AB show wavelength-dependent light curve behaviours. Using a robust k-means clustering algorithm, we identified several clusters of variability behaviours associated with three distinct pressure levels. By comparing to a general circulation model (GCM), we identified the possible mechanisms that drive the variability at these pressure levels: Patchy clouds rotating in and out of view likely shaped the dramatic light curves in the deepest layers between 1-2.5 $\mu$m, whereas hot spots arising from temperature / chemical variations of molecular species likely dominate the high-altitude levels between 2.5-3.6 $\mu$m and 4.3-8.5 $\mu$m. Small-grain silicates potentially contributed to the variability of WISE 1049A at 8.5-11 $\mu$m. While distinct atmospheric layers are governed by different mechanisms, we confirmed for the first time that each variability mechanism remains consistent within its layer over the long term. Future multi-period observations will further test the stability of variability mechanisms on this binary, and expanded JWST variability surveys across the L-T-Y sequence will allow us to trace and understand variability mechanisms across a wider population of brown dwarfs and planetary-mass objects.

 - **Abstract**
 Fifty years after the very first sounding rocket measurement of cosmic X-ray polarization, the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) mission has effectively opened a new window into the X-ray sky. Prior to launch of IXPE, an extensive calibration campaign was carried out to fully characterize the response of this new type of instrument. Specifically, the polarization-sensitive detectors were intensively calibrated in Italy, where they were developed and built. The X-ray optics, which collect and focus X rays onto the detectors, were built and calibrated in the U.S. A key question was whether the telescope (optics + detectors) calibrations could be synthesized from the individual component calibrations, avoiding time consuming and costly end-to-end calibrations for a flight program with a fixed schedule. The data presented here are from a calibration of the flight spare telescope utilizing the flight spare detector and flight spare mirror assembly combined. These data show that the presence of the mirror module does not affect the polarization response of the detectors (within the required calibration accuracy) and that the angular resolution of the telescopes could be accurately determined. Thus, the original extensive stand-alone ground calibration data of all the flight detectors and all the flight optic can be utilized in full to derive the flight telescopes calibrations.

          A Model of UV-Blue Absorbance in Bulk Liquid of Venusian Cloud Aerosols Is Consistent with Efficient Organic Absorbers at High Concentrations

 - **Abstract**
 At visible wavelengths, Venus appears serene and pale-yellow, but since the 1920s, observers have noted high-contrast features in the ultraviolet. These features track the about 4-day superrotation of the upper cloud deck and vary widely over time and space. The identity of the UV absorber(s)-active between at least 280 and 500 nm-remains unknown, as no proposed candidate fully matches all observational data. From remote observations of Venus, and accounting for light scattering by sub-micrometer droplets, we modeled the 365-455 nm absorbance per cm of the bulk liquids forming Venus's clouds. Assuming a uniform distribution in mode 1 and 2 particles across a 6 km layer below the cloud top at 65 km, we constrain the bulk absorbance with a peak at A375 nm being 2942 per cm. This extremely high absorbance implies the presence of a highly efficient absorber, most likely conjugated organics, at relatively high concentration-e.g. about 25 g/L for porphyrin type pigments. Inorganic absorbers, with molar absorption coefficients typically in the range of 1,000-10,000 per M per cm, would either need to comprise a large portion of the aerosols or are simply not light absorbent enough, even if present in pure form. We emphasize that all candidate absorbers must be evaluated against Venus's reflectance curve using (i) known molar absorption coefficients, (ii) realistic atmospheric distributions, and (iii) appropriate particle size distributions. The upcoming Rocket Lab mission will test the hypothesis of organics in Venus's clouds.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery and confirmation of two planets orbiting the metal-poor Sun-like star, HD 35843 (TOI 4189). HD 35843 c is a temperate sub-Neptune transiting planet with an orbital period of 46.96 days that was first identified by Planet Hunters TESS. We combine data from TESS and follow-up observations to rule out false-positive scenarios and validate the planet. We then use ESPRESSO radial velocities to confirm the planetary nature and characterize the planet's mass and orbit. Further analysis of these RVs reveals the presence of an additional planet, HD 35843 b, with a period of 9.90 days and a minimum mass of $5.84\pm0.84$ $M_{\oplus}$. For HD 35843 c, a joint photometric and spectroscopic analysis yields a radius of $2.54 \pm 0.08 R_{\oplus}$, a mass of $11.32 \pm 1.60 M_{\oplus}$, and an orbital eccentricity of $e = 0.15\pm0.07$. With a bulk density of $3.80 \pm 0.70$ g/cm$^3$, the planet might be rocky with a substantial H$_2$ atmosphere or it might be a ``water world". With an equilibrium temperature of $\sim$480 K, HD 35843 c is among the coolest $\sim 5\%$ of planets discovered by TESS. Combined with the host star's relative brightness (V= 9.4), HD 35843 c is a promising target for atmospheric characterization that will probe this sparse population of temperate sub-Neptunes.

 - **Abstract**
 We fit archival near-infrared spectra of 305 brown dwarfs with atmosphere models from the Sonora and Phoenix groups. Using the parameters of the best-fit models as estimates for the physical properties of the brown dwarfs in our sample, we have performed a survey of how brown dwarf atmospheres evolve with spectral type and temperature. We present the fit results and observed trends. We find that clouds have a more significant impact on near infrared spectra than disequilibrium chemistry, and that silicate clouds influence the near infrared spectrum through the late T types. We note where current atmosphere models are able to replicate the data and where the models and data conflict. We also categorize objects with similar spectral morphologies into families and discuss possible causes for their unique spectral traits. We identify two spectral families with morphologies that are likely indicative of binarity.

 - **Abstract**
 Forecasting future solar activity has become crucial in our modern world, where intense eruptive phenomena mostly occurring during solar maximum are likely to be strongly damaging to satellites and telecommunications. We present a 4D variational assimilation technique applied for the first time to real solar data. Our method is tested against observations of past cycles 22, 23, 24 and on the ongoing cycle 25 for which we give an estimate of the imminent maximum value and timing and also provide a first forecast of the next solar minimum. We use a variational data assimilation technique applied to a solar mean-field Babcock-Leighton flux-transport dynamo model. Ensemble predictions are produced in order to obtain uncertainties on the timing and value of the maximum of cycle $n+1$, when data on cycle $n$ is assimilated. We study in particular the influence of the phase during which data is assimilated in the model and of the weighting of various terms in the objective function. The method is validated on cycles 22, 23 and 24 with very satisfactory results. For cycle 25, predictions vary depending on the extent of the assimilation window but start converging past 2022 to a solar maximum reached between mid-2024 up to the beginning of 2025 with a sunspot number value of $143.1 \pm 15.0$. Relatively close values of the maximum are found in both hemispheres within a time lag of a few months. We also forecast a next minimum around late 2029, with still significant errorbars. The data assimilation technique presented here combining a physics-based model and real solar observations produces promising results for future solar activity forecasting.

 - **Abstract**
 Studying the atmospheres of exoplanets is one of the most promising ways to learn about distant worlds beyond our solar system. The composition of an exoplanet's atmosphere can provide critical insights into its geology and potential habitability. For instance, the presence of certain molecules such as water vapor, oxygen, or methane have been proposed to indicate the possibility of life. From an observation point of view, over the past fifteen years, significant progress has been made in characterizing exoplanetary atmospheres. This work reviews recent developments in ground-based high-resolution spectroscopic instruments that make it possible to analyze distant atmospheres in great detail. High-resolution transmission spectroscopy, one of the most effective methods used, has examined the atmospheres of Jupiter-like and is pushing towards the smaller, sub-Neptunian exoplanets. Numerous molecules have been detected using this technique, including CO,H2O,TiO,HCN,CH4,NH3,C2H2,OH. We explore the intriguing possibilities that lie ahead for future ground-based instrumentation, particularly in the context of detecting biologically relevant molecules within Earth-analog exoplanetary atmospheres including molecular oxygen (O2). With detailed exposure time calculations for detecting O2 we find that at the same exposure time spectral resolution of 300,000 reaches higher significance compared to 100,000. The exposure time and therefore the needed number of transits is reduced by a factor of 4 in challenging haze and cloud scenarios.

          Benchmark stars for mean stellar density and surface gravity estimates of solar-type stars

 - **Abstract**
 Adding an independent estimate of the mean stellar density, $\rho_{\star}$, as a constraint in the analysis of stars that host transiting exoplanets can significantly improve the precision of the planet radius estimate in cases where the light curve is too noisy to yield an accurate value of the transit impact parameter, e.g. the light curves of Earth-size planets orbiting in the habitable zone of Sun-like stars that will be obtained by the PLATO mission. I have compiled a sample of 36 solar-type stars for which analysis of high-quality light curves together with constraints on the orbital eccentricity yield mean stellar density measurements with a median error of 2.3%. Of these, 8 are in transiting exoplanet systems and 28 in eclipsing binary systems with very low mass companions that contribute <0.1% of the total flux in the V band. A re-calibrated empirical relation for stellar mass as a function of T$_{\rm eff}$, $\rho_{\star}$ and [Fe/H] has been used to find mass estimates with a typical precision of 5.2% for the stars in this sample. Examples are given of how this sample can be used to test the accuracy and precision of $\rho_{\star}$ and log(g) estimates from catalogues of stellar parameters for solar-type stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma ray burst (GRB) afterglow light curves have the potential to inform us about presently unobserved stages in the aftermath of a neutron star merger. Using numerical simulations of short GRB afterglows we obtain an approximate quantitative connection between key aspects of the emission mechanism and the shapes of the resulting light curves. Employing simple, but efficient, parameterizations of the light curve based on a broken power law in terms of physical parameters, fitted to a large dataset of synthetic light curves, we apply basic machine learning techniques to determine the approximate connection between key input parameters of the forward shock model and the light curve parameters. Solving then the inverse problem, we find that the strength of the central engine can be reasonably accurately estimated even with very limited information. In particular, merely the position of jet-break in the on-axis, respectively the maximum in the off-axis light curve determines the kinetic energy at the tens of percent level.

 - **Abstract**
 Direct detection experiments have established the most stringent constraints on potential interactions between particle candidates for relic, thermal dark matter and Standard Model particles. To surpass current exclusion limits a new generation of experiments is being developed. The upcoming upgrade of the CRESST experiment will incorporate $\mathcal{O}$(100) detectors with different masses ranging from $\sim$2g to $\sim$24g, aiming to achieve unprecedented sensitivity to sub-GeV dark matter particles with a focus on spin-independent dark matter-nucleus scattering. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the planned upgrade, detailed experimental strategies, anticipated challenges, and projected sensitivities. Approaches to address and mitigate low-energy excess backgrounds $-$ a key limitation in previous and current sub-GeV dark matter searches $-$ are also discussed. In addition, a long-term roadmap for the next decade is outlined, including other potential scientific applications.

 - **Abstract**
 Massive neutrinos imprint distinctive signatures on the evolution of cosmic structures, notably suppressing small-scale clustering. We investigate the impact of massive neutrinos on the galaxy bispectrum in redshift-space, adopting a spherical harmonic multipole decomposition $B_L^m(k_1, \mu, t)$, that captures the full angular dependence. We develop an analytical and numerical framework incorporating neutrino-corrected perturbation theory kernels and redshift-space distortions. Our results demonstrate that the linear triangle configurations are particularly sensitive to massive neutrinos, with deviations reaching up to $\sim 2\%$ for a total mass $\sum m_\nu = 0.12\,\mathrm{eV}$. To assess detection prospects in galaxy surveys like \textit{Euclid}, we compute the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for individual multipoles, including the effects of Finger-of-God damping and shot noise. The neutrino-induced signatures in $B_0^0$ and $B_2^0$ are found to be detectable with SNR $\gtrsim 5$ across a range of configurations, even after accounting for small-scale suppression. Higher-order multipoles such as $B_2^1$ and $B_2^2$ are moderately sensitive, with SNR $\gtrsim$ ($2-3$) in squeezed limits, while hexadecapole moments are more suppressed but still exhibit measurable signals at high $k_1$. Additionally, the SNR generally increases with wave number $k_1$, particularly for squeezed and stretched triangles, suggesting that access to smaller scales significantly enhances detection this http URL study highlights the potential of the redshift-space bispectrum multipoles as sensitive probes of massive neutrinos, complementing traditional power spectrum analyses, and underscores the importance of angular information and higher-order statistics for galaxy surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 Type-I thermonuclear bursts (TNBs) from neutron star low-mass X-ray binaries (NSLMXBs) originate on the neutron star's surface from the unstable burning of the accreted material. On the other hand, kHz quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) are thought to originate in the innermost regions of the in-spiraling accretion disk. Due to the violent nature of the bursts, it is anticipated that Type-I TNBs will impact the inner accretion flow, and, therefore, the kHz QPOs. In this work, we systematically study the evolution of the upper and the lower kHz QPOs immediately before and after a Type-I TNB on 4U 1636$-$536 using {\it{AstroSat}} observations in the 3--20 keV band. The analysis of the power-density-spectra show the presence of kHz QPOs within 200 seconds before the onset of the Type--I burst. However, we have not detected any prominent signature of the same within 100-200 second posterior to the burst. The kHz QPOs then re-emerges after $\approx$ 200 sec. The fractional rms variation in the 3--20 keV band drops by $\approx$ 5-6 \%, supporting the non-existence of kHz QPOs in the 200 sec post-Burst Zone. The time scale of 200 sec coincides with the viscous time scale, highlighting a scenario where the inner disk is temporarily disrupted by the intense radiation from the Type-I TNB. The kHz QPO then re-establishes as the inner disk is restored.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we explore how the size and surrounding tidal fields of dark matter protohalos at high redshift influence their angular momentum (AM) evolution. While tidal torque theory (TTT) states that AM arises from the misalignment between protohalo shape and tidal fields, it remains unclear what is the characteristic scale of the perturbations that couple with each protohalo, and its correlation with protohalo properties such as size. Moreover, although the assumptions of the TTT are assumed to hold during the linear and quasi-linear regime, cosmological simulations reveal that discrepancies between its predictions and the true AM of halos emerge earlier than expected. To address this, we analyze cosmological simulations to study tidal fields at $z=80$ using different smoothing lengths, and determine which best predicts AM under TTT. We then investigate discrepancies between predicted and actual AM across redshifts, considering the effect of evolving tidal and inertia tensors. Our results show that the early tidal field couples with the inertia tensor of protohalos on scales about half of their characteristic size and confirm that disagreements between theory and simulation arise before the non-linear regime, suggesting a systematic effect from protohalo shape interacting with the forming cosmic web.

 - **Abstract**
 The problem of quasar classification comes in the class of highly imbalanced classification problems since Radio-loud (RL) quasars are rare and make up only about 10% of the quasar population. In this work, we use the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-DR3 dataset and introduce a PCA-based regression pipeline designed to maximize recall for rare classes in class-imbalanced astronomical data. We demonstrate an effective methodology to identify the key features of the dataset and apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction. For the PCA transformed SDSS-DR3 dataset, first two components account for the 97% of the observed variance. We perform classification of Radio-Loud (RL) and Radio-Quiet (RQ) quasars with Random Forest Classifier (RFC), novel PCA based balanced linear regression classifier (PBC), Random forest integrated with SMOTE classifier and XGBoost classifier with threshold tuning. RFC achieves an overall accuracy of 92% while PBC achieves an overall accuracy of 62%. XGBoost achieves an overall accuracy of 72% and SMOTE integrated RFC achieves an accuracy of 85%. Higher precision is obtained for RQ quasars in all classification methods. For the RL class, RFC achieves a recall of 0.04, XGBoost achieves a recall of 0.39, SMOTE integrated RFC achieves a recall of 0.25 and PBC achieves a recall of 0.52 attributed to the balanced logistic regression. RFC and PBC achieve F1 score of 0.08 and 0.19 respectively for RL while XGBoost achieves an improved F1 score of 0.22 but at the cost of reduced recall of the RL class. SMOTE integrated RFC achieves a better F1 score of 0.21 over RFC and PBC. Overall results of classifiers point to extreme class imbalance between RQ and RL classes in the data set.

 - **Abstract**
 The gravitational wave signal of binary compact objects has two main contributions at frequencies below the characteristic merger frequency: the gravitational wave signal associated with the early inspiral stage of the binary and the non-linear gravitational wave memory. We compare the sensitivity of upcoming gravitational wave detectors to these two contributions, with a particular interest in events with a merger phase at frequencies higher than the detector's peak sensitivity. We demonstrate that for light primordial black holes, current and upcoming detectors are more sensitive to the inspiral signal. Our analysis incorporates the evolution history of primordial black hole binaries, key to accurately estimating the relevant event rates. We also discuss the waveform templates of the memory signal at ground- and space-based interferometers, and the implications for a matched filtering search. This allows us to compare the sensitivity of high-frequency gravitational wave detectors, sensitive to the merger phase, with the sensitivity of existing interferometers.

          Probing the Cores of Subdwarf B Stars: How do They Compare to Cores in Helium Core-Burning Red Giants?

 - **Abstract**
 The mixing of material from stellar convective cores into their adjacent radiative layers has been a matter of long-standing debate. Pulsating subdwarf B stars offer excellent conditions to advance our understanding of this problem. In this work we use a model-independent approach to infer information about the cores of three subdwarf B stars and compare it with similar inferences from earlier analysis of red giants in the helium core-burning phase. This is achieved by fitting an analytical description of the gravity-mode pulsation periods to pulsation data collected by the Kepler satellite. From the fits we infer the reduced asymptotic period spacings and the amplitude and position of sharp structural variations associated with chemical discontinuities in the stellar interiors. Our results indicate the presence of sharp structural variations with similar properties in all three stars, located near the edge of the gravity-mode propagation cavity and likely associated with the C-O/He transition. We find that these structural variations differ systematically from those of helium core-burning red giant stars, having larger amplitudes and being located at a larger buoyancy radius. This suggests that chemical mixing beyond the adiabatically stratified core into the radiatively stratified layers may be more extensive in subdwarf B stars than in helium core-burning red giants. Alternatively, the stratification of the mixing region beyond the adiabatically stratified core may differ significantly between the two types of stars. The model-independent constraints set on the structural variations inside these three stars are the first of a kind and will be key to enhance the modelling of layers adjacent to stellar convective cores and to test non-canonical stellar evolution channels leading to the formation of hot subdwarf stars.

          Bridging the Atmospheric Circulations of Hot and Warm Giant Exoplanets

 - **Abstract**
 We perform high-resolution atmospheric flow simulations of hot and warm giant exoplanets that are tidally locked. The modeled atmospheres are representative of those on KELT-11b and WASP-39b, which possess markedly different equilibrium temperatures but reside in a similar dynamical regime: in this regime, their key dynamical numbers (e.g., Rossby and Froude numbers) are comparable. Despite their temperature difference, both planets exhibit qualitatively similar atmospheric circulation patterns, which are characterized by turbulent equatorial flows, anticyclonic polar vortices, and large-scale Rossby waves that gives rise to quasi-zonal flows in the extra-tropics (i.e., near ~20 degrees). Quantitative differences between the KELT-11b and WASP-39b atmospheres reflect their different Rossby deformation scales, which influence the horizontal length scale of wave--vortex interactions and the overall structure of the circulation.

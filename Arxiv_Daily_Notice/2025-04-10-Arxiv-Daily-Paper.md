 - **Abstract**
 Galaxy surveys are crucial for studying large-scale structure (LSS) and cosmology, yet they face limitations--imaging surveys provide extensive sky coverage but suffer from photo-$z$ uncertainties, while spectroscopic surveys yield precise redshifts but are sample-limited. To take advantage of both photo-$z$ and spec-$z$ data while eliminating photo-$z$ errors, we propose a deep learning framework based on a dual UNet architecture that integrates these two datasets at the field level to reconstruct the 3D photo-$z$ density field. We train the network on mock samples representative of stage-IV spectroscopic surveys, utilizing CosmicGrowth simulations with a $z=0.59$ snapshot containing $2048^3$ particles in a $(1200~h^{-1}\rm Mpc)^3$ volume. Several metrics, including correlation coefficient, MAE, MSE, PSNR, and SSIM, validate the model's accuracy. Moreover, the reconstructed power spectrum closely matches the ground truth at small scales ($k \gtrsim 0.06~h/\rm Mpc$) within the $1\sigma$ confidence level, while the UNet model significantly improves the estimation of photo-$z$ power spectrum multipoles. This study demonstrates the potential of deep learning to enhance LSS reconstruction by using both spectroscopic and photometric data.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new, Bayesian analysis of the highest-resolution optical spectrum of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) binary candidate PG 1302-102, obtained with ESPRESSO@VLT (R \simeq 138, 000). Our methodology, based on robust Bayesian model selection, reveals the presence of multiple narrow emission lines at the expected redshift of the source and confirms (for H\{beta}) and detects (for H{\gamma}) the presence of redshifted broad components. Additionally, we have discovered a very broad and, if it is associated with the H\{beta}, very redshifted component at {\lambda} \simeq 5000Å. We evaluate two scenarios for explaining the observed broad emission line (BEL) in PG 1302-102. In the case in which the redshifted BEL asymmetry arises from the orbital motion of a putative binary, our measurements coupled with simple estimates of the broad-line region (BLR) sizes suggest that the individual black hole BLRs are either settled in a single BLR or in the process of merging and, therefore truncated and highly disturbed. Alternatively, in the scenario of a single SMBH, we explain the distorted emission of the BELs with a nonsymmetric distribution of the BLR clouds; namely, a thin disk with a spiral perturbation. This BLR configuration is statistically preferred over any empirical multi-Gaussian fit and simultaneously explains the asymmetric emission of the H{\beta} and H{\gamma} close to the bulk of the line and any additional excess (or the lack of it, in the case of the H{\gamma}) at much longer wavelengths. The physical origins of the perturbation are unclear, and a connection with the possible presence of a black hole binary cannot be ruled out. Given the growing evidence from theoretical and observational works demonstrating the common presence of disturbed BLRs in active galactic nuclei, we argue that an origin related to self-gravitating instabilities may be more plausible.

          Positive Feedback II: How Dust Coagulation inside Vortices Can Form Planetesimals at Low Metallicity

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of planetesimals ($\sim$100 km planet building blocks) has confounded astronomers for decades, as numerous growth barriers appear to impede their formation. In a recent paper we proposed a novel interaction where the streaming instability (SI) and dust coagulation work in tandem, with each one changing the environment in a way that benefits the other. This mechanism proved effective at forming planetesimals in the fragmentation-limited inner disk, but much less effective in the drift-limited outer disk, concluding that dust traps may be key to forming planets at wide orbital separations. Here we explore a different hypothesis: That vortices host a feedback loop in which a vortex traps dust, boosting dust coagulation, which in turn boosts vortex trapping. We combine an analytic model of vortex trapping with an analytic model of fragmentation limited grain growth that accounts for how dust concentration dampens gas turbulence. We find a powerful synergy between vortex trapping and dust growth. For $\alpha \le 10^{-3}$ and solar-like metallicity this feedback loop consistently takes the grain size and dust density into the planetesimal formation region of the streaming instability (SI). Only in the regime of strong turbulence ($\alpha \ge 3\times 10^{-3}$) does the system often converge to a steady state below the SI criterion. The combination of vortex trapping with dust coagulation is an even more powerful mechanism than the one involving the SI. It is effective at lower metallicity and across the whole disk -- anywhere that vortices form.

          The likelihood of not detecting cavity-carving companions in transition discs -- A statistical approach

 - **Abstract**
 Protoplanetary discs with cavities, also known as ``transition discs'', constitute ~10% of protoplanetary discs at sub-mm wavelengths. Among several explanations, one hypothesis suggests these cavities are carved by undetected stellar or planetary companions. We present a novel approach to quantify the likelihood that a cavity-carving companion goes undetected because it is either too close to the star (i.e., has a small projected separation) or too faint to be resolved. We generate two independent samples of stellar and planetary companions with random sky orientations, assuming distributions in eccentricity, mass ratio, and time-weighted orbital phases, to study the statistical properties of the cavities they produce. We calculate the likelihood that a companion appears with a projected separation $d$ relative to its semi-major axis $a_{bin}$ ($d/a_{bin}$). Then, using a disc truncation model, we calculate the likelihood that companions carve a cavity with size $a_{cav}$ relative to its semi-major axis $a_{bin}$ and projected separation $d$, deriving distributions of $a_{bin}/a_{cav}$ and $d/a_{cav}$. We find that stellar companions carve cavities with median sizes ~3 times larger than their projected separation $d$ ($a_{cav}\sim3d$, $a_{cav}\sim1.7 d$ for planets), but with a statistically significant tail towards larger values ($a_{cav}\gg 3d$). We estimate the likelihood that cavity-carving companions go undetected due to projection effects when the system is observed with spatial resolution $R$, $P(d< R)$. Considering observational constraints on companion masses, we apply this framework to 13 well-known transition discs. We find that undetected stellar companions are unlikely in 8 out of 13 systems we considered, with 5 notable exceptions: ABAur, MWC758, HD135344B, CQTau and HD169142. The presence of undetected planets cannot be excluded in any of the transition discs considered.

          Can a time evolving, asymmetric broad line region mimic a massive black hole binary?

 - **Abstract**
 Gas within the influence sphere of accreting massive black holes is responsible for the emission of the broad lines observed in optical-UV spectra of unobscured active galactic nuclei. Since the region contributing the most to the broad emission lines (i.e. the broad line region) depends on the active galactic nucleus luminosity, the study of broad line reverberation to a varying continuum can map the morphology and kinematics of gas at sub-pc scales. In this study, we modify a preexisting model for disc-like broad line regions, including non-axisymmetric structures, by adopting an emissivity profile that mimics the observed luminosity-radius relation. This makes our implementation particularly well suited for the analysis of multi-epoch spectroscopic campaigns. After validating the model, we use it to check if strongly non-axisymmetric, single broad line regions could mimic the short time-scale evolution expected from massive black hole binaries. We explore different orientations and anisotropy degrees of the broad line region, as well as different light curve patterns of the continuum to which the broad line region responds. Our analysis confirms that recently proposed algorithms designed to search for massive black hole binaries in large multi-epoch spectroscopic data are not contaminated by false positives ascribed to anisotropic broad line regions around single MBHs.

          Chemical tagging with APOGEE, MUSE, and HST: constraints on the formation of $ω$ Centauri

 - **Abstract**
 A plethora of evidence suggests that $\omega$ Centauri ($\omega$ Cen) is the nuclear star cluster of a galaxy that merged with the Milky Way in early times. We use APOGEE, Gaia, MUSE, and HST data supplemented by galaxy chemical evolution models to place constraints on the assembly and chemical enrichment history of $\omega$ Cen. The APOGEE data reveal three stellar populations occupying separate loci on canonical chemical planes. One population resembles metal-poor halo field stars (P1), a second shows light-element abundance anti-correlations typical of metal-poor globular clusters (IM), and a third population (P2) is characterised by an extreme "second-generation" abundance pattern. Both P1 and P2 populations cover a broad range of metallicity, consistent with extended histories of bursty star formation (SF), which is also evident from their light- and $\alpha$-element abundance patterns. Conversely, the IM stars exhibit a narrow metallicity spread, combined with the Al-Mg, Na-O, and C-N anti-correlations common to metal-poor Galactic globular clusters. Moreover, these three populations alone seem to account for the distribution of $\omega$ Cen stars in the chromosome map. We discuss these findings in context of a scenario according to which $\omega$ Cen formed by a combination of in situ SF within the host galaxy (P1), followed by the spiralling in of gas-rich globular clusters (IM), leading to another burst of SF (P2). We perform a robust comparison of the chemical composition of $\omega$ Cen with those of halo substructures well represented in APOGEE DR17, finding no chemical associations to a high confidence level.

          Testing compact massive black hole binary candidates through multi-epoch spectroscopy

 - **Abstract**
 Emission from two massive black holes (MBHs) bound in a close binary is expected to be modulated by different processes, such as Doppler boost due to the orbital motion, accretion rate variability generated by the interaction with a circumbinary disc, and binary gravitational self-lensing. When the binary is compact enough, the two black holes are thought to be surrounded by a common broad line region that reprocesses the impinging periodically varying ionising flux, creating broad emission lines with variable lineshapes. Therefore, the study of broad emission line variability through multi-epoch spectroscopic campaigns is of paramount importance for the unambiguous identification of a binary. In this work, we study the response of a disc-like broad line region to the Doppler-boosted ionising flux emitted by $\mathrm{sub-milli-pc}$ MBH binaries on a circular orbit and compare it with the response of a broad line region illuminated by a single MBH with a periodically but isotropically varying intrinsic luminosity. We show that in the binary case, the time lags of the blue and red wings of the broad emission lines, arising from diametrically opposite sides of the circumbinary disk, are out of phase by half of the binary's orbital period, as they each respond to the periodic "light-house" modulation from the binary's continuum emission. This asymmetric time-lag represents a new binary signature that can not be mimicked by a single MBH.

 - **Abstract**
 This study sets new constraints on Cold+Warm Dark Matter (CWDM) models by leveraging the small-scale suppression of structure formation imprinted in the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest. Using the Sherwood-Relics suite, we extract high-fidelity flux power spectra from simulated Lyman-$\alpha$ forest data, spanning a broad range of cosmologies and thermal histories. This enables precise constraints on the warm dark matter (WDM) fraction, $f_{\mathrm{WDM}}$, and the mass of the WDM particle, $m_{\mathrm{WDM}}$. A key advancement of our analysis is the integration of a neural network emulator directly at the likelihood level, significantly accelerating Bayesian parameter inference. With new observations of high-redshift ($z$ = 4.2$-$5.0) quasar spectra from UVES and HIRES, we establish stringent upper limits: for $m_{\mathrm{WDM}}$ = 1 keV, we find $f_{\mathrm{WDM}} < 0.16$ (2$\sigma$), with constraints loosening to 35\%, 50\%, and 67\% for $m_{\mathrm{WDM}}$ = 2, 3, and 4 keV, respectively. Our results for pure WDM reaffirm the lower bounds of previous work. Crucially, we account for the fixed resolution of simulations and the impact of patchy reionization, demonstrating their minimal influence on mixed dark matter constraints. This robustness paves the way for tighter bounds with improved statistical samples in the future. Our findings suggest that CWDM models can naturally accommodate mild suppression of matter clustering in the high redshift Lyman-$\alpha$ forest 1D flux power, potentially offering a resolution to some of the ongoing cosmological tensions at low redshifts, namely the $S_{8}$ tension.

          Hydrodynamic Modelling of Early Peaks in Type Ibc Supernovae with Shock Cooling Emission from Circumstellar Matter

 - **Abstract**
 Recent high-cadence transient surveys have uncovered a rare subclass of Type Ibc supernovae (SNe) that exhibit an early, blue peak lasting a few days before the main, radioactively powered peak. Since progenitors of Type Ibc SNe are typically compact and lack an extended envelope, this early peak is commonly attributed to shock cooling emission from circumstellar matter (CSM) surrounding the progenitor star. As such, these SNe provide a unique opportunity to constrain the pre-explosion activity of Type Ibc SN progenitors. We present the first systematic study of this Type Ibc SN population that uses hydrodynamic modelling. We simulated Type Ibc SNe exploding in a CSM using the multi-group radiation-hydrodynamics code STELLA, exploring a range of SN and CSM properties. By comparing the resulting theoretical multi-band light curves to a sample of seven Type Ibc SNe with early peaks, we constrained their CSM properties. Assuming a wind-like density distribution for the CSM, we found CSM masses of $10^{-2} - 10^{-1} \ \mathrm{M}_\odot$ and CSM radii of $(1 - 5) \times 10^3 \ \mathrm{R}_\odot$. While the masses were roughly consistent with a previous estimate obtained using an analytical model, the radii were significantly different, likely due to our assumption of spatially spread out CSM. We infer that the progenitors could have created CSM via late-time binary mass transfer or pulsational pair instability. We also estimate that, in the planned ULTRASAT high-cadence survey, $\sim 30$ shock cooling peaks from Type Ibc SNe will be observed.

 - **Abstract**
 Recovering high-fidelity images of the night sky from blurred observations is a fundamental problem in astronomy, where traditional methods typically fall short. In ground-based astronomy, combining multiple exposures to enhance signal-to-noise ratios is further complicated by variations in the point-spread function caused by atmospheric turbulence. In this work, we present a self-supervised multi-frame method, based on deep image priors, for denoising, deblurring, and coadding ground-based exposures. Central to our approach is a carefully designed convolutional neural network that integrates information across multiple observations and enforces physically motivated constraints. We demonstrate the method's potential by processing Hyper Suprime-Cam exposures, yielding promising preliminary results with sharper restored images.

 - **Abstract**
 As an interesting subclass of gamma-ray burst (GRB), Type IL GRB (such as GRB 211211A and GRB 230307A) features a long-duration prompt emission but originating from compact binary merger. The "long duration" emisison of Type IL GRB are dominately composed of the main burst, rather than the extended emission, differentiating them from the traditional "long-short" GRB (e.g., GRB 060614). Previous study has reported several Type IL GRBs by visual inspection of their light curves. In this work, we established a detailed criterion to identify Type IL GRBs by light curve, and then systematically searched the archival \textit{Fermi}/GBM data with this criterion, resulting in a sample of 5 type IL GRBs from January 1, 2014 to January 1, 2024, i.e. GRB 230307A, GRB 211211A, GRB 200914A, GRB 200311A and GRB 170228A. Apart from the light curve pattern, we find that the temporal and spectral properties of these 5 GRBs also support this classification. Interestingly, we find that the energy ratio between extended emission and main emission is almost constant ($\sim0.7$, with small scattering) for these GRBs, which have strong implication on the mechanism of Type IL burst. We discuss theoretical models to interpret the progenitor, central engine, and extended emission of these Type IL bursts.

 - **Abstract**
 This study presents calculations of rate coefficients, resonance strengths, and cross sections for the dielectronic recombination (DR) of Y^+, Sr^+, Te^2+, and Ce^2+--low-charge ions relevant to kilonovae and non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) plasmas. Using relativistic atomic structure methods, we computed DR rate coefficients under conditions typical of these environments. Our results highlight the critical role of low-lying DR resonances in shaping rate coefficients at kilonova temperatures (~ 10^4 K) and regulating charge-state distributions. Pronounced near-threshold DR resonances significantly influence the evolving ionization states and opacity of neutron star merger ejecta. Comparisons with previous studies emphasize the necessity of including high-n Rydberg states for accurate DR rate coefficients, especially for complex heavy ions with dense energy levels. Discrepancies with existing datasets underscore the need for refined computational techniques to minimize uncertainties. These results provide essential input for interpreting spectroscopic observations of neutron star mergers, including James Webb Space Telescope data. We also put forward suitable candidates for experimental studies, recognizing the challenges involved in such measurements. The data presented here have potential to refine models of heavy-element nucleosynthesis, enhance plasma simulation accuracy, and improve non-LTE plasma modeling in astrophysical and laboratory settings.

          Evolution of the Comptonizing medium of the black-hole candidate Swift J1727.8$-$1613 along the hard to hard-intermediate state transition using NICER

 - **Abstract**
 We analyse the properties of the Comptonizing medium in the black-hole X-ray binary Swift J1727.8$-$1613 using the time-dependent Comptonization model vkompth, using NICER observations of type-C QPOs in the hard and hard-intermediate states. During the 2023 outburst of the source, we measure the rms and phase lags of the QPO across 45 observations as the QPO frequency, $\nu_{\rm QPO}$, evolves from $\sim 0.3$ Hz to $\sim 7$ Hz. By simultaneously fitting the time-averaged spectrum of the source and the rms and lag spectra of the QPO, we derive the evolution of the disk and corona parameters. At $\nu_{\rm QPO} = 0.34$ Hz, the QPO phase lags are hard, with 10 keV photons lagging 0.5 keV photons by $\sim 0.5$ rad. As $\nu_{\rm QPO}$ increases, the lags for the same energy bands decrease, reaching near zero at $\nu_{\rm QPO} \sim 1.2$ Hz, and then reverse to soft lags of $\sim -1.1$ rad at $\nu_{\rm QPO} \sim 7$ Hz. Initially, the inner radius of the accretion disk is truncated at $\sim 30-40 R_g$ (assuming a 10 solar-mass black hole) and, as the QPO frequency increases, the truncation radius decreases down to $\sim 10 R_g$. Initially, two coronas of sizes of $\sim 6.5 \times 10^3$ km and $\sim 2 \times 10^3$ km, extend over the disk and are illuminated by different regions of the disk. As the QPO frequency increases, both the coronas shrink to $\sim 2 \times 10^3$ km at $\nu_{\rm QPO} = 2.5$ Hz. Following a data gap, one corona expands again, peaking at a size of $\sim 2 \times 10^4$ km. We interpret the evolution of the coronal size in the context of accompanying radio observations, discussing its implications for the interplay between the corona and the jet.

          Revealing the ages of metal-rich RR Lyrae via kinematic label transfer

 - **Abstract**
 RR Lyrae stars have long been considered reliable tracers of old, metal-poor populations, primarily due to their prevalence in globular clusters and the Galactic halo. However, the discovery of a metal-rich subpopulation in the Galactic disc, kinematically colder and more rotationally supported, challenges this classical view. Understanding the age of these metal-rich RR Lyrae stars is crucial for constraining their formation pathways and assessing what Galactic populations they are tracing. In this work, we leverage the unprecedented astrometric precision of Gaia DR3 to infer the age distribution of metal-rich RR Lyrae stars through a kinematic comparison with O-rich Mira variables. Mira variables, with their well-established period-age relation, serve as a natural clock, allowing us to transfer age information to RR Lyrae stars via their phase-space properties. By applying this approach across different metallicity bins, we find that the most metal-rich RR Lyrae stars ($[\rm Fe/H] > -0.5$) exhibit kinematics consistent with a population significantly younger ($\approx 6-7$ Gyr) than typically assumed for RR Lyrae stars. In contrast, those with $-1 < [\rm Fe/H] < -0.5$ show properties more aligned with older ($\approx 9-11$ Gyr) populations. Interestingly, we also find evidence of a possible double age populations for the most metal-rich RR Lyrae, one younger with ages between 3 and 6 Gyr, and another one older ranging from 8 to 11 Gyr. These results provide strong evidence that metal-rich RR Lyrae stars in the Galactic field do not exclusively trace ancient populations. This finding challenges the current model of RR Lyrae formation and supports alternative formation scenarios, such as binary evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Modern detector manufacturing allows spectral and polarimetric filters to be directly integrated on top of separate detector pixels. This enables the creation of CubeSat-sized spectro-polarimetric instruments that are not much larger than the detector and a lens. Redundancy inherent to the observed scene, offers the opportunity for sparse sampling in the form of not scanning all filters at every location. However, when there are fewer pushbroom steps than filters, data are missing in the resulting data cube. The missing, largely redundant data can be filled in with interpolation methods, often called demosaicers. The choice of filters and their precise layout influences the performance of the instrument after the demosaicing process. In these proceedings we describe a part of a design toolbox for both the filter layout and the optimum parameters for the reconstruction to a full spectro-polarimetric data cube. The design tool is based on training a (neural) network and jointly updating the values of the filters and demosaicer. We optimized a filter layout by training on spectro-polarimetric remote observations of the Earth acquired by SPEX airborne. This optimised filter layout could reconstruct a validation scene from five overlapping snapshots (pushbroom steps), which would take 109 pushbroom steps when measuring with a classical layout and no reconstruction.

 - **Abstract**
 One of the primary objectives in modern astronomy is to discover and study planets with characteristics similar to Earth. This pursuit involves analyzing the spectra of exoplanets and searching for biosignatures. Contamination of spectra by nearby objects (e.g., other planets and moons in the same system) is a significant concern and must be addressed for future exo-Earth searching missions. The aim is to estimate, for habitable planets, the probability of spectral contamination by other planets within the same star system. This investigation focuses on the Large Interferometer for Exoplanets (LIFE). Since the Rayleigh criterion is inapplicable to interferometers such as those proposed for LIFE, we present new criteria based on the principle of parsimony, which take into account two types of issues: contamination or blending of point sources, and cancellation of point sources due to destructive interference. We define a new spatial resolution metric associated with contamination or cancellation that generalizes to a broader family of observing instruments. In the current baseline design, LIFE is an X-array architecture nulling interferometer. Our investigation reveals that its transmission map introduces the potential for two point sources to appear as one, even if they do not appear in close proximity. We find that LIFE has a spatial resolution comparable to that of a traditional telescope with a diameter of $D = 600\,\text{m}$, observing at $\lambda = 4 \,\mu\text{m}$. Our survey of a star system population shows that, out of 73.4 expected habitable planets detected, 71.3 are not contaminated on average.

 - **Abstract**
 Future telescopes will survey temperate, terrestrial exoplanets to estimate the frequency of habitable ($\eta_{\text{Hab}}$) or inhabited ($\eta_{\text{Life}}$) planets. This study aims to determine the minimum number of planets ($N$) required to draw statistically significant conclusions, particularly in the case of a null result (i.e., no detections). Using a Bayesian framework, we analyzed surveys of up to $N=100$ planets to infer the frequency of a binary observable feature ($\eta_{\text{obs}}$) after null results. Posterior best fits and upper limits were derived for various survey sizes and compared with predicted yields from missions like the Large Interferometer for Exoplanets (LIFE) and the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO). Our findings indicate that $N=20-50$ ``perfect'' observations (100\% confidence in detecting or excluding the feature) yield conclusions relatively independent of priors. To achieve 99.9\% upper limits of $\eta_{\text{obs}} \leq 0.2/0.1$, approximately $N \simeq 40/80$ observations are needed. For ``imperfect'' observations, uncertainties in interpretation and sample biases become limiting factors. We show that LIFE and HWO aim for sufficiently large survey sizes to provide statistically meaningful estimates of habitable environments and life prevalence under these assumptions. However, robust conclusions require careful sample selection and high-confidence detection or exclusion of features in each observation.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the realization of quintom scenario for dynamical dark energy within modified gravity theories that can efficiently fit the recent observational datasets. Starting from a general effective field theory formulation of dark energy in metric-affine geometry, we derive the background action in unitary gauge and we demonstrate how both $f(T)$ and $f(Q)$ gravity can naturally realize quintom behavior through appropriate forms and parameter choices. Additionally, using the Gaussian process reconstruction of the latest DESI DR2 BAO data combined with SNe and CMB observations, we extract the reconstructed dark-energy equation-of-state parameter, showing that it exhibits quintom-type evolution, crossing the phantom divide from below. Moreover, through detailed parameter estimations and application of information criteria, we compare the model with the quadratic one. Our results show that, due to its rich structure, modified gravity stands as one of the main candidates for the realization of the data-favoured dynamical dark energy.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results of our study of the long-period eclipsing binary star \Aur. The results are based on spectroscopic data obtained with the UFES échelle spectrograph and photometric observations from TESS. The derived radial velocity curve is based on 17 spectra obtained between 2021 and 2023, covering all orbital phases of this binary system. The orbital period determined from TESS data, $P = 27.019803 \pm 0.000003$ days, agrees within uncertainties with the period established in previous studies. The model constructed for the TESS photometric light curve achieves a precision of 0.01\%. The effective temperatures of both components, as well as the system metallicity, were directly derived from the spectra and are $T_\mathrm{eff, A} = 6250 \pm 50$\,K, $T_\mathrm{eff, B} = 5855 \pm 50$\,K, and $\mathrm{[Fe/H]} = -0.10 \pm 0.08$, respectively. Our analysis of the photometric and spectroscopic data allowed us to directly compute the luminosities of the components, $L_A = 1.82\,L_\odot$ and $L_B = 1.07\,L_\odot$, their radii, $R_A = 1.15\,R_\odot$ and $R_B = 1.00\,R_\odot$, and their masses, $M_A = 1.137\,M_\odot$ and $M_B = 1.023\,M_\odot$, with uncertainties below 1\%. Comparison with evolutionary tracks indicates that the system's age is $1.18 \pm 0.10$\,Gyr, and both components are still on the main sequence. The \Aur\ system is particularly interesting due to the partial eclipse of the primary component, which results in the ``inversion'' of the primary and secondary minima in the photometric light curve.

 - **Abstract**
 One of the observational challenges in the standard cosmological model is known as the Hubble tension. This $\sim$ 5$\sigma$ discrepancy between early and late measurements of the Hubble Constant arises from observations that rely on cosmological distance estimates, either explicitly or implicitly. In this study, we relax the assumption of the Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) distance-redshift relation and explore the influence of small-scale inhomogeneities on the propagation of light from distant sources, using the Zeldovich-Kantowski-Dyer-Roeder (ZKDR) approximation as an alternative approach to address this tension. We employ the ZKDR equation along with a modified version to test our hypothesis using recent Type Ia supernovae data from the Pantheon+ compilation and the SH0ES collaboration and six gravitational lens systems from the H0LiCOW collaboration. Our findings indicate that a background model characterized by the ZKDR approximation and its modifications does not solve or alleviate the Hubble tension.

 - **Abstract**
 Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) have emerged as powerful probes in cosmology. An optimized method for extracting the cosmic baryon density from localized FRBs, based on maximizing the joint likelihood function of the extragalactic dispersion measure ($\mathrm{DM}_{\mathrm{ext}}$), was proposed by Macquart et al. [Nature 581, 391 (2020)]. In this Letter, we identify a crucial term that was omitted in their derivation of the probability density function (PDF) for $\mathrm{DM}_{\mathrm{ext}}$. Using simulated FRB data, we demonstrate that neglecting this term leads to a systematic bias in the inferred cosmic baryon density, with deviations exceeding the $1\sigma$ confidence level. This highlights the importance of the missing term for the reliable cosmological application of FRBs. Furthermore, employing a sample of 88 real localized FRBs, we find that the baryon density derived using the original PDF by Macquart et al. is inconsistent with the Planck 2018 CMB data, while our corrected PDF yields a result in excellent agreement. We conclude that the omitted term is essential and must be included in order to obtain accurate cosmological constraints from FRB observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Growing numbers of exoplanet detections continue to reveal the diverse nature of planetary systems. Planet formation around late-type M dwarfs is of particular interest. These systems provide practical laboratories to measure exoplanet occurrence rates for M dwarfs, thus testing how the outcomes of planet formation scale with host mass, and how they compare to Sun-like stars. Here, we report the discovery of TOI-6478b, a cold ($T_{\text{eq}}=204\,$K) Neptune-like planet orbiting an M5 star ($R_\star=0.234\pm0.012\,\text{R}_\odot$, $M_\star=0.230\pm0.007\,\text{M}_\odot$, $T_{\text{eff}}=3230\pm75\,$K) which is a member of the Milky Way's thick disc. We measure a planet radius of $R_b=4.6\pm0.24\,\text{R}_\oplus$ on a $P_b=34.005019\pm0.000025\,$d orbit. Using radial velocities, we calculate an upper mass limit of $M_b\leq9.9\,\text{M}_\oplus$ ($M_b\leq0.6\,\text{M}_{\text{Nep}})$, with $3\,\sigma$ confidence. TOI-6478b is a milestone planet in the study of cold, Neptune-like worlds. Thanks to its large atmospheric scale height, it is amenable to atmospheric characterisation with facilities such as JWST, and will provide an excellent probe of atmospheric chemistry in this cold regime. It is one of very few transiting exoplanets that orbit beyond their system's ice-line whose atmospheric chemical composition can be measured. Based on our current understanding of this planet, we estimate TOI-6478b's spectroscopic features (in transmission) can be $\sim2.5\times$ as high as the widely studied planet K2-18b.

 - **Abstract**
 Lyman Alpha Emitters (LAEs) are valuable high-redshift cosmological probes traditionally identified using specialized narrow-band photometric surveys. In ground-based spectroscopy, it can be difficult to distinguish the sharp LAE peak from residual sky emission lines using automated methods, leading to misclassified redshifts. We present a Bayesian spectral component separation technique to automatically determine spectroscopic redshifts for LAEs while marginalizing over sky residuals. We use visually inspected spectra of LAEs obtained using the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) to create a data-driven prior and can determine redshift by jointly inferring sky residual, LAE, and residual components for each individual spectrum. We demonstrate this method on 910 spectroscopically observed $z = 2-4$ DESI LAE candidate spectra and determine their redshifts with $>$90% accuracy when validated against visually inspected redshifts. Using the $\Delta \chi^2$ value from our pipeline as a proxy for detection confidence, we then explore potential survey design choices and implications for targeting LAEs with medium-band photometry. This method allows for scalability and accuracy in determining redshifts from DESI spectra, and the results provide recommendations for LAE targeting in anticipation of future high-redshift spectroscopic surveys.

          Combining high-contrast imaging with high-resolution spectroscopy: Actual on-sky MIRI/MRS results compared to expectations

 - **Abstract**
 CONTEXT: Combining high-contrast imaging with high-resolution spectroscopy offers a powerful way to detect and characterize exoplanets around nearby stars, despite challenges linked to their faintness. Instruments like VLT/SPHERE are state of the art in high-contrast imaging, but their spectral resolution (R=50) limits them to basic characterization of close companions. These systems can detect planets down to 5-10 Mjup at 10 AU from their stars. Detection limits are mainly constrained by speckle noise, which dominates over photon and detector noise at short separations, even with advanced differential imaging. Space-based high-contrast imaging is also limited by image stability. Speckle noise can, however, be mitigated through molecular mapping, a technique that leverages high-resolution spectroscopic data. AIMS: We aim to predict detection limits in spectro-imaging after molecular mapping, analyzing how photon and detector noise propagate and comparing predictions with real data to assess performance losses from instrumental effects. We also propose mitigation strategies and validate our model using observations. METHODS: We analyzed JWST/MIRI/MRS data with FastCurves, an numerical tool, and compared results to outputs from the MIRI simulator. We also applied principal component analysis (PCA) to identify and isolate systematic effects, with and without molecular mapping. RESULTS: We studied various systematic effects and their impacts on signal and noise. PCA helped highlight and reduce straylight, fringes, and aliasing. We further compared observed and modeled companion spectra. CONCLUSIONS: FastCurves was improved to account for systematics and validated with real data. In high-flux regimes, systematics impose contrast limits even with molecular mapping. Our approach could benefit other instruments and inform the planning of future facilities like ELT/ANDES and ELT/PCS.

 - **Abstract**
 The Sun is the most studied of all stars, and thus constitutes a benchmark for stellar models. However, our vision of the Sun is still incomplete, as illustrated by the current debate on its chemical composition. The problem reaches far beyond chemical abundances and is intimately linked to microscopic and macroscopic physical ingredients of solar models such as radiative opacity, for which experimental results have been recently measured that still await theoretical explanations. We present opacity profiles derived from helioseismic inferences and compare them with detailed theoretical computations of individual element contributions using three different opacity computation codes, in a complementary way to experimental results. We find that our seismic opacity is about 10% higher than theoretical values used in current solar models around 2 million degrees, but lower by 35% than some recent available theoretical values. Using the Sun as a laboratory of fundamental physics, we show that quantitative comparisons between various opacity tables are required to understand the origin of the discrepancies between reported helioseismic, theoretical and experimental opacity values.

 - **Abstract**
 Detection of spectral line in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) is importance for studying GRB physics, as it provides insights into the composition and physical conditions of the GRB environment. However, progress in detecting X-ray or gamma-ray emission and absorption lines in GRB spectra has been relatively slow, only the narrow emission line feature of about 10 MeV found in GRB 221009A has exhibited a significance exceeding $5 \sigma$. Here, we report the probable evidence of a narrow emission feature at about 2.1 mega-electron volts (MeV) in the spectrum of GRB 221023A. The highest statistical significance of this feature is observed in the time interval between 8 and 30 seconds after Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor trigger, with the chance probability value $<2.56 \times 10^{-5}$ (after accounting for the look-elsewhere effect), corresponding to a Gaussian-equivalent significance $> 4.20 \sigma$. We interpret this feature as being generated through the de-excitation of excited electrons in the relativistic hydrogen-like high-atomic-number ions entrained in the GRB jet.

          HIP 15429: a newborn Be star on an eccentric binary orbit

 - **Abstract**
 We identified a new post-interaction binary, HIP 15429, consisting of a stripped star and a recently formed, rapidly rotating Be star companion ($v \sin i \approx 270$ km/s) sharing many similarities with recently identified bloated stripped stars. From orbital fitting of multi-epoch radial velocities we find a 221-day period. We also find an eccentricity of $e=0.52$, which is unexpectedly high as tides are expected to have circularised the orbit efficiently during the presumed recent mass transfer. The formation of a circumbinary disk during the mass transfer phase or the presence of an unseen tertiary companion might explain the orbit's high eccentricity. We determined physical parameters for both stars by fitting the spectra of the disentangled binary components and multi-band photometry. The stripped nature of the donor star is affirmed by its high luminosity at a low inferred mass ($\lesssim 1 \mathrm{M}_\odot$) and imprints of CNO-processed material in the surface abundances. The donor's relatively large radius and cool temperature ($T_{\mathrm{eff}} = 13.5 \pm 0.5$ kK) suggest that it has only recently ceased mass transfer. Evolutionary models assuming a 5-6 $\mathrm{M}_\odot$ progenitor can reproduce these parameters and imply that the binary is currently evolving towards a stage where the donor becomes a subdwarf orbiting a Be star. The remarkably high eccentricity of HIP 15429 challenges standard tidal evolution models, suggesting either inefficient tidal dissipation or external influences, such as a tertiary companion or circumbinary disk. This underscores the need to identify and characterise more post-mass transfer binaries to benchmark and refine theoretical models of binary evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the non-Gaussianity of second-order matter density perturbations induced by primordial gravitational waves (GWs). These tensor-induced scalar modes arise from local fluctuations in the GWs energy density, which is quadratic in tensor perturbations. The resulting second-order density contrast follows a chi-squared distribution, naturally exhibiting significant non-Gaussianity. We compute the bispectrum of these tensor-induced scalar modes and analyze its dependence on various primordial GWs power spectra, including scale-invariant, blue-tilted, Gaussian-bump, and monochromatic sources. We find that the bispectrum shape is inherently sensitive to the underlying GWs spectrum by construction. In particular, Gaussian-bump and monochromatic sources produce a strong signal peaking in the equilateral configuration, similar to the effect of scalar-induced tensor modes. Our findings reveal a new way to probe primordial GWs via galaxy surveys and highlight a unique feature of tensor-induced density perturbations, otherwise mimicking linear ones on sub-horizon scales.

          New empirical mass-loss recipe for UV radiation line-driven winds of hot stars across various metallicities

 - **Abstract**
 The winds of massive stars remove a significant fraction of their mass, strongly impacting their evolution. As a star evolves, the rate at which it loses mass changes. In stellar evolution codes, different mass-loss recipes are employed for different evolutionary stages. The choice of the recipes is user-dependent and the conditions for switching between them are poorly defined. Focusing on hot stars, we aim to produce a physically motivated, empirically calibrated mass-loss recipe suitable for a wide range of metallicities. We want to provide a ready-to-use universal recipe that eliminates the need for switching between recipes for hot stars during stellar evolution calculations. We compile a sample of hot stars with reliable stellar and wind parameters in the Galaxy and the Magellanic Clouds. The sample is used to determine the dependence of the mass-loss rate on the basic stellar parameters. We find that independent of evolutionary stage and temperature, the wind mass-loss rate is a function of the electron-scattering Eddington parameter ($\Gamma_e$) and metallicity (Z), being in line with expectations of radiation-driven wind theory. Our derived scaling relation provides an adequate ($\Delta$log($\dot{M}$/(M$_\odot$/yr)) = 0.43) and broadly applicable mass-loss recipe for hot stars. The newly derived mass-loss recipe covers nearly the entire parameter space of hot stars with UV radiation-driven winds and eliminates the need for interpolation between mass-loss formulae at different evolutionary stages when applied in stellar evolution models. Examples of stellar evolution calculations using our new recipe reveal that the predictions on the ionizing fluxes and final fates of massive stars, especially at low metallicity, differ significantly from models that use the standard mass-loss rates, impacting our understanding of stellar populations at low metallicity and in the young Universe.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a differentiable, end-to-end Bayesian forward modeling framework for line intensity mapping cosmology experiments, with a specific focus on low-frequency radio telescopes targeting the redshifted 21 cm line from neutral hydrogen as a cosmological probe. Our framework is capable of posterior density estimation of the cosmological signal jointly with foreground and telescope parameters at the field level. Our key aim is to be able to optimize the model's high-dimensional, non-linear, and ill-conditioned parameter space, while also sampling from it to perform robust uncertainty quantification within a Bayesian framework. We show how a differentiable programming paradigm, accelerated by recent advances in machine learning software and hardware, can make this computationally-demanding, end-to-end Bayesian approach feasible. We demonstrate a proof-of-concept on a simplified signal recovery problem for the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array experiment, highlighting the framework's ability to build confidence in early 21 cm signal detections even in the presence of poorly understood foregrounds and instrumental systematics. We use a Hessian-preconditioned Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm to efficiently sample our parameter space with a dimensionality approaching $N\sim10^5$, which enables joint, end-to-end nuisance parameter marginalization over foreground and instrumental terms. Lastly, we introduce a new spherical harmonic formalism that is a complete and orthogonal basis on the cut sky relevant to drift-scan radio surveys, which we call the spherical stripe harmonic formalism, and it's associated three-dimensional basis, the spherical stripe Fourier-Bessel formalism.

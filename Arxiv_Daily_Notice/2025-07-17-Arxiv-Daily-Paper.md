 - **Abstract**
 The Earth possesses many environmental extremes that mimic conditions on extraterrestrial worlds. The stratosphere at 30-40 km altitude closely resembles the surface of Mars in terms of pressure, temperature, and radiation levels (UV, proton, and Galactic cosmic rays). While microbial life in the troposphere is well documented, the true upper limit of Earth's biosphere remains unclear. The stratosphere offers a promising environment to explore microbial survival in such extreme conditions. Despite its significance to astrobiology, this region remains largely unexplored due to difficulties in access and avoiding contamination. To address this, we have developed SAMPLE (Stratospheric Altitude Microbiology Probe for Life Existence), a balloon-borne payload designed to collect dust samples from the stratosphere and return them in conditions suitable for lab analysis. The entire system is novel and designed in-house, with weight- and stress-optimized components. The main payload includes three pre-sterilized sampling trays and a controller that determines altitude and governs tray operation. One tray will remain closed during flight (airborne control) and another on the ground (cleanroom control) to monitor contamination. Additional systems include environmental sensors, GPS trackers, cameras, and a Flight Termination Unit (FTU) to end the mission once sampling is complete. A parachute ensures the safe recovery of the payload. Upon retrieving the payload, the sampling trays (including controls) will be sent to a suitable laboratory where the samples will be examined for the presence and nature of collected material.

 - **Abstract**
 This white paper highlights the work that is needed to anticipate the challenges and societal impacts of a possible technosignature detection. We recommend practical steps to strengthen NASA's astrobiology agenda, guided by the existing interdisciplinary framework of the SETI PostDetection Hub (est. 2022) at the University of St Andrews (Elliot et al. 2023), which emphasizes comprehensive preparedness across science, society, governance, and communication. NASA can significantly enhance readiness by supporting deep interdisciplinary integration, funding SETI post-detection research infrastructure, and cultivating international collaboration. We outline six key dimensions of readiness-directed evidence-based research: cross-divisional methodologies, humanities and social sciences integration, communication, strategic foresight, and development of resilient global infrastructures.

          Can Moons Exist around the Habitable-zone Planet K2-18b?

 - **Abstract**
 K2-18b closely orbits a nearby M3 dwarf within its habitable zone, where this planet could be either a super-Earth or a mini-Neptune. Recent studies using transit spectroscopy suggest that it is Hycean in nature, but this classification is currently controversial. We use the N-body integrator rebound and its extension library reboundx to investigate the possibility of exomoons around K2-18b. Due to tidal interactions that induce outward migration, we find that any moons would be extremely unlikely. If formed, their lifetimes would be relatively short, not exceeding 10 Myr assuming Earth-like or Neptune-like tidal parameters for K2-18b. Recent studies estimate the stellar (and system) lifetime as 3 Gyr, which is significantly longer than the tidal migration timescale. We show that exomoons are unlikely to survive around K2-18b due to rapid tidal-driven migration, casting doubt on moon-based habitability scenarios for short-period M-dwarf planets in general.

 - **Abstract**
 The chemical abundance patterns of near-pristine objects provide important constraints on the properties of the first generations of stars in the Universe. We present the chemical abundances of five very metal-poor ([M/H]<-2.5) sub damped Lyman alpha systems (subDLAs) covering the redshift range $3.6<z<4.3$, identified with the XQ-100 survey. We find that the subDLAs in our sample show consistent chemical abundance patterns (in particular [C/O], [Al/O], and [Fe/O]) with those of very metal-poor DLAs. Based on Voigt profile fitting, the chemical abundance ratios [C/O], [Al/O], and [Si/O] of individual velocity components in at least three of the subDLAs shows some intrinsic scatter. In order to verify these chemical inhomogeneities in absorption components, we present a novel method for computing ionization corrections (ICs) on a component-by-component basis and show that ICs alone cannot explain the variations in [C/O], [Al/O], and [Si/O] between components of the same absorber at ~2 sigma significance. Comparing the observed abundance ratios to the simulated core-collapse supernovae yields of early stellar populations, we find that all individual components of the subDLAs appears to be enriched by progenitor masses of <30 M_sol. The observed inhomogeneities between components can be reproduced by differences in the progenitor mass or supernova explosion energy. As such, the observed chemical inhomogeneities between components can be explained by poorly mixed gas from different nucleosynthetic events.

          Stephenson 2 DFK 52: Discovery of an exotic red supergiant in the massive stellar cluster RSGC2

 - **Abstract**
 Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations at 1.3mm have recently revealed surprising complexity in the circumstellar environment of DFK 52, a red supergiant (RSG) located in the Stephenson 2 massive open cluster. We provide an initial characterisation of the star's mass-loss properties by studying its circumstellar emission in continuum, $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, and SiO rotational lines. We find that DFK 52 is surrounded by an extremely large outflow (up to 50,000 au in radius) that shows complex morphologies in both its molecular and dust emission. The size of the circumstellar medium is unprecedented, even when compared with other known extreme RSGs, and its lower luminosity indicates that its mass ejection mechanism may be unique among this population. The molecular emission can be partially reproduced by a two-component model consisting of a fast (27 km/s) detached equatorial component with $M{\sim}0.05$ $M_{\odot}$ and a slow (10 km/s) spherical envelope with $\dot{M}\sim3\times10^{-6}$ $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. This suggests that DFK 52 underwent a dramatic mass-loss event $\sim$4000 years ago, but has since transitioned into having a slower more symmetric mass loss. We conservatively estimate a total mass of $0.1-1$ $M_{\odot}$ in the complex extended regions of the outflow. The uncertain nature of the dramatic mass loss warrants extensive follow-up of this likely supernova progenitor.

          A young gas giant and hidden substructures in a protoplanetary disk

 - **Abstract**
 The detection of planets in protoplanetary disks has proven to be extremely challenging. In contrast, rings and gaps, usually attributed to planet-disk interactions, have been found in virtually every large protoplanetary (Class II) disk observed at 0.9-1.3 mm with sufficient spatial resolution (5 au). The nearby disk around MP Mus (PDS 66) stands as an exception to this rule, and its advanced age (7-10 Myr) is particularly difficult to reconcile with its apparent lack of substructures. Despite the disk's smooth appearance, Gaia data of MP Mus show a significant proper motion anomaly, signalling the presence of a companion. Here we present ALMA 3 mm observations of the system with comparable high spatial resolution to previous 1.3 mm data. The new observations pierce deeper into the disk midplane and reveal an inner cavity (<3 au) and a ring at 10 au. The disk structure inferred from ALMA observations narrows down the properties of the companion to a gas giant orbiting at 1-3 au, and hydrodynamic simulations further confirm that such a planet can produce the observed cavity. These independent pieces of evidence constitute an indirect but compelling detection of an exoplanet within a protoplanetary disk using Gaia astrometry. MP Mus is the first system in which undetected substructures are revealed thanks to the lower optical depths at longer wavelengths, suggesting that rings and gaps are even more abundant than what is currently believed.

          Towards sub-milliarcsecond astrometric precision using seeing-limited imaging

 - **Abstract**
 The Earth's atmospheric turbulence degrades the precision of ground-based astrometry. Here we discuss these limitations and propose that, with proper treatment of systematics and by leveraging the many epochs available from the Korean Microlensing Telescope Network (KMTNet), seeing-limited observations can reach sub-milliarcsecond precision. Such observations may be instrumental for the detection of Galactic black holes via microlensing. We present our methodology and pipeline for precise astrometric measurements using seeing-limited observations. The method is a variant of Gaia's Astrometric Global Iterative Solution (AGIS) that include several detrending steps. Tests on 6,500 images of the same field, obtained by KMTNet with typical seeing condition of 1 arcsecond and pixel scale of 0.4 arcsecond, suggest that we can achieve, at the bright end (mag <17), relative proper motion precision of 0.1-0.2 mas/yr, over a baseline of approximately five years, using data from the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO) site. The precision is estimated using bootstrap simulations and further validated by comparing results from two independent KMTNet telescopes.

          Double White Dwarf Binaries in SDSS-V DR19 : The discovery of a rare DA+DQ white dwarf binary with 31 hour orbital period

 - **Abstract**
 Binaries of two white dwarfs (WDs) are an important class of astrophysical objects that are theorized to lead to Type Ia supernovae and are also used to gain insight into complex processes involved in stellar binary evolution. We report the discovery of SDSS~J090618.44+022311.6, a rare post-common envelope binary of a hydrogen atmospheric DA WD and a DQ WD which shows carbon absorption features, and is only the fourth such binary known. We combine the available spectroscopic, photometric, and radial velocity data to provide a self-consistent model for the binary and discuss its history as a binary DA+DQ. The system has a period of 31.17 hours with masses of 0.42 M$_{\odot}$ for DA WD and 0.49 M$_{\odot}$ for DQ WD. The corresponding cooling ages point to an Algol type of evolution with the lower mass star evolving into a DA WD first and later the massive DQ WD is formed. The system has a merger timescale of 450 Gyrs and will lead to the formation of a massive WD. With this, the number of known DA+DQ WD binaries has increased to four, and we find that their stellar properties all lie in the same range. Detailed study of more such systems is vital to understand common processes involved in the formation of this rare class of binaries and give insights towards the broader picture of WD spectral evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Extra-tidal features around globular clusters (GCs) are tracers of their disruption, stellar stream formation, and their host's gravitational potential. However, these features remain challenging to detect due to their low surface brightness. We conduct a systematic search for such features around 19 GCs in the DECam Local Volume Exploration (DELVE) survey Data Release 2, discovering a new extra-tidal envelope around NGC 5897 and find tentative evidence for an extended envelope surrounding NGC 7492. Through a combination of dynamical modeling and analyzing synthetic stellar populations, we demonstrate these envelopes may have formed through tidal disruption. We use these models to explore the detectability of these features in the upcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), finding that while LSST's deeper photometry will enhance detection significance, additional methods for foreground removal like proper motions or metallicities may be important for robust stream detection. Our results both add to the sample of globular clusters with extra-tidal features and provide insights on interpreting similar features in current and upcoming data.

          Chemical transformation of CO in evolving protoplanetary discs across stellar masses: a route to C-rich inner regions

 - **Abstract**
 Protoplanetary discs around Very Low Mass Stars (VLMS) show hydrocarbon-rich MIR spectra indicative of C/O>1 in their inner discs, in contrast to discs around higher-mass hosts which mostly show O-bearing species. One scenario proposed to elevate C/O in VLMS inner discs is the advection of O-depleted gas from the outer disc. However, if CO gas remains abundant, C/O can be at most ~1. We test if chemical transformation of CO into other species allows this transport scenario to produce C/O significantly above 1. We track the evolving inner disc C/H and O/H with a 1D disc evolution code. We model the transport of molecules in gas and ice and add conversions of species to represent key reaction pathways at the midplane. We explore the role of disc mass, size, ionization rate, and substructures. The inner disc C/O increases over time due to sequential delivery where O-rich species (e.g. H2O) give way to C-rich species (e.g. CH4). To reach C/O>1, separating C and O is key, hence the liberation of C from gaseous CO by He+ is critical. Ionization drives this chemistry and needs rates >~10^-17 s^-1 for VLMSs for sufficient chemical evolution within a disc lifetime. However, <~10^-17 s^-1 is needed to ensure that C/O stays <1 for the first few Myr in T Tauri discs. While C/O is usually higher for VLMS than T Tauri stars due to faster sequential delivery, C/O significantly above 1 is only produced by combining gas-phase CO destruction with gas advection and radial drift. Sufficient O depletion and hydrocarbon production around VLMSs can then be achieved but may imply higher ionization rates than T Tauris. Observations of older discs may distinguish whether higher ionization rates are indeed needed or faster physical evolution timescales alone are sufficient. CH3OH ice photodissociation at a dust trap between the CH3OH and CH4 snowlines may also liberate C as CH4 gas that can enrich the inner disc.

 - **Abstract**
 Since 2014, the Pierre Auger Observatory has exploited a dedicated trigger and its very high time resolution to study ELVES and harvest record samples of multiple ELVES using the Fluorescence Detector (FD). In 2017, after extending the readout of trace lengths to 0.9 ms, we started observing other types of light transients from the base of the ionosphere, such as HALOS, which deserved further investigation. In December 2023 and April 2024, we installed two additional cameras (TLECAMs), which allow us to perform simultaneous detection of these transients with higher space resolution and longer integration times. Here, we present our first simultaneous observations of SPRITES and ELVES by both TLECAMs and FD. Furthermore, we describe the Python algorithm based on DBSCAN to automatically detect SPRITES in the videos recorded by our TLECAMs and acquire data efficiently without needing the FD trigger.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results of a search for scandium K$_\alpha$ X-ray fluorescence resulting from $^{44}$Ti electron capture decay in four young supernova remnants. We analyzed archival XMM-Newton data from Tycho's SNR, Kepler's SNR, Cassiopeia A, and SN 1987A. We fit the X-ray spectra in regions of interest with up to four components, thermal and power-law, as needed to fit the spectrum, and add a gaussian to test for extra Sc emission. While all require the line with modest confidence, none represent definitive detections on their own, and all are consistent with previous gamma-ray detections or limits on the $^{44}$Ti mass.

 - **Abstract**
 We have previously studied several elements in 58 selected bulge spheroid stars, based on spectral lines in the H-band. We now derive the abundances of the less-studied elements phosphorus (P; Z=15), sulphur (S; Z=16), and potassium (K; Z=19). The abundances of P, S, and K in 58 bulge spheroid stars are compared both with the results of a previous analysis of the data from the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE), and with a few available studies of these elements. We derive the individual abundances through spectral synthesis, using the stellar physical parameters available for our sample from the DR17 release of the APOGEE project. We provide recommendations for the best lines to be used for the studied elements among those in the H-band. We also compare the present results, together with literature data, with chemical-evolution models. Finally, the neutrino-process was taken into account for the suitable fit to the odd-Z elements P and K. We confirm that the H-band has useful lines for the derivation of the elements P, S, and K in moderately metal-poor stars. The abundances, plotted together with literature results from high-resolution spectroscopy, indicate that: moderately enhanced phosphorus stars are found, reminiscent results obtained for thick disk and halo stars of metallicity [Fe/H]~-1.0. Therefore, for the first time, we identify this effect to occur in the old stars from the bulge spheroid. Sulphur is an alpha-element and behaves as such. Potassium and sulphur both exhibit some star-to-star scatter, but fit within the expectations from chemical evolution models.

          exoALMA. XVIII. Interpreting large scale kinematic structures as moderate warping

 - **Abstract**
 The exoALMA program gave an unprecedented view of the complex kinematics of protoplanetary disks, revealing diverse structures that remain poorly understood. We show that moderate disk warps ($\sim 0.5-2^\circ$) can naturally explain many of the observed large-scale velocity features with azimuthal wavenumber $m = 1$. Using a simple model, we interpret line-of-sight velocity variations as changes in the projected Keplerian rotation caused by warping of the disk. While not a unique explanation, this interpretation aligns with growing observational evidence that warps are common. We demonstrate that such warps can also produce spiral structures in scattered light and CO brightness temperature, with $\sim 10$ K variations in MWC 758. Within the exoALMA sample, warp properties correlate with stellar accretion rates, suggesting a link between the inner disc and outer disc kinematics. If warps cause large-scale kinematic structure, this has far reaching implications for turbulence, angular momentum transport, and planet formation.

          The evolution of a supermassive binary black hole in an non-spherical nuclear star cluster

 - **Abstract**
 (abridged) We consider a secular orbital evolution of a supermassive binary black hole (SBBH) with unequal masses $M_p$ and $M_s < M_p$ in a central part of a non-spherical nuclear star cluster (NSC). When the mass of NSC inside the orbit is smaller than $M_{s}$ dynamical friction becomes inefficient. The subsequent orbital evolution of SBBH is largely governed by perturbing tidal potential of NSC arising from its non-sphericity. When the perturbing potential is mainly determined by quadrupole harmonics with azimuthal number $|m|=2$ the secular dynamics of the SBBH does not conserve any components of the angular momentum and can lead to the formation of highly eccentric orbits. Such orbits can experience an efficient circularization due to emission of gravitational waves (GW). In this Paper we consider this situation in some detail. We study analytically and numerically the orbital evolution taking into account the important effect of Einstein apsidal precession and estimate the largest possible value of $e$, which can be obtained. We then estimate a possibility of fast orbital circularization through emission of gravitation waves on a highly eccentric orbit, with circularization timescale of the order of the orbital period. We find that our mechanism could result in such events on a time scale of the order of or smaller than a few Gyr. It is stressed that for particular values of the model parameters such events may sometimes be distinguished from the ones expected in more standard scenarios, since in our case the eccentricity may remain substantial all the way down to the final merger. It is also noted that our results can be applied to other astrophysical settings, e.g. to study the orbital evolution of a binary star or a proto planetary system inside a massive deformed gas cloud.

          Volatile enrichment in low-mass planets: Signatures of past planetary disruption?

 - **Abstract**
 Context: Tidal disruption and engulfment events around main-sequence stars, such as the luminous red nova ZTF SLRN-2020 (a candidate planetary-engulfment event), reveal the destruction of close-in giant planets. While current observations focus on stellar accretion and inner dust emission, the fate of the volatile-rich material expelled during disruption remains poorly understood. Aims: We investigate whether the H/He-rich gas expelled from the disrupted planet's envelope and atmosphere can escape the inner system and be gravitationally captured by an outer low-mass planet (a volatile-enriched planet, or VEP), potentially forming a transient atmosphere and producing detectable volatile contamination. Methods: We model the outward diffusion of gas from a tidally stripped giant using two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations with FARGO3D, complemented by analytical estimates of volatile observability and atmospheric escape. We assess the efficiency of gas capture by outer planets and the survival timescales of the resulting secondary atmospheres under high-energy stellar irradiation. Results: Our simulations show that volatile-rich gas can form a VEP. The resulting envelopes can contain between 1e-10 and 1e-6 Earth masses, up to the mass of Earth's atmosphere, for Earth-like planets, yielding transit depths of tens to several hundred ppm. Such signatures may persist for 1 to 100 million years, depending on planetary mass, orbit, and stellar activity. Conclusions: This scenario offers a viable pathway to form volatile-rich atmospheres in evolved low-mass planets. When accompanied by dynamical signatures such as eccentric orbits, these chemical anomalies may trace past planetary disruption. This framework may help interpret the atmospheric and orbital properties of systems like TOI-421b and WASP-107b, shedding new light on the late-stage evolution of planetary systems.

 - **Abstract**
 High-resolution spectroscopy (HRS) plays a crucial role in characterizing exoplanet atmospheres, revealing detailed information about their chemical composition, temperatures, and dynamics. However, inaccuracies in orbital parameters can affect the result of HRS analyses. In this paper, we simulated HRS observations of an exoplanet's transit to model the effects of an offset in transit midpoint or eccentricity on the resulting spectra. We derived analytical equations to relate an offset in transit midpoint or eccentricity to shifted velocities, and compared it with velocities measured from simulated HRS observations. Additionally, we compared velocity shifts in the spectrum of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-76b using previously reported and newly measured transit times. We found that transit midpoint offsets on the order of minutes, combined with eccentricity offsets of approximately $0.1$, lead to significant shifts in velocities, yielding measurements on the order of several kilometers per second. Thus, such uncertainties could conflate derived wind measurements.

 We explore the use of Swin Transformer V2, a pre-trained vision Transformer, for photometric classification in a multi-survey setting by leveraging light curves from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS). We evaluate different strategies for integrating data from these surveys and find that a multi-survey architecture which processes them jointly achieves the best performance. These results highlight the importance of modeling survey-specific characteristics and cross-survey interactions, and provide guidance for building scalable classifiers for future time-domain astronomy.

 - **Abstract**
 On July 1st 2025 the third interstellar object, 3I/ATLAS or C/2025 N1 (ATLAS), was discovered, with an eccentricity of $e=6.15 \pm 0.01$ and perihelion of $q=1.357\pm0.001$ au. We report our initial visible to near-infrared (420-1000 nm) spectrophotometry of 3I/ATLAS using both the Palomar 200 inch telescope and Apache Point Observatory. We measure 3I/ATLAS to have a red spectral slope of 19 %/100 nm in the 420-700 nm range, and a more neutral 6 %/100 nm slope over 700-1000 nm. We detect no notable emission features such as from C$_2$.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a view of the stellar halo in the inner-central regions of the Milky Way (R <~ 10 kpc) mapped by RR Lyrae stars. The combined BRAVA-RR/APOGEE RR Lyrae catalog is used to obtain a sample of 281 RR Lyrae stars located in the bulge region of the Galaxy, but with orbits indicating they belong to the inner-central halo. The RR Lyrae stars in the halo are more metal-poor than the bulge RR Lyrae stars and have pulsation properties more consistent with an accreted population. We use the Milky Way-like zoom-in cosmological simulation Auriga to compare the properties of the RR Lyrae stars to those expected from the "Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage" (GES) merger. The integrals of motions and eccentricities of the RR Lyrae stars are consistent with a small fraction of 6-9 +- 2 % of the inner-central halo RR Lyrae population having originated from GES. This fraction, lower than what is seen in the solar neighborhood, is consistent with trends seen in the Auriga simulation, where a GES-like merger would have a decreasing fraction of GES stars at small Galactocentric radii compared to other accreted populations. Very few of the Auriga inner Galaxy GES-18 particles have properties consistent with belonging to a bulge population with (z_max < 1.1 kpc), indicating that no (or very few) RR Lyrae stars with bulge orbits should have originated from GES.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the Dispersion Leverage Coronagraph (DLC), a novel variation of the Achromatic Interfero Coronagraph (AIC) that is designed for optical systems featuring large, dispersive primary objective gratings. DLC was originally designed for the Diffractive Interfero Coronagraph Exoplanet Resolver (DICER), a notional 20m class infrared space telescope utilizing the enhanced one-dimensional angular resolution of large diffraction gratings in order to discover and characterize near-Earth exoplanets. Here we develop the theoretical foundation for DLC, and apply it to DICER as an example use case. We derive important properties of the DLC system including focal plane transmission maps, stellar leakage, residual optical path difference tolerance, and pointing error/jitter considerations. Ultimately, we found that DLC effectively nulls an on-axis target across the entire spectrum in the focal plane, allowing for 2D/lambda diffraction-limited imaging. It requires asymmetrical fine-guidance tolerances on pointing error/jitter. We work through a benchmark DICER design, explaining the need for a second disperser to reduce background from Zodiacal light, and showing that it could plausibly find and characterize approximately 4 nearby, habitable exoplanets around Sun-like stars in a seven year mission; about 30% of the habitable exoplanets within 8 pc were found in our simulation. The DLC may be useful for any application requiring extremely high resolution, close-companion spectroscopy.

 - **Abstract**
 We present SEDONA-GesaRaT, a rapid code for supernova radiative transfer simulation developed based on the Monte-Carlo radiative transfer code SEDONA. We use a set of atomic physics neural networks (APNN), an artificial intelligence (AI) solver for the non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) atomic physics level population calculation, which is trained and validated on 119 1-D type Ia supernova (SN Ia) radiative transfer simulation results showing great computation speed and accuracy. SEDONA-GesaRaT has been applied to the 3-D SN Ia explosion model N100 to perform a 3-D NLTE radiative transfer calculation. The spatially resolved linear polarization data cubes of the N100 model are successfully retrieved with a high signal-to-noise ratio using the integral-based technique (IBT). The overall computation cost of a 3-D NLTE spectropolarimetry simulation using SEDONA-GesaRaT is only $\sim$3000 core-hours, while the previous codes could only finish 1-D NLTE simulation, or 3-D local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) simulation, with similar computation resources. The excellent computing efficiency allows SEDONA-GesaRaT for future large-scale simulations that systematically study the internal structures of supernovae.

 - **Abstract**
 KM3NeT has recently reported the detection of a very high-energy neutrino event, while IceCube has previously set upper limits on the differential neutrino flux above 100 PeV but has yet to observe a neutrino event with an energy comparable to that of the KM3NeT detection. To improve diffuse measurements above 10 PeV, we apply machine learning techniques to enhance atmospheric muon background rejection and directional reconstruction. We utilize a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to perform a classification task that distinguishes neutrinos from high-energy atmospheric muons. The method allows for the rejection of early hits from laterally spread, lower-energy muons in cosmic ray showers without relying on directional reconstruction as a prior. Additionally, a Transformer-based Neural Network is implemented for directional reconstruction. Unlike previous likelihood-based rapid reconstruction algorithms that assume a single muon track, this method makes no prior assumptions about event topology of the particle inside the detector. We demonstrate improved background rejection and reconstruction performance using machine learning techniques. Applications to the development of future Extremely High Energy (EHE) selections are also discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the discovery of two intersecting radio shells, likely radio relics, surrounding a compact galaxy group dominated by a massive elliptical galaxy. The shells present as partial, edge-brightened rings with diameters of about 240" (720 kpc) each and resemble a pair of odd radio circles. The central galaxy, WISEA J184105.19-654753.8, which shows signs of interactions, is radio bright, has a stellar mass of 3.1 x 10^11 Msun (for a redshift of zphot = 0.18) and is located in the intersect region. The double radio shell system, which we refer to as ORC J1841-6547 (also known as ORC 6), was detected in 944 MHz radio continuum images obtained with Phased Array Feeds on the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP). The more prominent, north-western shell may be associated with an X-ray detection, while the weaker, south-eastern shell has no counterpart at non-radio wavelength. We propose outwards moving shocks from galaxy mergers driving into the intragroup medium, re-energising relic radio lobes, as a possible formation scenario for the observed radio shells. We conclude that at least some ORCs are shock-energised relics in the outskirts of galaxy groups, which originate during the merger evolution of the brightest group galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 The discovery of $N_{\rm pp} = 40$ Jupiter-mass binary objects (JuMBOs) alongside $N_{\rm p} = 500$ free-floating Jupiter-mass objects (JMOs) in the Trapezium cluster's central portion raises questions about their origin \cite{2023arXiv231001231P}. \citet{2024NatAs...8..756W} argue that the rate at which two planets orbiting the same star are stripped by a close encounter can explain about half the observed JuMBOs in the Trapezium cluster. Although, their cross-section calculations agree with our own \citep{2024ScPA....3....1P}, one cannot extrapolate their results into clustered environments because it ignores the dissociation of JuMBOs due to subsequent encounters in the clustered environment. The inability of forming JuMBOs via the proposed scenario either calls for another formation mechanism, or the observed JuMBOs require thorough confirmation.

          The origin of the most recently ejected OB runaway star from the R136 cluster

 - **Abstract**
 The $\sim 60\,000$ solar-mass (\MSun) star-cluster R136 (NGC~2070) in the Tarantula Nebula in the Large Magellanic Cloud is the host of at least 55 massive stars ($M \apgt 10$\,\MSun) which move away from the cluster at projected velocities $\gteq 27.5$\,km/s \cite{2024Natur.634..809S}. The origin of the high velocities of such runaway stars have been debated since the 1960s, resulting either from dynamical ejections \citep{1961BAN....15..265B,1961BAN....15..291B} or from supernova explosions \citep{1983ApJ...267..322H}. Due to the Gaia satellite's outstanding precision, we can now retrace the most recently ejected binary star, Mel 34, back to the center of R136 and reconstruct the events that 52\,000 years ago let to its removal from R136, i.e., we establish its dynamical interaction and ejection history. We find that this ejection requires the participation of 5 stars in a strong interaction between a triple composed of the tight massive binary Mel~39 orbited by the star VFTS~590, and the binary star Mel~34. The participation of 5 stars is unexpected because runaway stars were not expected to result from triple interactions \cite{2011Sci...334.1380F}. The deterministic nature of the Newtonian dynamics in the scattering enables us to reconstruct the encounter that ejected Mel~34. We then predict that Mel~39 is a binary star with an 80\,\Msun\, companion star that orbits within $\sim 1^\circ$ in the same plane as Mel~34, and escapes the cluster with a velocity of $\sim 64$\,km/s. The five stars will undergo supernova explosions in the coming 5\,Myr at a distance of $\sim 180$\,pc to $\sim 332$\,pc from their birth location (R\,136). The resulting black hole binaries, however, are not expected to merge within a Hubble time.

          Can a multi-tracer approach improve the constraints on the turnover scale?

 - **Abstract**
 The turnover scale of the power spectrum is related to the size of the particle horizon at the matter-radiation equality, which can be used as a standard ruler to constrain cosmological parameters. In this work, we apply a model-independent method to mock datasets to forecast constraints on the turnover scale below a redshift of 0.5, investigating for the first time with a multi-tracer approach. We find that combining the galaxy density with peculiar velocity does not improve the turnover scale constraints for current or currently planned surveys because either the cosmological volume or the effective number density of peculiar velocities is too low. However, we demonstrate that when combining the galaxy power spectrum from 4HS with the HI power spectrum from SKA1-B2, the constraints on the turnover scale improve by $\sim30\%$ compared to using only a single tracer. We demonstrate for the first time that combining DESI, 4HS, and an SKA Phase 1 Band 2 survey could achieve a $\sim5\%$ level constraint on the turnover scale and a $\sim90\%$ probability of detecting the turnover below a redshift of 0.5. Lastly, we also demonstrate that combining the DESI BGS redshift sample with the LRG, ELG, and QSO samples could break the degeneracy between $r_H$ and $\Omega_m$ and improve their constraints by $\sim25\%$ and $\sim45\%$, respectively, compared to only using the high redshift samples. The constraints on the particle horizon at the matter-radiation equality $r_H$ and the matter density $\Omega_m$ could then further improve by $\sim20\%$ and $\sim30\%$, respectively, when combining the full set of DESI redshift tracers with 4HS and SKA1-B2.

 Generative machine learning models have been demonstrated to be able to learn low dimensional representations of data that preserve information required for downstream tasks. In this work, we demonstrate that flow matching based generative models can learn compact, semantically rich latent representations of field level cold dark matter (CDM) simulation data without supervision. Our model, CosmoFlow, learns representations 32x smaller than the raw field data, usable for field level reconstruction, synthetic data generation, and parameter inference. Our model also learns interpretable representations, in which different latent channels correspond to features at different cosmological scales.

 - **Abstract**
 Core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) may contribute a significant amount of dust in the early universe. Freshly formed coolant molecules (e.g., CO) and warm dust can be found in CCSNe as early as ~100 d after the explosion, allowing the study of their evolution with time series observations. In the Type II SN 2023ixf, we aim to investigate the temporal evolution of the temperature, velocity, and mass of CO and compare them with other CCSNe, exploring their implications for the dust formation in CCSNe. From observations of velocity profiles of lines of other species (e.g., H and He), we also aim to characterize and understand the interaction of the SN ejecta with pre-existing circumstellar material (CSM). We present a time series of 16 near-infrared spectra of SN 2023ixf from 9 to 307 d, taken with multiple instruments: Gemini/GNIRS, Keck/NIRES, IRTF/SpeX, and MMT/MMIRS. The early (t<70 d) spectra indicate interaction between the expanding ejecta and nearby CSM. At t<20 d, intermediate-width line profiles corresponding to the ejecta-wind interaction are superposed on evolving broad P Cygni profiles. We find intermediate-width and narrow lines in the spectra until t<70 d, which suggest continued CSM interaction. We also observe and discuss high-velocity absorption features in H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ line profiles formed by CSM interaction. The spectra contain CO first overtone emission between 199 and 307~d after the explosion. We model the CO emission and find the CO to have a higher velocity (3000-3500 km/s) than that in Type II-pec SN 1987A (1800 - 2000 km/s) during similar phases (t=199-307 d) and a comparable CO temperature to SN 1987A. A flattened continuum at wavelengths greater than 1.5 $\mu$m accompanies the CO emission, indicating the presence of warm dust forming in the ejecta. The warm dust masses are estimated to be in the range of 1.0-2.3$\times$10$^{-5} M_{\odot}$.

 - **Abstract**
 The dense material in a compact star from a supernova remnant is beyond terrestrial experimentation, so phenomenological modeling is used to match astrophysical observations. This is crucial due to the complex sensitivity of compact star features to dense matter properties. Despite modeling flexibility, certain universal relationships among compact star features hold true, regardless of the matter model. Our study examines these universal relationships, focusing on the moment of inertia, tidal Love number, and quadrupole moment, as well as correlations between non-radial oscillation frequencies and star compactness. We consider baryonic stars with cores of heavier baryons. Our findings show that baryonic stars with cores of heavier baryons follow the universal relations, and the f-mode oscillation frequency's universality relative to tidal deformability is notable, with an error margin under 1$\%$.

 - **Abstract**
 The recent detection of the neutrino event KM3-230213A ($\sim$~220 PeV) by the KM3NeT/ARCA telescope, the most energetic ever observed, could represent the long-awaited evidence for a cosmogenic origin, arising from the interaction of an ultra-high-energy cosmic ray with background photons. Its secure confirmation would mark a major advance in high-energy astrophysics. We perform a self-consistent multimessenger transport calculation of protons and their secondary $\gamma$-rays and neutrinos from cosmologically evolving sources, confronting predictions with data from the Pierre Auger Observatory, IceCube, KM3NeT, and the Fermi-LAT isotropic $\gamma$-ray background. A steep sub-ankle proton component saturates the diffuse $\gamma$-ray background and is disfavoured, whereas a hard proton spectrum extending beyond $10^{20}$~eV with evolution $\propto (1+z)^3$ reproduces KM3-230213A without violating any limits. This scenario requires a proton fraction $\lesssim 10$\% at $3\times 10^{19}$~eV and excludes faster-evolving sources. Joint UHE-neutrino and $\gamma$-ray observations thus sharpen constraints on extragalactic cosmic-ray sources and set targets for AugerPrime and next-generation neutrino telescopes.

          Quasi-Periodic Oscillations due to radiative feedback mechanism between the disc and corona

 - **Abstract**
 Compact object systems exhibit Quasi-Periodic Oscillations (QPOs) as revealed by peaked features in their power density spectra. It has been known that stochastic variations in the accretion disc will propagate to the corona after a time delay and that the hard X-rays from the corona impinge back on the disc, giving reflection spectral features. Here, we show that the combination of these two effects makes a simple radiative feedback system between the corona and the disc, which naturally produces the observed QPOs whose primary frequency corresponds to the inverse of the time delay. The analytical form of the expected power spectra can be statistically compared with the observed ones. Hence, for the first time, a physical model is used to describe and fit the AstroSat observed power spectra of the black hole systems MAXI J1535-571 and GRS 1915+105, including the QPO, its harmonics, as well as the broadband components.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a statistical analysis of the 175 SPARC galactic rotation curves to test the hypothesis of whether the Keplerian velocity tapering at large radii ($v(r)\propto 1/\sqrt{r}$) of the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) halo model agrees with observational data. The null hypothesis is Rubin's flat-rotation curve, $v(r)=\text{constant}$ -such as can be obtained from a spherical, isothermal-like density profile, or alternatively with a very prolate halo-. To decide whether we adopt the null (Rubin behaviour) or alternative (NFW behaviour) hypothesis, we evaluate the derivative in each galaxy of $v(r)$ with its last data points. We conclude that the data is presently compatible with the null hypothesis -no taper off, no decline of $v(r)$ is seen.

 At this early stage of its passage through our Solar System, 3I/ATLAS, the recently discovered interstellar interloper, has displayed various anomalous characteristics, determined from photometric and astrometric observations. As largely a pedagogical exercise, in this paper we present additional analysis into the astrodynamics of 3I/ATLAS, and hypothesize that this object could be technological, and possibly hostile as would be expected from the 'Dark Forest' resolution to the 'Fermi Paradox'. We show that 3I/ATLAS approaches surprisingly close to Venus, Mars and Jupiter, with a probability of $\lesssim 0.005$\%. Furthermore the low retrograde tilt of 3I/ATLAS's orbital plane to the ecliptic offers various benefits to an Extra-terrestrial Intelligence (ETI), since it allows the object access to our planet with relative impunity. The eclipse by the Sun from Earth of 3I/ATLAS at perihelion, would allow it to conduct a clandestine reverse Solar Oberth Manoeuvre, an optimal high-thrust strategy for interstellar spacecraft to brake and stay bound to the Sun. An optimal intercept of Earth would entail an arrival in late November/early December of 2025, and also, a non-gravitational acceleration of $\sim{5.9} \times 10^{-5}$ au day$^{-2}$, normalized at 1 au from the Sun, would indicate an intent to intercept the planet Jupiter, not far off its path, and a strategy to rendezvous with it after perihelion.

 - **Abstract**
 We present observations of the nearby extremely metal-poor galaxy I Zw 18 using the Keck Cosmic Web Imager (KCWI) and the JWST Mid-InfraRed Instrument (MIRI) Integral Field Spectrographs (IFS). From optical and mid-IR oxygen emission lines, we measured direct-method abundances for three ionic states of oxygen, including O$^{3+}$/H$^+$. In contrast to previous studies of I Zw 18, the high spatial resolution afforded by KCWI and MIRI/MRS revealed chemical inhomogeneities on 60 pc scales in the form of metal-poor pockets and metal-enriched gas. These are located outside I Zw 18's star-forming complexes having possibly been dispersed beyond these regions via stellar feedback effects. We found that metallicities derived using a single low-ionization density tracer, and T$_{\rm e}$([O II]) derived from a temperature relationship commonly used in high-$z$ galaxy studies, exhibited the largest scatter and underestimated the metallicity compared to those derived using multi-ion densities and estimated T$_{\rm e}$([N II]). Finally, we compared O$^{3+}$/H$^+$ abundances from a theoretical ionization correction factor (ICF) against observed values and found that the oxygen ICF underestimates the O$^{3+}$/H$^+$ abundance by a factor of 2, indicating that either additional ionizing sources are needed or standard stellar population models are unable to produce the requisite ionizing flux.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding how well future cosmological experiments can reconstruct the mechanism that generated primordial inhomogeneities is key to assessing the extent to which cosmology can inform fundamental physics. In this work, we apply a quantum metrology tool - the quantum Fisher information - to the squeezed quantum state describing cosmological perturbations at the end of inflation. This quantifies the ultimate precision achievable in parameter estimation, assuming ideal access to early-universe information. By comparing the quantum Fisher information to its classical counterpart - derived from measurements of the curvature perturbation power spectrum alone (homodyne measurement) - we evaluate how close current observations come to this quantum limit. Focusing on the tensor-to-scalar ratio as a case study, we find that the gap between classical and quantum Fisher information grows exponentially with the number of e-folds a mode spends outside the horizon. This suggests the existence of a highly efficient (but presently inaccessible) optimal measurement. Conversely, we show that accessing the decaying mode of inflationary perturbations is a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for exponentially improving the inference of the tensor-to-scalar ratio.

 Interstellar Objects are comets and asteroids that formed around other stars but were ejected before they could accrete into exoplanets. They therefore represent a rare opportunity to compare the building blocks of planets in the Solar System to those in other stellar systems. The third Interstellar Object, 3I/ATLAS, is the newest, brightest, potentially largest, and fastest member of this population. We report observations of 3I/ATLAS taken on 2025 July 3 and 4 with the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility just days after its discovery. In r'-band imaging with 'Opihi, we see no obvious lightcurve variability and derive a g'-i' color of 1.06+/-0.11 which is consistent in spectral slope to recent work by D.Z. Seligman et al. (2025) and C. Opitom (2025). We obtained the first near-infrared (NIR) reflectance spectrum of 3I/ATLAS with SpeX. The visible color and NIR spectrum show a linear, red visible slope, a somewhat less red slope between 0.7 and 1.1 $\mu{m}$, and a neutral or slightly blue slope at longer wavelengths. Challenges in modeling the reflectivity of 3I may indicate that this comet has a complex grain size distribution, grain compositions unlike Solar system comets, or both. Like 2I/Borisov, there are no obvious signatures of water ice in the coma of 3I/ATLAS. Observations closer to perihelion will help elucidate whether 3I has less water than anticipated or whether the Interstellar Objects might retain and release their ices somewhat differently than Solar System comets do.

 - **Abstract**
 The elastic properties of the neutron star crust are thought to play a crucial role in various phenomena of neutron stars (glitches, oscillations, gravitational wave emission) and should be described quantitatively to model these phenomena. The fundamental problem of this description is associated with the polycrystalline nature of the crust: similar to terrestrial materials, the elastic moduli, strictly speaking, depend on the shape and orientation of crystallites, but for the crust, they are unknown. As a result, some assumptions are generally required to predict the elastic properties or constrain their possible range. In this paper, we follow the commonly believed assumption that the crust is (locally) isotropic, which allows us to describe elastic properties by two (effective) parameters: bulk and shear moduli. The bulk modulus is well determined by the Voigt-Reuss bounds, and we constrain the shear modulus by applying, for the first time in astrophysics of compact stars, the variational Hashin-Shtrikman approach, based on the additional assumption that there are no correlations in the orientation of crystallites. We analyse the Hashin-Shtrikman bounds for the one-component crust taking into account the electron screening and the motion of the nuclei, and for two-component static crystals. In particular, we demonstrate that within applied assumptions the effective shear modulus should be lower than the Voigt estimate, typically applied in the astrophysical literature.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first application of marked angular power spectra to weak lensing data, using maps from the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam Year 1 (HSC-Y1) survey. Marked convergence fields, constructed by weighting the convergence field with non-linear functions of its smoothed version, are designed to encode higher-order information while remaining computationally tractable. Using simulations tailored to the HSC-Y1 data, we test three mark functions that up- or down-weight different density environments. Our results show that combining multiple types of marked auto- and cross-spectra improves constraints on the clustering amplitude parameter $S_8\equiv\sigma_8\sqrt{\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3}$ by $\approx$43\% compared to standard two-point power spectra. When applied to the HSC-Y1 data, this translates into a constraint on $S_8 = 0.807\pm 0.024$. We assess the sensitivity of the marked power spectra to systematics, including baryonic effects, intrinsic alignment, photometric redshifts, and multiplicative shear bias. These results demonstrate the promise of marked statistics as a practical and powerful tool for extracting non-Gaussian information from weak lensing surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 In order to develop a consistent quantum theory of gravity, we must understand the nature of spacetime at the Planck scale. In particular if it exhibits quantum fluctuations, they may cause propagating particles to evolve in an apparently non-unitary manner. Neutrinos, which interact only via the weak force and gravity, maintain quantum coherence while propagating over large distances. Thus, neutrino oscillations serve as a precise interferometer to search for Planck-scale fluctuations of spacetime. The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is the world's largest neutrino telescope, located in the Antarctic icecap. We search the data on atmospheric neutrinos detected by IceCube in the energy range 0.5-100 TeV to test for neutrino decoherence. In this contribution, we present the sensitivity of the analysis, which shows significant improvement compared to previous IceCube results as a result of improved reconstruction and a larger sample of events.

          The impact of the transport of chemicals and electronic screening on helioseismic and neutrino observations in solar models

 - **Abstract**
 The transport of chemical elements in stellar interiors is one of the greatest sources of uncertainties of solar and stellar modelling. The Sun, with its exquisite spectroscopic, helioseismic and neutrino observations, offers a prime environment to test the prescriptions used for both microscopic and macroscopic transport processes. We study in detail the impact of various formalisms for atomic diffusion on helioseismic constraints in both CLES (Scuflaire et al., 2008a) and Cesam2k2 (Morel and Lebreton 2008; Marques et al. 2013; Deal et al. 2018) models and compare both codes in detail. Moreover, due to the inability of standard models using microscopic diffusion to reproduce light element depletion in the Sun (Li, Be), another efficient process must be included to reproduce these constraints (rotation-induced: Eggenberger et al. 2022, overshooting -- or penetrative convection -- below the convective envelope: Thévenin et al. 2017, or ad hoc turbulence: Lebreton and Maeder 1987; Richer, Michaud, and Turcotte 2000). However, introducing such an extra mixing leads to issues with the CNO neutrino fluxes (see Buldgen et al. 2023), which seem to be systematically lower than the Borexino observations (Appel et al., 2022. Another key aspect to consider when reconciling models with neutrino fluxes is the impact of electronic screening (Mussack and Däppen, 2011).

          Using deep learning to characterize single-exposure double-line spectroscopic binaries

 - **Abstract**
 Distinguishing the component spectra of double-line spectroscopic binaries (SB2s) and extracting their stellar parameters is a complex and computationally intensive task that usually requires observations spanning several epochs that represent various orbital phases. This poses an especially significant challenge for large surveys such as Gaia or LAMOST, where the number of available spectra per target is often not enough for a proper spectral disentangling. We present a new approach for characterizing SB2 components from single-exposure spectroscopic observations. The proposed tool uses deep neural networks to extract the stellar parameters of the individual component spectra that comprise the single exposure, without explicitly disentangling them or extracting their radial velocities. The neural networks were trained, tested, and validated using simulated data resembling Gaia RVS spectra, which will be made available to the community in the coming Gaia data releases. We expect our tool to be useful in their analysis.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a search for short-duration gravitational-wave transients in data from the first eight months of Advanced LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA's fourth observing run, denoted O4a. We use four analyses which are sensitive to a wide range of potential signals lasting up to a few seconds in the 16-4096 Hz band. Excluding binary black hole merger candidates that were already identified by low-latency analyses, we find no statistically significant evidence for other gravitational-wave transients. We measure the sensitivity of the search for representative signals, including sine-Gaussians, Gaussian pulses, and white-noise bursts with different frequencies and durations, adopting a false alarm rate of 1 per 100 years as detection threshold. Depending on signal type, we find improvements over previous searches by factors of 2 to 10 in terms of sensitivity to strain amplitude and of 90% confidence upper limit on the rate density of sources. We also evaluate a variety of core-collapse supernova models and find that, for some models, the search could have detected gravitational waves from stellar core-collapse throughout the Milky Way. Finally, we consider neutron star f-modes associated with pulsar glitches and find that, assuming a source similar to the Vela Pulsar, the search could have detected a gravitational-wave signal from a glitch with fractional frequency change as small as $\sim 2$ to $6 \times 10^{-5}$ depending on the neutron star mass.

 - **Abstract**
 We derive constraints on the neutrino mass using a variety of recent cosmological datasets, including DESI BAO, the full-shape analysis of the DESI matter power spectrum and the one-dimensional power spectrum of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest (P1D) from eBOSS quasars as well as the cosmic microwave background (CMB). The constraints are obtained in the frequentist formalism by constructing profile likelihoods and applying the Feldman-Cousins prescription to compute confidence intervals. This method avoids potential prior and volume effects that may arise in a comparable Bayesian analysis. Parabolic fits to the profiles allow one to distinguish changes in the upper limits from variations in the constraining power $\sigma$ of the different data combinations. We find that all profiles in the $\Lambda$CDM model are cut off by the $\sum m_\nu \geq 0$ bound, meaning that the corresponding parabolas reach their minimum in the unphysical sector. The most stringent 95% C.L. upper limit is obtained by the combination of DESI DR2 BAO, Planck PR4 and CMB lensing at 53 meV, below the minimum of 59 meV set by the normal ordering. Extending $\Lambda$CDM to non-zero curvature and $w_0w_\mathrm{a}$CDM relaxes the constraints past 59 meV again, but only $w_0w_\mathrm{a}$CDM exhibits profiles with a minimum at a positive value. Using a combination of DESI DR1 full-shape, BBN and eBOSS Lyman-$\alpha$ P1D, we successfully constrain the neutrino mass independently of the CMB. This combination yields $\sum m_\nu \leq 285$ meV (95% C.L.). The addition of DESI full-shape or Lyman-$\alpha$ P1D to CMB and DESI BAO results in small but noticeable improvement of the constraining power of the data. Lyman-$\alpha$ free-streaming measurements especially improve the constraint. Since they are based on eBOSS data, this sets a promising precedent for upcoming DESI data.

 - **Abstract**
 The scalar spectral index $n_s$ is a powerful test of inflationary models. The tightest constraint on $n_s$ to date derives from the combination of cosmic microwave background (CMB) data with baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data. The resulting $n_s$ constraint is shifted significantly upward relative to the constraint from CMB alone, with the consequence that previously preferred inflationary models are seemingly disfavored by $\gtrsim 2 \sigma$. Here we show that this shift in $n_s$ is the combined effect of a degeneracy between $n_s$ and BAO parameters exhibited by CMB data and the tension between CMB datasets and DESI BAO data under the assumption of the standard cosmological model. Given the crucial role of $n_s$ in discriminating between inflationary models, we urge caution in interpreting CMB+BAO constraints on $n_s$ until the BAO-CMB tension is resolved.

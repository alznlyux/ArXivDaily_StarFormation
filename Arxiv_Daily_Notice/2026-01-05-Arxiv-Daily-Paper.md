#### Title:
          Detailed Investigation of a W UMa Contact Binary with an Ultralow Mass Ratio and a Third-Body as a Potential Merger Candidate

- **Abstract**
 The lower limit of the mass ratio in contact binaries remains uncertain, with observations suggesting systems exist below theoretical predictions. The stability of such very low mass ratio systems is still debated. Based on our review of systems within the mass ratio cutoff range, we reanalyzed TYC 3801-1529-1 and found it to have the lowest known mass ratio, q=0.024_{-(1)}^{+(2)}, among analyzed contact binaries. The reanalysis of this target was carried out using the BSN application and the MCMC method. We then compared our light curve solution obtained from TESS observations with the results of a previous study. We studied the period variations of this system and identified a cyclic trend over the past six years. After the third-body contribution has been removed, the system's period variations can be described either by a linear trend with a negative slope or by a quadratic trend with a downward curvature. These results indicate that it is still not possible to definitively determine whether the orbital period is increasing or decreasing, underscoring the importance of future observations. By considering the challenges of detecting the faint secondary in extremely low mass ratio systems, we estimated the absolute parameters of the target. Based on our analysis, the secondary component of the binary is likely a brown dwarf, while the third body appears to be a low-mass M-type dwarf. According to our analysis, TYC 3801-1529-1 is dynamically unstable and thus represents a remarkable candidate for a binary merger.
#### Title:
          Comparison of Static and Evolving Potentials in the Orbital Dynamics of Globular Clusters in the Central Region of the Galaxy

- **Abstract**
 A comparative analysis of the dynamics of the orbital motion (regular or chaotic) of 45 globular clusters in the central region of the Galaxy with a radius of 3.5 kpc is carried out. The static and evolving (based on the semi-analytical cosmological model of Gomez et al. (2010) and Hagi et al. (2015)) potentials of the Galaxy are considered both in the form of an axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric potential of the Galaxy with a rotating elongated bar with the following parameters at the present time: mass $10^{10} M_\odot$, length of the major semi-axis 5 kpc, rotation angle of the bar axis 25$^o$, angular velocity of rotation 40 km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$ . To form the 6D-phase space required for integrating the orbits, the most accurate astrometric data to date from the Gaia satellite (Vasiliev \& Baumgardt, 2021), as well as new refined average distances (Baumgardt \& Vasiliev, 2021) were used. We used a frequency method for analysis of the chaotic/regular orbital motion of all 45 GCs. The results are summarized in the table, which provides an overview of each GC in our sample, the degree of chaotization in both the static and evolving potentials, and the influence of the central rotating bar on the degree of orbital chaotization in both cases. It is shown that the orbital dynamics have undergone minor changes during the transition from the static to the evolving potential. This confirms our previously obtained result that changes in the masses and sizes of the gravitational potential components act on orbital parameters in opposite ways, and at small galactocentric distances this influence is maximally compensated, while the orbits of distant objects and objects with large apocentric distances experience the greatest influence.

          Measurement of the extragalactic background light at 8600Å using dark cloud shadow and the CaII-triplet lines

- **Abstract**
 We present results of a measurement of the near infrared Extragalactic Background Light using the dark-cloud method. Long-slit spectra covering the opaque core of the intermediate--latitude globule DC303.8-14.2 and the almost unobscured off area were measured using nodding-along-the-slit measuring technique providing a differential spectrum free of most of the foreground components. A template for the only remaining major foreground component, the scattered integrated starlight dominated by the strong Ca II triplet lines at 8498, 8542, 8664$Å$, from the dark core itself was constructed using the GAIA RVS spectral database. The derived EBL intensity is $1.62\pm 0.76(\sigma_{stat})\, 10^{-9} erg\, cm^{-2} s^{-1}Å^{-1} sr^{-1}$ or $13.8\pm6.5(\sigma_{stat})$nW m$^{-2}$sr$^{-1}$; this represents a tentative detection at $2.1\sigma$, level.

- **Abstract**
 Recent analyses conclude that Betelgeuse, a red supergiant star (HD 39801), likely has a companion object with a period of about 2000 days orbiting at only 2.3 stellar radii, deep in the chromosphere of the supergiant. A probable detection of such a companion, named Siwarha, has just occurred from speckle imaging. This study finds that Betelgeuse spectra in the optical region and ultraviolet exhibit signatures of variable circumstellar absorption and chromospheric outflows. These variations are consistent with the ~ 2000-day period of the companion object. Circumstellar absorption evident in optical Mn I lines, and mass outflow marked by ultraviolet Fe II, Si I, and Mg I lines increase after the transit of the companion across the disk of Betelgeuse. Following the eclipse of the companion, the absorption and outflow slowly decrease in advance of the next transit. The occurrence and variation of this plasma appear consistent with the presence of a trailing and expanding wake caused by a companion star orbiting within the atmosphere of Betelgeuse.

          Near-Contact Binaries on the Path to Contact Binaries

- **Abstract**
 A comprehensive evolution study was conducted on a carefully selected sample of near-contact binaries (NCBs) with more massive components filling the Roche lobes, utilizing the best-known basic parameters and indications of ongoing mass transfer. The results and discussion highlight that several NCBs with total masses exceeding 2 solar masses survive only a short time after mass exchange as contact binaries (CBs), with both components eventually merging to form a rapidly rotating giant, akin to FK~Com. Less massive NCBs transition into typical CBs and remain in this phase for up to 2 Gyr before ending their binary evolution as systems with extremely low mass ratios, susceptible to Darwin instability. However, this does not fully explain the existence of low-mass CBs with masses in the range of 1-1.5 solar masses. It is noted that there exists a population of low-mass binaries, nearly filling their Roche lobes. Their overall properties suggest that they could be progenitors of low-mass CBs.

- **Abstract**
 Complex organic molecules (COMs), the building blocks of life, have been extensively detected under various physical conditions, from quiescent clouds to star-forming regions. They therefore serve as excellent tracers for the local physical and chemical properties of these environments. Proper models that are capable of grasping the formation and destruction of COMs are crucial to understanding observations. However, given that distinct COMs may be detected from different locations and at varying times, we improve UCLCHEM - a gas-grain chemical code - to a one-dimensional, time-dependent model, tailored to protostars. In this update, we examine two stages of a protostar: the prestellar and heating stages, incorporating a simple radiative mechanism for both the internal and external radiation fields of the cloud. This approach relies on the key assumption that the dust and gas temperatures are completely coupled. Ultimately, we implement an updated version of our model to interpret observations obtained through both single-dish and interferometry under varying conditions, including a SgrB2(N1) hot core, massive Galactic clumps and a hot core in Orion. We show that our model could reproduce these observations well, highlighting that some COMs are positioned at a higher temperature in the envelope, whereas others are from the lower temperature, potentially leading to misinterpretation when using a single-point model. In a particular case of SgrB2(N1), the best model indicates that the cosmic-ray ionisation rate significantly exceeds the value typically used for the standard interstellar medium. Our model shows as an efficient computational tool particularly useful for better insights into observations of COMs.

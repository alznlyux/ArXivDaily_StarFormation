          Placing the Solar System in its Astrophysical Context

 - **Abstract**
 We examine recent astronomical data to assess whether the sun and Solar System possess anomalous properties compared to other stars and exoplanetary systems, providing context for astrobiology research. Utilising data primarily from large surveys like {\it Gaia}, {\it Kepler}, {\it TESS}, and ground-based spectroscopy (e.g., GALAH, LAMOST, HARPS), we construct comparison samples (e.g., nearby stars, solar analogues and twins within 20-200 pc) and employ statistical methods, including regression analysis, to account for parameter dependencies. We find that the sun is modestly metal-rich compared to nearby solar-age stars. More anomalous solar properties include its mass (top $\sim$8 percent locally), low photometric variability on short timescales ($\sim$0.2 percent), specific light and heavy element abundance patterns (high beryllium, low lithium, low carbon/oxygen and nitrogen/oxygen ratios, and low heavy neutron capture and refractory elements), slow rotation, and low superflare rate. The sun has average $\alpha$/iron, phosphorus/iron, and Ytterbium/iron abundance ratios. It also has average chromospheric activity as measured by R$^{\rm '}_{\rm HK}$(T$_{\rm eff}$), R$^{\rm +}_{\rm HK}$, and H$\alpha$ indices. The Solar System is unusual in its lack of super-Earths despite hosting a cold Jupiter ($\sim$3 percent), the low eccentricities of its planets (especially considering detectability, $<2$ percent), its large size scale for a multi-planet system ($\sim$6 percent), and potentially the sun's obliquity. The sun's galactic orbit is less eccentric and has lower vertical excursions than $\sim$95 percent of nearby solar analogues. Its current position is near perigalacticon and minimum distance from the Galactic plane, resulting in a higher local star density than 98.8 percent of randomly chosen times from $-0.5$ to $+0.5$ Gyrs.

 - **Abstract**
 As cosmological simulations and their associated software become increasingly complex, physicists face the challenge of searching through vast amounts of literature and user manuals to extract simulation parameters from dense academic papers, each using different models and formats. Translating these parameters into executable scripts remains a time-consuming and error-prone process. To improve efficiency in physics research and accelerate the cosmological simulation process, we introduce SimAgents, a multi-agent system designed to automate both parameter configuration from the literature and preliminary analysis for cosmology research. SimAgents is powered by specialized LLM agents capable of physics reasoning, simulation software validation, and tool execution. These agents collaborate through structured communication, ensuring that extracted parameters are physically meaningful, internally consistent, and software-compliant. We also construct a cosmological parameter extraction evaluation dataset by collecting over 40 simulations in published papers from Arxiv and leading journals that cover diverse simulation types. Experiments on the dataset demonstrate a strong performance of SimAgents, highlighting its effectiveness and potential to accelerate scientific research for physicists. Our demonstration video is available at: this https URL. The complete system and dataset are publicly available at this https URL.

 - **Abstract**
 The Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) enables the characterisation of young self-luminous gas giants at previously inaccessible wavelengths, revealing physical processes in gas, dust, and clouds. We characterise the young planetary system TWA 27 (2M1207) in the mid-infrared (MIR), studying the atmosphere and disk spectra of the M9 brown dwarf TWA 27A and its L6 planetary-mass companion TWA 27b. We obtained data with the MIRI Medium Resolution Spectrometer (MRS) from 4.9 to 20 um, and MIRI Imaging in the F1000W and F1500W filters. We applied high-contrast imaging methods to extract the companion's spectral energy distribution up to 15 um at 0.78 arcsec separation and a contrast of 60. Combining these with published JWST/NIRSpec spectra, we analysed the 1-20 um range using self-consistent atmospheric grids and 0D slab models for molecular disk emission. The atmosphere of TWA 27A is well fitted by a BT-SETTL model with Teff 2780 K, log g 4.3, plus a 740 K blackbody for the inner disk rim. The disk shows at least 11 organic molecules, with no water or silicate dust emission detected. The atmosphere of TWA 27b is matched by a Teff 1400 K low-gravity model with extinction, best fit by the ExoREM grid. MIRI spectra and photometry for TWA 27b reveal a silicate cloud absorption feature between 8-10 um and significant (>5 sigma) infrared excess at 15 um consistent with circumplanetary disk emission. These MIRI observations provide new insights into TWA 27, revealing diverse features to study the formation and evolution of circumplanetary disks and young dusty atmospheres.

          Free Floating or Merely Detached?

 - **Abstract**
 Microlensing surveys suggest the presence of a surprisingly large population of free-floating planets, with a rate of about two Neptunes per star. The origin of such objects is not known, neither do we know if they are truly unbound or are merely orbiting at large separations from their host stars. Here, we investigate planet-planet scattering as a possible origin through numerical simulations of unstable multi-planet systems. We find that planet ejection by scattering can be slow, often taking more than billions of years for Neptune-mass scatterers orbiting at a few AU and beyond. Moreover, this process invariably delivers planets to orbits of hundreds of AU that are protected from further scattering. We call these ``detached" planets. Under the scattering hypothesis, we estimate that about half of the reported ``free-floating" Neptunes are not free but merely ``detached".

          Constraints on Bose-Einstein condensate stars as neutron stars models from new observational data

 - **Abstract**
 We evaluate the feasibility of Bose-Einstein condensate stars (BECS) as models for the interior of neutron stars. BECS are compact objects composed of bosons, formed through the spin-parallel pairing of neutrons. Here, we utilize the astronomical data from GW170817, XMMU J173203.3-344518 (the lightest neutron star known), and a novel lower limit on neutron star core heat capacity to scrutinize the compatibility of BECS with these recent observations of neutron stars. Our specific focus is to constrain the values of the scattering length $a$, a parameter determining the strength of particle interactions in the model. Our analysis suggests that if the stars involved in GW170817 were BECSs, the scattering length of their constituent bosons should fall within the $4$ to $10$ fm range. Additionally, at a scattering length of $a\sim 3.1-4$ fm, stars with mass and radius characteristics akin to XMMU J173203.3-344518 are identified. Moreover, we find that the heat capacity depends of the mass and temperature of BECS, and surpasses the established lower bound for neutron star cores when $a>2-5$ fm. In summary, our results endorse BECS models with $a\sim 4$ fm, providing neutron star observables in robust agreement with diverse observations and contributing to the ongoing understanding of neutron star interiors.

 - **Abstract**
 The detection of extensive air showers using radio antennas has evolved into a mature technique, complementing particle detector arrays by providing sensitivity to the longitudinal development of the showers and enabling an independent determination of the cosmic-ray energy. Both the Pierre Auger Observatory in Argentina and the IceCube Neutrino Observatory at the South Pole have been undergoing upgrades, including the integration of radio antennas. The next-generation neutrino detector IceCube-Gen2 will also feature a surface array for PeV-EeV cosmic-ray detection, consisting of scintillation detectors and radio antennas. Prototype stations for this upgrade have been in operation for several years at both, the South Pole and the Auger Observatory, enabling cross-checks and potentially a cross-calibration of the energy scales between the two experiments. In this contribution, we present an analysis of air showers observed with the radio antennas of the IceCube-Gen2 prototype station, coinciding with detections by the water-Cherenkov detectors of the densest part of the Pierre Auger Observatory's surface array, featuring a 433 m spacing.

          Constraints on the spread of nuclear masses in ultra-high-energy cosmic rays based on the Phase I hybrid data from the Pierre Auger Observatory

 - **Abstract**
 We present an analysis of the correlation between the depth of the maximum of air-shower profiles and the signal in water-Cherenkov stations in events registered simultaneously by the fluorescence and surface detectors of the Pierre Auger Observatory. The analysis enables us to place constraints on the spread of nuclear masses in ultra-high-energy cosmic rays with a minor impact from the experimental systematic uncertainties and uncertainties in air-shower simulations. Due to this unique feature, the correlation analysis has previously allowed us to exclude all pure and proton-helium compositions near the ankle in the cosmic-ray energy spectrum at 5$\sigma$ confidence level. The same property makes the correlation analysis an effective tool for testing the consistency of predictions of the post-LHC hadronic interaction models, including their latest versions such as EPOS LHC-R, QGSJet-III-01, Sibyll${}^\bigstar$ and Sibyll 2.3e. In this work, the correlation analysis using the Phase I hybrid data from the Pierre Auger Observatory is presented. The analysis uses the newest generation of hadronic interaction models and covers an extended energy range around the ankle in the cosmic-ray spectrum.

 - **Abstract**
 Neutron-rich outflows in neutron-star mergers (NSMs) or other explosive events can be subject to substantial heating through the release of rest-mass energy in the course of the rapid neutron-capture (r-) process. This r-process heating can potentially have a significant impact on the dynamics determining the velocity distribution of the ejecta, but due to the complexity of detailed nuclear networks required to describe the r-process self-consistently, hydrodynamic models of NSMs often neglect r-process heating or include it using crude parametrizations. In this work, we present a conceptually new method, RHINE, for emulating the r-process and concomitant energy release in hydrodynamic simulations via machine-learning algorithms. The method requires the evolution of only a few additional quantities characterizing the composition, of which the nuclear rates of change are obtained at each location and time step from neural networks trained by a large set of trajectories from full nuclear-network calculations. The scheme is tested by comparing spherically symmetric wind simulations and long-term simulations of NSMs using RHINE with post-processing results from nucleosynthesis calculations, where we find very good agreement. In our NSM models on average about 2.3MeV, 0.7MeV, and 2.1MeV are released per baryon in dynamical ejecta, NS-torus ejecta, and black-hole (BH) torus ejecta, respectively. The strongest velocity boost is observed for BH-torus ejecta, which also become 40% more massive with r-process heating. The nucleosynthesis yields are only mildly affected by r-process heating, but the kilonova gets significantly brighter once the BH-torus ejecta become visible. RHINE can be readily implemented in existing hydrodynamics codes using pre-trained machine-learning data and routines for source-term prediction that we provide online.

 - **Abstract**
 The filamentary dark cloud complex in Norma reveals signs of active low-mass star formation including protostars, H-alpha emission line stars, Herbig Haro objects, and the eruptive FU Orionis-like star V346 Nor. We present results of the first pointed X-ray observations of the Norma dark cloud, focusing on the westernmost Sandqvist 187 region. Chandra detected 75 X-ray sources and a complementary XMM-Newton observation detected 92 sources within the Chandra field-of-view, of which 46 are cross-matched to Chandra, yielding 121 unique X-ray sources. We present a catalog of X-ray sources along with basic X-ray properties and candidate IR and optical counterparts. Existing near-IR photometry reveals several X-ray sources with color excesses as typical of young stars with disks. Gaia parallaxes single out foreground stars and X-ray sources with distances of 500 - 1000 pc that are probable cloud members. The known emission line stars Sz 136 and Sz 137 were detected but V346 Nor was not. Interestingly, the optical and IR counterparts of the brightest Chandra source are not known with certainty but the prime suspects are very faint. Thus, the nature of the object responsible for the bright X-ray emission remains speculative. The X-ray observations presented here will serve as a pathfinder for identifying and characterizing the young stellar population in the Norma dark cloud.

 - **Abstract**
 In the quest to understand the climates and atmospheres of exoplanets, 3D global climate models (GCMs) have become indispensable. The ability of GCMs to predict atmospheric conditions complements exoplanet observations, creating a feedback loop that enhances our understanding of exoplanetary atmospheres and their environments. This paper discusses the capabilities of the Global Exoplanet Spectra (GlobES) module of the Planetary Spectrum Generator (PSG), which incorporates 3D atmospheric and surface information into spectral simulations, offering a free, accessible tool for the scientific community to study realistic planetary atmospheres. Through detailed case studies, including simulations of TRAPPIST1 b, TRAPPIST-1 e, and Earth around Sun, this paper demonstrates the use of GlobES and its effectiveness in simulating transit, emission and reflected spectra, thus supporting the ongoing development and refinement of observational strategies using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and future mission concept studies (e.g., Habitable Worlds Observatory [HWO]) in exoplanet research.

 - **Abstract**
 NASA's Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope is a flagship astrophysics mission planned for launch no later than May 2027. The Coronagraph Instrument (CGI) aboard Roman will demonstrate the technology for direct imaging and spectroscopy of exoplanets around nearby stars and starlight suppression that surpass previous space-based and ground-based coronagraphs. This is accomplished using active wavefront control in space with deformable mirrors. CGI requires a star acquisition system capable of acquiring reference and target stars to achieve this goal. This paper describes two CGI star acquisition system methods: EXCAM and Raster Scan. Furthermore, it will detail the results of the CGI thermal vacuum (TVAC) tests conducted to evaluate system-level star acquisition and verify its performance requirements.

          Mars Clocks and other novel analog clocks, using Earth Standard Seconds

 - **Abstract**
 We present analog clocks fitted to the Mars solar day. These clocks use the standard Earth-based second of the International System of Units (SI) as their operational unit of time, unlike current practice for Mars timekeeping. We discuss the importance of preserving the SI second. On this basis, we identify the two analog clocks most suitable for public use by a future Mars population. These are a 20-hour clock with a hand motion similar to that of the standard Earth clock, and a 24-hour clock with a novel "Martian" hand motion which strikes the hour when all 3 hands converge onto that hour mark on the dial. Both clocks have Earth-day equivalents to assist learning. We also present a 24-hour "SpaceClock", similar to the Martian clock but with no favored reference plane, hence equally readable from any viewing orientation.

          Little Red Dots As Late-stage Quasi-stars
 - **Authors:** Mitchell C. Begelman, Jason Dexter

Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/
 - **Abstract**
 We argue that the "Little Red Dots" (LRDs) discovered with the James Webb Space Telescope are quasi-stars in their late stages of evolution. Quasi-stars are hypothetical objects predicted to form following the core collapse of supermassive stars, and consist of black holes accreting from massive envelopes at a super-Eddington rate. We show that models of late-stage quasi-stars, with black hole masses exceeding $\sim 10\%$ of the total, predict thermal and radiative properties that are insensitive to both black hole and envelope mass, and spectrally resemble LRDs. Specifically, we show that they are likely to exhibit reddish colors, a strong Balmer break, and possess conditions favorable to the production of Balmer lines that are broadened by electron scattering. Their huge electron column densities suppress any X-rays. Late-stage quasi-stars, with black hole masses $\gtrsim 10^6 M_\odot$, should dominate the overall quasi-star population. Their short predicted lifetimes (tens of Myr), coupled with the high observed comoving density of LRDs, suggest that most or all supermassive black holes go through a quasi-star/LRD phase during their formation and growth.

          Probing periodic trends in the TESS light curves of the seventeen known Double White Dwarf systems

 - **Abstract**
 There is a relatively large population of known double white dwarfs (DWDs) that were mostly discovered through spectroscopic observations and by measuring their radial velocity variations. Photometric observations from these systems give us additional information about their faint components by manifesting eclipsing or lensing signals or periodic trends such as ellipsoidal variations or Doppler boosting. To find these signals and trends we probe the public photometric data collected by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) telescope from 17 known DWD systems. We use the Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) technique to de-noise their light curves. For DWD systems J1717$+$6757, J1557$+$2823, LP400$-$22, J1449$+$1717, J2132$+$0754, and J2151$+$1614 we find regular and periodic trends in their TESS light curves. The periodic trend in light curve J1449$+$1717 is caused by the blending effect due to a variable and bright star close to it which are unresolvable in the TESS observations. The discovered periodic trend for J1717$+$6757 was recovered by the TESS data. The periodic trends in light curves of J1557$+$2823 and J2151$+$1614 have the False Alarm Probability (FAP) values $\simeq 14.8,~36.5\%$. So their detected trends are likely noises with non-orbital origins. Periods of trends in light curves of LP400$-$22 and J2132$+$0754 are the same as and half of orbital periods, respectively. We evaluate possible ranges for Doppler boosting and ellipsoidal variations's amplitudes for these targets. This study highlights the importance of TESS data for identifying periodic trends such as ellipsoidal or intrinsic variations rather than short eclipsing/lensing signals in DWD light curves specially bright targets with ignorable blending.

          Alleviating the Hubble tension with Torsion Condensation (TorC)

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/
 - **Abstract**
 Constraints on the cosmological parameters of Torsion Condensation (TorC) are investigated using Planck 2018 Cosmic Microwave Background data. TorC is a case of Poincaré gauge theory -- a formulation of gravity motivated by the gauge field theories underlying fundamental forces in the standard model of particle physics. Unlike general relativity, TorC incorporates intrinsic torsion degrees of freedom while maintaining second-order field equations. At specific parameter values, it reduces to the $\Lambda$CDM model, providing a natural extension to standard cosmology. The base model of TorC introduces two parameters beyond those in $\Lambda$CDM: the initial value of the torsion scalar field and its time derivative -- one can absorb the latter by allowing the dark energy density to float. To constrain these parameters, `PolyChord` nested sampling algorithm is employed, interfaced via `Cobaya` with a modified version of `CAMB`. Our results indicate that TorC allows for a larger inferred Hubble constant, offering a potential resolution to the Hubble tension. Tension analysis using the $R$-statistic shows that TorC alleviates the statistical tension between the Planck 2018 and SH0Es 2020 datasets, though this improvement is not sufficient to decisively favour TorC over $\Lambda$CDM in a Bayesian model comparison. This study highlights TorC as a compelling theory of gravity, demonstrating its potential to address cosmological tensions and motivating further investigations of extended theories of gravity within a cosmological context. As current and upcoming surveys -- including Euclid, Roman Space Telescope, Vera C. Rubin Observatory, LISA, and Simons Observatory -- deliver data on gravity across all scales, they will offer critical tests of gravity models like TorC, making the present a pivotal moment for exploring extended theories of gravity.

 - **Abstract**
 The L 98-59 system, identified by TESS in 2019, features three transiting exoplanets in compact orbits of 2.253, 3.691, and 7.451 days around an M3V star, with an outer 12.83-day non-transiting planet confirmed in 2021 using ESPRESSO. The planets exhibit a diverse range of sizes (0.8-1.6 R$_{\oplus}$), masses (0.5-3 M$_{\oplus}$), and likely compositions (Earth-like to possibly water-rich), prompting atmospheric characterization studies with HST and JWST. Here, we analyze 16 new TESS sectors and improve radial velocity (RV) precision of archival ESPRESSO and HARPS data using a line-by-line framework, enabling stellar activity detrending via a novel differential temperature indicator. We refine the radii of L 98-59 b, c, and d to 0.837 $\pm$ 0.019 R$_{\oplus}$, 1.329 $\pm$ 0.029 R$_{\oplus}$, 1.627 $\pm$ 0.041 R$_{\oplus}$, respectively. Combining RVs with transit timing variations (TTV) of L 98-59 c and d from TESS and JWST provides unprecedented constraints on the masses and eccentricities of the planets. We report updated masses of 0.46 $\pm$ 0.11 M$_{\oplus}$ for b, 2.00 $\pm$ 0.13 M$_{\oplus}$ for c, and 1.64 $\pm$ 0.07 M$_{\oplus}$ for d, and a minimum mass of 2.82 $\pm$ 0.19 M$_{\oplus}$ for e. We additionally confirm L 98-59\,f, a non-transiting super-Earth with a minimal mass of 2.80 $\pm$ 0.30 M$_{\oplus}$ on a 23.06-day orbit inside the Habitable Zone. The TTVs of L 98-59 c and d (<3 min, $P_{\rm TTV} = 396$ days) constrain the eccentricities of all planets to near-circular orbits ($e \lesssim 0.04$). An internal structure analysis of the transiting planets reveals increasing water-mass fractions ($f_{\rm H_{2}O}$) with orbital distance, reaching $f_{\rm H_{2}O} \approx 0.16$ for L 98-59\ d. We predict eccentricity-induced tidal heating in L 98-59 b with heat fluxes comparable to those of Io, potentially driving volcanic activity.

          Anisotropic Universes in Light of Observations

 - **Abstract**
 The cosmological principle is a cornerstone of the standard cosmological model. However, recent observations suggest potential deviations from this assumption, hinting at a small anisotropic expansion. Such an expansion can arise from sources that break rotational invariance. A minimal realization of this scenario is described by a Bianchi I geometry, where each spatial direction evolves at a different rate, and the degree of anisotropy is quantified by the shear parameter $\Sigma$. In this work, we constrain the present-day value of the shear, $\Sigma_0$, by confronting theoretical predictions with recent cosmological data. We implement various anisotropic models within the Boltzmann code \texttt{CLASS} and explore their parameter space using the sampler \texttt{MontePython}. Although our results show that $\Sigma_0$ is model-dependent, notably, in one specific scenario considering a homogeneous scalar field coupled to a 2-form field, $\Sigma_0 = 0$ is excluded at the $2\sigma$ confidence level, with mean value around $|\Sigma_0| \sim 10^{-4}$ while remaining consistent with observations. These findings challenge the conventional assumption that cosmic shear is negligible in the present universe. Moreover, the anisotropic expansion in this model is driven by a steep scalar field potential, a feature often found in supergravity-inspired scenarios. While anisotropic models offer interesting alternatives and could help explain some cosmological anomalies, they generally introduce additional parameters, making the standard $\Lambda$CDM model statistically favored in most cases. Still, they remain compatible with current observations and provide new perspectives on features not fully explained within the standard framework. These results highlight the importance of further exploring anisotropic cosmologies to better understand their implications.

          Unexplored Opportunities for Automatic Differentiation in Astrophysics

 - **Abstract**
 We present a systematic analysis of automatic differentiation (AD) applications in astrophysics, identifying domains where gradient-based optimization could provide significant computational advantages. Building on our previous work with GRAF (Gradient-based Radar Ambiguity Functions), which discovered optimal radar waveforms achieving 4x computational speedup by exploring the trade-off space between conflicting objectives, we extend this discovery-oriented approach to astrophysical parameter spaces. While AD has been successfully implemented in several areas including gravitational wave parameter estimation and exoplanet atmospheric retrieval, we identify nine astrophysical domains where, to our knowledge, gradient-based exploration methods remain unexplored despite favorable mathematical structure. These opportunities range from discovering novel solutions to the Einstein field equations in exotic spacetime configurations to systematically exploring parameter spaces in stellar astrophysics and planetary dynamics. We present the mathematical foundations for implementing AD in each domain and propose GRASP (Gradient-based Reconstruction of Astrophysical Systems & Phenomena), a unified framework for differentiable astrophysical computations that transforms traditional optimization problems into systematic exploration of solution spaces. To our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically delineate unexplored domains in astrophysics suitable for automatic differentiation and to provide a unified, mathematically grounded framework (GRASP) to guide their implementation.

 - **Abstract**
 We present new observations of the PDS 70 disc obtained with the Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) in Band 9 (671 GHz) at 0.242$^{\prime\prime}$ resolution, which provide valuable insights into the spatial distribution of sub-millimetre grains in the disc. The data reveal a ring-like morphology, with a radial peak located between those previously observed at infrared wavelengths and longer millimetre observations. Additionally, we detect a tentative outer shoulder in Band 9 that is not observed at longer wavelengths. These findings suggest that small grains ($\sim 100 \mu$m) traced by Band 9 may be escaping from the pressure bump both radially inwards and outwards, or may be tracing different disc layers than those probed at longer wavelengths. A multi-wavelength analysis of the disc at millimetre wavelengths and the best fit to the spectral energy distribution shows the presence of centimetre grains around the ring location, where the dust surface density also peaks, compatible with dust trap models. The grain size in the disc cavity is not well constrained but is consistent with grains as small as 10 $\mu$m, supporting the hypothesis that small dust grain filters through the cavity. We use dust evolution models to demonstrate that a turbulent viscosity of $\alpha \gtrsim 10^{-3}$ allows small grains to filter through the disc gap, while $\alpha \lesssim 5 \times 10^{-3}$ is required to retain large grains in the pressure bump. The Band 9 observations of PDS 70 validate theoretical models and confirm the presence of pebble flux through the disc gap.

 - **Abstract**
 The orbital eccentricities of brown dwarfs encode valuable information of their formation and evolution history, providing insights into whether they resemble giant planets or stellar binaries. Here, we report the discovery of TOI-5575b, a long-period, massive brown dwarf orbiting a low-mass M5V star ($\rm 0.21\pm0.02\,M_\odot$) delivered by the TESS mission. The companion has a mass and radius of $\rm 72.4\pm4.1\,M_J$ and $\rm 0.84\pm0.07\,R_J$ on a 32-day moderately eccentric orbit ($e=0.187\pm0.002$), making it the third highest-mass-ratio transiting brown dwarf system known to date. Building on this discovery, we investigate the eccentricity distributions of a sample of transiting long-period ($10\leq P\lesssim 1000$ days, $\sim$0.1-1.5 AU) giant planets, brown dwarfs and low-mass stars. We find that brown dwarfs exhibit an eccentricity behavior nearly identical to that of giant planets: a preference for circular orbits with a long tail toward high eccentricities. Such a trend contrasts sharply with direct imaging findings, where cold (5-100 AU) brown dwarfs and giant planets display distinct eccentricity distributions. Our results suggest that transiting long-period brown dwarfs and giant planets probably 1) form in different routes at exterior orbits but undergo analogous dynamical evolution processes and migrate inwards; or 2) both contain two sub-groups, one with widely spread eccentricities while the other has circular orbits, that jointly sculpt the eccentricity distributions. The low-mass-star systems appear to be a distinctive population, showing a peak eccentricity at about 0.3, akin to more massive stellar binaries.

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of very metal-poor (VMP; [Fe/H] $\leq -2.0$) stars on planar orbits has been the subject of great attention since their first discovery. However, prior to the release of the Gaia BP/RP (XP) spectra, and large photometric samples such as SkyMapper, SAGES, J-PLUS and S-PLUS, most studies have been limited due to their small sample sizes or strong selection effects. Here, we cross-match photometric metallicities derived from Gaia XP synthetic photometry and geometric distances from Bailer-Jones et al., and select 12,000 VMP stars (1604 dwarfs and 10,396 giants) with available high-quality astrometry. After calculating dynamical parameter estimates using \texttt{AGAMA}, we employ the non-negative matrix factorization technique to the $v_\phi$ distribution across bins in $Z_{\rm max}$ (the maximum height above or below the Galactic plane during the stellar orbit). We find three primary populations of the selected VMP stars: halo, disk system, and the Gaia Sausage/Enceladus (GSE) structure. The fraction of disk-like stars decreases with increasing $Z_{\rm max}$ (as expected), although it is still $\sim 20$\% for stars with $Z_{\rm max}$ $\sim 3 $ kpc. Similar results emerge from the application of the Hayden criterion, which separates stellar populations on the basis of their orbital inclination angles relative to the Galactic plane. We argue that such high fractions of disk-like stars indicate that they are an independent component, rather than originating solely from Galactic building blocks or heating by minor mergers. We suggest that most of these VMP stars are members of the hypothesized ``primordial" disk.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational wave astronomy presents a promising opportunity to directly observe scalar-induced gravitational waves originating from the early universe. Future experiments, including ground-based interferometers like LIGO and Virgo, the Pulsar Timing Array, and telescopes such as FAST and SKA, are poised to significantly enhance sensitivity to these gravitational waves. In this paper, we combined Cosmic Microwave Background data with upper or lower limits of the stochastic gravitational wave background provided by FAST or SKA, to constrain scalar-induced gravitational waves. To provide a comprehensive forecast, we consider two scenarios: one where FAST or SKA does not detect scalar-induced gravitational waves, thereby setting an upper limit on the fractional energy density; and another where these waves are detected successfully, thus establishing a lower limit on the fractional energy density. In the $\Lambda$CDM+$r$ model, the scalar spectral index of the power-law power spectrum is constrained to $n_s=0.9589^{+0.0021}_{-0.0011}$ from the combinations of CMB+BAO+SKA datasets in the upper limit scenario. The constraint shifts to $n_s = 0.9661^{+0.0027}_{-0.0039}$ in the lower limit scenario. Comparing with the constraint from the combinations of CMB+BAO datasets, the scalar spectral index $n_s$ exhibits significant changes, which could serve as an indicator for detecting scalar-induced gravitational waves. In the $\Lambda$CDM+$\alpha_s$+$r$ model and the $\Lambda$CDM+$\alpha_s$+$\beta_s$+$r$ model, the running of the scalar spectral index $\alpha_s$ and the running of the running of the scalar spectral index $\beta_s$ also show notable variations, suggesting potential indicators. The numerical findings clearly demonstrate the impact of the upper and lower limits provided by FAST or SKA.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the main-sequence binary (MSMS) Catalog derived from Gaia Data Release 3 BP/RP (XP) spectra. Leveraging the vast sample of low-resolution Gaia XP spectra, we develop a forward modeling approach that maps stellar mass and photometric metallicity to XP spectra using a neural network. Our methodology identifies binary systems through statistical comparison of single- and binary-star model fits, enabling detection of binaries with mass ratios between 0.4 and 1.0 and flux ratios larger than 0.1. From an initial sample of 35 million stars within 1 kpc, we identify 14 million binary candidates and define a high-confidence "golden sample" of 1 million binary systems. This large, homogeneous sample enables detailed statistical analysis of binary properties across diverse Galactic environments, providing new insights into binary star formation and evolution. In addition, the $\chi^2$ comparison allows us to distinguish stars with luminous companions from single stars or binaries with dark companions, such as white dwarfs, neutron stars and black hole candidates, improving our understanding of compact object populations.

 - **Abstract**
 Neutrinos can experience fast flavor conversions (FFCs) in highly dense astrophysical environments, such as core-collapse supernovae and neutron star mergers, potentially affecting energy transport and other processes. The simulation of fast flavor conversions under realistic astrophysical conditions requires substantial computational resources and involves significant analytical challenges. While machine learning methods like Multilayer Perceptrons have been used to accurately predict the asymptotic outcomes of FFCs, their 'black-box' nature limits the extraction of direct physical insight. To address this limitation, we employ two distinct interpretable machine learning frameworks-Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) and Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy)-to derive physically insightful models from a FFC simulation dataset. Our analysis reveals a fundamental trade-off between predictive accuracy and model simplicity. The KANs demonstrates high fidelity in reconstructing post-conversion neutrino energy spectra, achieving accuracies of up to $90\%$. In contrast, SINDy uncovers a remarkably concise, low-rank set of governing equations, offering maximum interpretability but with lower predictive accuracy. Critically, by analyzing the interpretable model, we identify the number density of heavy-lepton neutrinos as the most dominant factor in the system's evolution. Ultimately, this work provides a methodological framework for interpretable machine learning that supports genuine data-driven physical discovery in astronomy and astrophysics, going beyond prediction alone.

 - **Abstract**
 Context: In a recent publication, we established a close relationship between light-curve asymmetries in Mira variables and indicators of their dust mass-loss rate. The light-curve asymmetries appear to be related to the stars' third dredge-up (3DUP) activity. Aims: We aim to reveal the evolutionary status of M-type Miras with light-curve asymmetries ('bumps') within the spectral sequence M -- S -- C, determine their mass-loss properties, and check possible evolutionary scenarios. Methods: We analysed a sample of 3100 Miras collected from the ASAS database, distinguishing between symmetric and asymmetric light curves. We determined their periods, luminosity functions, and period-luminosity relations, their locations relative to the Galactic midplane, as well as mass-loss rate indicators through the 2MASS-WISE colours and the Gaia-2MASS diagram. Results: The M-type Miras with symmetric light curves are generally found to have shorter periods, lower luminosities, a larger average distance to the Galactic midplane, and lower initial masses than the M-type Miras with asymmetries. In addition, 25 Miras are proposed as candidates for new carbon stars. Conclusions: We propose that the M-type Miras have two distinct populations: M-type Miras with symmetric light curves, which have lower initial mass progenitors than M-type Miras with asymmetries, which show signs of 3DUP activity and are the link to the S-type Miras.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the circumstances which allow a black hole to remain put at the galactic centre when the stellar core is anisotropic. We use N-body calculations to study the response of stellar orbit families embedded in a larger, isotropic isochrone (Hénon) background potential. When the BH orbits in an odd f[E,Lz] velocity distribution function, they transfer angular momentum to it. We call this dynamical traction: it takes place whenever the kinetic energy drawn from f[E,Lz] has an excess of streaming motion over its (isotropic) v-dispersion. For a dynamically cold disc, the outcome depends on both the orbit of the BH and that of a Jeans-unstable stellar sub-structures. When the stellar clumps have much binding energy, a BH may scatter off of them after they formed. In the process the BH may be dislodged from the centre and migrate outward due to dynamical traction. When the stellar clumps are less bound, they may still migrate to the centre where they either dissolve or merge with the BH. The final configuration is similar to a nuclear star cluster which may yet be moving at ~10 km/s wrt the barycentre. The angular momentum transferred to a BH by dynamical traction delays the migration to the galactic centre by several hundred million years. The efficiency of angular momentum transfer is a strong function of the fragmented (cold) state of the stellar space density. In a dynamically cold environment, a BH is removed from the central region through a two-stage orbital migration instability. A criterion against this instability is proposed in the form of a threshold in isotropic velocity dispersion compared to streaming motion. For a BH to settle at the heart of a galaxy on time-scales of ~ 300 Myr or less requires that a large fraction of Lz be dissipated, or, alternatively, that the BH grows in situ in an isotropic environment devoid of sub-structures.

 - **Abstract**
 The IceCube Neutrino Observatory has observed a sample of high purity, primarily atmospheric, muon neutrino events over 11 years from all directions below the horizon, spanning the energy range 500 GeV to 100 TeV. While this sample was initially used for an eV-scale sterile neutrino search, its purity and spanned parameter space can also be used to perform an earth tomography. This flux of neutrinos traverses the earth and is attenuated in varying amounts depending on the energy and traversed column density of the event. By parameterizing the earth as multiple constant--density shells, IceCube can measure the upgoing neutrino flux as a function of the declination, yielding an inference of the density of each shell. In this talk, the latest sensitivities of this analysis and comparisons with the previous measurement are presented. In addition, the analysis procedure, details about the data sample, and systematic effects are also explained. This analysis is one of the latest, weak-force driven, non-gravitational, measurements of the earth's density and mass.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding where elements were formed has been a key goal in astrophysics for nearly a century, with answers involving cosmology, stellar burning, and cosmic explosions. Since 1957, the origin of the heaviest elements (formed via the rapid neutron capture process; r-process) has remained a mystery, identified as a key question to answer this century by the US National Research Council. With the advent of gravitational wave astronomy and recent measurements by the James Webb Space Telescope we now know that neutron star mergers are a key site of heavy element nucleosynthesis. We must now understand the heavy element yield of these events as well as mapping when these mergers occurred back through cosmic time, currently thought to peak when the universe was half its current age. This requires an extremely sensitive ultraviolet, optical, and infrared telescope which can respond rapidly to external discoveries of neutron star mergers. We here describe how the Habitable Worlds Observatory can provide the first complete answer to one of the questions of the century.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmological N-body simulations are among the primary tools for studying structure formation in the Universe. Analyses of these simulations critically depend on accurately identifying and tracking dark matter subhalos over time. In recent years, several new algorithms have been developed to improve the accuracy and consistency of subhalo tracking in cold dark matter simulations. These algorithms should be revisited in the context of new physics beyond gravity, which can modify the evolution and final properties of subhalo populations. In this work, we apply the particle-tracking-based subhalo finder Symfind to velocity-dependent self-interacting dark matter simulations with large cross section amplitudes to assess the performance of particle-tracking methods beyond the CDM paradigm. We find that the core-particle-tracking technique, which is key to the success of these algorithms in CDM, does not always yield accurate results in SIDM. The interplay between dark matter self-interactions and tidal stripping can cause the diffusion of core particles to larger radii, leading particle-tracking-based algorithms to prematurely lose track of SIDM subhalos. For massive core-expansion subhalos and core-collapse subhalos that experience close or repeated pericentric passages, a significant fraction of core particles can be lost, and particle-tracking-based finders such as Symfind offer no clear advantage over traditional methods that rely on identifying phase-space overdensities. On the other hand, for subhalos with large pericentric distances or fewer, more distant passages, Symfind tends to outperform. These differences depend sensitively on the cross section amplitude and turnover velocity of the underlying SIDM model. We therefore recommend a hybrid approach that leverages the strengths of both techniques to produce complete and robust catalogs of core-expansion and core-collapse SIDM subhalos.

 - **Abstract**
 The combined data of Fluorescence and Surface Detectors of the Pierre Auger Observatory has recently provided the strongest constraints on the validity of predictions from current models of hadronic interactions. The unmodified predictions of these models on the depth of shower maximum ($X_\text{max}$) and the hadronic part of the ground signal are unable to accurately describe the measured data at a level of more than 5$\sigma$ in the energy range 3-10 EeV. This inconsistency has been shown to originate not only from the predicted amount of muons at the ground level, but also from the predicted scale of $X_\text{max}$, which must be adjusted to better match the observed data. The resulting deeper $X_\text{max}$ scales of the models imply a heavier mass composition to be interpreted from the $X_\text{max}$ measurements. We show the results of the test with an updated data set of the Pierre Auger Observatory, studying also the energy evolution of the fitted modification parameters and new versions of the models of hadronic interactions. Additionally, we discuss the phenomenological consequences of the deeper $X_\text{max}$ scale of models on the interpretation of the features of the energy spectrum and the muon problem in air-shower modelling.

 - **Abstract**
 The dust-to-gas ratio in the protoplanetary disk, which is likely imprinted into the host star metallicity, is a property that plays a crucial role during planet formation. We aim at constraining planet formation and evolution processes by statistically analysing planetary systems generated by the Generation III Bern model, comparing with the correlations derived from observational samples. Using synthetic planets biased to observational completeness, we find that (1) the occurrence rates of large giant planets and Neptune-size planets are positively correlated with [Fe/H], while small sub-Earths exhibit an anti-correlation. In between, for sub-Neptune and super-Earth, the occurrence rate first increases and then decreases with increasing [Fe/H] with an inflection point at 0.1 dex. (2) Planets with orbital periods shorter than ten days are more likely to be found around stars with higher metallicity, and this tendency weakens with increasing planet radius. (3) Both giant planets and small planets exhibit a positive correlation between the eccentricity and [Fe/H], which could be explained by the self-excitation and perturbation of outer giant planets. (4) The radius valley deepens and becomes more prominent with increasing [Fe/H], accompanied by a lower super-Earth-to-sub-Neptune ratio. Furthermore, the average radius of the planets above the valley increases with [Fe/H]. Our nominal model successfully reproduces many observed correlations with stellar metallicity, supporting the description of physical processes and parameters included in the Bern model. However, the dependences of orbital eccentricity and period on [Fe/H] predicted by the synthetic population is however significantly weaker than observed. This discrepancy suggests that long-term dynamical interactions between planets, along with the impact of binaries/companions, can drive the system towards a dynamically hotter state.

 - **Abstract**
 We present 3D hydrodynamical modelling of supernova-induced binary-interaction-powered supernovae; a scenario proposed for the peculiar type Ic supernova SN2022jli. In this scenario, supernova ejecta of a stripped-envelope star impacts a close-by stellar companion, temporarily inflating the envelope. The expanded envelope engulfs the neutron star, causing strong mass accretion at super-Eddington rates. Feedback from the accretion powers the supernova light curve with periodic undulations. Our simulations capture key features of SN2022jli, both the overall decline and the superimposed undulations of the light curve. Based on our parameter study, we find that (i) the accretion feedback should be sufficiently geometrically confined and the eccentricity of the post-supernova binary orbit should be $0.7\lesssim e\lesssim0.9$ to sustain a high accretion rate, and (ii) the viewing angle should be close to edge-on to match the low undulation amplitude ($\Delta L/L\sim0.1$) of SN2022jli. Different combinations of parameters could account for other supernovae like SN2022mop, SN2009ip and SN2015ap. We also discuss possible explanations for other key features of SN2022jli such as the $\gamma$-ray detection at $\sim200~\mathrm{d}$ and the rapid optical drop at $\sim250~\mathrm{d}$. Finally, we speculate on the future evolution of the system and its relation to existing neutron star binaries.

 - **Abstract**
 Analyses by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration suggest a significant deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM model when their baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements are combined with Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) data and various Type Ia supernova (SNIa) samples. In this work, we systematically investigate the origin of the deviations from the $\Lambda$CDM reported in recent cosmological analyses by combining different CMB datasets, BAO measurements, and DESY5 SNIa samples within the $w_0w_a$CDM framework. We find that the DESY5 SNIa sample, particularly its low-redshift component (DES-lowz), the Planck CMB data, the lensing measurements of Planck and ACT-DR6, and the DESI-DR2 BAO measurements contribute most significantly to the observed tensions. In contrast, combinations involving DES-SN, WMAP, SPT, and ACT-DR6 remain consistent with $\Lambda$CDM within $\sim1\sigma$. Our results highlight the critical impact of SNIa systematics, CMB data, and the choice of BAO dataset on constraints of dynamical dark energy models. These findings underscore the importance of improved calibration, homogeneity, and cross-validation of observational datasets to robustly assess potential deviations from the standard cosmological model.

 The Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG) observatory continues to operate successfully in orbit at the Lagrange point L2. The Mikhail Pavlinsky ART-XC telescope has demonstrated high efficiency in conducting X-ray surveys both over large sky regions and the entire celestial sphere. A recently published source catalog, based on data from the first four and partially completed fifth sky scans, contains 1,545 objects detected in the 4-12 keV energy range. In this work, using the same sky survey data, we assess the sensitivity to point source detection across the celestial sphere based on X-ray aperture photometry - that is, we calculate the upper flux limit in the 4-12 keV band at any given significance level. The method is implemented using both Poisson statistics and Bayesian inference, with consistent results between the two approaches. This information is important for studying variable and transient X-ray sources, as well as sources that are not detected with sufficient statistical significance in the ART-XC all-sky survey. The ART-XC upper limit service is available at this https URL.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper focuses on extending the use of Minkowski Tensors to analyze anisotropic signals in cosmological data, focusing on those introduced by redshift space distortion. We derive the ensemble average of the two translation-invariant, rank-2 Minkowski Tensors for a matter density field that is perturbatively non-Gaussian in redshift space. This is achieved through the Edgeworth expansion of the joint probability density function of the field and its derivatives, expressing the ensemble averages in terms of cumulants up to cubic order. Our goal is to connect these theoretical predictions to the underlying cosmological parameters, allowing for parameter estimation by measuring them from galaxy surveys. The work builds on previous analyses of Minkowski Functionals in both real and redshift space and addresses the effects of Finger-of-God velocity dispersion and shot noise. We validate our predictions by matching them to measurements of the Minkowski Tensors from dark matter simulation data, finding that perturbation theory is a qualified success. Non-perturbative Finger-of-God effects remain significant at relatively large scales (R< 20 Mpc/h) and are particularly pronounced in the components parallel to the line of sight.

 - **Abstract**
 The mass discrepancy problem, observed in high-mass stars within eclipsing binaries, highlights systematic differences between dynamical and evolutionary mass estimates, challenging the accuracy of stellar evolution models. We aim to determine whether analysis methods directly contribute to this discrepancy and to assess how methodological improvements might reduce or clarify it. To address this, we developed a new self-contained framework that simultaneously models the photometric and spectroscopic data, minimising biases introduced by traditional iterative approaches and enabling consistent parameter optimisation. We present this framework alongside validation tests on synthetic data and demonstrate its application to three well-studied observed binaries, including one system known for its pronounced mass discrepancy. The framework recovers multiple viable solutions from distinct local minima, including one that reduces the mass discrepancy. These results illustrate how methodological biases, rather than evolutionary model assumptions, can contribute to the mass discrepancy problem. We further highlight that external constraints, such as independent distance estimates or evolutionary models, may be necessary to distinguish between degenerate solutions. Expanding this analysis to a larger sample will provide a more complete understanding, with forthcoming results in the next paper in this series.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive comparative analysis of three pivotal epochs in cosmic history: structure formation, recombination, and matter-radiation equality, within the framework of $f(R, L_m)$ gravity and the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Using a nonlinear evolution equation for density perturbations, we determine the collapse redshift ($z_c$), showing that cosmic structures form earlier in $f(R, L_m)$ gravity due to enhanced effective gravitational coupling. Recombination is studied via the visibility function $g(z)$, peaking at $z_{\mathrm{rec}} \approx 1092.6$ in both models, consistent with Planck 2018 data. We compute the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of $g(z)$ and find a slightly extended decoupling duration in $f(R, L_m)$. Finally, we analyze the evolution of energy densities and determine the matter-radiation equality redshift as $z_{\mathrm{eq}} \approx 4203$ in $f(R, L_m)$ and $z_{\mathrm{eq}} \approx 2779$ in $\Lambda$CDM, with corresponding cosmic times of approximately $67{,}756$ and $67{,}232$ years, respectively. These results confirm that $f(R, L_m)$ gravity retains key cosmological landmarks while introducing testable deviations from the standard paradigm.

 - **Abstract**
 The receiver N3AR operating at a frequency range between 67 and 116 GHz has been commissioned at the APEX telescope in October 2024. This adds a new low-frequency band for APEX, with the capability of simultaneous dual-frequency observations using a dichroic beamsplitter. The 3 mm receiver also allows APEX to join the existing 3 mm global VLBI network. One of our commissioning goals was to perform simultaneous dual-band VLBI observations at 86 and 258 GHz using receivers with shared-optical-paths (SOP) to correct the atmospheric phase fluctuations using the frequency phase transfer (FPT) technique. This was possible together with the IRAM 30 m telescope, which has already developed such a capability. We aimed to verify the expected phase coherence and sensitivity improvement at the higher frequency achievable by applying FPT. With the dual-band, single baseline data, we applied the FPT method, which uses the lower frequency data to correct the simultaneously observed higher-frequency data. We evaluate the improvement compared to the conventional single-band observing mode by analyzing the coherence factor in the higher frequency data. Our results show that the phase fluctuations at the two bands are well correlated. After applying FPT, the interferometric phases at the higher frequency vary much slower and the coherence factor is significantly improved. Our analysis confirms the feasibility of applying FPT to frequencies above 250 GHz with SOP receivers. Future observations in this mode could dramatically improve the sensitivity and imaging fidelity of high-frequency VLBI.

 - **Abstract**
 The Pierre Auger Observatory has the capability to identify neutrino-induced extensive air showers above $10^{17}$ eV by using its large Surface Detector (SD) array. Data from the Observatory have been used to set some of the most stringent upper limits to the neutrino flux in the ultra-high energy (UHE) range. The data have also been used for follow-up detection of transient events in the context of multi-messenger astrophysics. In mid-2013, two additional SD triggers (Time-over-Threshold-deconvolved (ToTd) and Multiplicity-of-Positive Steps (MoPS)) were shown to increase the detection capability for the neutrino-induced air showers in the energy regime below $10^{19}$ eV by a factor of 5-10. This contribution will give an overview of the ongoing work regarding the searches for UHE neutrinos at the Pierre Auger Observatory. The impact of the ToTd and MoPS triggers for neutrino search in the zenith angle range of $60^{\circ} < \theta < 75^{\circ}$ is discussed. A novel neutrino identification method, which integrates these triggers, is applied to observational data to look for neutrino-like events using a $\textit{blind}$ search strategy. New constraints to point-like sources of UHE neutrinos will be presented for the angular range explored.

 - **Abstract**
 Pulsars, the cosmic lighthouses, are strongly self-gravitating objects with core densities significantly exceeding nuclear density. Since the discovery of the Hulse--Taylor pulsar 50 years ago, binary pulsar studies have delivered numerous stringent tests of General Relativity (GR) in the strong-field regime as well as its radiative properties -- gravitational waves (GWs). These systems also enable high-precision neutron star mass measurements, placing tight constraints on the behaviour of matter at extreme densities. In addition, pulsars act as natural detectors for nanohertz GWs, primarily from supermassive black hole binaries, culminating in the first reported evidence of a stochastic GW background in 2023. In this article, I review key milestones in pulsar research and highlight some of contributions from my own work. After a brief overview of the gravity experiments in §1, I review the discovery of pulsars -- particularly those in binaries -- and their critical role in gravity experiments (§2) that laid the foundation for recent advances. In §3, I present the latest efforts on GR tests using the Double Pulsar and a pioneer technique to constrain the dense matter equation of state. §4 demonstrates the potential of binary pulsars on testing alternative theories to GR. Advances in nanohertz GW detection with pulsar timing arrays are discussed in §5. I outline some of the current challenges in §6 and conclude with final remarks in §7.

 - **Abstract**
 In the build-up of galactic discs gas infall is an important ingredient and it produces radial gas inflows as a physical consequence of angular momentum conservation, since the infalling gas on to the disc at a specific radius has lower angular momentum than the circular motions of the gas at the point of impact. NGC300 is a well studied isolated, bulge-less, and low-mass disc galaxy ideally suited for an investigation of galaxy evolution with radial gas inflows. To investigate the effects of radial gas inflows on the physical properties of NGC300, a chemical evolution model for NGC300 is constructed by assuming its disc builds up progressively by infalling of metall-free gas and outflowing of metal-enriched gas. Radial gas inflows are also considered in the model. Our model including the radial gas inflows and an inside-out disc formation scenario can simultaneously reproduce the present-day observed radial profiles of HI gas mass surface density, SFR surface density, sSFR, gas-phase and stellar metallicity. We find that, although the value of radial gas inflow velocity is as low as -0.1 km/s, the radial gas inflows steepen the present-day radial profiles of HI gas mass surface density, SFR surface density, and metallicity, but flatten the radial sSFR profile. Incorporating radial gas inflows significantly improves the agreement between our model predicted present-day sSFR profile and the observations of NGC300. It predicts a significant flattening of the metallicity gradient with cosmic time. We also find that the model predicted star formation has been more active recently, indicating that the radial gas inflows may be help to sustain star formation in local spirals, at least in NGC300.

 - **Abstract**
 The Pierre Auger Observatory consists of 1660 water-Cherenkov detectors (WCDs) and 27 fluorescence telescopes, covering a surface of 3000 km2 in the province of Mendoza, Argentina. After almost two decades, Auger Phase I has ended the data taking and has already delivered many outstanding physics results. The Auger Observatory is currently running in Phase II, with upgraded detectors for enhanced data of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs). During Phase I, several engineering detectors were developed and tested. Some of those developments led to new detectors, which are now part of the upgraded Observatory. For Phase II, the WCDs were upgraded with a surface-scintillator detector, a radio detector, a small photomultiplier, and an upgraded electronics board, facilitating mass-sensitive measurements for source identification of UHECRs. Moreover, an underground muon detector allows for a direct measurement of the muon content of air showers. The Offline framework is the main software for the event reconstruction and detector simulation at the Pierre Auger Observatory. It is continuously being developed to accommodate changes in the detector and new algorithms. It allows the running of various applications, which are made up of individual modules, either on raw data or simulations on an event-by-event basis. Large productions of shower and detector reference libraries are done with CORSIKA 7 and Offline on the European Grid Infrastructure (EGI) using the Virtual Organization Auger. Various air-shower geometries (up to 89 degrees in zenith) were considered, as well as several primary particles (from light to ultra-heavy nuclei, photons, and neutrinos), hadronic interaction models and detector configurations for Phase I and Phase II. In this contribution, we present the actual efforts and updates on software for data production and reference Monte Carlo simulations for Auger data analysis.

          A Method for Testing Diffusive Shock Acceleration and Diffusion Propagation of 1-100 TeV Cosmic Electron with Multi-wavelength Observation of Geminga Halo and Pulsar Wind Nebula

 - **Abstract**
 Diffusive shock acceleration and diffusion propagation are essential components of the standard cosmic ray model. These theories are based on extensive observations of high-energy solar processes, providing substantial direct evidence in the MeV energy range. Although the model is widely and successfully used to explain high-energy cosmic phenomena, direct validation has been elusive. The multi-wavelength spectra and angular profile measurements of the Geminga pulsar wind nebula and its pulsar halo, particularly the precise spectral observations by HAWC and LHAASO-KM2A in recent years, offer a rare opportunity to test these theories with cosmic rays energies between 1 TeV and several hundred TeV. These observations are expected to elevate the direct testing of theoretical models from multi-MeV to sub-PeV energies. In this work, a method is developed to test the diffusive shock acceleration and diffusion propagation model between one and several hundred TeV energies through the latest spectral and morphological data of the Geminga region from HAWC and Fermi-LAT. Our results show that the theories of diffusive shock acceleration and diffusion propagation are consistent with experimental observations. However, the published morphological data adopted rather wide energy bins and currently do not allow a high precision test of the inferred energy dependent diffusion coefficient by observed energy spectra with DSA theory. It is anticipated that future HAWC and LHAASO-KM2A observations will yield higher-precision results, and the confirmation of a rapidly increasing diffusion coefficient above 100 TeV would serve as important evidence supporting the diffusive shock acceleration and diffusion propagation theory.

 - **Abstract**
 The Pierre Auger Observatory has driven the field of ultra-high-energy cosmic ray (UHECR) physics, producing several groundbreaking observations over the last 20 years. One of the most striking findings has been the complex evolution of UHECR mass composition, as revealed by detailed analyses of observables such as the depth of shower maximum ($X_{\rm max}$) and the muon content of showers. As more data are collected and sophisticated analyses are undertaken, not only are new fine details emerging, but the general picture of UHECR mass composition is becoming increasingly robust. This contribution presents recent results on the mass composition of UHECRs derived from surface, fluorescence, and radio detectors. Together with other key findings from the Observatory, these results converge to present a coherent picture of UHECR mass composition, effectively ruling out proton dominance and challenging the interpretation of the observed flux features as purely proton-induced propagation effects. To finish the contribution, we compare the $X_{\rm max}$ data from the southern and northern equatorial bands of the exposure of the Pierre Auger Observatory fluorescence detector to evaluate the possibility of changes in composition as a function of declination.

 - **Abstract**
 Solar activity events release vast amounts of energy, including radio waves, X-rays, ultraviolet radiation, and energetic particles, which interact with the ionosphere of the Earth and can disrupt radio wave propagation, affecting radio communications. They can either enhance reflections, improving long-distance terrestrial communications, or cause signal degradation and absorption, respectively, depending on whether the increased ionization affects the upper or lower layers of the ionosphere. In the first case, the solar cycle modulates the Maximum Usable Frequency (MUF), the highest frequency usable for radio communication between two Earth-based points. The Auger Engineering Radio Array (AERA) of the Pierre Auger Observatory was developed to measure the radio emission from extensive air showers in the $30-80$ MHz band. We examine the impact of solar activity on AERA data collected over approximately 11 years. We report the detection of different types of solar radio bursts and we investigate how increased solar radiation - particularly in the X-ray and extreme ultraviolet bands - also affects measurements in the AERA energy band. Our results show a remarkable correlation between the MUF and the broadband noise observed in the $30-40$ MHz frequency range. Radio blackouts are also observed in AERA spectrograms in coincidence with those reported by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Additionally, we performed a search for temporal coincidences between AERA data and independent observations of solar radio burst events from the e-CALLISTO network and the SWAVES instrument. These findings highlight the complex interplay between solar activity and radio wave propagation, which is also relevant for cosmic-ray detection.

 - **Abstract**
 The analysis of HAWC data is done using a likeihood-based systematic multi-source search procedure utilizing the threeML software package and the HAL Plugin. This approach was inspired by the extended source search described in the Fermi-LAT Extended Source Search Catalog. The pipeline to search for point sources and extended sources within the region of interest (ROI) is described in the recent HAWC papers. This procedure is computationally intensive and often requires multiple days to produce a final model for a region. Often this approach misses fainter sources, which need to be added manually later. This blind search could be complemented by providing a method to seed source locations, which can be assessed and evaluated by likelihood analysis, thereby significantly reducing the computational time and resources spent on finding a model.

          How an overweight and rapidly rotating PG 1159 star in the Galactic halo challenges evolutionary models

 - **Abstract**
 PG 1159 stars are thought to be progenitors of the majority of H-deficient white dwarfs. Their unusual He-, C-, and O-dominated surface composition is typically believed to result from a late thermal pulse experienced by a single (pre-)white dwarf. Yet, other formation channels - involving close binary evolution - have recently been proposed and could lead to similar surface compositions. Here we present a non-local thermodynamic equilibrium spectral analysis based on new UV and archival optical spectra of one of the hottest PG 1159 stars, $\text{RX J}0122.9\text{ -}7521$. We find $T_\text{eff} = 175$ kK and a surface gravity of log $g = 7.7$, and an astonishingly low O/C ratio of $7.3 \times 10^{-3}$ by mass. By combining the spectroscopic surface gravity and Gaia parallax with a spectral energy distribution fit, we derive a mass of $M_\text{spec} = 1.8^{+1.1}_{-0.7}$ $M_\odot$. Although this spectroscopic mass is higher than predicted by evolutionary models, it is subject to substantial uncertainty. Furthermore, we find that $\text{RX J}0122.9\text{ -}7521$ shows strongly rotationally broadened lines, suggesting that the previously reported photometric period of $41$ min indeed corresponds to the rotational period of this star. Our kinematic analysis shows that $\text{RX J}0122.9\text{ -}7521$ belongs to the Galactic halo, which - assuming single-star evolution - is in stark contrast to its relatively high mass. The rapid rotation, high mass, and halo kinematics, as well as the lack of evidence for a close companion, lead us to believe that $\text{RX J}0122.9\text{ -}7521$ formed through the merger of two white dwarfs. Yet, none of the current models can explain the surface abundances of $\text{RX J}0122.9\text{ -}7521$.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a novel non-parametric method for inferring smooth models of the mean velocity field and velocity dispersion tensor of the Milky Way from astrometric data. Our approach is based on Stochastic Variational Gaussian Process Regression (SVGPR) and provides an attractive alternative to binning procedures. SVGPR is an approximation to standard GPR, the latter of which suffers severe computational scaling with N and assumes independently distributed Gaussian Noise. In the Galaxy however, velocity measurements exhibit scatter from both observational uncertainty and the intrinsic velocity dispersion of the distribution function. We exploit the factorization property of the objective function in SVGPR to simultaneously model both the mean velocity field and velocity dispersion tensor as separate Gaussian Processes. This achieves a computational complexity of O(M^3) versus GPR's O(N^3), where M << N is a subset of points chosen in a principled way to summarize the data. Applied to a sample of ~8 x 10^5 stars from the Gaia DR3 Radial Velocity Survey, we construct differentiable profiles of the mean velocity and velocity dispersion as functions of height above the Galactic midplane. We find asymmetric features in all three diagonal components of the velocity dispersion tensor, providing evidence that the vertical dynamics of the Milky Way are in a state of disequilibrium. Furthermore, our dispersion profiles exhibit correlated structures at several locations in |z|, which we interpret as signatures of the Gaia phase spiral. These results demonstrate that our method provides a promising direction for data-driven analyses of Galactic dynamics.

 - **Abstract**
 Meteoroid entry into planetary atmospheres generates bow shocks, resulting in high-temperature gas conditions that drive chemical reactions. In this paper, we perform three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of meteoroid entry using the Athena++ code, coupled with chemistry calculations via Cantera to model the non-equilibrium chemistry triggered by atmospheric entry. Our aerodynamical simulations reveal the formation of complex shock structures, including secondary shock waves, which influence the thermodynamic evolution of the gas medium. By tracking thermodynamic parameters along streamlines, we analyze the effects of shock heating and subsequent expansion cooling on chemical reaction pathways. Our results demonstrate that chemical quenching occurs when the cooling timescale surpasses reaction rates, leading to the formation of distinct chemical products that deviate from equilibrium predictions. We show that the efficiency of molecular synthesis depends on the object\textquotesingle s size and velocity, influencing the composition of the post-entry gas mixture. Applying our model to Titan, we demonstrate that organic matter can be synthesized in the present environment of Titan. Also, we find that nitrogen, the dominant atmospheric component, remains stable, while water vapor is efficiently removed, a result inconsistent with equilibrium chemistry assumptions. Moreover, we compare our simulation results with laser experiments and find good agreement in chemical yields. Finally, we also evaluate the impact on Titan\textquotesingle s atmosphere as a whole, showing that meteoroid entry events could have played a significant role in supplying molecules such as HCN during early Titan\textquotesingle s history.

 - **Abstract**
 We describe distinctive stellar features indicating the presence of hyperons in neutron stars. A strongly negative curvature of the mass-radius relation R(M) is characteristic of hyperons, which can be determined from measurements of neutron stars with three different masses. Similarly, a reduced second derivative of the tidal deformability as function of mass $\lambda(M)$ points to hyperonic degrees of freedom in NS matter. The slopes of such curves R(M) and \lambda(M) can distinguish a hyperonic equation of state from purely nucleonic models if they appear increased (decreased for \lambda(M)) relative to the maximum mass of neutron stars.

 - **Abstract**
 In the framework of the coherent curvature radiation model of pulsar radio emission, charged particles responsible for the radio emission are generated on the polar cap in the localized pair cascade processes called sparks. When a pulsar can no longer sustain the sparking process on its polar cap, the coherent radio emission from the pulsar stops, and the pulsar is called dead. In this work, we revisit the pulsar death phenomena under two popular voltage gap models: vacuum voltage gap and partially screened voltage gap. We notice that a dying pulsar resorts to a single spark on the polar cap to sustain the pair production under both voltage gap frameworks. The presence of only one spark on the polar cap has important implications for the radio emission properties of the pulsar. We study the emission properties of five pulsars close to the lower boundary on the $P-\dot{P}$ plane of the current pulsar population, as these pulsars are expected to be dying. We find that the dying pulsars in our sample and the normal pulsar population have very similar emission properties. We show that the majority of pulsars in the pulsar death valley, including five pulsars in our sample, show evidence of multiple sparks as opposed to what is expected from single spark death line models.

 - **Abstract**
 The nuclear rates for reactions involving 12C and 16O are key to compute the energy release and nucleosynthesis of massive stars during their evolution. These rates shape the stellar structure and evolution, and impact the nature of the final compact remnant. We explore the impact of new nuclear reaction rates for 12C({\alpha},{\gamma})16O, 12C+12C, 12C+16O and 16O+16O reactions for massive stars. We aim to investigate how the structure and nucleosynthesis evolve and how these processes influence the stellar fate. We computed stellar models using the GENEC code, including updated rates for 12C({\alpha},{\gamma})16O and, for the three fusion reactions, new rates following a fusion suppression scenario and new theoretical rates obtained with TDHF calculations. The updated 12C({\alpha},{\gamma})16O rates mainly impact the chemical structure evolution changing the 12C/16O ratio with little effect on the CO core mass. This variation in the 12C/16O ratio is critical for predicting the stellar fate, which is very sensitive to 12C abundance. The combined new rates for 12C+12C and 16O+16O fusion reactions according to the HIN(RES) model lead to shorter C- and O-burning lifetimes, and shift the ignition conditions to higher temperatures and densities. Theoretical TDHF rates primarily affect C-burning, increasing its duration and lowering the ignition temperature. These changes alter the core chemical structure, the carbon shell size and duration, and hence the compactness. They also affect nucleosynthesis. This work shows that accurate reaction rates for key processes in massive star evolution drive significant changes in stellar burning lifetimes, chemical evolution, and stellar fate. In addition, discrepancies between experimental and theoretical rates introduce uncertainties in model predictions, influencing both the internal structure and the supernova ejecta composition.

 - **Abstract**
 Predictions for the acoustic attenuation coefficient and phase speed as functions of frequency and altitude in Saturn's atmosphere are presented and discussed. The pressure range considered in the study is 1 mbar to 1 bar, in windless and cloudless conditions. The atmospheric composition is represented by the major constituents, namely hydrogen (with its two spin isomers, ortho-H$_2$ and para-H$_2$) and helium. The H$_2$ and He concentrations are assumed constant with respect to altitude; however, non-uniform ortho- and para-H$_2$ profiles are considered. The acoustic wavenumber is obtained by incorporating a viscous, thermal, and internal molecular relaxation effects in a linearized fluid dynamics model. The ambient inputs are vertical profiles of the specific heats, shear viscosity, and thermal conductivity coefficients of the three-component (oH$_2$, pH$_2$, He) mixture, extracted at each pressure-temperature pair.

 - **Abstract**
 Spiral galaxy disks are thought to exist in a quasi-stationary state, between fresh gas accretion from cosmic filaments and disk star formation, self-regulated through supernovae feedback. Our goal here is to quantify these processes and probe their efficiency. While star formation can be traced at 10 Myr time-scales through H$\alpha$ emission, the signature of OB stars, and at 100 Myr scale with UV emission, the gas surface density is traced by HI emission for the atomic phase. We choose to investigate feedback processes using fountain effects in M101, a nearby well-observed face-on galaxy. Face-on studies are very complementary to the more frequent edge-on observations of these fountains in the literature. We use high-resolution data from THINGS for the HI emission GALEX for UV, and SITELLE/SIGNALS IFU for the H$\alpha$ tracer. We have identified 20 new HI holes, in addition to the 52 holes found by Kamphuis in 1993. We study in more detail the nine holes satisfying strong criteria to be true fountain effects, compute their physical properties, and derive their energy balance. Only one small HI hole still contains H$\alpha$ and young stars inside, while the largest hole of 2.4 kpc and oldest age (94 Myr) is deprived of H$\alpha$ and UV. For face-on disks, the possibility to study simultaneously the HI shell morphology, the stellar association, and kinematic evidence is of primordial importance. In M101, we have quantified how stellar feedback is responsible for carving the observed cavities in the atomic gas disk, and how it can expel above the disk the neutral gas, which is then unavailable for star formation during up to 100 Myr.

          Angular-momentum pairs in spherical systems: applications to the Galactic centre

 Consider a system of point masses in a spherical potential. In such systems objects execute planar orbits covering two-dimensional rings or annuli, represented by the angular-momentum vectors, which slowly reorient due to the persistent weak gravitational interaction between different rings. This process, called vector resonant relaxation, is much faster than other processes which change the size/shape of the rings. The interaction is stron9gest between objects with closely aligned angular-momentum vectors. In this paper, we show that nearly parallel angular-momentum vectors may form stable bound pairs in angular-momentum space. We examine the stability of such pairs against an external massive perturber, and determine the critical separation analogous to the Hill radius or tidal radius in the three-body problem, where the angular-momentum pairs are marginally disrupted, as a function of the perturber's mass, the orbital inclination, and the radial distance. Angular-momentum pairs or multiples closer than the critical inclination will remain bound and evolve together in angular-momentum-direction space under any external influence, such as anisotropic density fluctuations, or massive perturbers. This study has applications in various astrophysical contexts, including galactic nuclei, in particular the Milky Way's Galactic centre, globular clusters, or planetary systems. In nuclear star clusters with a central super-massive black hole, we apply this criterion to the disc of young, massive stars, and show that clusters in angular-momentum space may be used to constrain the presence of intermediate-mass black holes or the mass of the nearby gaseous torus.

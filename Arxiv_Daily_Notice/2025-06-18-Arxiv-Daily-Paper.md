          Accuracy of analytic potentials for orbits of satellites around a Milky Way-like galaxy: comparison with $N$-body simulations

 - **Abstract**
 To study the orbits of satellites, a galaxy could be modelled either by means of a static gravitational potential, or by live $N$-body particles. Analytic potentials allow for fast calculations, but are idealized and non-responsive. On the other hand, $N$-body simulations are more realistic, but demand higher computational cost. Our goal is to characterize the regimes in which analytic potentials provide a sufficient approximation, and those where $N$-bodies are necessary. We perform two sets of simulations using both Gala and Gadget, in order to closely compare the orbital evolution of satellites around a Milky Way-like galaxy. Focusing on the periods when the satellite has not yet been severely disrupted by tidal forces, we find that the orbits of satellites up to $10^{8} {\rm M_{\odot}}$ can be reliably computed with analytic potentials to within 5% error, if they are circular or moderately eccentric. If the satellite is as massive as $10^{9} {\rm M_{\odot}}$, errors of 9% are to be expected. However, if the orbital radius is smaller than 30 kpc, the results may not be relied upon with the same accuracy beyond 1--2 Gyr.

          Spectroscopic Ultraluminous Ly-alpha Luminosity Functions at z = 5.7 and z = 6.6 from HEROES: Evidence for Ionized Bubbles

 - **Abstract**
 We present spectroscopic Ly$\alpha$ luminosity functions (LFs) at z = 5.7 and z = 6.6 based on a large 209 source sample of Ly$\alpha$ emitter (LAE) candidates identified in Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam narrowband imaging and confirmed with Keck II/DEIMOS spectroscopy over a multi-year observing campaign. After applying photometric and spectroscopic cuts to produce homogeneous samples, we use the resulting samples of 49 z = 5.7 and 56 z = 6.6 LAEs to compute spectroscopic LAE LFs at each redshift. We correct our LFs for incompleteness using a source-injection simulation. We find excellent agreement with current spectroscopic and photometric LAE LFs from the literature. We look for evolution over the redshift range z = 5.7-6.6. We find a strong convergence of the LFs at L(Ly$\alpha$) > $10^{43.4}$ erg s$^{-1}$. This convergence (noted in previous literature) provides strong evidence that the most luminous LAEs at z = 6.6 form ionized bubbles around themselves, allowing for greater Ly$\alpha$ transmission through the neutral intergalactic medium, which is measured as an increase in the bright end of the z = 6.6 LF over the expected evolution in the LF based on the faint end. We infer that ultraluminous LAEs may play a significant role in reionization.

          Different Inhomogeneous Evolutionary Histories for Uranus and Neptune

 - **Abstract**
 We present updated non-adiabatic and inhomogeneous evolution models for Uranus and Neptune, employing an interior composition of methane, ammonia, water, and rocks. Following formation trends of the gas giants, Uranus and Neptune formation models are applied, where both planets begin with layers stable to convection. Both planets are subject to convective mixing throughout their evolution. Uranus undergoes modest convective mixing, preserving much of its primordial internal heat. In contrast, Neptune's interior undergoes extensive mixing, homogenization, and adiabatic cooling of the outer 40\% of its envelope. The subsequent release of internal energy in Neptune, driven by the convective instability of its primordial outer compositional gradient, accounts for its higher luminosity relative to Uranus. Thus, the observed luminosity differences between Uranus and Neptune could be primarily dictated by the convective stability of their outer envelopes. The extensive convective mixing in Neptune leads to a higher metallicity in its outer region compared to Uranus, a feature seen in atmospheric measurements and shown in past interior models of Neptune. Due to Neptune's more pronounced cooling, our models predict favorable conditions for hydrogen-water immiscibility in its envelope.

          Not-quite-primordial black holes

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a new mechanism for the formation of seeds of supermassive black holes at early cosmic epochs. Enhanced density fluctuations with amplitudes that are not large enough to form primordial black holes post-inflation can still lead to collapsed dark matter halos at very early times. For halos forming prior to $1+z \approx 200$, the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) is energetic enough to suppress the formation of molecular hydrogen, hence preventing cooling and fragmentation, as a consequence of which baryons falling into the potential well of the halo may undergo "direct collapse" into a black hole. We show using a few illustrative models how this mechanism may account for the abundance of high-redshift black holes inferred from observations by the James Webb Space Telescope while remaining consistent with current limits from CMB spectral distortions. Limits on the primordial power spectrum are also derived by requiring that the universe not reionize too early.

 - **Abstract**
 Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) searches for nHz gravitational-wave backgrounds (GWBs) typically model time-correlated noise by assuming a diagonal covariance in Fourier space, neglecting inter-frequency correlations introduced by the finite observation window. We show that this diagonal approximation can lead to biased estimates of spectral parameters, especially for the common red process that represents the GWB. To address these limitations, we present a method that (i) computes the time-domain autocorrelation on a coarse grid using a fast Fourier transform (FFT), (ii) interpolates it accurately to the unevenly sampled observation times, and (iii) incorporates it into a low-rank likelihood via the Sherman--Morrison--Woodbury identity. Using both analytic covariance comparisons and end-to-end simulations inspired by the NANOGrav 15-year dataset, we demonstrate that our method captures frequency correlations faithfully, avoids Gibbs ringing, and recovers unbiased spectral parameters with modest computational cost. As PTA datasets increase in sensitivity and complexity, our approach offers a practical and scalable path to fully accurate covariance modeling for current and future analyses.

 - **Abstract**
 (abridged) In a series of publications, we describe a comprehensive comparison of Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) data with theoretical models of Sgr A* and M87*. Here, we report on improvements made to our observational data reduction pipeline and present the generation of observables derived from the EHT models. We make use of ray-traced GRMHD simulations that are based on different black hole spacetime metrics and accretion physics parameters. These broad classes of models provide a good representation of the primary targets observed by the EHT. To generate realistic synthetic data from our models, we took the signal path as well as the calibration process, and thereby the aforementioned improvements, into account. We could thus produce synthetic visibilities akin to calibrated EHT data and identify salient features for the discrimination of model parameters. We have produced a library consisting of an unparalleled 962,000 synthetic Sgr A* and M87* datasets. In terms of baseline coverage and noise properties, the library encompasses 2017 EHT measurements as well as future observations with an extended telescope array. We differentiate between robust visibility data products related to model features and data products that are strongly affected by data corruption effects. Parameter inference is mostly limited by intrinsic model variability, which highlights the importance of long-term monitoring observations with the EHT. In later papers in this series, we will show how a Bayesian neural network trained on our synthetic data is capable of dealing with the model variability and extracting physical parameters from EHT observations. With our calibration improvements, our newly reduced EHT datasets have a considerably better quality compared to previously analyzed data.

          Deep learning inference with the Event Horizon Telescope III. Zingularity results from the 2017 observations and predictions for future array expansions

 - **Abstract**
 (abridged) In the first two papers of this publication series, we present a comprehensive library of synthetic EHT observations and used this library to train and validate Bayesian neural networks for the parameter inference of accreting supermassive black hole systems. The considered models are ray-traced GRMHD simulations of Sgr A* and M87*. In this work, we infer the best-fitting accretion and black hole parameters from 2017 EHT data and predict improvements that will come with future upgrades of the array. Compared to previous EHT analyses, we considered a substantially larger synthetic data library and the most complete set of information from the observational data. We made use of the Bayesian nature of the trained neural networks and apply bootstrapping of known systematics in the observational data to obtain parameter posteriors. Within a wide GRMHD parameter space, we find M87* to be best described by a spin between 0.5 and 0.94 with a retrograde MAD accretion flow and strong synchrotron emission from the jet. Sgr A* has a high spin of $\sim$ 0.8 $-$ 0.9 and a prograde accretion flow beyond the standard MAD/SANE models with a comparatively weak jet emission, seen at a $\sim$ 20$^\circ$ $-$ 40$^\circ$ inclination and $\sim$ 106$^\circ$ $-$ 137$^\circ$ position angle. While previous EHT analyses could rule out specific regions in the model parameter space considered here, we are able to obtain narrow parameter posteriors with our Zingularity framework without being impacted by the unknown foreground Faraday screens and data calibration biases. We further demonstrate that the AMT extension to the EHT will reduce parameter inference errors by a factor of three for non-Kerr models, enabling more robust tests of general relativity. It will be instructive to produce new GRMHD models with the inferred interpolated parameters to study their accretion rate plus jet power.

 - **Abstract**
 We have searched for ultra-long (> 100 s) gamma-ray transients in the data from the anticoincidence shield (ACS) of the SPI gamma-ray spectrometer onboard the INTEGRAL orbital observatory and classified them by machine learning methods. We have found about 4364 candidates for such events in the SPI-ACS data by the `blind' threshold search method. We have developed an algorithm for automatic processing of their light curves that distinguishes a candidate for transients on various time scales and allows its duration and fluence to be determined. The algorithm has been applied to calculate (and compare) the fluxes in the light curves recorded by various INTEGRAL detectors: IREM, SPI-ACS, SPI, ISGRI, and PICsIT. These fluxes have been used to train the classifier based on gradient boosting. Subsequently, we have performed a cluster analysis of the candidates found by the dimensionality reduction and clustering methods. In conclusion we have compared the remaining candidates with the data from the Konus-WIND gamma-ray detectors. Thus, we have confirmed 16 candidates for astrophysical transients, including four candidates for ultra-long gamma-ray bursts from the events detected by the SPI-ACS detector. Out of the probable events, but unconfirmed by other experiments, up to 270 events can be classified as real gamma-ray bursts.

 - **Abstract**
 We demonstrate the potential of Euclid's slitless spectroscopy to discover high-redshift (z>5) quasars and their main photometric contaminant, ultracool dwarfs. Sensitive infrared spectroscopy from space is able to efficiently identify both populations, as demonstrated by Euclid Near-Infrared Spectrometer and Photometer Red Grism (NISP RGE) spectra of the newly discovered z=5.404 quasar EUCL J181530.01+652054.0, as well as several ultracool dwarfs in the Euclid Deep Field North and the Euclid Early Release Observation field Abell 2764. The ultracool dwarfs were identified by cross-correlating their spectra with templates. The quasar was identified by its strong and broad CIII] and MgII emission lines in the NISP RGE 1206-1892 nm spectrum, and confirmed through optical spectroscopy from the Large Binocular Telescope. The NISP Blue Grism (NISP BGE) 926-1366 nm spectrum confirms CIV and CIII] emission. NISP RGE can find bright quasars at z~5.5 and z>7, redshift ranges that are challenging for photometric selection due to contamination from ultracool dwarfs. EUCL J181530.01+652054.0 is a high-excitation, broad absorption line quasar detected at 144 MHz by the LOw-Frequency Array (L144=4e25 W/Hz). The quasar has a bolometric luminosity of 3e12 Lsun and is powered by a 3.4e9 Msun black hole. The discovery of this bright quasar is noteworthy as fewer than one such object was expected in the ~20 deg2 surveyed. This finding highlights the potential and effectiveness of NISP spectroscopy in identifying rare, luminous high-redshift quasars, previewing the census of these sources that Euclid's slitless spectroscopy will deliver over about 14,000 deg2 of the sky.

          On the Size of the Mission Suite Enabled by NASA's Deep Space Network

 - **Abstract**
 The Deep Space Network (DSN) is the primary means of commanding, tracking, and receiving data from all of NASA's deep space missions, as well as a number of deep space missions operated by other international space agencies. The current number of missions enabled by the DSN is approximately 40 missions, but there has been concern about the level of "over-subscription" of the DSN, namely that the number of missions currently using the DSN is larger than can be enabled reasonably. This manuscript assesses the maximum number of missions that could be enabled, based on recent performance and with the constraint that the total number of hours used per week does not exceed the available number of DSN antenna-hours. Three different models are considered, and the maximal number of missions that could be enabled ranges between approximately 40 missions and 70 missions, assuming that there continues to be approximately six Mars missions and that those Mars missions continue to make use of the DSN's multiple spacecraft per antenna (MSPA) capability. Crucially, the conclusion that an approximately 50% growth in the DSN mission suite rests on the assumption that the DSN antennas are "interchangeable," but they are not, with some spacecraft able to use only certain antennas. Efforts to make the DSN antennas more "interchangeable," primarily in their transmitter and receiver suites, would be an effective means of ensuring expanded capability. Additional findings from this work are that, while additional use of the MSPA capability might appear to be a promising means for increasing the mission suite, there appear to be no locations in the Solar System, other than Mars, for which it would be effective.

 - **Abstract**
 With the combination of observations from in-situ and high-resolution remote sensing instruments, the Solar Orbiter (SolO) mission has become a particularly valuable mission for studying the inner heliosphere. With a field of view (FOV) of 40$^\circ$ to the east of the Sun, the Solar Orbiter Heliospheric Imager (SoloHI) is one of the six remote sensing instruments on board the Solar Orbiter (SolO) spacecraft. SoloHI's high-resolution imaging observations of the heliosphere and its higher cadence than previous generations of heliospheric imagers make it a perfect candidate to perform and complement studies of CMEs evolution through the heliosphere. In this work, we present the first prominence material detected by SoloHI along with other remote sensing instruments. We report that as the CME propagates out in the heliosphere, the associated filament material reaches a heliocentric height of $\sim$122.5$\,$R$_{\odot}$ ($\sim$0.57$\,$au).

          The DORCHA suite: nature, nurture, and the phase space distribution of the Milky Way's high redshift progenitors today

 - **Abstract**
 Where in the present-day Milky Way should we search for the remnants of its earliest stars? We address this question using the DORCHA (Gaelic for Dark; DUR-uh-khuh) suite: a set of 25 high-resolution, dark-matter-only cosmological zoom-in simulations of Milky Way analogue (MWA) haloes evolved to $z=0$. Of these, 15 are isolated and the rest are in pairs, similar to the MW and M31. By identifying and tagging the most bound material in high-redshift ($z\geq5$) progenitor haloes -- those likely to host early star formation -- we track the present-day phase-space distribution of this ancient component. We find that this material is highly centrally concentrated at $z=0$, with 90 - 100 per cent residing within $r \lesssim 15\,h^{-1}\,\mathrm{kpc}$. It exhibits steep density profiles ($\rho\propto\,r^{-4}$), low velocity dispersions ($\sigma_r / \sigma_{\rm max} \lesssim 0.6$), and radially biased orbits ($\beta \gtrsim 0.5$ for $r \gtrsim 0.1\,R_{200}$), consistent with a relaxed, centrally embedded population. These results hold across haloes with diverse formation histories and environments, suggesting that the dynamical signature of early progenitors is robust to later mergers and interactions. Our findings imply that the fossil record of the first generations of stars -- including Population III and extremely metal-poor stars -- should be sought in the innermost regions of the Milky Way, where they retain distinctive kinematic imprints. While these stellar populations may overlap, we caution that low metallicity does not uniquely identify ancient stars, nor vice versa. The DORCHA suite thus provides a physically motivated baseline for interpreting observations from Galactic Archaeology surveys targeting the bulge and inner halo.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a study of the solar wind over different periods of the solar cycle, specifically focussing on the minimum between solar cycles 24 and 25, and the active, ascending phase of solar cycle 25. With the use of interplanetary scintillation (IPS) data taken by the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) from mid-2019 and early 2023, we have sampled over a wide range of solar latitudes and elongations, probing a large section of the surrounding heliosphere from $\sim$90 to 140R$_\odot$. The MWA observations provide the highest density of sampled IPS radio sources to date, allowing for an investigation into the latitudinal dependence of the scattering effect caused by the solar wind on a radio source as observed throughout the solar cycle. We find our measurements during periods of heightened solar activity are consistent with a spherically symmetric solar wind. On the other hand, with a reduction in solar activity we find the solar wind density inherits a latitudinal dependence. As is consistent with prior studies, an elliptical function better represents the transition from poles to equator, although we find a more exaggerated sigmoid shaped curve is required to represent the low- to mid-latitude transition region during the minimum of solar cycle 24. We find for a heliospheric distance range of 108 - 123R$_{\odot}$ the reduction ratio between the equator and the southern pole is 1.62$\pm$0.02.

          DESI results and Dark Energy from QCD topological sectors

 - **Abstract**
 We present a physically motivated model of dark energy (DE) rooted in the topological structure of the Quantum ChromoDynamic (QCD) vacuum. In this framework, DE emerges as the Universe expands, from the difference in vacuum energy between the expanding Universe and Minkowski spacetime, driven by QCD vacuum topological sectors. This leads to a modification of the dark energy term in the Friedmann equation, which then scales with the Hubble parameter as $\rho_{\rm DE}(t) \propto H(t)$ when dark energy dominates the expansion of the Universe. The QCD scale, $\Lambda_{\rm QCD} \sim 100~{\rm MeV}$, naturally sets the energy density of DE and provides a compelling explanation for why its impact on cosmic expansion becomes significant only in the recent cosmological epoch. Importantly, the entire framework is grounded in Standard Model (SM) physics, involving no new fields or coupling constants. Key predictions of the model include: (a) A present-day DE equation of state $w_{\rm DE} > -1$, asymptotically approaching the de Sitter limit $w_{\rm DE} = -1$ in the future, with the corresponding asymptotic Hubble constant $\overline{H}$ set by $\Lambda_{\rm QCD}$. (b) At redshifts $z \ge 0$, $w_{\rm DE}$ can lie above or below $-1$ and may cross this boundary multiple times, behavior qualitatively consistent with recent DESI observations. (c) The solution to the Friedmann equation in this framework can deviate from the canonical $\Lambda$CDM form at $z \ge 0$. (d) If such deviation occurs, it can be tested using cosmological observations, CMB anisotropies, BAO, SNIa, and large-scale structure, which we propose to explore in future work. (e) Finally, we point out a potential connection between our framework and the observed $H_0$ tension.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive mid-infrared spectroscopic survey of 124 Herbig Ae/Be stars using newly processed Spitzer/IRS spectra from the newly released CASSISjuice database. Based on prominent dust and molecular signatures (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, silicates, and hydrogenated amorphous carbons), we classify the stars into five groups. Our analysis reveals that 64% of the spectra show PAH emission, with detections peaking in the stellar effective temperature range 7000-11000 K (B9-A5). Silicate features appear in 50% of the sample and likewise diminish at higher temperatures. Additionally, we find that future PAH studies can focus on Herbig Ae/Be stars with a spectral index ($n_{2-24}$ > -1) and flared morphologies to maximize PAH detections. The 6.2 $\mu$m PAH band is the most frequently observed in our sample, shifting blueward with increasing stellar temperature, and this is the largest sample yet used to test that peak shift. The weaker 6.0 $\mu$m feature does not shift with 6.2 $\mu$m, implying a distinct origin of C=O (carbonyl) or olefinic C=C stretching relative to C--C vibrations. We examined the 11.0/11.2 $\mu$m PAH ratio using high-resolution Spitzer spectra for the first time in a sample of Herbig Ae/Be stars, finding a range of ionization conditions. This study provides a strong foundation for future JWST observations of intermediate-mass pre-main-sequence stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Computational astrochemical models are essential for helping us interpret and understand the observations of different astrophysical environments. In the age of high-resolution telescopes such as JWST and ALMA, the substructure of many objects can be resolved, raising the need for astrochemical modeling at these smaller scales, meaning that the simulations of these objects need to include both the physics and chemistry to accurately model the observations. The computational cost of the simulations coupling both the three-dimensional hydrodynamics and chemistry is enormous, creating an opportunity for surrogate models that can effectively substitute the chemical solver. In this work we present surrogate models that can replace the original chemical code, namely Latent Augmented Neural Ordinary Differential Equations. We train these surrogate architectures on three datasets of increasing physical complexity, with the last dataset derived directly from a three-dimensional simulation of a molecular cloud using a Photodissociation Region (PDR) code, 3D-PDR. We show that these surrogate models can provide speedup and reproduce the original observable column density maps of the dataset. This enables the rapid inference of the chemistry (on the GPU), allowing for the faster statistical inference of observations or increasing the resolution in hydrodynamical simulations of astrophysical environments.

 - **Abstract**
 The dense cores of Milky Way globular clusters (GCs) play host to a variety of dynamical encounters between stellar objects, which can accelerate stars to velocities high enough to escape the GC. The most extreme examples of these encounters are interactions between single GC stars and binaries including at least one compact object. These interactions can result in ejection velocities of up to several hundred $\mathrm{km \ s^{-1}}$, approaching or even exceeding the escape velocity of the Galaxy itself. In order to study whether these interactions contribute to the Galactic population of hypervelocity stars (stars moving faster than the Galactic escape speed), we combine Monte Carlo $N$-body GC simulations, observations of Galactic GCs, and a particle spray code to generate realistic populations of stars which have escaped from Milky Way GCs following star + compact object binary (S+COB) interactions. We find that over the last 500 Myr, S+COB interactions have likely ejected $\sim$6300 stars from Galactic GCs, of which $839_{-67}^{+70}$ have present-day velocities exceeding $500 \; \mathrm{km \ s^{-1}}$. Using mock photometric observations, we find that $290_{-23}^{+28}$ ejected stars are detectable in Gaia Data Release 3, however, only $1_{-1}^{+2}$ stars faster than $500 \; \mathrm{km \ s^{-1}}$ are detectable. Even so, we show that observational prospects in the upcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time are more optimistic, and future detected fast extratidal GC stars will serve as a useful probe of GC cores.

 - **Abstract**
 The stability of the heliopause, the tangential discontinuity separating the solar wind from the interstellar medium, is influenced by various processes, including the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. This study investigates the role of charge exchange collisions between protons and hydrogen (H) atoms in reduction of the Kelvin-Helmholtz growth rate at the heliopause. Using a two-dimensional gasdynamic model with the inclusion of H atoms, we perform numerical simulations of the plasma flow near the heliopause flanks. We conduct a parametric study by varying the Knudsen number. Our results indicate that charge exchange collisions play a crucial role in suppressing the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. As the Knudsen number decreases, the flow transitions from an unstable regime to a smoother state.

 - **Abstract**
 Diffuse Interstellar Bands (DIBs) are crucial tracers of the interstellar medium (ISM), yet their carriers remain poorly understood. While large-scale surveys have advanced DIB studies in cool stellar spectra, measurements in hot stellar spectra are still limited. Using 287 277 high signal-to-noise (S/N $>$ 50) hot stellar spectra from the tenth data release of the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope low-resolution spectroscopic survey (LAMOST LRS DR10), we systematically measured the three prominent optical DIBs at 5780, 5797, and 6614 Å. We published three catalogs containing 285 103, 279 195, and 281 146 valid measurements for the DIBs at 5780, 5797, and 6614 Å, respectively. Among them, 112 479, 25 232, and 71 048 are high-quality samples after rigorous quality control. To our knowledge, these are the largest hot-star DIB datasets in the northern sky. The catalogs provide spectral metadata, added astrometeric information, DIB profiles, and quality metrics. Our methodology and open-source pipeline ensure reproducibility, while the scale and precision of the data support future statistical studies. We anticipate that these catalogs will highlight the LAMOST's role in advancing DIB research and deepening our understanding of the ISM.

 - **Abstract**
 Very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) astrometry is used to determine the three-dimensional position and proper motion of astronomical objects. A typical VLBI astrometric campaign generally includes around ten observations, making it challenging to characterise systematic uncertainties. Our study on two bright pulsars, B0329+54 and B1133+16, involves analysis of broadband Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) data over $\sim30$ epochs (spanning approximately $3.5\, {\rm years}$). This extended dataset has significantly improved the precision of the astrometric estimates of these pulsars. Our broadband study suggests that, as expected, the primary contribution to systematic uncertainties in L-band VLBI astrometry originates from the ionosphere. We have also assessed the effectiveness of the modified TEC (total electron content) mapping function, which converts vertical TEC to slant TEC, in correcting ionospheric dispersive delays using global TEC maps. The parallax and proper motion obtained from the multiple data sets, calibrated using the traditional and the modified TEC mapping functions, are consistent. However, the reduced chi-square values from least-squares fitting and precision of the fitted astrometric parameters show no significant improvement, and hence, the effectiveness of the new TEC mapping function on astrometry is unclear. For B0329+54, the refined parallax estimate is $0.611^{+0.013}_{-0.013}\, {\rm mas}$, with best-fit proper motion of $\mu_{\alpha} = 16.960^{+0.011}_{-0.010}\, {\rm mas\, yr^{-1}}$ in R.A. and and $\mu_{\delta} = -10.382^{+0.022}_{-0.022}\, {\rm mas\, yr^{-1}}$ in Dec. For B1133+16, the new estimated parallax is $2.705^{+0.009}_{-0.009}\, {\rm mas}$, with proper motions of $\mu_{\alpha} = -73.777^{+0.008}_{-0.008}\, {\rm mas\, yr^{-1}}$ and $\mu_{\delta} = 366.573^{+0.019}_{-0.019}\, {\rm mas\, yr^{-1}}$.

 - **Abstract**
 Free-floating planetary mass objects-worlds that roam interstellar space untethered to a parent star-challenge conventional notions of planetary formation and migration, but also of star and brown dwarf formation. We focus on the multiplicity among free-floating planets. By virtue of their low binding energy (compared to other objects formed in these environments), these low-mass substellar binaries represent a most sensitive probe of the mechanisms at play during the star formation process. We use the Hubble Space Telescope and its Wide Field Camera 3 and the Very Large Telescope and its ERIS adaptive optics facility to search for visual companions among a sample of 77 objects members of the Upper Scorpius and Taurus young nearby associations with estimated masses in the range between approximately 5-33 M$_{\rm Jup}$. We report the discovery of one companion candidate around a Taurus member with a separation of 111.9$\pm$0.4 mas, or $\sim$18 au assuming a distance of 160pc, with an estimated primary mass in the range between 3-6 M$_{\rm Jup}$ and a secondary mass between 2.6-5.2 M$_{\rm Jup}$, depending on the assumed age. This corresponds to an overall binary fraction of 1.8$^{+2.6}_{-1.3}$% among free-floating planetary mass objects over the separation range $\ge$7 au. Despite the limitations of small-number statistics and variations in spatial resolution and sensitivity, our results, combined with previous high-spatial-resolution surveys, suggest a notable difference in the multiplicity properties of objects below $\sim$25 M$_{\rm Jup}$ between Upper Sco and Taurus. In Taurus, five companions were identified among 78 observed objects (4.9$^{+2.8}_{-2.0}$%), whereas none were found among 97 objects in Upper Sco ($\le$1.2%).}

 - **Abstract**
 Photometric data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission and radial velocities from the Gaia mission and ground-based observations were used to model the light curves and calculate the physical parameters of the eccentric eclipsing systems CH Ind, V577 Oph, CX Phe, and TIC 35481236. The components of these systems have temperatures between 6450 and 7500 K, masses between 1.4 and 1.85 solar masses, and radii between 1.49 and 3.05 solar radii. The residuals of these models were further analyzed using the Fourier method to reveal the pulsational frequencies of their oscillating components. Due to the similarity of the components of each system, the eclipses were used as spatial filters in order to determine which member is the pulsating star. CH Ind was found to pulsate in 46 frequencies; its primary component is a $\gamma$ Dor star and the secondary a $\delta$ Sct star. The primary component of V577 Oph oscillates in both the regimes of $\gamma$ Dor and $\delta$ Sct stars. Moreover, using past timings of minima, an eclipse timing variation analysis was also performed for V577 Oph, resulting in the calculation of the apsidal motion parameters and the existence of a third body around the system. Both components of CX Phe were found to be $\delta$ Sct stars; its primary has three independent frequencies in the range of 14.5-17.4 d$^{-1}$ and its secondary has two main modes of 5.19 and 7.22 d$^{-1}$. The analysis of TIC 35481236 indicates the hybrid $\delta$ Sct-$\gamma$ Dor nature of its secondary component. The physical and pulsational properties of the $\delta$ Sct stars of these systems were compared with those of other $\delta$ Sct stars-members of binaries in evolutionary diagrams.

 - **Abstract**
 XMM-Newton is a cornerstone mission of the European Space Agency (ESA) for X-ray astronomy, providing high-quality X-ray data for astrophysical research since the start of the century. Its Science Analysis System (SAS) has been a reliable data reduction and analysis software, evolving throughout the years to meet changing user needs, while incorporating new methods. This paper presents the XMM-SAS Datalab, a tool within the cloud-based ESA Datalabs platform, designed to enhance the interactivity and collaborative potential of SAS. By integrating SAS with a modern, Python-based JupyterLab interface, it enables shared analysis workspaces, removes the need for local software setup, and provides faster access through containerised environments and preconfigured libraries. Moving SAS to the cloud preserves a consistent software setup while eliminating installation complexities, saving time and effort. A case study of the X-ray binary Vela X-1 demonstrates that the Datalabs platform reliably replicates local SAS outputs, with minimal deviations attributed to calibration file versions. The XMM-SAS Datalab allows straightforward X-ray data analysis with collaborative process, setting the way for future adaptations in e-science platforms and multi-wavelength astronomy, while offering traceability and reproducibility of scientific results.

 - **Abstract**
 Helioseismology and solar modelling have enjoyed a golden era thanks to decades-long surveys from ground-based networks such as for example GONG, BiSON, IRIS and the SOHO and SDO space missions which have provided high-quality helioseismic observations that supplemented photometric, gravitational, size and shape, limb-darkening and spectroscopic constraints as well as measurements of neutrino fluxes. However, the success of solar models is also deeply rooted in progress in fundamental physics (equation of state of the solar plasma, high-quality atomic physics computations and opacities, description of convection and the role of macroscopic transport processes of angular momentum and chemicals, such as for example meridional circulation, internal gravity waves, shear-induced turbulence or even convection. In this paper, we briefly outline some key areas of research that deserve particular attention in solar modelling. We discuss the current uncertainties that need to be addressed, how these limit our predictions from solar models and their impact on stellar evolution in general. We outline potential strategies to mitigate them and how multidisciplinary approaches will be needed in the future to tackle them.

 - **Abstract**
 The turbulent ionized interstellar medium diffracts radio waves and makes them propagate in multiple paths. The pulse-broadening observed at low frequencies results from the scattering effect of interstellar clouds of ionized gas. During the Galactic Plane Pulsar Snapshot (GPPS) survey and other projects by using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST), we detect the pulse-broadening for 122 pulsars in the radio frequency band between 1.0 and 1.5 GHz, including 60 newly discovered pulsars in the GPPS survey and 62 previously known pulsars. We find that a more accurate dispersion measure can be obtained from aligning the front edge of the scattered subband pulses at the 1/4 or 1/2 peak level for most pulsars with one dominant component in the intrinsic profile, and the best DM values from aligning the intrinsic profile components from the model-fitting. From the pulse profiles at a few subbands we derive the pulse-broadening timescale and the scattering spectral index. These scattering parameters are measured for the first time for 93 pulsars. For 29 pulsars with previously detected scattering features, our measurements of the pulse-broadening timescale are consistent with results in the literature. We find that pulsars behind spiral arms show a stronger scattering effect due to greater density fluctuations in the arm regions. With a properly derived dispersion measure and careful calibration, we also present polarization profiles for 41 pulsars in three subbands of FAST observations.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a novel application of cosmological rescaling, or "remapping," to generate 21 cm intensity mapping mocks for different cosmologies. The remapping method allows for computationally efficient generation of N-body catalogs by rescaling existing simulations. In this work, we employ the remapping method to construct dark matter halo catalogs, starting from the Horizon Run 4 simulation with WMAP5 cosmology, and apply it to different target cosmologies, including WMAP7, Planck18 and Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) models. These catalogs are then used to simulate 21 cm intensity maps. We use the halo occupation distribution (HOD) method to populate halos with neutral hydrogen (HI) and derive 21 cm brightness temperature maps. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the remapping approach in generating cosmological simulations for large-scale structure studies, offering an alternative for testing observational data pipelines and performing cosmological parameter forecasts without the need for computationally expensive full N-body simulations. We also analyze the precision and limitations of the remapping, in light of the rescaling parameters $s$ and $s_m$, as well as the effects of the halo mass and box size thresholds.

 The heating of a molecular cloud by photons emitted by a primary black hole (PBH) located inside the cloud is considered. For graphite and silicate dust particles, the dependence of dust temperature on the distance from PBH is derived, along with the emission spectrum of dust particles. The obtained spectrum is compared with the sensitivity of the Millimetron Space Observatory for various values of concentration and size of dust particles and different PBH masses.

 - **Abstract**
 The value of the accretion luminosity during the early phases of star formation is a crucial information which helps us understand how stars form, yet it is still very difficult to obtain. We develop a new methodology to measure accretion luminosity using mid-infrared hydrogen recombination lines, and apply it to a limited sample of Class~I protostars in the Taurus and Ophiuchus star forming regions. We adopt the commonly used assumption that the properties of disk-protostar accretion in Class I objects is similar to the disk-star accretion in Class II objects. Using simultaneous observations of three hydrogen recombination lines Brg, Pfg, and Bra, we derive the mean intrinsic line ratios, and we verified that these are constant across the probed range of photospheric and accretion properties. We establish correlations between the line luminosities and accretion luminosity. We measure the extinction towards the line emission regions in Class I protostars comparing the observed line ratios to the Class II mean values. We then derive the Class I accretion luminosities from the established Class II correlations. We find that the accretion luminosity dominates the bolometric luminosity for the more embedded protostars, corresponding to lower values of the bolometric temperature. As the bolometric temperature increases above ~700K, there is a sharp drop of the contribution of the accretion from the bolometric luminosity. Our finding are in qualitative agreement with numerical simulations of star formation. We suggest that this methodology should be applied to larger and more statistically significant samples of Class I objects, for a more detailed comparison. Our results also suggest that by combining multiple infrared line ratios, it will be possible to derive a more detailed description of the dust extinction law in protostellar envelopes.

 - **Abstract**
 Planetary systems orbiting close binaries are valuable testing grounds for planet formation and migration models. More detections with good mass measurements are needed. We present a new planet discovered during the BEBOP survey for circumbinary exoplanets using radial velocities. We use data taken with the SOPHIE spectrograph at the Observatoire de Haute-Provence, and perform a spectroscopic analysis to obtain high precision radial velocities. This planet is the first radial velocity detection of a previously unknown circumbinary system. The planet has a mass of $0.56$ $M_{Jup}$ and orbits its host binary in 550 days with an eccentricity of 0.25. Compared to most of the previously known circumbinary planets, BEBOP-3b has a long period (relative to the binary) and a high eccentricity. There also is a candidate outer planet with a $\sim1400$ day orbital period. We test the stability of potential further candidate signals inside the orbit of BEBOP-3b, and demonstrate that there are stable orbital solutions for planets near the instability region which is where the Kepler circumbinary planets are located. We also use our data to obtain independent dynamical masses for the two stellar components of the eclipsing binary using High Resolution Cross-Correlation Spectroscopy (HRCCS), and compare those results to a more traditional approach, finding them compatible with one another.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper describes the second and third data releases (DR2 and DR3, respectively) from the ongoing United Kingdom Infrared Telescope (UKIRT) Hemisphere Survey (UHS). DR2 is primarily comprised of the $K$-band portion of the UHS survey, and was released to the public on June 1, 2023. DR3 mainly includes the $H$-band portion of the survey, with a public release scheduled for September 2025. The $H$- and $K$-band data releases complement the previous $J$-band data release (DR1) from 2018. The survey covers approximately 12,700 square degrees between declinations of 0 degrees and $+$60 degrees and achieves median 5$\sigma$ point source sensitivities of 19.0 mag and 18.0 mag (Vega) for $H$ and $K$, respectively. The data releases include images and source catalogs which include $\sim$581 million $H$-band detections and $\sim$461 million $K$-band detections. DR2 and DR3 also include merged catalogs, created by combining $J$- and $K$-band detections (DR2) and $J$-, $H$-, and $K$-band detections (DR3). The DR2 merged catalog has a total of $\sim$513 million sources, while the DR3 merged catalog contains $\sim$560 million sources.

 - **Abstract**
 Hot solar coronal loops, such as flaring loops, reach temperatures where the thermal transport becomes non-local. This occurs when the mean-free-path of electrons can no longer be assumed to be small. Using a modified version of the Lare2d code, we study the evolution of flare-heated coronal loops under three thermal transport models: classical Spitzer-Harm (SH), a flux-limited local model (FL), and the non-local Schurtz-Nicolai-Basquet (SNB) model. The SNB model is used extensively in laser-plasma studies. It has been benchmarked against accurate non-local Vlasov-Fokker-Planck models and proven to be the most accurate non-local model which can be applied on fluid time-scales. Analysis of the density-temperature evolution cycles near the loop apex reveals a distinct evolutionary path for the SNB model, with higher temperatures and lower densities than local models. During energy deposition, the SNB model produces a more localised and intense temperature peak at the apex due to heat flux suppression, which also reduces chromospheric evaporation and results in lower post-flare densities. EUV emission synthesis shows that the SNB model yields flare light curves with lower peak amplitudes and smoother decay phases. We also find that non-local transport affects equilibrium loop conditions, producing hotter and more rarefied apexes. These findings emphasise the need to account for non-local conduction in dynamic solar phenomena and highlight the potential of the SNB model for improving the realism of flare simulations. Flux-limited conduction models cannot reproduce the results of non-local transport covered by the SNB model.

 - **Abstract**
 The ESA/NASA Rosalind Franklin rover, planned for launch in 2028, will carry the first laser desorption ionization mass spectrometer (LDI-MS) to Mars as part of the Mars Organic Molecule Analyzer (MOMA) instrument. MOMA will contribute to the astrobiology goals of the mission through the analysis of potential organic biosignatures. Due to the minimal availability of comparable equipment, laboratory analyses using similar techniques and instrumentation have been limited. In this study, we present a modified commercial benchtop LDI-MS designed to replicate MOMA functionality and to enable rapid testing of samples for MOMA validation experiments. We demonstrate that our instrument can detect organic standards in mineral matrices, with MS/MS enabling structural identification even in complex mixtures. Performance was additionally validated against an existing LDI-MS prototype through the comparison of spectra derived from natural samples from a Mars analog site in the Atacama Desert. Lastly, analysis of Mars analog synthetic mineral mixes highlights the capacity of the instrument to characterize both the mineralogical and organic signals in mission-relevant samples. This modified benchtop instrument will serve as a platform for collaborative research to prepare for MOMA operations, test LDI parameters, and generate pre-flight reference data in support of the mission science and astrobiology specific goals.

 SETI@home is a radio Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) project, looking for technosignatures in data recorded at multiple observatories from 1998 to 2020. Most radio SETI projects analyze data using dedicated processing hardware. SETI@home uses a different approach: time-domain data is distributed over the Internet to $\gt 10^{5}$ volunteered home computers, which analyze it. The large amount of computing power this affords ($\sim 10^{15}$ floating-point operations per second (FPOP/s)) allows us to increase the sensitivity and generality of our search in three ways. We use coherent integration, a technique in which data is transformed so that the power of drifting signals is confined to a single discrete Fourier transform (DFT) bin. We perform this coherent search over 123 000 Doppler drift rates in the range ($\pm$100 Hz s$^{-1}$). Second, we search for a variety of signal types, such as pulsed signals and arbitrary repeated waveforms. The analysis uses a range of DFT sizes, with frequency resolutions ranging from 0.075 Hz to 1221 Hz. The front end of SETI@home produces a set of detections that exceed thresholds in power and goodness of fit. We accumulated $\sim 1.2\times 10^{10}$ such detections. The back end of SETI@home takes these detections, identifies and removes radio frequency interference (RFI), and looks for groups of detections that are consistent with extraterrestrial origin and that persist over long timescales. This paper describes the front end of SETI@home and provides parameters for the primary data source, the Arecibo Observatory; the back end and its results are described in a companion paper.

 - **Abstract**
 SETI@home is a radio Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) project that looks for technosignatures in data recorded at the Arecibo Observatory. The data were collected over a period of 14 years and cover almost the entire sky visible to the telescope. The first stage of data analysis found billions of detections: brief excesses of continuous or pulsed narrowband power. The second stage removed detections that were likely radio frequency interference (RFI), then identified and ranked signal candidates: groups of detections, possibly spread over the 14 years, that plausibly originate from a single cosmic source. We manually examined the top-ranking signal candidates and selected a few hundred. In the third and final stage we are reobserving the corresponding sky locations and frequency ranges using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST) radio telescope. This paper covers SETI@home's second stage of data analysis. We describe the algorithms used to remove RFI and to identify and rank signal candidates. To guide the development of these algorithms, we used artificial candidate birdies that model persistent ET signals with a range of power, bandwidth, and planetary motion parameters. This approach also allowed us to estimate the sensitivity of our detection system to these signals.

 - **Abstract**
 For many fundamental physics applications, transformers, as the state of the art in learning complex correlations, benefit from pretraining on quasi-out-of-domain data. The obvious question is whether we can exploit Large Language Models, requiring proper out-of-domain transfer learning. We show how the Qwen2.5 LLM can be used to analyze and generate SKA data, specifically 3D maps of the cosmological large-scale structure for a large part of the observable Universe. We combine the LLM with connector networks and show, for cosmological parameter regression and lightcone generation, that this Lightcone LLM (L3M) with Qwen2.5 weights outperforms standard initialization and compares favorably with dedicated networks of matching size.

- **Abstract**
 Observations of massive star-forming regions show that classical stellar wind models over-predict the luminosity of the X-ray emitting gas, indicating a significant fraction of wind energy is lost. In this paper, we present a multi-wavelength analysis of the giant HII region 30 Doradus and its central star cluster R136 using 2 Ms of Chandra X-ray Observatory data, combined with James Webb Space Telescope and Hubble Space Telescope imaging and Spitzer spectral-energy distributions, to investigate how the hot gas energy is lost through turbulent mixing, radiative cooling, and physical leakage. We compare the spatial and spectral properties of the hot gas with those of the warm ionized gas and dust. We find no significant correlation between the dust and hot gas temperatures, suggesting they are not directly coupled and that the dust resides in the swept-up shells where it is heated radiatively. H$\alpha$ and X-ray surface brightness profiles show that the X-rays peak interior to the H$\alpha$ shells, demonstrating partial confinement of the hot gas. The fragmented shell structure and bright X-ray interior that declines near the H$\alpha$ shell reflect efficient cooling from turbulent mixing at the hot-cold interface. We compare against recent simulations of stellar-feedback driven bubbles which have broad agreement with the morphology of the X-ray and H$\alpha$ emission, but the simulations produce a dip in the interior X-ray surface brightness and a lack of hard X-rays compared to the observations. These differences may suggest thermal conduction is important as mass-loading of the hot bubble could reproduce the X-ray observables.

- **Abstract**
 We present high-angular-resolution imaging of the asymptotic giant branch star W Hya with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) to probe the dynamics and chemistry in the atmosphere and inner wind. W Hya was observed with the longest baselines of ALMA at 250-268 GHz with an angular resolution of ~17x20 mas. ALMA's high angular resolution allowed us to resolve the stellar disk of W Hya, along with clumpy, irregularly shaped emission extending to ~100 mas: plume in the north-northwest, a tail in the south-southwest, and the extended atmosphere elongated in the east-northeast--west-southwest direction, with semimajor and semiminor axes of ~70 and 40 mas (~3.4 and 1.9 Rstar), respectively. We identified 57 lines, which include SiO, H2O, SO2, SO, HCN, AlO, AlOH, TiO, TiO2, OH, and some of their isotopologues. The molecular line images show spatially inhomogeneous molecular formation. Our ALMA data taken at phase 0.53 (minimum light) indicate global, accelerating infall within ~75 mas (3.6 Rstar) but also outflow at up to ~10 km/s in deeper layers. While 38 of the detected lines appear in absorption against the continuum stellar disk as expected, we detect nonthermal emission on top of the continuum over the stellar disk in 19 lines of SiO, H2O, SO2, and AlO. The emission of SiO, AlO, TiO, TiO2, SO, and SO2 coincides well with the clumpy dust cloud distribution obtained from contemporaneous visible polarimetric imaging in addition to H2O reported in our previous work. This lends support to the idea that SiO, H2O, and AlO are directly involved in grain nucleation. The overlap of SO/SO2 (possibly also TiO/TiO2) with the dust clouds suggests the formation of these molecules and dust behind shocks induced by pulsation and/or convection. We detect HCN emission close to the star, down to ~30 mas (~1.4 Rstar), which is consistent with shock-induced chemistry.

- **Abstract**
 We modeled the trajectories of material ejected from 20 nearby debris disk stars, including Epsilon Eridani (Ran), Vega, Fomalhaut, and Beta Pictoris, within a simulated Milky Way potential in order to quantify their contribution to the population of interstellar material entering the solar system. Our simulations show that material from each of these 20 systems is currently to be expected within our planetary system. We calculate expected fluxes of both macroscopic interstellar objects (ISOs, $\geq100~$m), which could be detected by telescopic surveys, and smaller meteoroids ($\geq200~$microns), which could manifest as meteors in Earth's atmosphere. We estimate that the ISO population originating from these debris disks and currently within the inner solar system is on the order of ~2, only a fraction of the expected total ISO population but nonetheless likely to be discovered by Rubin. Meteors in Earth's atmosphere from these systems are expected as well, but current methods, both radar and video, might require decades to collect even a single event. Our sample is found to be rich in relatively low excess velocity particles compared to the broader expected ISO population, which might make them harder to distinguish observationally from bound objects in some cases. These results provide a framework for linking detections of interstellar material to their astrophysical origins, offering new opportunities to probe the composition and dynamical history of nearby planetary systems.

- **Abstract**
 The system $\kappa$ Tuc A is part of a hierarchical-quintuple system and is a prime target for studies of hot-exozodiacal dust, because a time-variable near-infrared excess has been detected. We observed the system with the Multi Aperture mid-Infrared Spectroscopic Experiment (MATISSE) and GRAVITY at the Very Large Telescope Interferometer, and detected the stellar companion to the primary $\kappa$ Tuc Aa that was previously inferred by astrometry, $\kappa$ Tuc Ab. Its $L$-band flux ratio to the primary is 1.32% and its signature in the MATISSE closure phases is mostly smaller than +/- 2°, which makes $\kappa$ Tuc Ab the highest-contrast companion ever detected with MATISSE closure phases. We verified with GRAVITY that relative astrometry with milliarcsecond precision can be retrieved from MATISSE closure phases. Using multiple epochs of observations, we obtain a full orbital solution for $\kappa$ Tuc Ab. Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.94 and a semi-major axis of 4.8au. The orbit of $\kappa$ Tuc Ab and the orbit of the wider separation companion $\kappa$ Tuc B are mutually inclined. Based on the measured flux ratio of $\kappa$ Tuc Ab to Aa and their dynamical mass, we estimate the spectral type of $\kappa$ Tuc Ab to be M3.5V to M4.5V. While the then unknown star $\kappa$ Tuc Ab might have caused the putative detection of hot-exozodiacal dust around $\kappa$ Tuc Aa in 2012 and 2014, this cannot be for the detection in 2019, giving rise to an intriguing system architecture. This motivates studies investigating the interplay of the low-mass star on an eccentric orbit, the hot-exozodiacal dust, and a possible planetesimal reservoir.

- **Abstract**
 We present new Chandra observations of seven luminous quasars at $z>6.5$. Combined with archival Chandra observations of all other known quasars, they form nearly complete X-ray observations of all currently known $z\sim7$ quasars with $M_{1450}<-26.5$, except for J0313$-$1806 at $z=7.642$ and J0910$-$0414 at $z=6.636$. Together with existing ground-based NIR spectroscopy and ALMA observations, we investigate the correlations between X-ray emission (the X-ray luminosity $L_{\rm X}$ and the optical/UV-to-X-ray spectral slope $\alpha_{\rm OX}$) and various quasar properties (rest-UV luminosity $L_{\mathrm{2500\ \mathring{A}}}$, bolometric luminosity $L_{\rm bol}$, C IV blueshift, and infrared luminosity $L_{\rm IR}$). We find most $z>6.5$ quasars follow a similar $\alpha_{\rm OX}-L_{\mathrm{2500\ \mathring{A}}}$ relation as $z\sim1-6$ quasars, but also display a large scatter. We find a potential correlation between $\alpha_{\rm OX}$ and the C IV blueshift, suggesting a soft optical/UV-to-X-ray SED shape is frequently associated with fast disk winds. Furthermore, we analyze the X-ray spectrum of 11 quasars at $z>6.5$ with Chandra detection, and find the best-fit photon index $\Gamma$ is $2.41\pm0.27$, which is likely driven by high accretion rates of $z>6.5$ quasars. In addition, we find there are no significant correlations between either $L_{\rm X}$ and $L_{\rm IR}$, nor $L_{\rm bol}$ and $L_{\rm IR}$, suggesting no strong correlations between quasar luminosity and star formation luminosity for the most luminous quasars at $z>6.5$.

- **Abstract**
 We present an analysis of the radio quiescent data from a multiwavelength campaign of the active M-dwarf flare star AU Mic (dM1e) that occurred in October 2018. Using Ku-band data (12 to 18 GHz) from the Very Large Array and K-band data (17 to 25 GHz) from the Australia Telescope Compact Array, we find that the quiescent spectrum can be decomposed into two components: one falling with frequency and one that remains flat. The flat component has a relatively steady flux density of 0.64 $\pm$ 0.14 mJy. The falling component varies in strength, but exhibits a spectral index of $\alpha$ = $-0.88 \pm 0.10$. The falling component is thus consistent with nonthermal, optically thin gyrosynchrotron radiation with a corresponding power-law index similar to flares from AU Mic. While a flat component may arise from thermal, optically thin free-free emission, the observed flux density and inferred mass-loss rate are both too large compared to previous stellar wind and X-ray emission theory and models, necessitating an alternative explanation. This flat component instead matches well with an optically thick gyroresonance component integrated over multiple source regions such that the composite spectra are reasonably flat. The persistence of these components across the rotational period suggests multiple source regions, which may help explain changes in flux density and persistent high-energy electrons.

- **Abstract**
 The Sun exhibits an 11-year cyclic variation, maintained by dynamo action in the solar interior. Mean-field flux transport dynamo models have successfully reproduced most of the features observed in solar cycles, while the model includes many free parameters, such as the speed of the meridional flow and the amplitude of the poloidal field generation. Inferring these free parameters is on demand because they correspond to the solar interior condition. We suggest a novel method for inferring the free parameters using a genetic algorithm. At each generation, we evaluate the fitness of our simulation against the observational data and optimize the parameters. We apply our method to the observed solar cycle data from 1723 to 2024 and successfully reproduce the observations from both qualitative and quantitative perspectives. We expect our method to be applicable to sunspot numbers, even those obtained from isotope data and historical documents, in the future, to better understand past solar interior dynamics.

          Dynamical and Photometric Analysis of NGC 146 and King 14: Evidence for a Co-Moving, Unbound Cluster Pair

- **Abstract**
 To understand the nature of the NGC 146-King 14 cluster pair, we conducted a detailed photometric, astrometric, and dynamical study using multiwavelength data from Gaia DR3, Pan-STARRS1, WISE, and TESS. Using a probabilistic approach, we identified 770 and 690 high-probability members of NGC 146 and King 14, respectively. Both clusters exhibit well-defined radial density profiles consistent with King models. We estimate the cluster ages as 20 $\pm$ 5 Myr and 50 $\pm$ 10 Myr from isochrone fitting, and distances of 2.98 $\pm$ 0.33 kpc and 2.51 $\pm$ 0.23 kpc from parallaxes after applying the Bailer-Jones criteria. The clusters show consistent mean proper motions. The mass function slopes (1.51 $\pm$ 0.18 and 1.50 $\pm$ 0.15) are close to the Salpeter value, and the extinction follows a normal Galactic reddening law (RV ~ 3.1). Three-dimensional mapping gives a projected separation of ~ 9 pc. Orbit integration using the galpy MWPotential2014 model shows that NGC 146 and King 14 move in nearly circular, disk-like orbits with similar mean orbital radii (Rm ~ 9 kpc) and orbital periods of roughly 255 Myr. A dynamical separation of ~ 32 pc indicates that both clusters share a common spatial and kinematic association, consistent with a co-moving pair. However, their relative velocity exceeds the escape velocity set by their combined mass, indicating they are not gravitationally bound. TESS light curves reveal seven variable stars, including $\gamma$ Doradus, SPB stars, and eclipsing binaries, though only one is a likely member. Overall, the clusters likely formed within the same giant molecular cloud and now exist as an unbound co-moving pair.

          Modeling of Rayleigh Scattering and Interstellar Polarization for Evolved Late-Type Stars

- **Abstract**
 Evolved late-type stars are frequently identified as photometric and spectroscopic variables, such as Mira-type or semi-regular variable objects. These stars can also be polarimetrically variable, an indicator of non-spherical geometry for spatially unresolved sources. Departures from symmetry can arise in a number of ways, such as the presence of a binary companion (e.g., multiple illumination sources for scattered light), brightness variations in the stellar atmosphere (e.g., large convective cells), or aspherical circumstellar envelopes (e.g., disks or aspherical stellar winds). Common polarigenic opacities for cool stars include Rayleigh scattering and dust scattering. The classic wavelength dependence of lambda^-4 for Rayleigh single scattering is generally straightforward; however, that signature can be confounded by interstellar polarization (ISP). We explore strategies for interpreting polarimetric observations when the interstellar polarization (ISP) cannot be removed. We introduce a "hybrid" spectrum that includes both Rayleigh polarization for a stellar contribution and the Serkowski Law for an interstellar contribution. We find the polarization spectral slope can be more shallow than expected from Rayleigh scattering alone. For stellar variability, shorter wavelengths give higher amplitude changes when Rayleigh scattering dominates the interstellar signal. Quite anomalous slopes can occur over limited wavelength intervals if the stellar and interstellar position angles differ by 90 deg. Results of the models are discussed in the context of photopolarimetry methods, and an application is considered in terms of variable polarization from the carbon star, R Scl.

- **Abstract**
 Context. TT Arietis (TT Ari) is a nova-like cataclysmic variable of the VY Scl subtype with light-curve variations on multiple timescales. In addition to the superhump modulation, quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) have been found. Aims. Our aim is to determine the occurrence, strength, and variability of QPOs in TT Ari based on more complete data than in previous works. Methods. The data were obtained during the high state of TT Ari in October 2012 by the MOST space telescope, covering a total of 361.2 hours of continuous observation. We searched for frequencies over subsets of time using a Fourier-like power spectrum and then added the frequencies together, forming groups. Results. Our method has revealed QPOs that occur in "frequency groups", which are events with a continuous oscillation of similar, constant or slowly variable frequency. We report a total of 160 frequency groups in the period range between 14 and 53 minutes (27 and 98 days-1), with two peaks in the power spectrum at 18.5 and 33.8 minutes (42.5 and 77.5 days-1). The duration of these frequency groups varies between 0.72 and 7.5 hours (average 2.8 hours) revealing between 3 and 18 complete cycles in the light curve. Most of them show significant frequency variations over the course of their duration. Sometimes two frequency groups occur simultaneously. An analysis with randomised data confirms that stochastic processes can only explain a fraction of the QPOs found. The occurrence of QPOs appears not to be related to the superhump phase.

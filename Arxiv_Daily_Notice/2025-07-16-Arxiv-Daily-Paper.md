 - **Abstract**
 This note complements the article on X-ray and infrared variability of the X-ray binary Cyg X-3 (WR+c), published by me and my co-authors (ApJ, v.926, p. 123, 2022). In that paper, a compact IR source was discovered in the system, located in the vicinity of the X-ray source associated with the relativistic companion. In the current note I refine the possible location of the IR source based on simple qualitative considerations.

 - **Abstract**
 Merger trees track the hierarchical assembly of dark matter halos across cosmic time and serve as essential inputs for semi-analytic models of galaxy formation. However, conventional methods for constructing merger trees rely on ad-hoc assumptions and are unable to incorporate environmental information. Nguyen et al. (2024) introduced FLORAH, a generative model based on recurrent neural networks and normalizing flows, for modeling main progenitor branches of merger trees. In this work, we extend this model, now referred to as FLORAH-Tree, to generate complete merger trees by representing them as graph structures that capture the full branching hierarchy. We trained FLORAH-Tree on merger trees extracted from the Very Small MultiDark Planck cosmological N-body simulation. To validate our approach, we compared the generated merger trees with both the original simulation data and with semi-analytic trees produced using the Extended Press-Schechter (EPS) formalism. We show that FLORAH-Tree accurately reproduces key merger rate statistics across a wide range of mass and redshift, outperforming the conventional EPS-based approach. We demonstrate its utility by applying the Santa Cruz semi-analytic model (SAM) to generated trees and showing that the resulting galaxy-halo scaling relations, such as the stellar-to-halo-mass relation and supermassive black hole mass-halo mass relation, closely match those from applying the SAM to trees extracted directly from the simulation. FLORAH-Tree provides a computationally efficient method for generating merger trees that maintain the statistical fidelity of N-body simulations.

          Breaking the Mass Inclination Degeneracy of Radial Velocity Measurements via Monitoring von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai Cycles: Implications in the HD 41004 System

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the dynamical stability of the S-type planet in the compact binary HD 41004. Using $N$-body simulations, we find that the planet could be dynamically stable at a mutual angle inclination up to $\sim75^\circ$. The von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai (vZLK) mechanism becomes active when the mutual inclination is greater than 39.2$^\circ$. High-inclination orbits exhibit coupled oscillations in eccentricity and inclination, along with apsidal precession. Synthetic radial velocity (RV) modeling shows that these secular variations produce measurable signatures across a broad range of timescales, from full vZLK cycles to observationally accessible decades. For instance, a high mutual inclination at 75$^\circ$ can induce RV drifts exceeding 5 m s$^{-1}$ per planetary orbit ($\sim 1.9 \,\text{m s}^{-1}\, \text{yr}^{-1}$) in circular binary configurations. The presence of eccentric vZLK further accelerates these drifts, enhancing the detectability. Long-term RV observations of this system offer a unique pathway to dynamically constrain the orbital inclination, and thus determine the true mass of HD 41004 Ab. The degeneracy of mass-inclination is well known when using RV measurements alone. Our results highlight that HD 41004Ab and potentially other S-type planets in compact binaries are promising targets for breaking such a degeneracy by studying the dynamics induced by the vZLK mechanism through long-term high-precision RV monitoring.

          WISDOM Project -- XXV. Improving the CO-dynamical supermassive black hole mass measurement in the galaxy NGC 1574 using high spatial resolution ALMA observations

 - **Abstract**
 We present a molecular gas dynamical supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass measurement in the nearby barred lenticular galaxy NGC 1574, using Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array observations of the $^{12}$CO(2-1) emission line with synthesised beam full-widths at half-maximum of $0.''078\times0.''070$ ($\approx7.5\times6.7$ pc$^2$). The observations are the first to spatially resolve the SMBH's sphere of influence (SoI), resulting in an unambiguous detection of the Keplerian velocity increase due to the SMBH towards the centre of the gas disc. We also detect a previously known large-scale kinematic twist of the CO velocity map, due to a position angle (PA) warp and possible mild non-circular motions, and we resolve a PA warp within the central $0.''2\times0.''2$ of the galaxy, larger than that inferred from previous intermediate-resolution data. By forward modelling the data cube, we infer a SMBH mass of $(6.2\pm1.2)\times10^7$ M$_\odot$ ($1\sigma$ confidence interval), slightly smaller than but statistically consistent with the SMBH mass derived from the previous intermediate-resolution data that did not resolve the SoI, and slightly outside the $1\sigma$ scatter of the SMBH mass -- stellar velocity dispersion relation. Our measurement thus emphasises the importance of observations that spatially resolve the SMBH SoI for accurate SMBH mass measurements and gas dynamical modelling.

          A Simulation Based Inference Approach to the Dynamics of the MW-LMC System -- Validation

 - **Abstract**
 The infall of the LMC into the Milky Way (MW) has generated dynamical disequilibrium throughout the MW. The interaction has displaced the MW's centre of mass, manifesting as an apparent 'reflex motion' in velocities of outer halo stars. Often, expensive high fidelity MW--LMC simulations are required to model these effects, though the range of model parameter spaces can be large and complex. We investigate the ability of lower fidelity, rigid MW-LMC simulations to reliably infer the model parameters of higher fidelity N-body and hydrodynamical cosmological zoom-in MW--LMC simulations using a Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) approach. We produce and release a set of 128,000 MW--LMC rigid potentials, with stellar haloes evolved to present-day, each adopting a unique combination of model parameters including the MW mass, the LMC mass and the dynamical friction strength. For these simulation parameters, we use SBI to find their posterior distributions. We find that our SBI framework trained on rigid MW--LMC simulations is able to correctly infer the true simulation LMC mass within a $1\sigma$ confidence interval from both N-body and cosmological simulations when knowledge of the induced MW reflex motion is provided as data. This motivates future applications of the presented SBI framework to observational data, which will help constrain both MW and LMC properties, as well as the dynamics of the MW's reflex motion.

          Nonlinear Evolution of the Unstratified Polydisperse Dust Settling Instability

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The Dust Settling Instabilty (DSI) is a member of the Resonant Drag Instabilities (RDI) family, and is thus related to the Streaming Instability (SI). Linear calculations found that the unstratified monodisperse DSI has growth rates much higher than the SI even with lower initial dust to gas ratios. However, recent nonlinear investigation found no evidence of strong dust clumping at the saturation level. Aims. To investigate the nonlinear saturation of the mono- and polydisperse DSI. We examine the convergence behaviour wrt. both the numerical resolution and the number of species. By characterising the morphology of the dust evolution triggered by the DSI, we can shed more light on its role in planetesimal formation. Methods. We perform a suite of 2D shearing box hydro simulations with the code Idefix, both in the mono- and polydisperse regimes. We focus on the time evolution of the maximum dust density, noting the time at which the instability is triggered, as well as analyse the morphology of the resultant structure. Results. In our monodisperse simulations, the maximum dust density increases and the instability saturates earlier with higher spatial resolution, with no signs of convergence. The polydisperse simulations do seem to converge with the number of species and produce maximum dust densities that are comparable to, albeit lower than, the monodisperse simulations. Different dust species tend to form adjacent but separate dust filaments, which may have implications on dust growth and further clumping. Conclusions. The monodisperse DSI produces dust structure at densities high enough that likely leads to clumping. The polydisperse DSI produces lower but comparable dust densities. Our idealised treatment suggests that the DSI is important for planetesimal formation, as it suffers less than the SI from including a dust size distribution.

 - **Abstract**
 Being one of the most populated mean motion resonances (MMR) with Neptune and lying close to the inner boundary of the present day cold classical disk, observations of the orbital and surface class distributions of the plutinos in the 3:2 MMR provide constraints on Neptune's migration and insight into the compositional structure of the pre-migration planetesimal disk. Here, we present observations of the surface reflectance of 43 small to mid-size (H_V >~ 5) transneptunian objects (TNOs) through the grz wavelength range, 14 of which are plutinos. We classify the surfaces of these TNOs using the two-surface class model (FaintIR and BrightIR surface classes) proposed by Fraser and collaborators, where the FaintIR surface class is dominated by cold classicals. Incorporating similar observations of plutinos from the literature for a total sample size of 43 plutinos, we find that the osculating inclination distributions (i_osc) of the FaintIR and BrightIR plutinos are statistically distinguishable at 99.3% significance, where (6/7) of the plutinos with i_osc > 4.5° have FaintIR surfaces. This is most easily explained if the FaintIR and BrightIR planetesimals were radially partitioned in the primordial planetesimal disk before being captured into the 3:2 resonance. While this could be evidence that the primordial cold classical disk with FaintIR surfaces was broader in the past by ~3 au in the sunward direction, we cannot rule out the alternative explanation that these FaintIR plutinos were scattered from the ~42.5-48 au region from the Sun and captured into the 3:2 resonance.

 - **Abstract**
 The Pierre Auger Observatory has been operating in Malargue, Province of Mendoza, western Argentina, for over two decades, significantly advancing our understanding of cosmic rays. Beyond its scientific mission, the installation and operation of the Observatory has had profound social, economic, educational and cultural impact on the local community, the region and worldwide. More than 90 percent of the Observatory's annual operational budget is invested in the region, benefiting sectors such as tourism, hospitality, gastronomy, and local commerce. Additionally, the presence of international visitors and collaborations has fostered a rich cultural exchange. Malargue has emerged as a destination for scientific tourism, with the Observatory as a major attraction, having welcomed over 178,000 visitors since its inauguration and boosting the development of the region. This article explores the broad direct and indirect benefits of the Auger Observatory and the key lessons learned from this endeavor. A new International Agreement signed in 2024 ensures the continuity of the project for at least another decade, until 2035, reaffirming its scientific, economic, and social relevance.

 - **Abstract**
 The LHAASO observatory has recently measured details of the cosmic-ray (CR) spectrum in the knee region (1 -- 10 PeV) with unprecedented precision, including its average CR mass composition and the spectrum of the proton component. We use these precision measurements, combined with direct measurements of CRs by space-based detectors, to derive predictions for the spectrum of diffuse gamma-ray and neutrino emission from the interstellar medium under the assumption that the CR spectrum is universal throughout the Milky Way. We compare these predictions with the Fermi-LAT and LHAASO measurements of the diffuse gamma-ray flux from inner and outer Galactic Plane regions and with estimates of the neutrino flux based on the IceCube data for the same Galactic Plane regions. We notice that the model predictions exceed LHAASO gamma-ray measurements at energies above 100 TeV. This excess can be interpreted within a CR knee model assuming a "local PeV CR bubble''. Within this model, we infer the extension of the local PeV CR bubble of 1.5 +/- 0.3 kpc in the direction of the inner Galaxy and of 0.7+/-0.3 kpc toward the outer Galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent studies suggest that the angular momentum evolution of late-M and brown dwarfs differs from the well-known spin-down evolution of hotter stars. Characterizing the distribution of rotation periods of these objects in the solar neighborhood can help elucidate this evolutionary pathway just above, at, and below the hydrogen burning limit. In this paper, we examine 399 candidate single late-M dwarfs with $G - G_{RP} \geq 1.4$ mag ($\gtrsim$M6) using TESS light curves. To determine rotation periods, we employed Lomb-Scargle Periodograms to provide a first estimate of the period, then refined them with a Gaussian Process approach, requiring multi-sector confirmation when available. We found 133 rotation periods, ranging from 2 hours to 6 days, and amplitudes between 0.08% and 2.71%. We find that the observed variability fraction in late-M dwarfs rises with the number of available TESS sectors, approaching an apparent ceiling of ~50%. This likely reflects a detection limit determined by viewing geometry and supports the idea that spot-induced variability is common across the late-M and brown dwarf population. In our comparison with previously published late-M dwarf rotation periods reported, we found consistent results, confirming or updating 31 periods. Our findings expand the number of previously known late-M dwarf periods under 1 day by 76%. Combined with published rotation periods for a broader range of spectral types, we find a lower envelope on the rotation period decreasing from 5 hours at early-M dwarfs to 1 hour at L, T, and Y dwarfs.

 The study of integrating photonic devices into astronomical instruments is the primary focus of astrophotonics. The growth in this area of study is relatively recent. Research related to astronomical spectroscopic phenomena has received a lot of attention in recent times. There are several important advantages to integrating photonics technology into an astronomical instrument, such as cost savings because of increased reproducibility, thermal and mechanical stability, and miniaturization. This paper provides a brief review of recent advances in astrophotonics.

 - **Abstract**
 The origins of ultra-high-energy particles remain one of the most profound mysteries in astrophysics. If nearby transient sources of ultra-high-energy particles exist, we might expect correlated emission of neutrinos and photons, arriving in close temporal and spatial coincidence. The IceCube Neutrino Observatory, located at the South Pole, is sensitive to neutrinos from TeV to EeV energies, while the Pierre Auger Observatory, in Argentina, detects cosmic rays and has the capability of observing ultra-high-energy photons using surface and fluorescence detectors. The ultra-high-energy photon candidates reported by the Auger Collaboration, though consistent with cosmic ray backgrounds, provide a compelling opportunity to search for correlated neutrino-photon events. In this contribution, we present the framework to search for ultra-high-energy transients by combining multi-flavour neutrino data from IceCube with photon candidates from the Auger Detector from 2011 to 2017. We will report the sensitivities that we expect to achieve from the search and the astrophysical implications of the possible outcomes.

          Determination of absorption by Q-method for JHK photometry in embedded clusters

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper we describe the absorption determination by the Q-method for 2MASS photometry ($J$, $H$ and $K_S$ bands). Using the Pleiades and Praesepe stars, we determine the zero-reddening sequence for different values of the color excess ratios $E(J-H)/E(H-K_S)$. In this paper we consider a sequence consisting of two segments, that leads to an uncertainty in the determining of absorption - one value of the Q parameter corresponds to two values of the non-reddened color index. We propose a method to select a segment of the zero-reddening sequence for the main sequence stars of the cluster. The method is based on the difference in the position of stars of different segments in the cluster luminosity function. To test the proposed method, we simulate the luminosity functions of clusters with the non-uniform absorption distribution in the cluster region. With the typical absorption values in embedded clusters, about 10 % of stars are erroneously assigned, but in some cases this fraction can reach 20 %. Thus, despite the fact that irregular absorption distorts the distribution of stars of different segments on the cluster luminosity function, our method allows to separate stars with an error of no more than 20 %.

 - **Abstract**
 PG 1553+113 is a high-frequency peaked BL Lac object (HBL), with redshift 0.433, detected with the current generation of IACTs (Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes) up to $\sim$ 1 TeV. Interestingly, the continuous $\gamma$-ray lightcurve collected by Fermi-LAT since 2008 showed a signature of a periodic modulation of $2.18 \pm 0.08$ years at energies above 100 MeV and 1 GeV. In addition, the source shows clear variabiliy down to day-scale in all bands. XMM-Newton data recently showed rapid variability in the X-ray band down to $2.4 \pm 0.7$ ks. Short-timescale (sub-hour) variabilities are a key observable to constrain the size of the photon-emitting region inside the blazar jet. The LST-1 (first protoype of the Large-Sized Telescope) of the CTAO (Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory) is located on Roque de los Muchachos in La Palma, Spain. With its high sensitivity at low energies (20-150 GeV), it provides a unique opportunity to investigate such phenomena. In 2023, the source had a very bright flare that triggered LST-1 and multi-wavelength data campaigns. In this study, we present the results of this observation campaign, in particular, the search for short-timescale variabilities.

          A low mass, binary-stripped envelope for the Type IIb SN 2024abfo

 - **Abstract**
 Type IIb supernovae (SNe) are a transitional subclass of stripped-envelope SNe showing hydrogen lines in their spectra that gradually weaken and give way to helium lines reminiscent of SNe Ib, which is indicative of stripping through stellar winds or binary interaction. SN 2024abfo is the seventh SN IIb with a direct progenitor detection. We find that the position of the supernova in our ERIS adaptive optics imaging agrees with the progenitor position in archival HST imaging to within 19 mas. The progenitor SED is consistent with an A5 giant. Single star models predict an initial mass in the range 11 to 15 solar masses, while the most probable binary model is a 12+1.2 solar mass system with an initial period of 1.73 years. We also find significant evidence for variability of the progenitor candidate in the years prior to core-collapse. SN 2024abfo is the least luminous SN IIb with a direct progenitor detections. At late times the r-band light curve decays more slowly than the comparison SNe, which may be due to increased gamma-ray trapping. Similar to SN 2008ax, SN 2024abfo does not show a prominent double-peaked light curve. Our semi-analytic light curve modelling shows that this may be due to a very low mass of hydrogen in the outer envelope. Spectrally, SN 2024abfo is most similar to SN 2008ax at early times while at later times (80 days) it appears to show persistent Halpha absorption compared to the comparison sample. We prefer a binary system to explain the supernova and its progenitor, although we are unable to rule out single-star models. We recommend late-time observations to search for a binary companion and signatures of CSM-interaction. The absence of these features would support the hypothesis that SN 2024abfo resulted from a system which underwent a period of binary mass transfer well before (1000 yr) the explosion, resulting in a low-mass hydrogen-rich envelope.

          Hydrodynamical simulations of the vertical shear instability with dynamic dust and cooling rates in protoplanetary disks

 - **Abstract**
 Turbulence in protoplanetary disks affects dust evolution and planetesimal formation. The vertical shear instability (VSI) is one of the candidate turbulence-driving mechanisms in the outer disk region. Since the VSI requires rapid gas cooling, dust grains in disks can influence and potentially control VSI-driven turbulence. However, VSI-driven turbulence has strong vertical motion, causing vertical dust diffusion. As a result, it remains unclear how turbulent structures and dust distributions form. We aim to clarify whether the VSI can achieve a quasi-steady dust profile under cooling rate evolution associated with turbulently diffusing dust. We also elucidate the dependence of the dust size and dust-to-gas mass ratio on the realization and persistence of the equilibrium state. We perform global two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of an axisymmetric disk to investigate how the VSI drives turbulence and maintains a balance between dust settling and diffusion. These simulations account for the dynamic interplay between dust distribution, cooling rates, and turbulence. We find that VSI mixing, dust settling, and local cooling reach an equilibrium, forming a thick dust layer with a dimensionless vertical mixing coefficient of approximately 10^{-3}. The ability of the VSI to sustain this state also depends on the dust size and dust-to-gas mass ratio. Larger grains or lower mass ratios weaken turbulence, leading to dust settling. The condition of equilibrium state existence is consistent with the prediction of the semi-analytic model presented by Fukuhara & Okuzumi (2024). Our results indicate that efficient turbulent dust mixing and efficient cooling can occur simultaneously. They also imply that turbulence in VSI-dominated disks has different intensity levels depending on the grain size. This suggests that the efficiency of dust growth can depend on the VSI in protoplanetary disks.

          Extensions of Brown Hamiltonian-II. Analytical study on the modified von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai effects

 - **Abstract**
 In triple systems of weak hierarchies, nonlinear perturbations arising from the periodic oscillations associated with the inner and outer binaries play a crucial role in shaping their long-term dynamical evolution. In this context, we have developed an extended Brown Hamiltonian in Paper I, which serves as a fundamental model for describing the modified von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai (ZLK) oscillations. The present work aims to analyze the characteristics of ZLK oscillations within this extended framework, focusing on phase-space structures, the location of ZLK center, the maximum eccentricity reached, the boundaries of librating cycles, and the critical inclination required to trigger ZLK resonance. Under the extended Hamiltonian, we introduce the Lidov integral C_ZLK, which is a combination of the Hamiltonian and the z-component of angular momentum, to characterize the modified ZLK properties. It is found that the librating and circulating cycles are separated by C_ZLK=0, which is consistent with the classical theory. Furthermore, we derive analytical expressions of these ZLK properties using perturbation techniques. Analytical predictions are compared to numerical results, showing an excellent agreement between them. Notably, the results reveal that ZLK characteristics in prograde and retrograde regimes are no longer symmetric under the influence of Brown corrections. At last, we conduct $N$-body integrations about millions of orbits to generate dynamical maps, where the numerical structures are well captured by the analytical solutions derived from the extended model.

          Impact of local foreground radiations on Very High Energy observations of extragalactic sources

 - **Abstract**
 In the framework of exploiting Very High Energy (VHE) gamma-ray observations of extragalactic sources to infer constraints on the intensity of cosmological background radiations, as well as on deviations from the standard model of particles and physical interactions (like violations of Lorentz invariance and axion-like particles -- LIV and ALPs), we discuss here possible contaminant effects due to the presence of radiations fields from local sources. We specifically model and analyze the foreground radiations produced inside the host galaxy of the VHE source and the cosmic environment itself hosting the source, as well as radiations produced in the Milky Way, along the VHE source's observational line-of-sights. Our analysis shows that such contaminant foregrounds may indeed impact on observations of only the very local Active Galactic Nuclei (e.g. Centaurus A), but not significantly those in the Virgo cluster (M87) and beyond.

 - **Abstract**
 Supernova remnants (SNRs) interacting with molecular clouds are interesting laboratories to study the acceleration of cosmic rays and their propagation in the dense ambient medium. We analyze 14 years of Fermi-LAT observations of the supernova remnant Puppis A to investigate its asymmetric $\gamma$-ray morphology and spectral properties. This middle-aged remnant ($\sim$4 kyr) is evolving in an inhomogeneous environment, interacting with a dense molecular cloud in the northeast and a lower-density medium in the southwest. We find clear differences in both $\gamma$-ray luminosity and spectral energy distribution between these two regions. The emission from both sides is consistent with a hadronic origin. However, while the southwestern emission can be explained by standard Diffusive Shock Acceleration (DSA), the northeastern side may involve re-acceleration of pre-existing cosmic rays or acceleration via reflected shocks in the dense cloud environment. Additionally, we identify two significant $\gamma$-ray excesses outside the remnant, including a previously unreported source to the south. These features are likely produced by cosmic rays that have escaped Puppis A and are interacting with nearby dense molecular material. From this extended emission, we estimate the total energy in escaping cosmic rays to be $W_{CR} \sim 1.5 \times 10^{49}$ erg, providing important constraints on cosmic-ray propagation around the remnant.

 - **Abstract**
 The variation in hot Jupiter (HJ) occurrence across stellar environments holds clues as to the dominant formation channels of these extreme planets. Recent studies suggest HJ hosts preferentially reside in regions of high phase space density, possibly reflecting natal environmental conditions. These regions are kinematically cold (|v| < 40 km/s), prompting the alternative hypothesis that the correlation reflects an age bias: planetary systems in overdensities are systematically younger and therefore less likely to have undergone tidal inspiral and destruction. We test whether the apparent excess of HJs in phase space overdensities arises from differences in intrinsic host properties -- mass, metallicity, age -- which may correlate with phase space density or whether there is evidence for an additional environmental effect. We derive homogeneous estimates for the mass, metallicity, and age of planet-hosting stars using 2MASS and Gaia DR3 photometry, parallaxes, and self-consistent spectroscopic and spectrophotometric observables. In a sample of 2265 confirmed exoplanet hosts, we find a significant relative excess of HJs orbiting stars in overdense regions. However, we also find that overdensities preferentially host younger, more massive, and more metal-rich stars compared to underdensities. After correcting for these differences, either by detrending the phase space density against age or by matching host properties across subsamples, we find no significant differences in the HJ populations between over- and underdense regions. Our results suggest that the previously reported correlation between HJ occurrence and phase space density is driven by underlying differences in host star demographics rather than an intrinsic environmental effect.

 - **Abstract**
 The source GS~1826-24 is a neutron star low mass X-ray binary known as the 'clocked burster' because of its extremely regular bursting behavior. We report on the detection of a long type-I X-ray burst from this source. We perform a detailed spectroscopic analysis of the long X-ray burst, lasting for $\sim 600$ s, seen in the NuSTAR observation carried out on 2022 September. The persistent emission is well described by an absorbed thermal Comptonization model (nthcomp), and the source exhibits a hard spectral state during this observation. The observed burst exhibits a rise time of $\sim 25$ s and a decay time of $\sim 282$ s. The time-resolved spectroscopy of the burst shows a significant departure from a pure thermal spectrum and is described with a model consisting of a varying-temperature blackbody plus an evolving persistent emission component. We observe a significant enhancement in the persistent emission during the burst. The enhancement of the pre-burst persistent flux is possibly due to Poynting-Robertson drag or coronal reprocessing. At the peak of the burst, the blackbody temperature and the blackbody emitting radius reached a maximum of $2.10\pm 0.07$ keV and $5.5\pm 2.1$ km, respectively. The peak flux ($F_{peak}$) during the burst is $\approx 2.4\times 10^{-8}$ ergs cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, which corresponds to a luminosity of $\approx 9.7\times 10^{37}$ ergs s$^{-1}$.

 - **Abstract**
 This work delves into the dynamical dark energy models of the wCDM parameterisation that are defined by their equation of state by comparing different, well-known parameterisation models, in an attempt to lessen the tensions of {H_0} and {\sigma_8} by using the latest observational data. This research also tested the newer Planck likelihood and BAO data by comparing them to their predecessors. The data that was used were: the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data of Planck 2018 and Planck 2020 data; Cosmic Chronometers (CC), a sample of Supernovae Type Ia; and Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAO). A Bayesian analysis was performed to produce the results needed for the analysis. From the analyses, the best-fit values of the parameters show that almost all models are in favour of a phantom Universe. This study also showed that the new tested data constrained the models better than the previous ones, while also showing that the observation data supports the {\Lambda}CDM model over the dynamical dark energy models

 - **Abstract**
 Io's tidally-driven global volcanism indicates widespread partial melting in its mantle. How this melt participates in the interior dynamics, and, in particular, the role it plays in tidal dissipation, is poorly understood. We model Io's tidal deformation by treating its mantle as a two-phase (solid and melt) system. By combining poro-viscous and poro-elastic compaction theories in a Maxwell framework with a consistent model of tidal and self-gravitation, we produce the first self-consistent evaluation of Io's tidal heating rate due to shearing, compaction, and Darcy flow. We find that Darcy dissipation can potentially exceed shear heating, but only for large (0.05 to 0.2) melt fractions, and if the grain size is large or melt viscosity ultra-low. Since grain sizes larger than 1~cm are unlikely, this suggests that Darcy dissipation is secondary to shear dissipation. Compaction dissipation is maximised when the asthenosphere is highly resistive to isotropic stresses, but contributes at most 1% of Io's observed heating rate. This work represents a crucial step toward a self-consistent quantitative theory for the dynamics of Io's partially molten interior.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The one-dimensional treatment of turbulent convection had large successes until the early 2000s. However, the recent abundance and precision of observational data shows that this problem is far from solved. A modern approach should be developed by using multidimensional models. Aims. We established a new theoretical framework for comparison between one-dimensional and multidimensional convection models by mapping the two-dimensional structure of the convective zone and optimizing the modeling parameters of the SPHERLS code. Methods. We constructed a series of static envelope models for the same RR Lyrae stars, but with different horizontal sizes and resolutions. We then used a series of statistical methods to quantify the sizes of convective eddies, map the energy cascade, and describe the different structural parts of the convective zone. These include integral length scales, Fourier series, and the determination of the convective flux through horizontal averaging. Results. The structure of the convective zone depends significantly on the model size, below an angular size of $9^\circ$. The horizontal resolution of earlier studies is adequate to describe the granulation pattern in the large eddy simulation approach. In quasi-static RR Lyrae stars, the convective zone consists of two distinct dynamically unstable regions that are loosely connected. Approximately half of the convective flux is supplied by the transport of ionization energy in the partial hydrogen ionization zone. Conclusions. The 2D models presented in this work with the described size and resolution parameters can be used for comparison against 1D models. The structure of the convective zone urges reconsideration of some recent approaches to describe the convective flux currently used in radial stellar pulsation codes, which will be addressed in a separate paper.

 The paper describes the objectives, design and findings of the pre-launch ground characterisation campaigns of the Euclid infrared detectors. The pixel properties, including baseline, bad pixels, quantum efficiency, inter pixel capacitance, quantum efficiency, dark current, readout noise, conversion gain, response nonlinearity, and image persistence were measured and characterised for each pixel. We describe in detail the test flow definition that allows us to derive the pixel properties and we present the data acquisition and data quality check software implemented for this purpose. We also outline the measurement protocols of all the pixel properties presented and we provide a comprehensive overview of the performance of the Euclid infrared detectors as derived after tuning the operating parameters of the detectors. The main conclusion of this work is that the performance of the infrared detectors Euclid meets the requirements. Pixels classified as non-functioning accounted for less than 0.2% of all science pixels. IPC coupling is minimal and crosstalk between adjacent pixels is less than 1% between adjacent pixels. 95% of the pixels show a QE greater than 80% across the entire spectral range of the Euclid mission. The conversion gain is approximately 0.52 ADU/e-, with a variation less than 1% between channels of the same detector. The reset noise is approximately equal to 23 ADU after reference pixels correction. The readout noise of a single frame is approximately 13 $e^-$ while the signal estimator noise is measured at 7 $e^-$ in photometric mode and 9 $e^-$ in spectroscopic acquisition mode. The deviation from linear response at signal levels up to 80 k$e^-$ is less than 5% for 95% of the pixels. Median persistence amplitudes are less than 0.3% of the signal, though persistence exhibits significant spatial variation and differences between detectors.

 - **Abstract**
 Light pollution is an increasing environmental concern, impacting both ecological systems and human health. This report presents an analysis of light pollution data from the \textit{Was het donker} SQM network from 2020 until 2023, with a focus on indirect light pollution, commonly known as skyglow. By integrating measurements from Sky Quality Meter (SQM) stations in the network and cloud cover data from EUMETSAT, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of night sky brightness across a region encompassing northern Netherlands and the western part of the German Wadden Coast. Yearly changes in brightness for 27 locations were ranked and plotted, revealing that in the darkest areas, light pollution is increasing at a rate of 2.78 to 6.68 percent per year. A trend emerged showing that brighter areas experienced lower variability in brightness, while darker zones exhibited higher variability. This is due to the dominance of artificial light sources, such as street lighting, in brighter areas, which reduces the influence of natural light sources like the Moon, stars, and cloud backscatter. Seasonal patterns and the effects of the Milky Way were also investigated. Density plots were employed to visualize these changes in night sky brightness, helping to identify specific sources of light pollution, such as greenhouse lighting and streetlight turn-off times. These findings emphasize the need for systematic monitoring of light pollution and offer valuable insights that can guide public awareness initiatives and inform light pollution mitigation strategies.

 - **Abstract**
 Deriving accurate carbon abundance estimates for a wide variety of stars is still complex due to the difficulties in properly measuring it from atomic and molecular lines. The aim of this paper is to analyse the carbon abundance determination for the large empirical X-shooter Spectral Library (XSL), commonly used as a benchmark for the development of stellar population models. The analysis was performed over strong molecular CH bands in the G-band region. We used the GAUGUIN automated spectrum synthesis code, and adopted two different grids of reference synthetic spectra separately, each with the same [C/Fe] abundance coverage. We carried out a detailed comparison between both grids to evaluate the accuracy and the model dependence of the measured [C/Fe] abundances. We obtained a large and precise unbiased [C/Fe] abundance catalogue from both theoretical grids, well distributed in the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram and with no trend with the stellar parameters. We also measured compatible values from each independent CH band, with a high-quality [C/Fe] abundance estimate for both dwarfs and giants indistinctly. We observed a dispersed flat trend around [C/Fe] = 0.0 dex all along the metallicity regime, in agreement with some literature studies. However, we reported variations up to 0.8 dex in the [C/Fe] composition of the star depending on the adopted grid. We did not find such differences in the $\alpha$-element measurements. This behaviour implies a strong model dependence in the [C/Fe] abundance estimate. Potential sources of error could be associated with the use of spectral synthesis methods to derive stellar carbon abundances in the CH4300A band. Intrinsic small differences in the synthetic models over this crowded and blended region may induce a large disparity in the precise abundance estimate for any stellar type, leading to inaccurate carbon measurements without being noticed

 - **Abstract**
 Modelling carbon monoxide (CO) line radiation is computationally expensive for traditional numerical solvers, especially when applied to complex, three-dimensional stellar atmospheres. We present COEmuNet, a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN)-based surrogate model that emulates CO line radiation transport with high accuracy and efficiency. It consists of an asymmetric encoder-decoder design that takes 3D hydrodynamical models as inputs and generates synthetic observations of evolved stellar atmospheres. The model is trained on data from hydrodynamic simulations of Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars perturbed by a companion. Given a set of input parameters, including velocity fields, kinetic temperature distribution, and CO molecular number densities, the COEmuNet model emulates spectral line observations with a median relative error of ~7% compared to a classical numerical solver of the radiative transfer equation, measured over seven frequency channels and arbitrary viewing directions. Besides, COEmuNet delivers a 1000 times speedup, enabling efficient model fitting to observational datasets, real-time visualization of simulations and progress toward integration in large-scale cosmological simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 The application of convolutional autoencoder deep learning to imaging data for planetary science and astrobiological use is briefly reviewed and explored with a focus on the need to understand algorithmic rationale, process, and results when machine learning is utilized. Successful autoencoders train to build a model that captures the features of data in a dimensionally reduced form (the latent representation) that can then be used to recreate the original input. One application is the reconstruction of incomplete or noisy data. Here a baseline, lightweight convolutional autoencoder is used to examine the utility for planetary image reconstruction or inpainting in situations where there is destructive random noise (i.e., either luminance noise with zero returned data in some image pixels, or color noise with random additive levels across pixel channels). It is shown that, in certain use cases, multi-color image reconstruction can be usefully applied even with extensive random destructive noise with 90% areal coverage and higher. This capability is discussed in the context of intentional masking to reduce data bandwidth, or situations with low-illumination levels and other factors that obscure image data (e.g., sensor degradation or atmospheric conditions). It is further suggested that for some scientific use cases the model latent space and representations have more utility than large raw imaging datasets.

 - **Abstract**
 We consider a general dark energy (DE) model parametrized by its equation-of-state (EoS), featuring three free parameters: $w_0$ (the present-day value of the DE EoS), $w_{\beta}$ (quantifying the dynamical nature of the DE EoS), and $\beta$ (governing various dynamical forms of the DE EoS). The key controlling parameter $\beta$ can recover several existing DE models in the literature, such as the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization ($\beta = 1$), the logarithmic parametrization (in the limit $\beta \rightarrow 0$), and the linear parametrization ($\beta = -1$), alongside generate a class of new DE parametrizations for other values of $\beta$. The resulting DE scenario is constrained using a suite of the latest cosmological probes, including Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) temperature and polarization anisotropies from three different experiments (Planck 2018 and Atacama Cosmology Telescope combined with WMAP), CMB lensing, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations from DESI Year 2, and PantheonPlus from Type Ia supernovae. Our analyses reveal that stringent constraints on the DE parameters are obtained only when all cosmological probes are combined; otherwise, some parameters remain unconstrained. The present-day value of the DE EoS remains in the quintessence regime according to our results, and no significant evidence for a dynamical DE EoS is found. However, based on the $\Delta\chi^2$ and Bayesian evidence analyses, we observe a mild preference for the present three-parameter DE parametrization over the CPL parametrization when all cosmological probes are taken into account. Nonetheless, the Bayesian evidence difference remains below the threshold for statistical significance according to the revised Jeffreys scale, indicating that both models are effectively equally preferred by the data.

 - **Abstract**
 The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will detect ~ 100 galactic binary systems comprised of black holes (BHs) and neutron stars (NSs). Identifying the nature of the constituents of these binaries as BHs or NSs, and distinguishing them from $\sim 10^4$ detected double white dwarfs will be challenging. In the absence of any other information, the inferred values of the component masses can be used to classify the nature of these objects. However, short-period galactic binaries $\sim 10^7 - 10^3$ yr from coalescence produce a quasi-monochromatic signal which carries little information about their masses. We generate synthetic LISA data sets containing gravitational waves (GWs) from galactic binary BHs, binary NSs and BHNSs drawn from an astrophysically realistic population produced through the isolated binary evolution channel. We process the data with an end-to-end Bayesian inference pipeline to explore the accuracy with which the individual component masses can be measured. We find that for $\approx 10\% - 50\%$ of the detected systems LISA will be able to measure the individual component masses by measuring the orbital eccentricity, periapse precession frequency, and GW induced frequency derivative. Typical fractional mass errors are $\approx 1\% - 100\%$ (depending on the specific value of the source parameters), which will enable in many circumstances the classification of the objects as BHs or NSs. For these binaries, LISA will also be able to determine their 3-dimensional position in the Milky Way. The LISA-detected sample of these double compact objects will provide new information about the galactic population of BHs and NSs, the star formation history of the Milky Way and the astrophysical processes leading to the formation of these systems. However, for a significant fraction of the LISA-detected binaries the nature of their constituent objects may remain unclear.

 - **Abstract**
 Spectroscopic redshift surveys are key tools to trace the large-scale structure (LSS) of the Universe and test the $\Lambda$CDM model. However, using redshifts as distance proxies introduces distortions in the 3D galaxy distribution. If uncorrected, these distortions lead to systematic errors in LSS analyses and cosmological parameter estimation. We present a new method that combines linear theory (LT) and a neural network (NN) to mitigate redshift space distortions (RSDs). The hybrid LT+NN approach is trained and validated on dark matter halo fields from z = 1 snapshots of the Quijote N-body simulations. LT corrects large-scale distortions in the linear regime, while the NN learns quasi-linear and small-scale features. The LT correction is applied first, then the NN is trained on the resulting fields to improve accuracy across scales. The method uses a Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss and yields significant performance gains: approximately 50% improvement over LT alone and 12% over NN alone. The reconstructed fields from the LT+NN method show stronger correlations with the true real-space fields than either LT or NN separately. The hybrid method also improves clustering statistics such as halo-halo and halo-void correlations, with benefits extending to BAO scales. Compared to NN-only, it provides better suppression of spurious anisotropies on large and quasi-linear scales, as measured by the quadrupole moments of correlation functions. This work shows that combining a physically motivated dynamical model with a machine learning algorithm leverages the strengths of both approaches. The LT+NN method achieves high accuracy with modest training data and computational cost, making it a promising tool for future applications to more realistic galaxy surveys.

 We present CRPropa 3.3, the latest release of the publicly available Monte Carlo framework for simulating the propagation of high-energy particles in astrophysical environments. This version introduces significant extensions that enables multi-messenger studies across a broad energy range, from GeV to ZeV. New features include explicit time tracking, time-dependent advection fields, and support for position-dependent radiation backgrounds, for more realistic simulations of Galactic and extragalactic propagation. Nuclear cross sections have been updated and expanded up to lead (Z=82). We illustrate some of these new features, including acceleration at moving shocks and gamma-ray propagation in the interstellar radiation field. Together, these improvements establish CRPropa 3.3 as a comprehensive tool for modelling cosmic rays, gamma rays, and their secondaries in structured, time-dependent environments, setting the stage for next-generation multi-messenger astrophysics.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the detection and characterization of TOI-201 c, a long-period transiting companion to the warm Jupiter TOI-201 b. Its presence was first inferred from high-amplitude transit timing variations (TTVs) in TOI-201 b, pointing to a massive outer body on a $7.7^{+1.0}_{-0.6}$-year eccentric orbit. This prediction was confirmed when TESS observed a transit of TOI-201 c, precisely constraining its orbital geometry. A joint fit to TTVs, transit photometry, and archival radial velocities yields a mass of $14.2^{+1.0}_{-1.2}$ $M_{\rm Jup}$ and an eccentricity of $0.643^{+0.009}_{-0.021}$. The mutual inclination between planets b and c is $2.9^{+4.8}_{-4.4}$ degrees, indicating a nearly coplanar architecture. Long-term numerical integrations confirm dynamical stability over gigayear timescales and predict that transits of TOI-201 b will cease within a few thousand years. TOI-201 c ranks among the longest-period transiting planets with well-constrained properties. Its detection via TTVs, followed by a confirmed transit, represents a rare observational sequence and highlights the power of TTVs and photometric monitoring to uncover distant companions. The TOI-201 system offers a valuable laboratory for testing models of giant planet formation, migration, and secular evolution in multi-planet systems.

 - **Abstract**
 The Cosmic Distance Duality Relation (CDDR) connects the angular diameter distance ($d_A$) and the luminosity distance ($d_L$) at a given redshift. This fundamental relation holds in any metric theory of gravity, provided that photon number is conserved and light propagates along null geodesics. A deviation from this relation could indicate new physics beyond the standard cosmological model. In this work, we test the validity of the CDDR at very low redshifts ($z < 0.04$) by combining $d_A$ from the Megamaser Cosmology Project with $d_L$ from the Pantheon+ sample of Type Ia Supernovae (SNIa). We find the relation to be statistically consistent with the current data. We further incorporate high-redshift Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO)-based $d_A$ measurements from DESI DR2 in combination with SNIa data, highlighting the critical role of the $r_d-M_b$ (early-late) calibration in testing the CDDR using these two probes. Assuming CDDR holds, we perform a Bayesian analysis to derive model-independent constraints on the calibration parameters. Using only BAO and SNIa data, we observe a strong degeneracy between $r_d$ and $M_b$. However, the inclusion of calibration-free Megamaser measurements breaks this degeneracy, enabling independent constraints without relying on a specific cosmological model or distance-ladder techniques. Additionally, we present a forecast incorporating the expected precision from future Megamaser and SNIa observations, demonstrating their potential to significantly tighten constraints on early-late calibration parameters, under the assumption of validity of CDDR.

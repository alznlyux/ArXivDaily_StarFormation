- **Abstract**
 We design a convolutional neural network (CNN) incorporating channel attention and spatial attention mechanisms to predict atmospheric parameters of hot subdwarfs. The experimental dataset comprises spectra at nine distinct signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels, with each SNR level containing 11 396 synthetic spectra and 945 observed spectra. The trained deep learning models achieves mean absolute errors (AME) in predicting hot subdwarf atmospheric parameters of 730 K for effective temperature (Teff ), 0.09 dex for surface gravity (log g), and 0.03 dex for helium abundance (log(nHe/nH)), respectively, which reaches the accuracy of traditional spectral fitting methods. Utilizing the trained deep learning models and low-resolution spectra from LAMOST DR12, we confirm 1512 hot subdwarfs from the catalog of hot subdwarf candidates, of which 291 are newly identified. Our results demonstrate that the deep learning model not only achieves accuracy comparable to traditional methods in obtaining hot subdwarf atmospheric parameters, but also far exceeds them in speed and efficiency, making it particularly suitable for the analysis of large datasets of hot subdwarf spectra.
#### Title:
          Revisiting the near infrared Calcium triplet as metallicity indicator
 - **Authors:** M. Navabi, R. Carrera, N. E. D. Noël, C. Gallart, E. Pancino, M. De Leo
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:

- **Abstract**
 The near-infrared Calcium II Triplet (CaT), around 850nm, is a key metallicity indicator for red giant stars. We present a revised [Fe/H] calibration as a function of CaT line strengths and four luminosity indicators, including the $Gaia$ $G$-band, together with the classical $V$, $I$, and $K_s$ bandpasses. For this purpose, we used a sample of 366 red giant stars belonging to 25 globular and open clusters, complemented by 52 extremely metal-poor field giant stars. The CaT line strengths are determined by fitting Gaussian-Lorentzian combination profiles using the Python lmfit package, which utilises the algorithms implemented therein. The derived calibration is valid for a wide metallicity range, $-4$\,dex$ \lesssim \mathrm{[Fe/H]} \lesssim +0.15$, and for ages older than $\sim$200 Myr. In addition, we performed a detailed assessment of how factors such as spectral resolution, spectral quality (expressed through the signal-to-noise ratio), and the algorithms used to constrain the line profiles affect the measured line strengths and the resulting metallicities.

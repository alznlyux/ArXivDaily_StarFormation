- **Abstract**
 Most stars form in dense stellar environments, where frequent close encounters can strongly perturb and reshape the early architecture of planetary systems. The solar system, with its rich population of distant comets, provides a natural laboratory to study these processes. We perform detailed numerical simulations using the LonelyPlanets framework that combines NBODY6++GPU and REBOUND, to explore the evolution of debris disks around solar system analogues embedded in stellar clusters. Two initial configurations are considered, an $Extended$ and a $Compact$ model, each containing four giant planets and either an extended or compact debris disk. We find that compact disks primarily form Kuiper belt and scattered disk-like populations through planet-disk interactions, while extended disks are more strongly shaped by stellar encounters, producing Oort cloud-like structures and interstellar comets with ejection velocities of 1-3 km/s. Stellar perturbations are most effective for encounter inclinations between $0^{\circ}$ and $30^{\circ}$, giving rise to distinct dynamical populations, like Sednoids, and inner Oort cloud analogues, and a characteristic tail in semi-major axis-eccentricity space. In coplanar encounters, the disk remains largely flattened, whereas polar flybys redistribute angular momentum vertically, producing nearly isotropic outer populations that resemble an emerging Oort cloud. Our results suggest that cometary reservoirs and interstellar objects are natural byproducts of planet-disk interactions and stellar flybys in dense clusters, linking the architecture of outer planetary systems to their birth environments.

- **Abstract**
 The evolution of gaseous planets is a complex process influenced by various physical parameters and processes. In this study, we present critical modifications to the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) code to enhance its applicability to giant planet modelling. We introduce an equation of state specifically tailored for materials at planetary conditions. The equation of state considers the thermodynamic properties of hydrogen-helium mixtures and heavy elements, improving the accuracy of internal structure calculations. We also present modifications to the radiative opacity to allow the modelling of grains, clouds and opacity windows. Furthermore, we refine the treatment of convective mixing processes in MESA to better replicate convective mixing with the presence of composition gradients. Finally, we add a treatment for helium rain and settling. These modifications aim to enhance the predictive capabilities of MESA for giant planet evolution and are publicly available. We hope that these improvements will lead to a deeper understanding of giant planet evolution in the solar system and beyond.

- **Abstract**
 We present a catalogue of compact sources detected in the SARAO MeerKAT 1.3 GHz Galactic Plane Survey (SMGPS). We extract 510599 compact sources, with areas less than five 8" beams, from the survey maps covering the regions $252°< l < 358^°$ and $2°< l < 61°$ at $|b| \leq 1.5^°$, which have an angular resolution of 8" and a sensitivity of $\sim$ 10-30 $\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$. In this paper, we describe the source identification and characterisation methods, present the quality assurance of the catalogue, explore the nature of the catalogue sources, and present initial science highlights. We limit our catalogue to sources with a signal-to-noise ratio $\geq 5$, as the catalogue is $\sim$90 per cent complete, and has a false positive rate of less than 1 per cent at this threshold. The bulk of the catalogue sources are previously unknown to the literature, with the majority of unknown sources at sub-mJy levels. Initial science highlights from the catalogue include the detection of 213 radio quiet WISE HII region candidates, previously undetected in radio continuum studies. We show images that compare the SMGPS compact sources to CORNISH ultracompact HII regions, thus highlighting the sensitivity and unprecedented uv-coverage of the SMGPS, and the potential synergy of the SMGPS with other surveys.

- **Abstract**
 Across the Galactic disk lies a diverse population of X-ray sources, with the fainter end remaining poorly understood due to past survey sensitivity limits. We aim to classify and characterize faint X-ray sources detected in the eROSITA All-Sky Survey (eRASS1) towards the inner Galactic disk ($350^\circ < l < 360^\circ$, $-1^\circ < b < 1^\circ$) using deeper XMM-Newton observations (typical exposure of $\sim 20\,\text{ks}$). We analyzed 189 eRASS1 sources, combining X-ray spectral fitting ($0.2$--$10\,\text{keV}$) with Gaia astrometric and photometric data for robust classification. Our results show that the eRASS1 catalog towards the Galactic disk is overwhelmingly dominated by coronal sources ($\sim 74\%$), primarily active stars and binaries, with $\sim 8\%$ being wind-powered massive stars and $\sim 18\%$ being accreting compact objects. We propose an empirical hardness-ratio cut ($\text{HR} > -0.2$) to efficiently isolate these non-coronal sources. By stacking the classified population and comparing with the Galactic Ridge X-ray Emission (GRXE), we estimate that $\sim 6\%$ of the GRXE flux in the $0.5$--$2.0\,\text{keV}$ band is resolved into point sources above the eRASS1 flux limit ($\sim 5\times 10^{-14}\,\text{erg}\,\text{cm}^{-2}\,\text{s}^{-1}$). This resolved soft-band emission is dominated by active stars, while hard-band flux originates primarily from X-ray binaries. We conclude that the eRASS1 catalog retains a non-negligible population of compact objects that can be effectively distinguished using X-ray color selection.

- **Abstract**
 Addressing the spatial uncertainty and spectral blending challenges in CSST slitless spectroscopy, we present a deep learning-driven, end-to-end framework based on the You Only Look Once (YOLO) models. This approach directly detects, classifies, and analyzes spectral traces from raw 2D images, bypassing traditional, error-accumulating pipelines. YOLOv5 effectively detects both compact zero-order and extended first-order traces even in highly crowded fields. Building on this, YOLO11 integrates source classification (star/galaxy) and discrete astrophysical parameter estimation (e.g., redshift bins), showcasing complete spectral trace analysis without other manual preprocessing. Our framework processes large images rapidly, learning spectral-spatial features holistically to minimize errors. We achieve high trace detection precision (YOLOv5) and demonstrate successful quasar identification and binned redshift estimation (YOLO11). This study establishes machine learning as a paradigm shift in slitless spectroscopy, unifying detection, classification, and preliminary parameter estimation in a scalable system. Future research will concentrate on direct, continuous prediction of astrophysical parameters from raw spectral traces.

          Radiatively-Cooled Mass Transfer: Disk Properties and L2 outflows across Mass Transfer Rates

- **Abstract**
 High rates of stable mass transfer (MT) occur for some binary star systems, resulting in luminous transients and circumbinary outflows. We perform hydrodynamical simulations of a $10 \ M_\odot$ donor star and a $5\ M_\odot$ point mass secondary, incorporating approximate effects of radiative cooling. By varying the orbital separation of the system, we probe MT rates between $10^{-5}$ and $10^{-1} M_\odot$/yr. Mass flows from the donor into an accretion disk, with significant equatorially-concentrated outflows through the outer Lagrange point L2 occurring for MT rates $\gtrsim 10^{-3} M_\odot$/yr, while the MT remaining mostly conservative for lower MT rates. In all cases, any outflowing gas approximately carries the specific angular momentum of L2. The gas cooling luminosity $L$ and temperature increases with MT rate, with $L \sim 10^{5} L_\odot$ and $T \sim 10^4 \, {\rm K}$ for simulations featuring the strongest outflows, with contributions from both the accretion disk and circumbinary outflow. The most luminous transients associated with mass outflows will be rare due to the high MT rate requirement, but generate significant optical emission from both the accretor's disk and the circumbinary outflow.

          What is the nature of late infall streamers?

- **Abstract**
 Growing observational evidence suggests that Class II protoplanetary disks may undergo substantial interactions with their environment in the form of late infall. This mass inflow predominantly manifests itself in the form of so-called streamers: filaments and arcs of gas connecting large-scale, extended gas structures to disk scales. Prevalent late infall has far-reaching consequences for planet formation theory, challenging the long-standing treatment of evolved disks in isolation. In this work, we investigate the emergence of late-infall streamers in different formation scenarios, their morphology and multiplicity, as well as their dependence on environmental conditions. We conduct this investigation by performing 3D hydrodynamical simulation using the grid-based code FARGO3D, which we post-process to obtain synthetic observations using the Monte Carlo radiative transfer code RADMC3D. We find that, while a late infall event in the form of a single encounter with a "cloudlet" of gas can produce a streamer via an interplay between the fall-back of bound material and shocks, such features dissipate quickly, on a timescale of ~10 kyr. Furthermore, we find that streamers can also form naturally in a turbulent, dense environment without the need for such encounters, which could act to reconcile short-lived streamers with ubiquitous detection of these structures. Here, we find multiple co-existing streamers for a disk velocity relative to the interstellar medium of $v_\mathrm{sys}=0.5~\mathrm{km}~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ and a turbulent velocity dispersion of $\sigma_\mathrm{turb}=0.5~\mathrm{km}~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. We find considerable dependence of the streamer morphology on the environment, which may act as a utility to constrain the physical conditions of the gas surrounding planet-forming disk, and therefore the conditions under which planets form.

          Alpha Core-Beam Origin in Low-$β$ Solar Wind Plasma: Insights from Fully Kinetic Simulation

- **Abstract**
 In-situ observations of the fast solar wind in the inner-heliosphere show that minor ions and ion sub-populations often exhibit distinct drift velocities. Both alpha particles and proton beams stream at speeds that rarely exceed the local Alfvén speed relative to the core protons, suggesting the presence of instabilities that constrain their maximum drift. We aim to propose a mechanism that generates an alpha-particle beam through non-linear Landau damping, primarily driven by the relative super-Alfvénic drift between protons and alpha particles. To investigate this process, we perform one-dimensional, fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulations of a non-equilibrium multi-species plasma, complemented by its linear theory to validate the model during the linear phase. Our results provide clear evidence that the system evolves by producing an alpha-particle beam, thereby suggesting a local mechanism for alpha-beam generation via non-linear Landau damping.

- **Abstract**
 We selected Bulge stars from APOGEE DR17 cross-matched with astrometric data from \textit{Gaia} DR3. Bulge stars were divided into sub-samples with line-of-sight velocity dispersion analyzed and the peaks of MDF were detected by both Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) and \texttt{this http URL\_peaks}. GMM is also conducted to kinematically distinguish the metal-poor and metal-rich populations. Analyses were put on the Bulge stars (including retrograde stars), their elemental abundances, and the [Mg/Mn]-[Al/Fe] plane to investigate potential accreted components. Finally, the shapes (X-shaped/boxy) of Bulge stars with different metallicities were analyzed through least-squares fitting based on the analytical Bulge models. By studying the kinematic, elemental and structural dependences on metallicity for Bulge stars, our findings are concluded as follows: 1. Six peaks are detected in the Bulge MDF, encompassing values reported in previous studies, suggesting a complex composition of Bulge populations. 2. An inversion relationship is well-observed in metal-rich sub-samples, while absent in metal-poor sub-samples. 3. Metal-poor populations exhibit larger dispersions than metal-rich stars (which is also revealed by GMM decomposition), suggesting that metal-rich stars are kinematically coherent. 4. Retrograde stars are confined to $\sim1$ kpc of the Galactic center, with their relative fraction decreasing at higher [Fe/H] -- a trend potentially linked to the ``spin-up'' process of Galactic disks. 5. Metal-rich Bulge stars with [Al/Fe] $<-0.15$ are likely associated with from disk accreted substructure, while all elemental planes exhibit bimodality but Na abundances rise monotonically with metallicity. 6. In general, stars with all metallicities support a boxy profile.

          Pulsation Mode Identification and Classification of 46 High-Amplitude $δ$ Scuti Stars from 50 Candidates with TESS observations

- **Abstract**
 Asteroseismic modelling of high-amplitude $\delta$ Scuti (HADS) variables critically depends on their accurate classification, which provides robust constraints on stellar physical parameters. As a foundational step in this direction, we present a detailed analysis of the pulsational behavior of 50 HADS star candidates using high-precision photometric data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). We confirm 46 as genuine HADS variables, with 40 stars having their dominant frequencies identified for the first time. Among them, 7 pulsate solely in the fundamental mode; 21 exhibit the fundamental mode alongside at least one low-amplitude nonradial mode; 5 are pure double-mode pulsators (the fundamental and first-overtone modes), 13 show double-mode pulsations accompanied by additional low-amplitude nonradial modes. The remaining four stars are classified as other types of variables: two (TIC 69546708 and TIC 110937533) are confirmed hot subdwarfs, one (TIC 8765832) is a cataclysmic variable, and one (TIC 32302937) is a likely hot subluminous star, but it requires further spectroscopic confirmation. We investigate the period-luminosity (PL) relation, also known as the Leavitt law, for these 46 confirmed HADS stars, deriving a revised relation: $M_{V}= (-3.31 \pm0.39)~\mathrm{log}~P+(-1.68 \pm 0.39)$. This result is consistent with previous studies. Their distribution in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram indicates that HADS stars are not strictly confined to be within a narrow instability strip previously found, but can extend beyond it, with a distribution toward lower temperatures. The refined classifications presented here establish a high-quality sample for precise asteroseismic modelling and enhance the potential for future machine-learning-assisted searches and classifications of HADS stars in large-scale photometric surveys.

- **Abstract**
 Carbonaceous nano-grains are a significant component of interstellar dust and dominate the mid-infrared emission of photodissociation regions (PDRs). We study the evolution of nano-grains across the illuminated edge of the Horsehead PDR, especially their abundance and size properties. This work is part of the Physics and Chemistry of PDR Fronts program studying dust and gas in PDRs with JWST. We use NIRCam+MIRI photometric bands and NIRSpec+MRS spectroscopy to map the illuminated edge. We model dust emission using the THEMIS dust model with the SOC radiative transfer code. Detailed modeling of high angular resolution JWST data allows us to obtain constraints on nano-grain properties. We find that diffuse ISM dust cannot account for the observed data, requiring evolved grains. A sharp density increase is observed at the illuminated edge, consistent with ALMA observations revealing a sharp transition between molecular and ionized gas. Although the PDR length could not be directly determined, we estimate an upper limit of approximately 0.015 pc. This implies a lower limit on small grain abundance (greater than 0.003), showing small grains are not depleted at the Horsehead edge, unlike in the Orion Bar. Our findings indicate a high-density environment and less steep size distribution for nano-grains at the illuminated edge versus the diffuse ISM. This implies nano-grain destruction mechanisms might be less efficient in the Horsehead's moderate-UV field than in more intense PDRs. These results support a model where nano-grain population recovery is slower in moderate-UV environments, leading to a unique dust size distribution at the edge of the Horsehead Nebula.

- **Abstract**
 JWST is collecting time-series observations of many free-floating planets (FFPs) to study their weather, but these light curves are the ideal datasets to search for exomoons that transit the FFP during observations. In this paper, we present observations of the planetary-mass Y dwarf ($T=250-285K$, $M = 6.5\pm3.5 M_{Jup}$, d = 2.3$\,$pc) WISE J085510.83-071442.5 (WISE 0855), whose proximity and brightness make it ideal for a transiting exomoon search. We examine 11 hours of time-series spectra from the JWST Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) whose sensitivity, in combination with Gaussian process (GP) modeling, allows for the disentanglement of exomoon transits from WISE 0855's variability. We do not find statistically significant evidence of an exomoon transit in this dataset. Using injection and recovery tests of artificial transits for depths ranging between 0.1-1% (0.35-1.12 $R_{\oplus}$) we explore the exomoon parameter space where we could successfully detect transits. For transit depths $\geq 0.5\%$ (1.96$\,R_{\text{Titan}}$), our detection rate is 96%, which, for WISE 0855, corresponds to a moon with a companion-to-host mass ratio similar to that of Titan and Saturn. Given our sensitivity, transit probabilities, and our observational duration, we determine a $\sim$91% probability of detecting a Titan mass analog exomoon after 18 such observations if every observed system hosts a Titan mass analog exomoon in a Galilean-like system. This suggests that JWST observations of dozens of FFPs could yield meaningful constraints on the occurrence rate of exomoons. This paper is the first demonstration that JWST is sensitive to Galilean moon mass analogs around FFPs.

- **Abstract**
 Reconstructions of solar spectral irradiance - especially in the ultraviolet (UV) range - are crucial for understanding Earth's climate system. Although total solar irradiance (TSI) has been thoroughly investigated, the spectral composition of solar radiation offers a deeper insight into its interactions with the atmosphere, biosphere, and climate. UV radiation, in particular, plays a key role in stratospheric chemistry and the dynamics of stratospheric ozone. Reconstructing solar irradiance over the past centuries requires accounting for both the cyclic modulation of active-region coverage associated with the 11-year solar cycle and the longer-term secular trends, including their centennial variability. This study utilizes an empirical framework, based on a 1000-year record of Open Solar Flux, to characterize the various temporal components of solar irradiance variability. We then combine these components to reconstruct Solar UV irradiance variations in spectral bands crucial for Earth's atmospheric studies.

- **Abstract**
 We present the largest ground-based catalogue of M-dwarf flares to date, comprising 1,229 time-resolved events identified in Zwicky Transient Facility Data Release 17. Using high-cadence ZTF observations collected between April 2018 and September 2020, we analyzed over 93 million variable light curves containing 4.1 billion photometric measurements. Flare candidates were identified through a machine-learning pipeline trained on simulated light curves generated by injecting TESS-based flare templates into ZTF data and then refined through an extensive post-filtering stage combining an additional classifier, metadata checks, and human inspection. For 655 flares with reliable Gaia-based distances and well-sampled light curves, we derived bolometric energies ranging from 10^31 to 10^35 erg. A clear correlation is observed between flare frequency and spectral subtype, with a sharp increase toward later M dwarfs, particularly near M4-M5, coinciding with the transition to full convection. Using 680 flaring stars with known vertical distances from the Galactic plane, we find that the fraction of flaring stars decreases with increasing Galactic height. The resulting catalogue provides the most comprehensive ground-based sample of M-dwarf flares and establishes a framework for flare detection and classification in upcoming wide-field surveys such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time.

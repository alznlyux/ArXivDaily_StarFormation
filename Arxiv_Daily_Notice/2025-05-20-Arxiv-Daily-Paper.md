          Flavor Equilibration of Supernova Neutrinos: Exploring the Dynamics of Slow Modes

 - **Abstract**
 Neutrinos experience collective flavor conversion in extreme astrophysical environments such as core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe). One manifestation of collective conversion is slow flavor conversion (SFC), which has recently attracted renewed interest owing to its ubiquity across different regions of the supernova environment. In this study, we systematically examine the evolution of kinematic decoherence in a dense neutrino gas undergoing SFC, considering lepton number asymmetries as large as $30\%$. Our findings show that the neutrino gas asymptotically evolves toward a generic state of coarse-grained flavor equilibration which is constrained by approximate lepton number conservation. The equilibration occurs within a few factors of the inverse vacuum oscillation frequency, $\omega^{-1}$, which corresponds to (anti)neutrinos reaching near flavor equipartition after a few kilometers for typical supernova neutrino energies. Notably, the quasi-steady state of the neutrino number densities can be quantitatively described by the neutrino-antineutrino number density ratio $n_{\bar{\nu}_e}/n_{\nu_e}$ alone. Such a simple estimation opens new opportunities for incorporating SFC into CCSN simulations, particularly in regions where SFC develops on scales much shorter than those of collisions.

 - **Abstract**
 We are searching for hot, constant-color, offset optical flares in the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) data stream that are ${>}10''$ from any galaxy in public imaging data from the PanSTARRS survey. Here, we present the first discovery from this search: AT 2024puz, a luminous multiwavelength transient offset by $5\,$kpc from a ${\sim}10^8\,M_\odot$ galaxy at $z=0.356$ with a low-moderate star formation rate. It produced luminous $10^{44.79 \pm 0.04}\,{\rm erg\,s}^{-1}$ optical/UV emission that evolved on a ${\sim}20\,$day timescale, as well as $10^{44.12\pm0.03}\,{\rm erg\,s}^{-1}$ X-ray emission with a photon-index $\Gamma=1.7$. No associated radio or millimeter emission was detected. We show that the early-time optical emission is likely powered by reprocessing of high-energy, accretion-powered radiation, with a possible contribution from a shock in a dense circum-transient medium. If the shock is dominant at early-times, the circum-transient medium has a mass ${\sim}0.1-1\,M_\odot$, radius $10^{15}\,$cm, and a density profile shallower than ${\sim}r^{-1}$. A near-infrared excess appears at late-times and is suggestive of reprocessing within a wind or other circum-transient medium. The X-rays are most consistent with a central engine. We suggest that AT 2024puz may be associated with an accretion event onto a $50-10^5\,M_\odot$ BH, where the lower masses are preferred based on the large projected offset from the host galaxy. AT2024puz exhibits properties similar to both luminous fast blue optical transients (LFBOTs) and tidal disruption events (TDEs), but is intermediate between them in its energetics and evolution timescale. This highlights the need for broader exploration of the landscape of hot optical transients to trace their origins.

          Ultraviolet variability in Solar-type members of the M67 open cluster

 - **Abstract**
 Solar-type members of the rich, nearly Solar-age and Solar-metallicity M67 open cluster are systematically investigated for ultraviolet variability. We utilize archival Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) data which features several imaging observation epochs spanning 5 years. Stars in or suspected of being in binary systems are avoided as well as stars that are blended in GALEX data, leading to a sample of 66 Solar-type stars. We assess variability over a variety of timescales that probe flares and longer-term trends that could be due to rotation and activity cycles. We do not find conclusive evidence for variability and determine that Solar-type members of M67 do not display >30% near-ultraviolet variability over timescales ranging from days to years. Furthermore, within 50-second cadence lightcurves generated for each of the imaging epochs we find no near-ultraviolet flares that are >~2x the quiescent stellar near-ultraviolet emission level; the implied ultraviolet flare rate derived from this study is in mild tension with that derived for stars observed by GALEX in the primary Kepler field. This M67 GALEX study presents one of the most comprehensive ultraviolet datasets currently available for probing continuum emission variability for old Sun-like stars; the planned NASA UVEX mission has the potential to dramatically expand upon this work.

 - **Abstract**
 Some carbon-rich Wolf-Rayet stars (WC stars) show an infrared excess from dust emission. Dust forms in the collision of the WC wind with a companion star's wind. As this dust is carried towards the ISM at close to the WCd wind speed and the binary continues through its orbit, a spiral structure forms around the system. The shape depends on the orbital eccentricity and period, as well as stellar parameters like mass-loss rates and terminal wind speeds. Imaging of the WCd binary WR 140 with JWST/MIRI revealed at least 17 concentric dust shells surrounding the binary. We present new JWST imaging of four additional WCd systems (WR 48a, WR 112, WR 125, and WR 137) that were imaged in 2024. In this analysis, we show that the dust is long-lived, surviving for at least 130 years, but more than 300 years in some systems. Longer duration measurements are limited by sensitivity. Regular spacing of dust features confirms the periodic nature of dust formation, consistent with a connection to binary motion. We use these images to estimate the proper motion of the dust, finding the dust to propagate out to the interstellar medium with motion comparable to the wind speed of the WC stars. In addition to these results, we observe unusual structures around WR 48a, which could represent dusty clumps shaped by photoevaporation and wind ablation like young proplyd objects. These results demonstrate that WC dust is indeed long-lived and should be accounted for in galactic dust budgets.

 - **Abstract**
 The orbital properties of the (as-yet) small population of hot Jupiters with nearby planetary companions provide valuable constraints on the past migration processes of these systems. In this work, we explore the likelihood that dynamical perturbations could cause nearby inner or outer companions to hot Jupiter to leave the transiting plane, potentially leaving these companions undetected despite their presence at formation. Using a combination of analytical and numerical models, we examine the effects of stellar evolution on hot Jupiter systems with nearby companions and identify several possible outcomes. We find that while inner companions are generally unlikely to leave the transiting plane, outer companions are more prone to decoupling from the hot Jupiter and becoming non-transiting, depending on the system's initial orbital architecture. Additionally, we observe a range of dynamical behaviors, including overall stability, inclination excitation, and, in some cases, instability leading to the ejection or collision of planets. We also show that the effect of stellar obliquity (with respect to the mean planet of the planets) is to amplify these effects and potentially cause outer companions to attain non-mutually-transiting configurations more often. Our results highlight the complex dynamical pathways shaping the architectures of hot Jupiter systems.

 - **Abstract**
 We discuss the possibility that dark energy arises from a strongly-coupled Higgs-Yang-Mills set of interacting fields in the non-perturbative regime. We choose the simplest $SU(2)$ representation, which is compatible with the Cosmological Principle. One of the components of the Higgs doublet act as an effective quintessence scalar field interacting with both gravity and the gauge field. We devise a multiple time scale approach to solve the equations of motion through a hierarchy of the couplings, utilizing exact solutions in terms of Jacobi elliptic functions. We observe that the time scale of variation of the Hubble constant is the slowest one, while, for the scalar field, assuming that its self-coupling is smaller than the coupling of the gauge field, represents an intermediate time scale. From the consistency of the Friedmann equations, we show how the effect of the scalar field is to give origin to dark energy with a proper equation of state corrected by a very small time-dependent term. Finally, agreement with cosmological data for the dark energy density is shown without relying on the fine-tuning of the physical constants of the model.

 - **Abstract**
 The Rapid Iterative FiTting (RIFT) parameter inference algorithm provides a simulation-based inference approach to efficient, highly-parallelized parameter inference for GW sources. Previous editions of RIFT have conservatively optimized for robust inference about poorly constrained observations. In this paper, we summarize algorithm enhancements and operating point choices to enable inference for more exceptional compact binaries. Using the previously-reported RIFT/asimov interface to efficiently perform analyses on events with reproducible settings consistent with past work, we demonstrate that the latest version of RIFT can efficiently analyze events with multiple costly models including the effects of precession or eccentricity.

 - **Abstract**
 We present SpiderCat, a multi-wavelength catalog of all publicly known compact binary millisecond pulsars (MSPs) in the Galactic field. These systems, colloquially known as "spiders", consist of neutron stars in tight orbits with low-mass companions, which are gradually ablated by the pulsar wind. SpiderCat includes both primary subclasses - redbacks and black widows - distinguished by companion mass, as well as candidates and peculiar systems such as transitional, huntsman and tidarren MSPs. As of this initial release, SpiderCat contains 109 entries: 32 redbacks, 49 black widows, 23 redback candidates, and 5 black widow candidates. In this paper, we compile and summarize key parameters for each system, including spin and orbital properties, and multi-wavelength data from radio, optical, X-ray, and gamma-ray observations. An interactive, publicly accessible web interface (this https URL) enables exploration and visualization of the data. The rapid growth of the number of known spiders, accelerated by the Fermi-LAT survey and its ability to identify MSPs in gamma-rays, has opened the door to population-level studies. Utilizing SpiderCat, we analyze trends in spin period, orbital period, companion mass, emission properties, and spatial distribution. SpiderCat serves as a dynamic, multi-wavelength repository for this unique class of binary pulsars, facilitating new discoveries and constraints on pulsar evolution, particle acceleration, and the neutron star equation of state.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive analysis of the digest2 parameters for candidates of the Near-Earth Object Confirmation Page (NEOCP) that were reported between 2019 and 2024. Our study proposes methods for significantly reducing the inclusion of non-NEO objects on the NEOCP. Despite the substantial increase in near-Earth object (NEO) discoveries in recent years, only about half of the NEOCP candidates are ultimately confirmed as NEOs. Therefore, much observing time is spent following up on non-NEOs. Furthermore, approximately 11% of the candidates remain unconfirmed because the follow-up observations are insufficient. These are nearly 600 cases per year. To reduce false positives and minimize wasted resources on non-NEOs, we refine the posting criteria for NEOCP based on a detailed analysis of all digest2 scores. We investigated 30 distinct digest2 parameter categories for candidates that were confirmed as NEOs and non-NEOs. From this analysis, we derived a filtering mechanism based on selected digest2 parameters that were able to exclude 20% of the non-NEOs from the NEOCP while maintaining a minimal loss of true NEOs. We also investigated the application of four machine-learning (ML) techniques, that is, the gradient-boosting machine (GBM), the random forest (RF) classifier, the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) classifier, and neural networks (NN) to classify NEOCP candidates as NEOs or non-NEOs. Based on digest2 parameters as input, our ML models achieved a precision of approximately 95% in distinguishing between NEOs and non-NEOs. Results. Combining the digest2 parameter filter with an ML-based classification model, we demonstrate a significant reduction in non-NEOs on the NEOCP that exceeds 80%, while limiting the loss of NEO discovery tracklets to 5.5%. Importantly, we show that most follow-up tracklets of initially misclassified NEOs are later correctly identified as NEOs.

          PIRATES -- a machine-learning framework for polarized, interferometric image reconstruction

 - **Abstract**
 Optical interferometric image reconstruction is a challenging, ill-posed optimization problem which usually relies on heavy regularization for convergence. Conventional algorithms regularize in the pixel domain, without cognizance of spatial relationships or physical realism, with limited utility when this information is needed to reconstruct images. Here we present PIRATES (Polarimetric Image Reconstruction AI for Tracing Evolved Structures), the first image reconstruction algorithm for optical polarimetric interferometry. PIRATES has a dual structure optimized for parsimonious reconstruction of high fidelity polarized images and accurate reproduction of interferometric observables. The first stage, a convolutional neural network (CNN), learns a physically meaningful prior of self-consistent polarized scattering relationships from radiative transfer images. The second stage, an iterative fitting mechanism, uses the CNN as a prior for subsequent refinement of the images with respect to their polarized interferometric observables. Unlike the pixel-wise adjustments of traditional image reconstruction codes, PIRATES reconstructs images in a latent feature space, imparting a structurally derived implicit regularization. We demonstrate that PIRATES can reconstruct high fidelity polarized images of a broad range of complex circumstellar environments, in a physically meaningful and internally consistent manner, and that latent space regularization can effectively regularize reconstructed images in the presence of realistic noise.

 - **Abstract**
 Planets residing within the hot-Neptune Desert are rare, and studying their atmospheres can provide valuable insights into their formation and evolutionary processes. We present the atmospheric characterization of the first known ultra-hot Neptune, LTT-9779 b, using transmission spectroscopic observations obtained with the HST/WFC3 G141 and G102 grisms. Using the Iraclis pipeline and TauREx3 retrieval code, we find that LTT-9779 b likely possesses a H/He-dominated primary atmosphere with an opaque aerosol layer and the pure cloudy, flat-line model is rejected with approximately 2.7-$\sigma$ confidence. Although we do not find conclusive evidence supporting the presence of any molecular species, we place 95% confidence level upper limits on the volume mixing ratios (VMRs) of hydroxyl radical (OH) and iron hydride (FeH) at $7.18\times10^{-2}$ and $1.52\times10^{-8}$, respectively. Notably, the retrieval results are inconsistent with predictions from equilibrium chemistry models, which favor higher $\rm H_2O$ abundances over OH. This discrepancy suggests that disequilibrium processes, such as photochemistry or vertical mixing, may have altered the atmospheric composition. Comparisons between HST, Spitzer and JWST data reveal no evidence of temporal variations in the atmospheric composition of the terminator region. Our results highlight the need for higher-resolution spectroscopy and secondary eclipse observations to resolve LTT-9779 b's temperature-pressure (T-P) profile and chemical inventory definitively.

          Global flow regimes of hot Jupiters

 - **Abstract**
 In hot and ultra-hot Jupiters, stellar irradiation is a primary driver of atmospheric circulation and the wave structures that sustain it. We aim to investigate how variations in radiative and dynamical timescales influence global flow regimes, atmospheric circulation efficiency, and the interplay of wave structures across a sample of hot Jupiters. In particular, we explore a previously predicted transition in the global flow regime, where enhanced stellar irradiation suppresses the smaller-scale wave and eddy features that feed into superrotating jets and ultimately leads to simpler, day-to-night dominated flows. We simulate a suite of eight well-studied hot Jupiters with the THOR general circulation model, spanning equilibrium temperatures from about $1100$ K to $2400$ K. We develop a wavelet-based analysis method to decompose simulated wind fields into their underlying wave modes, which we validate on analytical examples. As a preliminary exploration of the flow regime of ultra-hot Jupiters, we perform an additional simulation for WASP-121b, where the mean molecular weight is set to represent an atmosphere dominated by atomic hydrogen. Our results confirm that increasing stellar irradiation diminishes atmospheric heat redistribution efficiency and weakens contributions from smaller-scale modes that are critical to sustain superrotation. As equilibrium temperatures rise, large-scale modes dominate the atmospheric circulation, driving a transition from jet-dominated flows toward day-to-night circulation. Additionally, by artificially lowering the mean molecular weight, we partially restore circulation efficiency and reintroduce a more complex, multi-scale flow pattern. These findings refine our understanding of how atmospheric circulation evolves with increasing irradiation and composition changes, offering a more nuanced framework for interpreting hot and ultra-hot Jupiter atmospheres.

          Dynamical regimes of two eccentric and mutually inclined giant planets

 - **Abstract**
 We consider a basic planetary system composed by a Sun like star, a Jupiter-like planet an a Neptune-like planet in a wide range of orbital configurations not limited to the hierarchical case. We present atlases of resonances showing the domains of approx. 1300 mutual mean-motion resonances (MMRs) and their link to chaotic and regular dynamics. Following a semi-analytical method for the study of the secular dynamics we found two regimes for equilibrium configurations: one for low mutual inclinations were equilibrium is related to oscillations of the difference between the pericenter longitudes around 0 or 180 degrees, and another for high mutual inclinations where the equilibrium is given by defined values of the argument of the pericenters equal to integer multiples of 90 degrees. By numerical integration of the full equations of motion we calculate the fundamental frequencies of the systems in their diverse configurations and study their dependence with the orbital elements. According to the analysis of the fundamental frequencies we found two dynamical regimes depending on the initial mutual inclination and the limit between the two regimes occurs at some critical inclination 30<ic<40 defined by the occurrence of the secular resonance g1=g2. For i<ic the dynamics is analogue a the classic secular model for low (e,i) with well defined three fundamental frequencies and free and forced modes, conserving quasi constant the mutual inclination. For i>ic the dynamics is completely different with increasing changes in mutual inclination and emerging combinations of the fundamental frequencies and, depending on the case, dominated by the secular resonance or the vZLK mechanism.

          Modelling helium in exoplanet atmospheres. A revised network with photoelectron-driven processes

 - **Abstract**
 The He I line at 1.08 $\mu$m is a valuable tracer of atmospheric escape in exoplanet atmospheres. We expand past networks used to predict the absorbing He(2$^3S$) by including, firstly, processes that involve H$_2$ and some molecular ions and, secondly, the interaction of photoelectrons with the atmosphere. We survey the literature on the chemical-collisional-radiative processes that govern the production-loss of He(2$^3S$). We simulate the atmospheric outflow from the Neptune-sized GJ 436 b by coupling a hydrodynamic model that solves the bulk properties of the gas and a Monte Carlo model that tracks the energy degradation of the photoelectrons. We identify Penning ionization of H as a key He(2$^3S$) loss process at GJ 436 b and update its rate coefficient to a value consistent with the most recent available cross sections. The update affects notably the predicted strength of the He I line. For GJ 436 b, photoelectron-driven processes (mainly ionization and excitation) modify the He(2$^3S$) population in layers too deep to affect the in-transit spectrum. The situation might be different for other atmospheres though. The spectral energy distribution of GJ 436 has a strong effect on the predicted in-transit signal. The published non-detections of the He I line for GJ 436 b are reasonably consistent with our model predictions for a solar-metallicity atmosphere when the model adopts a recently proposed spectral energy distribution. The interpretation of the He I line at 1.08 $\mu$m is model-dependent. Our revised network provides a general framework to extract more robust conclusions from measurements of this line, especially in atmospheres where H$_2$ remains abundant to high altitudes. We will explore additional, previously-ignored processes in future work.

          Inclusion of sulfur chemistry in a validated C/H/O/N chemical network: identification of key C/S coupling pathways

 - **Abstract**
 The detection of SO2 in both WASP-39 b and WASP-107 b recently brought more attention to the modeling of photochemistry in exoplanets. However, sulfur kinetics data is lacking in the literature for the full C/H/O/N/S system. The networks used to model this chemistry neglect the coupling between sulfur and other C/H/O/N species. We aimed to integrate sulfur kinetics to our previously developed C_0-C_2/H/O/N chemical network, with the inclusion of its coupling to carbon and nitrogen chemistry, for conditions between 500 - 2500 K and 100 - 10^-6 bar, and any atomic composition. To achieve this reliability, we used a dual approach, deriving the network from other available combustion networks and from original ab initio calculations where data was lacking. This was performed together with an extensive validation of the network on 1606 experimental measurements from the literature on the combustion and pyrolysis of multiple sulfur compounds such as H2S, CH3SH, CS2 and OCS. To examine the consequences of this new chemical network on exoplanets atmospheric studies, we generated abundance profiles for GJ 436 b, GJ 1214 b, HD 189733 b, HD 209458 b, WASP-39 b and WASP-107 b using the 1D kinetic model FRECKLL, calculated the corresponding transmission spectra using TauREx 3.1 and compared these results with other chemical networks used in exoplanet modeling with sulfur. The coupling between carbon and sulfur chemistry is found to be impactful on both abundance profiles and observables, with CH2S being its key species. CS2 abundance is found to be probably much higher than anticipated in current kinetic networks for exoplanets. The detection of CS2 in TOI-270 d highlights the importance of using validated chemical networks to improve the reliability of our models, particularly in the JWST era. Combustion and pyrolysis data are largely available tools that reveal to be very useful for this task.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a set of companion dynamical masses and orbital parameters of seven star systems from the NEID Earth Twin Survey with significant absolute astrometric accelerations between the epochs of Hipparcos and Gaia. These include four binary star systems (HD 68017 AB, 61 Cygni AB, HD 24496 AB, and HD 4614 AB) and three planetary systems (HD 217107, HD 190360, and HD 154345). Our analyses incorporate a long baseline of RVs that includes over 1100 previously unpublished measurements from NEID and MINERVA, extending the overall RV baseline for each system by $\approx$2.5 years, as well as relative astrometry for the stellar binary systems where the positions of both stars are well-measured. In each case, the combination of astrometry and RVs constrains the three-dimensional acceleration of the host star and enables precise dynamical masses. We publish true masses for three planets whose measurements were previously entangled with their inclinations, four stellar masses with $\lesssim$1% relative precision, and improved orbital solutions for all seven systems, including the first for HD 24496 AB. These solutions not only agree with previous estimates, but also improve their fidelity. We also explore each system for evidence of periodic signals in the residuals around our best-fit models, and discuss the potential that the three planetary systems have for being directly imaged. With dynamical mass estimates and reliable orbit ephemerides, these seven star systems represent promising benchmarks for future stellar and planetary characterization efforts, and are amenable for further improvement with the upcoming release of Gaia epoch astrometry.

 - **Abstract**
 The upcoming space-based gravitational wave (GW) observatory, LISA, is expected to detect GW signals from supermassive black hole (SMBH) mergers occurring at high redshifts. However, understanding the origin and growth of SMBHs in the early Universe remains an open problem in astrophysics. In this work, we utilize the First Light And Reionization Epoch Simulations (FLARES), a suite of cosmological hydrodynamical zoom-in simulations, to study SMBH mergers at $5 \lesssim z \lesssim 10$ across a wide range of environments. Most mergers in FLARES involve secondary SMBHs near the seed mass ($m_{seed} \approx 1.5 \times 10^{5} M_{\odot}$) while primary SMBHs span up to $10^{9} M_{\odot}$, resulting in mass ratios from $q \sim 10^{-4}$ to $1$, with a peak at $q \sim 1$. The number of mergers increases rapidly towards lower redshifts, and the comoving total number density scales with overdensity as $n_{merger} = 10^{-3.80} (1 + \delta)^{4.56}$. Denser regions host more massive mergers, with higher merger redshifts and lower mass ratios. Within the FLARES redshift range, LISA is expected to detect mergers with $10^{5} \lesssim M_{tot} / M_{\odot} \lesssim 10^{8}$ and $q \gtrsim 10^{-2}$, corresponding to a detection rate of 0.030 $yr^{-1}$ for events with signal-to-noise ratio $SNR \geq 10$. Our study demonstrates the sensitivity of GW predictions at high redshifts to SMBH seed models and merger time delays, highlighting the need for improved modeling in future cosmological simulations to maximize LISA's scientific return.

 - **Abstract**
 High-velocity clouds (HVCs), which are gas clouds moving at high velocity relative to the galactic disk, may play a critical role in galaxy evolution, potentially supplying gas to the disk and triggering star formation. In this study, we focus on the nearby face-on barred spiral galaxy M83, where high spatial resolution, high-sensitivity CO (1-0) data are available. We identified molecular clouds and searched for clouds with velocities deviating by more than 50km/s from the disk velocity field as HVCs. A total of 10 HVCs were detected -nine redshifted and one blueshifted -- clearly highlighting an asymmetry in their velocity distribution. These HVCs have radii of 30-80 pc, masses on the order of $10^5 M_\odot$, and velocity dispersions of 3-20 km/s, displaying a tendency toward higher velocity dispersion compared to disk molecular clouds in M83. Most of the HVCs do not overlap with the candidates of supernova remnants, and the energy needed to drive HVCs at such high velocities exceeds single supernova energy. Together with the asymmetry in their velocity distribution, we thus conclude that most of the HVCs found in this study are inflow from outside the M83's disk.

 - **Abstract**
 Mass loss on the red giant branch (RGB) influences stellar evolution, properties of stellar populations, and Galactic chemical enrichment, yet remains poorly constrained observationally. Current models provide limited insight into how stellar properties, particularly how metallicity and mass, affects RGB mass loss. Here, I introduce a new observational approach that uses the age-velocity-dispersion relation and the lower-mass boundary of red giants as precise evolutionary markers. These markers, informed by Galactic evolution, allow us to construct observational isochrones for field stars. By comparing masses of RGB stars and red clump (RC) stars at the same age in the Kepler sample, I derive empirical measurements of integrated RGB mass loss at several points in age and metallicity. Combining these new observational measurements with open-cluster studies, I showed that the integrated mass loss on the RGB decreases with metallicity, and may also decrease with stellar mass. The average mass loss rate, which accounts for RGB lifetimes and the initial mass differences between RGB and RC stars at the same age, also show a similar trend. These findings challenge current mass-loss prescriptions widely adopted in stellar evolutionary models, since none of them is able to produce the observed mass-loss trend without widely adjusting free parameters. This highlights an urgent need to revise mechanisms that govern RGB mass loss.

 - **Abstract**
 To fully understand the star formation process, we are compelled to study it in a variety of environments. Of particular interest are how star formation and the resulting initial mass function (IMF) vary as a function of metallicity. We have observed an embedded young cluster in Sh2-284 (hereafter S284), the HII region associated with the open cluster Dolidze 25 using JWST/NIRCam with the aim to study star formation in a metal-poor, i.e., about 1/3 of solar, environment. In particular, we aim to measure the peak of the IMF. Using JWST NIRCam photometry, we identified the embedded cluster S284-EC1 and resolved its low-mass content. By comparison with pre-main sequence evolutionary tracks we determine the mass and extinction for the individual cluster members. Extinction limited samples are created based on the distribution of extinction and the completeness of the data. For the region with a completeness of 50% or higher, we have fitted a log-normal distribution to the IMF. Adopting a fiducial age of 1 Myr of the members, the peak of the IMF is found to be at mc = 0.16+-0.02Msun, which is significantly smaller than the peak mass measured in local young clusters, such as mc = 0.26+0.11-0.07 Msun in the Orion Nebula Cluster (Gennaro & Robberto 2020), or the local Galactic disk value of mc = 0.25 Msun (Chabrier 2005). We have found evidence for IMF variation as a function of metallicity, i.e., the peak of the IMF shifts to lower masses as one goes from solar to 1/3 solar metallicity. However, we caution that the result is sensitive to the assumed age of the stellar population, i.e., with peak mass rising if an age older than 1 Myr is adopted. This study further motivates the need for expanded samples of low-metallicity regions and their content to enable more comprehensive measures of the IMF in such environments.

 - **Abstract**
 The recent measurements from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) favor a higher value of the scalar spectral index $n_s$ compared to the Planck data, challenging many well-established inflationary models. In this work, we investigate the viability of polynomial potential inflation in light of the latest ACT data, focusing on the quadratic ($n=2$) and cubic ($n=3$) models. By exploring the parameter space and deriving constraints on the model coefficients, we find that the cubic model can provide a good fit to the data, while the quadratic model struggles to simultaneously accommodate the ACT data and the requirement of sufficient inflation. Our findings show that higher-order polynomial potentials remain viable for describing cosmic inflation, demonstrating how recent precision measurements continue to refine our understanding of the early Universe.

          Advanced modelling of Night Sky Background light for Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes

 - **Abstract**
 A significant source of noise for Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs), which are designed to measure air showers caused by astrophysical gamma rays, is optical light emitted from the night sky. This Night Sky Background (NSB) influences IACT operating times and their sensitivity. Thus, for scheduling observations and instrument simulation, an accurate estimate of the NSB is important. A physics-driven approach to simulating wavelength-dependent, per-photomultiplier-pixel NSB was developed. It includes contributions from scattered moonlight, starlight, diffuse galactic light, zodiacal light, and airglow emission. It also accounts for the absorption and scattering of optical light in the atmosphere and telescope-specific factors such as mirror reflectivity, photon detection efficiency, and focal length. The simulated results are corrected for pointing inaccuracies and individual pixel sensitivities and compared to data from the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) IACT array. The software package developed for this analysis will be made publicly available. Validation against H.E.S.S.\ data shows small deviations from the prediction, attributable to airglow and atmospheric variability. Per-Pixel predictions provide a good match to the data, with the relative 90\% error range being [-21\%, 19\%]. Compared to the existing standard modelling approach of assuming a constant background, where the relative 90\% error range was [-64\%, 48\%], this is a significant improvement.

          Retention of surface water on tidally locked rocky planets in the Venus zone around M dwarfs

 - **Abstract**
 Terrestrial planets within the Venus zone surrounding M dwarf stars can retain surface ice caps on the perpetual dark side if atmospheric heat transport is inefficient, {as suggested by previous global climate simulations \citep[e.g.,][]{leconte2013}.} This condition is {proposed} to play a role in the potential regional habitability of these planets. However, the amount of surface ice may be limited by considering the water condensed from the steam atmosphere in a runaway greenhouse state, and the physical mechanism for triggering the condensation process is not clear. Here, we use a two-column moist radiative-convective-subsiding model to investigate the water condensation process on tidally locked planets from the runaway greenhouse state. We find that the water condensation process is characterized by two distinct equilibrium states under the same {incoming stellar flux}. The initiation of condensation corresponds to a warm, unstable state exhibiting positive Planck feedback, whereas the termination phase corresponds to a cold, stable state exhibiting negative Planck feedback. We further show that the surface water mass in the collapsed state {decreases with the} incoming stellar flux, background surface pressure, and optical thickness of non-condensible greenhouse gases, with a global equivalent depth of less than $\sim 20$ cm. Our two-column approach provides a straightforward way to understand the water evolution on Venus zone planets around M dwarfs.

 - **Abstract**
 Seismic isolation is crucial for gravitational wave detectors as it minimizes ground vibrations, enabling the detection of faint gravitational wave signals. An active seismic isolation platform for precision measurement experiments is described. The table features piezo actuation along five degrees of freedom: three translational actuations and two tip-tilt degrees of freedom along the horizontal axes. It is stiff in rotation about the vertical axes. A seismometer is used to sense table motion. Piezo actuators are used to suppress seismic noise with feedback control bandwidth of 0.3 to 3 Hz. Suppression levels ranging from 21 to 36 dB of seismic noise within the frequency range of 0.5 to 1.3 Hz are demonstrated, as measured by a witness seismometer on the table, with the suppression direction along the axis of the longitudinal translation of the suspended mirror on the table. The suppression results in 1 $\mathrm{\mathrm{nm/\sqrt{Hz}}}$ residual horizontal motion at 1 Hz. Limitations such as tilt-to-translation coupling that prevent actuation over the desired range of 0.03 to 3 Hz are discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 The Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) has revolutionised the field of solar millimetre astronomy with its high angular resolution and cadence. However, with a limited field of view (FOV), targeted observations of highly dynamic phenomena such of flares are challenging. A large aperture single-dish telescope with a large FOV, such as the future Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST), would prove useful in observing such phenomena, as one could scan the full solar disk on shorter timescales. We aimed to explore what FOVs, detector counts, and scan strategies are suitable for AtLAST to push the required full-disk scan times below 1 minute, enabling regular observations of dynamic solar phenomena. Utilising the maria code, we were able to simulate solar observations with AtLAST, and thoroughly explored how instrumental properties and scanning strategies affect the full-disk observations in the planned frequency bands. We find the double-circle scan pattern, currently employed at ALMA for full-disk mapping to also be an acceptable way of scanning the Sun with AtLAST. Using small to intermediately sized instruments (1000 - 50,000 detector elements), the estimated observational cadence would be less than 1 minute across AtLAST's frequency range with a reasonable pixel spacing. Using instruments with larger FOVs ($\gtrapprox 0.25^\circ$, equivalent to $\gtrapprox$ 1 R$_\odot$), we find a simple circular scan to be more efficient, achieving cadences on second time scales, but requiring more detector elements ($\gtrapprox$ 100,000). We find that a large FOV single-dish telescope such as AtLAST could provide the solar millimetre community with hitherto unachievable observations, namely full-disk observations at high cadence and adequate resolution. With cadences potentially down to seconds, such an instrument would be ideal in the study of quickly evolving solar phenomena.

 - **Abstract**
 To model the temperature evolution of optically thin astrophysical environments at MHD scales, radiative and collisional cooling rates are typically either pre-tabulated or fit into a functional form and then input into MHD codes as a radiative loss function. Thermal balance requires estimates of the analogous heating rates, which are harder to calculate, and due to uncertainties in the underlying dissipative heating processes, these rates are often simply parameterized. The resulting net cooling function defines an equilibrium curve that varies with density and temperature. Such cooling functions can make the gas prone to thermal instability (TI), which will cause departures from equilibrium. There has been no systematic study of thermally unstable parameter space for nonequilibrium states. Motivated by our recent finding that there is a related linear instability, catastrophic cooling instability, that can dominate over TI, here we carry out such a study. We show that Balbus' instability criteria for TI can be used to define a critical cooling rate, $\Lambda_c$, that permits a nonequilibrium analysis of cooling functions through the mapping of TI zones. We furthermore extend Balbus' criteria to account for thermal conduction. Upon applying a $\Lambda_c$-based stability analysis to coronal loop simulations, we find that loops undergoing periodic episodes of coronal rain formation are linearly unstable to catastrophic cooling instability, while TI is stabilized by thermal conduction.

          Quantum confinement and carbon nanodots: A conceptual view for the origin of diffuse interstellar bands

 - **Abstract**
 The nature of the Diffuse Interstellar Band (DIB) carriers is perhaps the most studied, longest standing, unresolved problem in astronomy. While four bands have been associated with the fullerene cation (C^+_60) the vast majority (> 550) remain unidentified. This works is an attempt to provide a conceptual framework for the typical energy transitions that are central to explaining the origin of DIBs, however, it does not make an association between these transitions and any particular DIBs. The effect of quantum confinement on excitons is used, including charge transfer excitons, to construct a generic basis for the electronic transitions that could, in principle, be coherent with the energies associated with DIBs. In this model the carriers are carbon nanodots (CNDs) modelled as nanodiamonds and a-C(:H) nanoparticles. These preliminary results seem to show that particle size dependent effects in nanodiamond and a-C(:H) CNDs could be consistent with the positions of, and intervals between, some of the DIBs. One particular strength of the model is that predicts single bands from the majority of single-size particles and, at most, two bands from some of these same carriers. In the latter case the two bands come from different transitions and may or may not inter-correlate, depending upon the local environment. This generic framework indicates that the size dependent fundamental transitions in CNDs could provide a viable scenario for the origin of some DIB-type bands. While this work does not identify a single DIB, it furnishes a conceptual view for the DIB origin, and suggests that a more refined exploration of quantum confinement size effects, and exciton physics within the astronomical domain might prove fruitful. This work also hints at the requirement for stable configurations for particular size domains in order to explain DIB wavelength stability.

 - **Abstract**
 Measurement of the growth rate of structures ($\fsig$) with Type Ia supernovae (\sns) will improve our understanding of the nature of dark energy and enable tests of general relativity. In this paper, we generate simulations of the 10 year \sn\ dataset of the Rubin-LSST survey, including a correlated velocity field from a N-body simulation and realistic models of \sns\ properties and their correlations with host-galaxy properties. We find, similar to SN~Ia analyses that constrain the dark energy equation-of-state parameters $w_0w_a$, that constraints on $\fsig$ can be biased depending on the intrinsic scatter of \sns. While for the majority of intrinsic scatter models we recover $\fsig$ with a precision of $\sim13 - 14\%$, for the most realistic dust-based model, we find that the presence of non-Gaussianities in Hubble diagram residuals leads to a bias on $\fsig$ of about $\sim-20\%$. When trying to correct for the dust-based intrinsic scatter, we find that the propagation of the uncertainty on the model parameters does not significantly increase the error on $\fsig$. We also find that while the main component of the error budget of $\fsig$ is the statistical uncertainty ($>75\%$ of the total error budget), the systematic error budget is dominated by the uncertainty on the damping parameter, $\sigma_u$, that gives an empirical description of the effect of redshift space distortions on the velocity power spectrum. Our results motivate a search for new methods to correct for the non-Gaussian distribution of the Hubble diagram residuals, as well as an improved modeling of the damping parameter.

 Directly imaged exoplanets in wide orbits challenge current gas giant formation theories. They need to form quickly and acquire enough material before the disk dissipates, which cannot be accommodated by in-situ formation by core accretion. We search for wide separation ($>$ 100 au) planetary-mass companions with the Young Suns Exoplanet Survey (YSES). Here, we present a planetary-mass candidate companion discovered in the survey. We conducted follow-up observations of the candidate system after the first epoch observations and obtained six epochs of observations for this system between 2018 and 2024, and integral field spectroscopy of the stellar component. We report the detection of a candidate companion with H=22.04 $\pm$ 0.13 mag at a projected separation of 730 $\pm$ 10 au away from the primary star. High angular resolution imaging observations of the central star show it is a visual binary. Acceleration data, orbital fitting, spectral energy distribution fitting and radial velocity differences all suggest that there is at least one more unresolved low-mass stellar companion in this system. The planetary-mass candidate shows a significant proper motion comparable to that of the primary star. We estimate an age of 19-28 Myr for the primary star. We cannot confirm the companionship of the candidate due to the unknown barycentre of the stars. Long-term imaging and radial velocity monitoring of the central stars, along with spectroscopy of the candidate companion, are key to resolving the nature of this system. If confirmed, the candidate companion would have a mass of 3-5 Mj estimated with the ATMO evolutionary model. It would be another cold low-mass planet imaged similar to 51 Eri b and AF Lep b. Its extremely wide separation from the host star would challenge the formation theory of gas giant exoplanets.

 The knowledge of the point spread function (PSF) of the Mikhail Pavlinsky Astronomical Roentgen Telescope - X-ray Concentrator (ART-XC) telescope aboard the Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG) observatory plays an especially crucial role in the detection of point X-ray sources in the all-sky survey and the studies of extended X-ray objects with low surface brightness. In this work, we calibrate the far off-axis shape of the ART-XC PSF using in-flight data of Sco X-1 and the Crab Nebula, in all-sky survey or scan mode, respectively. We demonstrate that the so-called "slewing" ART-XC PSF (in contrast to the on-axis PSF), in convolution with the detector pixels, is consistent with ground calibration performed at the Marshall Space Flight Center, and can be used to model the PSF up to large off-axis distances in all-sky survey or scan modes. The radial profile of the Crab Nebula in the 4-12 keV band shows an extended structure out to ~150" and is consistent with Sco X-1 at larger off-axis angles. Finally, we performed an analytic parametrization of the slewing ART-XC PSF as a function of energy.

 Among the thousands of observed fast radio bursts (FRBs), a few sources exhibit exceptionally high burst activity observable by many telescopes across a broad range of radio frequencies. Almost all of these highly active repeaters have been discovered by CHIME/FRB, due to its daily observations of the entire Northern sky as a transit radio telescope. FRB 20240114A is a source discovered and reported by CHIME/FRB to the community in January 2024; given its low declination, even the detection of a few bursts hints at a high burst rate. Following the community announcement of this source as a potentially active repeater, it was extensively followed up by other observatories and has emerged as one of the most prolific FRB repeaters ever observed. This paper presents the five bursts CHIME/FRB observed from FRB 20240114A, with channelized raw voltage data saved for two bursts. We do not observe changes in the DM of the source greater than ~1.3 pc cm$^{-3}$ in our observations over nearly a year baseline. We find an RM of ~ +320 rad m$^{-2}$. We do not find evidence for scattering at the level of < 0.3 ms in the bursts, and we find no evidence for astrophysical scintillation. In our observations of FRB 20240114A, we see a burst rate ~49x higher than the median burst rate of apparent non-repeaters also discovered by CHIME/FRB. Each discovery of highly active FRBs provides a valuable opportunity to investigate whether there is a fundamental difference between repeating and apparently non-repeating sources.

 - **Abstract**
 The $\Gamma$ growth model is an effective parameterization employed across various scientific disciplines and scales to depict growth. It has been demonstrated that the cosmic star formation rate density (CSFRD) can also be described broadly by this pattern, i.e. $\frac{dM(T)}{dT} = M_{z,0}\, \times \frac{\beta^{\alpha}}{\Gamma(\alpha)} \, T^{\alpha-1} e^{-\beta \, T }$ M$_{\odot}$ Gyr$^{-1}$, where $M_{z,0}$ is the stellar mass at $z$ = 0, $\alpha = 3.0$, $\beta = 0.5 $ Gyr$^{-1}$ and $T$ describes time. We use the identical $\Gamma$ growth pattern given by the CSFRD to extend the present day (z = 0) stellar mass bins $M_{\ast}(T)$ of the Galaxy Stellar Mass Function (GSMF) and investigate if we are able to reproduce observations for the high redshift GSMFs. Surprisingly, our scheme describes successfully the evolution of the GSMF over 13.5 Gyrs, especially for objects with intermediate and low masses. We observe some deviations that manifest {\it solely} at very high redshifts ($z > 1.5$, i.e. more than 9.5 Gyr ago) and {\it specifically} for very small and exceedingly massive objects. We discuss the possible solutions (e.g. impacts of mergers) for these offsets. Our formalism suggests that the evolution of the GSMF is set by simple (few parameters) and physically motivated arguments. The parameters $\beta$ and $\alpha$ are theoretically consistent within a multi-scale context and are determined from the dynamical time scale ($\beta$) and the radial distribution of the accreting matter ($\alpha$). We demonstrate that both our formalism and state-of-the-art simulations are consistent with recent GSMFs derived from JWST data at high redshifts.

          Early Post Asymptotic Giant Branch Instability: Does it Affect White Dwarf Hydrogen Envelope Mass?

 - **Abstract**
 Although most white dwarf stars have hydrogen-dominated atmospheres, a significant fraction have atmospheres in which hydrogen is spectroscopically absent, with the fraction of hydrogen-free atmospheres varying with effective temperature. Estimates of the total mass of hydrogen, $M_H$, in the stellar envelope from either asteroseismology or spectral evolution are at odds with predicted values from theoretical stellar evolution modeling. Recent work has found that models in the early post AGB phase of evolution can exhibit thermally and dynamical unstable behavior. Here we investigate whether this Early Post AGB Instability (EPAGBI) can help resolve the conflict in $M_H$ values determined from white dwarf spectral evolution, analysis of DAV pulsations and canonical stellar evolution modeling, by evolving solar composition models of mass $1$ and $2 M_\odot$ through the AGB phases and to the white dwarf cooling track. The $M_H$ values at the end of the calculations are in the range consistent with asteroseismological determinations. However, we caution that, because hydrodynamic behavior is not included in our modeling, it is possible that all hydrogen would be removed. Thus, it is unclear whether the occurrence of the EPAGBI resolves the discrepancy between predictions of stellar evolution modeling and the asteroseismological hydrogen envelope mass determinations. The major impact of EPAGBIs is that they cause loops in the HRD. For models of AGB-departure mass 0.567 and 0.642 $M_\odot$, it takes approximately 100 and 10 yr for a single HRD loop, respectively. Such loops might be detectable in a long-term monitoring program, or perhaps by their imprint on planetary nebula morphology imparted by the cyclically varying mass loss rate.

 - **Abstract**
 During the early stages of star formation, accretion processes such as infall from the envelope and molecular streamers, and ejection of matter through winds and jets take place simultaneously. The Class 0/I binary [BHB2007] 11 shows evidence for accretion and ejection at the scales of the circumbinary disk and the inner close binary. Recent H$_2$CO observations showed two elongated structures with hints of outflowing motion almost perpendicular to the main CO outflow, which is launched from the circumbinary disk. With the aim of verifying the nature of these elongated structures, we analyze the line emission of H$^{13}$CO$^+$, CCH, c-C$_3$H$_2$ and SiO observed with ALMA within the Large Program FAUST. These molecules trace material moving at velocities close to the ambient cloud velocity. The images of H$^{13}$CO$^+$, CCH, c-C$_3$H$_2$ show the elongated structures, whose gas kinematics are consistent with outflowing motions and with rotation in the opposite sense to the main CO outflow. The derived mass loss rate from these large-scale structures is $(1.8\pm0.5)\times10^{-6}M_{\odot}\textrm{ yr}^{-1}$, in agreement with those measured in outflows driven by Class 0/I protostars. The SiO image reveals compact emission close to the binary system, with a slight elongation aligned with the larger-scale structures. This suggests that SiO is released from the sputtering of dust grains in the shocked material at the base of the potential new outflow, with a relative abundance of $\geq(0.11-2.0)\times10^{-9}$. However, higher angular and spectral resolution observations are needed to accurately estimate the outflow launching radius and its powering source. Given the location and the abundance of the SiO emission, we propose that the second outflow may be launched from inside the circumbinary disk, likely by the less massive companion, which is actively accreting material from its surroundings.

 - **Abstract**
 As solar coronal mass ejections (CMEs) propagate through the heliosphere, they expend energy in heating protons to compensate for the cooling that occurs due to expansion. CME propagation models usually treat energy dissipation implicitly via a polytropic index ($\delta$). Here we calculate the power dissipation implied by a given $\delta$ and compare it with the power available in the turbulent velocity fluctuations. We make this comparison using near-Earth {\em in-situ} observations of 27 of the most geoeffective CMEs ($D_{\rm st} < -75$ nT) in solar cycle 24. For $\delta = 5/3$, the power in the turbulent velocity fluctuations is $\approx 54$\% smaller than what would be required to maintain the proton temperature at the observed values. If the power in the turbulent cascade is assumed to be fully expended in local proton heating, the most probable value for $\delta$ is 1.35. Our results contribute to a better understanding of CME energetics, and thereby to improved CME propagation models and estimates of Earth arrival times.

          Insufficient evidence for DMS and DMDS in the atmosphere of K2-18 b. From a joint analysis of JWST NIRISS, NIRSpec, and MIRI observations

 - **Abstract**
 Recent JWST observations of the temperate sub-Neptune K2-18 b have been interpreted as suggestive of a liquid water ocean with possible biological activity. Signatures of DMS and DMDS have been claimed in the near-infrared (using the NIRISS and NIRSpec instruments) and mid-infrared (using MIRI). However, the statistical significance of the atmospheric imprints of these potential biomarkers has yet to be quantified from a joint analysis of the entire planet spectrum. We test the robustness of the proposed DMS/DMDS detections by simultaneously modeling the NIRISS and NIRSpec observations jointly with the MIRI spectrum, considering different data reductions and modeling choices. We use three well-tested pipelines to re-reduce the JWST observations, and two retrieval codes to analyze the resulting transmission spectra as well as previously published data. Our joint analysis of the panchromatic (0.6 - 12 um) spectrum of K2-18 b finds insufficient evidence for the presence of DMS and/or DMDS in the atmosphere of the planet. Furthermore, other molecules containing methyl functional groups (e.g., ethane) with absorption bands similar to DMS/DMDS provide an equally good fit to the data. We find that any marginal preferences are the result of limiting the number of molecules considered in the model and oversensitivity to small changes between data reductions. Our results confirm that there is no statistical significance for DMS or DMDS in K2-18 b's atmosphere. While previous works have demonstrated this on MIRI or NIRISS/NIRSpec observations alone, our analysis of the full transmission spectrum does not support claims of potential biomarkers. Using the best-fitting model including DMS/DMDS on the published data, we estimate that ~25 more MIRI transits would be needed for a 3-sigma rejection of a flat line relative to DMS/DMDS features in the planet's mid-infrared transmission spectrum.

 - **Abstract**
 Primordial scalar perturbations that reenter the horizon after inflation may induce a second-order Gravitational Wave spectrum with information about the primordial Universe on scales inaccessible to Cosmic Microwave Background experiments. In this work, we develop a general framework for the study of Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves in Palatini $f(R)$ gravity that was proven to successfully realise inflation and quintessence, and consider the case of the Starobinsky-like model as an example. A regime of radiation domination with a subdominant matter component is assumed, allowing for a well-motivated perturbative approach to the modified gravity corrections. We calculate the kernel function and the density spectrum numerically and find accurate analytical expressions. The spectral density, which may be tested across a wide range of frequencies by upcoming Gravitational Wave experiments, is shown to differ from the General Relativity and metric $f(R)$ gravity predictions under certain conditions. We comment on previous results in the literature regarding the metric formulation and make special emphasis on the potential of these distinctive features of the spectrum to probe the two formalisms of gravity.

          Wonderings on Wiggly Bispectra: Non-linear Evolution and Reconstruction of Oscillations in the Squeezed Bispectrum

 - **Abstract**
 Oscillations in the primordial bispectrum are sourced by a range of inflationary phenomena, including features in the inflaton potential and interactions with massive fields through the Cosmological Collider scenario. These signatures offer a powerful window into early-universe physics. In this work, we study how oscillations of the form $\lim_{q\ll k}B(q,k)\propto \cos(\mu \ln(q/k))$ impact the non-linear squeezed matter bispectrum. Using a suite of $N$-body simulations with non-Gaussian initial conditions, we show that non-linear evolution significantly damps these oscillations, effectively erasing the signal on scales $k \gtrsim 0.3~h/{\rm Mpc}$ at redshift $z=0$. This damping is well-described by the Zel'dovich approximation and can be modeled deep into the non-linear regime using non-perturbative separate universe simulations. Promisingly, we show that reconstruction techniques developed for baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) analyses can largely undo this damping, improving constraints on the amplitude (phase) of oscillations in the primordial squeezed bispectrum by up to a factor of five (four) at $z=0$. We also discuss several challenges with modeling the non-linear evolution of the squeezed bispectrum in the Cosmological Collider scenario, where the bispectrum is suppressed by a factor of $(q/k)^{3/2}$ relative to the template studied here. Our findings pave the way for future searches for oscillatory bispectra using large-scale structure data.

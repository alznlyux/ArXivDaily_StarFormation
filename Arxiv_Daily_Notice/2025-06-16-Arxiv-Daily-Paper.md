#### Title:
          A Comprehensive Guide to the U.S. Civil Space Budget

 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents an overview of the U.S. federal civil space budget between FY23 and proposed spending in FY25, providing a foundational reference dataset for civil space budget analyses. Projects that support, enable, or leverage space activities for civil purposes are found in more than 100 individual line items spread across 17 federal departments and agencies and are funded by 4 different appropriations bills. Across all these elements, civil space-related appropriations total roughly 44 billion dollars in FY25, of which NASA constitutes about 58 percent (Figure 1). To better view the cross-cutting nature of space missions and the support that enables them, the second half of this report introduces a novel representation of the civil space budget by organizing the data into six national priority areas: American Leadership and Manufacturing; Workforce Development; Fundamental Science; Efficiency, Improvements, and Growth; Homeland Security; Infrastructure, Energy, and Resiliency; and Remote Sensing Applications (Figure 2). This organization of the data highlights the ubiquity of space-related activity throughout diverse sectors to reach the same common goal.

          DBNets2.0: simulation-based inference for planet-induced dust substructures in protoplanetary discs

 - **Abstract**
 Dust substructures in protoplanetary discs can be signatures of embedded young planets whose detection and characterisation would provide a better understanding of planet formation. Traditional techniques used to link substructures' morphology to the properties of putative embedded planets present several limitations that the use of deep learning methods has partly overcome. In our previous work, we developed DBNets, a tool exploiting an ensemble of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to estimate the mass of putative planets in disc dust substructures. This inference problem, however, is degenerate as planets of different masses could produce the same rings and gaps if other physical disc properties were different. In this paper, we address this issue improving our simulation-based inference pipeline to estimate the full posterior distribution for the planet mass and three additional disc properties: the disc $\alpha$-viscosity, the scale height and the dust Stokes number. We also address some minor issues of our previous tool. The new pipeline involves a CNN that summarises the input images in a set of summary statistics, followed by an ensemble of normalising flows that model the inferred posterior for the target properties. We tested our pipeline on a dedicated set of synthetic observations using the TARP test and standard metrics, demonstrating its accuracy and precision. Additionally, we use the results obtained on the test set to study the degeneracies between pairs of parameters. Finally, we apply the developed pipeline to a set of 49 gaps in 34 protoplanetary discs' continuum observations. The results show typically low values of $\alpha$-viscosity, disc scale heights, and planet masses, with 83% of them being lower than 1M$_J$. These low masses are consistent with the non-detections of these putative planets in direct imaging surveys. Our tool is publicly available.

          The Potential Danger to Satellites due to Ejecta from a 2032 Lunar Impact by Asteroid 2024 YR4

 - **Abstract**
 On 2032 December 22 the 60 m diameter asteroid 2024 YR4 has a 4% chance of impacting the Moon. Such an impact would release 6.5 MT TNT equivalent energy and produce a ~1 km diameter crater. We estimate that up to 10^8 kg of lunar material could be liberated in such an impact by exceeding lunar escape speed. Depending on the actual impact location on the Moon as much as 10% of this material may accrete to the Earth on timescales of a few days. The lunar ejecta-associated particle fluence at 0.1 - 10 mm sizes could produce upwards of years to of order a decade of equivalent background meteoroid impact exposure to satellites in near-Earth space late in 2032. Our results demonstrate that planetary defense considerations should be more broadly extended to cis-lunar space and not confined solely to near-Earth space.

          Multi-band Emission from Star-Disk Collision and Implications for Quasi-Periodic Eruptions

 - **Abstract**
 We perform two-dimensional, multi-group radiation hydrodynamic simulations to explore the observational properties of a solar-like star colliding with an accretion disk around a supermassive black hole at separation of $\sim 100$ gravitational radii. We find that the star-disk collision produces ejecta on both sides of the disk. As the ejecta expand and cool, transient flares arise, reaching peak bolometric luminosity of up to $L\gtrsim10^{43}\rm erg~s^{-1}$. We estimate that the typical light curve rises and decays on an hour timescale. The spectral energy distribution (SED) peaks in $20-50$eV. The optical depth in soft X-rays is lower than the frequency-integrated optical depth, yielding $100$eV-$1$KeV luminosity $\nu L_{\nu}\gtrsim10^{42}\rm erg~s^{-1}$. The ejecta aligned with the star's incident direction shows breakout emission, leading to asymmetric SED evolution of the two ejecta. The SED evolution is roughly consistent with those seen in short-period quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs), which have eruption duration ranging from sub-hour to hours, but the ejecta cooling emission alone may not be sufficient to explain the longer duration flares. Increasing incident velocity generally produces a brighter and harder flare. A larger disk scale height prolongs the breakout emission but leads to a somewhat softer SED. A higher disk surface density can lead to higher ejecta temperature, reducing bound-free opacity and increasing luminosity. When lowering the disk surface density, we find that the ejecta becomes optically thin when the scattering optical depth across disk is at the order of $\tau_{\rm disk}\sim200$, and the ejecta disappear when $\tau_{\rm disk}\sim10$.

          Primordial black holes in cosmological simulations: growth prospects for supermassive black holes

 - **Abstract**
 It has long been suggested that a fraction of the dark matter in the Universe could exist in the form of primordial black holes (PBHs) that have existed since the radiation dominated era. Recent studies have suggested that these PBHs may be the progenitors to the population of high-redshift, supermassive black holes (SMBHs) observed since the launch of JWST. For the first time, we have included PBHs in cosmological simulations, to test whether PBHs can sink to the center of collapsing halos, locate dense gaseous regions experience significant growth. We tested PBH-to-DM mass ratios of $f_{\rm PBH}$ = $10^{-4}$ and $10^{-3}$, with an initial PBH mass of 1000 M$_\odot$, as inspired by recent observational constraints. We find that at $f_{\rm PBH} = 10^{-3}$, a number of PBHs were able to embed themselves in dense gas and grow to $10^{4}$-$10^{5}$ M$_\odot$ by $z=20$. These intermediate black holes (IMBHs) are possible progenitors to the highest redshift SMBH observations such as GNZ-11 ($10^{6}$ M$_\odot$ by $z=10$), outperforming light seed black hole (BH) growth seen in recent simulations without the need to invoke heavy seeding prescriptions. On the other hand, $f_{\rm PBH} = 10^{-4}$ resulted in no significant BH growth, emphasizing that the ability of PBHs to act as SMBH seeds is sensitive to the true value of $f_{\rm PBH}$ in the Universe, and showing that the $f_{\rm PBH} =10^{-4}-10^{-3}$ boundary marks the threshold above which SMBH seeding via 1000 M$_\odot$ PBHs becomes effective. This is the first step towards building a realistic PBH framework in cosmological simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the detection of a new HI absorption system associated with the radio source NVSS J164725+375218 at a redshift of z=2.327, identified through a blind survey conducted by the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME). This marks the fifth detection of an associated system at z > 2. By analyzing a subset of available data, we conducted a blind survey for HI absorption systems within the redshift range of 0.78 to 2.55 along 202 lines of sight in the declination range of 35 to 60 degrees. We detected three HI absorbers, including two previously known intervening systems and one newly discovered associated system. By fitting the absorption profile with a number of Gaussian functions, we put lower limits on the optical depth, velocity integrated optical depth and the ratio between the HI column density and the spin temperature of the absorption systems. These results represent a validation of CHIME's absorber search strategy, and demonstrate CHIME's ability to discover new absorbers even in small subsets of its full dataset.

          C and N abundances in globular clusters. I. The case of 47 Tuc and the effect of the first dredge-up

 - **Abstract**
 Globular clusters exhibit star-to-star chemical variations, traceable through both photometric and spectroscopic data. In this study, we investigate chemical variations in the globular cluster NGC104 (47Tucanae), aiming to trace multiple stellar populations across evolutionary phases and examine how the C/N anti-correlation evolves from the main sequence (MS) to the asymptotic giant branch (AGB). We also assess the impact of these populations on the interpretation of the V vs. V-I diagram. [C/Fe] and [N/Fe] abundances are obtained from CN and the CH features, while atmospheric parameters are homogeneously derived from photometry. The inferred abundances allow us to disentangle multiple populations along the CMD and refine cluster parameters. We find that MS stars are more C- and N-rich than their red giant branch, horizontal branch, and AGB counterparts. The C/N anti-correlation shifts during the sub-giant branch phase, coinciding with the first dredge-up. Interestingly, stars with different C and N abundances occupy distinct regions of the V vs V-I diagram, a pattern not attributable to differential reddening. Proper CMD fitting requires two isochrones with differing helium content, metallicity, and possibly age.

 - **Abstract**
 Primordial black hole (PBH) binaries experience strong gravitational perturbations in the case of their initial clustering, which significantly affects the dynamics of their mergers. In this work, we develop a new formalism to account for these perturbations and track the evolution of the binary orbital parameters distribution. Based on this approach, we calculate the merger rate of PBH binaries and demonstrate that its temporal evolution differs greatly from that of isolated binary systems. Moreover, PBH clustering produces distinctive features in the stochastic gravitational-wave background: the canonical $2/3$ spectral slope transforms to $\Omega_{\rm gw} \propto \nu^{-65/28}$ in a certain frequency band. These predictions can be probed in future gravitational wave observations, opening up new opportunities to test the clustering of PBHs and their contribution to dark matter.

 - **Abstract**
 Although the standard cosmological model is capable of explaining most current observational data, it faces some theoretical and observational issues. This is the main motivation for exploring alternative cosmological models. In this paper, we focus on a novel proposal that consists in adding an infinite tower of higher-order curvature invariants to the usual Einstein-Hilbert action. We obtain the late-time background evolution for three families of models that can be obtained from this proposal. We use recent data from Cosmic Chronometers and type Ia supernovae to test the late-time predictions of our models. In addition, we consider estimations from the Age of the Older Globular Clusters to constrain our models. While some of the studied cases are ruled out by the data, we show that there are particular cases of the GILA model that can explain current data.

 We present a new program aimed at developing a new generation of micromirror devices specifically tailored for astronomical applications, multi-slit spectroscopy in particular. We first overview the general characteristics of Multi-Object-Spectrographs based on the current Digital Micromirror Devices (DMDs), with particular focus on the newly deployed SAMOS instrument at the 4.1 m SOAR telescope on Cerro Pachon. We illustrate the operational advantages of DMD-based instruments and the technical limitations of the currently available devices, the DMDs produced by Texas Instruments (TI). We then introduce the baseline and target parameters of the new Micro-Mirror-Devices (MMDs) that we plan to develop with the goal of reaching TRL-5 by mid-2029 as required by the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) timeline. We conclude with a brief illustration of the exciting potential of MMD-based spectrographs for an 8 m class space telescope like HWO.

 - **Abstract**
 Using continuum and $\text{C}^{18}\text{O}\:(2-1)$ line data obtained from the large ALMA program FAUST, we studied the structure of the protostellar binary system L1551 IRS5 at scales between 30 and 3,000 au to constrain its properties, from the circumstellar and circumbinary disks up to the envelope and outflow scales, which exhibits complex and entangled structures at the scales of its inner and outer envelopes, presumably caused by the influence of the central binary. Assuming a dust-to-gas ratio of 100, we calculated the dust+gas mass for the circumbinary disk and each circumstellar disk of the binary, obtaining 0.018 M$_{\odot}$, for the circumbinary disk, 0.004 M$_{\odot}$, and 0.002 M$_{\odot}$, for the northern and southern circumstellar disk respectively. From the line emission, we retrieved the gas masses for each structure component. With the $\text{C}^{18}\text{O}\:(2-1)$ PV diagram along the circumbinary disk, we were able to constrain the centrifugal barrier, $r_{CB}=55$ au, update the specific angular momentum, $j\sim270$~au~km~s$^{-1}$. We built an analytical model that can be used to predict the influence of the morphology of the outflow and a few dynamic features that can reproduce the system emission, allowing us to explain and discern the outflow contribution from the complex emission due to the binary. Additionally, we inferred the density power law index, $\alpha=1.7$, and the envelope rotation velocity, $v_{c}=2$~km~s$^{-1}$. Finally, the observations gave us the physical constraints to obtain a coherent outflow model for L1551 IRS5.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the detection of a burst of emission over a 695.5 MHz-1031.5 MHz bandwidth by the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder, ASKAP. The burst was localised through analysis of near-field time delays to the long-decommissioned Relay 2 satellite, and exhibited a dispersion measure of $2.26 \cdot 10^{-5}$ pc cm$^{-3}$ -- 69.7 TECU, consistent with expectations for a single pass through the ionosphere. After coherent dedispersion, the burst was determined to be less than 30 ns in width, with an average flux density of at least 300 kJy. We consider an electrostatic discharge (ESD) or plasma discharge following a micrometeoroid impact to be plausible explanations for the burst. ESDs have previously been observed with the Arecibo radio telescope, but on 1000 times longer timescales. Our observation opens new possibilities for the remote sensing of ESD, which poses a serious threat to spacecraft, and reveals a new source of false events for observations of astrophysical transients.

 - **Abstract**
 The Large Millimeter Telescope Alfonso Serrano (LMT), is the largest millimeter radio telescope in the world, and was founded in 2006. This radio telescope is the final product of a collaboration agreement between Mexico and the United States in the 1990s. It is located on top of an extinct volcano in Mexico at an altitude of 4600 meters above sea level. In 2018, the University of Manchester and the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory signed an agreement with the Instituto Nacional de Astrofisica Optica y Electronica (INAOE) to train Mexican astronomers in high-frequency radio receiver construction techniques by designing an innovative device called Collaborative Heterodyne Amplifier Receiver for Mexico (CHARM) designed to work at a frequency of 345 GHz. The research team, composed of British and Mexican technicians and scientists, installed CHARM at the LMT in 2019 and began testing the equipment until the COVID-19 pandemic shut it down in March 2020. This paper describes the collaboration process between Mexico and the United Kingdom, facilitated by a British institution dedicated to supporting scientific projects in developing countries, the Global Challenges Research Fund (GCRF).

 Data tables on the equation of state (EOS) and microscopic structures for cold dense stellar matter with proton fractions $Y_p =0.01$-$0.65$ and baryon number densities $n_\text{b}=10^{-8}$-$2 \ \mathrm{fm}^{-3}$ are obtained adopting 13 different relativistic density functionals, i.e., NL3, PK1, PK1r, GM1, MTVTC, DD-LZ1, PKDD, DD-ME2, TW99, DD-MEX, DD-MEX1, DD-MEX2, and DD-MEY. The EOSs of dense stellar matter inside neutron stars with baryon number densities $n_\text{b}=7.6\times 10^{-11}$-$2 \ \mathrm{fm}^{-3}$ are obtained as well fulfilling $\beta$-stability condition. In general, the dense stellar matter exhibits droplet phase at $n_\mathrm{b}\lesssim 0.015\ \mathrm{fm}^{-3}$, while more exotic structures such as rods, slabs, tubes, and bubbles appear sequentially as density increases. The critical proton fractions $Y_p^\mathrm{drip}$ ($\approx 0.26$-0.31) for neutron drip are obtained, where neutron gas emerges outside of nuclei at $Y_p< Y_p^\mathrm{drip}$. For dense stellar matter at small densities ($n_\text{b}\lesssim 10^{-5} \ \mathrm{fm}^{-3}$) or large proton fractions ($n_\text{b}\lesssim0.1 \ \mathrm{fm}^{-3}$ and $Y_p\gtrsim Y_p^\mathrm{drip}$), the EOSs and microscopic structures are generally insensitive to the adopted density functionals. With the onset of neutron drip at $Y_p\lesssim Y_p^\mathrm{drip}$, the uncertainties emerge and peak at $n_\text{b} \approx 0.02 \ \mathrm{fm}^{-3}$ within the range $10^{-5} \lesssim n_\text{b}\lesssim0.1 \ \mathrm{fm}^{-3}$. At $n_\text{b}\gtrsim0.1 \ \mathrm{fm}^{-3}$, the dense stellar matter becomes uniform and muons eventually appear, where the uncertainties in the EOSs grow significantly.

          Addressing the $H_0$ tension through matter with pressure and no early dark energy

 - **Abstract**
 We propose that the Hubble tension arises due to an unaccounted additional component, that behaves as \emph{matter with pressure}. We demonstrate that this fluid remains subdominant compared to both dust and radiation throughout nearly the entire universe expansion history. Specifically, the additional fluid satisfies the Zel'dovic limit with a constant equation of state, $\omega_s > 0$, and a quite small normalized energy density, $\Omega_s$. Accordingly, this component modifies both the sound horizon and the background expansion rate, \emph{acting quite differently from early dark energy models}, without significantly affecting the other cosmological parameters. To show this, we perform a Monte Carlo Markov chain analysis of our model, hereafter dubbed $\Lambda_{\omega_s}$CDM paradigm, using the publicly available \texttt{CLASS} Boltzmann code. Our results confirm the presence of this fluid, with properties that closely resemble those of radiation. We find best-fit values that satisfy $\omega_s \lesssim \omega_\gamma$ and a relative energy density $\Omega_s / \Omega_\gamma = 0.45$, with $\omega_r$ and $\Omega_r$ the equation of state and density of photons, respectively. The effective fluid may be associated with generalized K-essence models or, alternatively, with Proca-type vector fields, albeit we do not exclude \emph{a priori} more exotic possibilities, i.e., dark radiation, axions, and so on. Physical implications of our results are analyzed in detail, indicating a statistical preference for the $\Lambda_{\omega_s}$CDM scenario over the conventional $\Lambda$CDM background.

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze the CS (J=2-1) line cube from the internal data release obtained by the large-scale program "ALMA CMZ Exploration Survey (ACES)" to investigate the kinematic structure of the innermost $\sim 10$ pc region of the Galaxy, which contains the high-velocity compact cloud (HVCC) at $(l,b,v_{\rm lsr})\sim(+0^\circ.02,-0^\circ.02, 100 {\rm km~s}^{-1})$ (hereafter G0.02). The longitude-velocity diagram (LVD) of the cloud draws an elliptical structure, which is interpreted as an orbital trajectory in the $(l,V_{\rm lsr})$ space of a noncircular (eccentric) motion of the molecular gas in the gravitational potential of an extended mass distribution in the central 10 pc of the Galaxy. We argue that G0.02 is a kinematic tracer of the inner potential, a rare case of a dense gas following an eccentric orbit in the nuclear gravitational field.

 - **Abstract**
 We numerically analyze quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) using a well-established spacetime model with neutron star sources. Within the framework of general relativity, we present expressions for the fundamental frequencies of test particles in the gravitational field of a slowly rotating and slightly deformed compact object defined by the Hartle-Thorne (HT) metric. Using the Relativistic Precession Model (RPM) formulated by Stella and Morinsk, we examine quasiperiodic oscillation data from eight neutron stars in low-mass X-ray binary systems. Employing Markov Chain Monte Carlo analyses with the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, we estimate 1-$\sigma$ and 2-$\sigma$ error bars. Finally, we compare our results with predictions from the Schwarzschild, Lense-Thirring, and Kerr metrics, demonstrating that three of the eight sources can be well explained within the Hartle-Thorne model.

 - **Abstract**
 We present results from an experimental study on the interaction of atomic deuterium with Mg-rich amorphous enstatite and forsterite type silicates. Infrared spectroscopy was used to examine the process. During D atom exposure, deuteroxyl group formation was observed. The cross section for OD group formation, estimated from the OD stretching band intensity with D atom fluence, is 4.2.10^{-18} cm^2 for both silicates. HD (D2) molecules form via D atom abstraction of chemisorbed H(D) atoms from OH (OD) groups, with a cross section of 7.0.10^{-18} cm^2. Quantum chemical calculations on enstatite and forsterite amorphous nano-clusters were used to analyze chemisorption and abstraction energies of H atoms. The formation of OH groups on forsterite is barrierless, while enstatite has a small energy barrier. H2 abstraction from hydroxyl groups is barrierless in both silicates. The results support our interpretation of IR spectral changes during D atom exposure as addition and exchange reactions, with catalytic molecular deuterium formation. These findings, obtained at 300 K, are relevant to astrophysical environments like photodissociation regions and interstellar clouds at lower temperatures. Amorphous silicates, like carbon grains, undergo hydrogenation in the diffuse interstellar medium due to interactions with atomic hydrogen and UV photons. The detection of these components on comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko connects primitive solar system objects to interstellar dust, offering new insights into their evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Astronomical surveys produce time-series data by observing stellar objects across multiple wavelength bands. Foundational transformer-based models, such as Astromer, encode each time-series as a sequence of embeddings of uniform dimensions. However, such models operate independently on each band at a single time and do not natively leverage information across telescope filters. We extend this framework by introducing a fusion mechanism that maps the collection of single-band embeddings to a unified sequence representation, enabling multiband modeling for downstream tasks. The challenge lies in devising a mechanism within the encoder to coordinate between data from different wavelengths, which are often recorded at asynchronous times. We pre-train multiband models on a subset of 600000 high signal-to-noise light curves from the MACHO survey and fine-tune them using the Alcock and ATLAS survey datasets. Experimental results show that both our proposed multiband architectures outperform the single-band models by approximately 10% in F1-score, with jointly pre-trained multiband encoders further improving performance over a collection of independently pre-trained single-band encoders. Furthermore, our experiments show that there are minimal differences in multiband performance when sampling individual band data asynchronously versus sampling all individual bands on the same set of time-steps. However, jointly pre-trained models can take more than twice the time to pre-train. These results demonstrate the trade-offs of the multiband approach where multivariate data are available.

 - **Abstract**
 We have developed a 1D planetary atmosphere model that solves in a self-consistent manner the evolution of temperature and disequilibrium chemistry in the vertical direction. Thermochemical kinetics is based on a reaction network built from scratch that includes 164 gaseous species composed of H, C, N, O, S, Si, P, Ti, He, and Ar, connected by 2352 forward reactions. The model is applied to the well-known gas giant exoplanets WASP-33b, HD209458b, HD189733b, GJ436b, and GJ1214b, and to secondary atmospheres that exoplanets characterized in the future may plausibly have. For irradiated gas giants with solar or supersolar metallicity, the corrections to the temperature due to disequilibrium chemistry are relatively small, on the order of 100 K at most, in agreement with previous studies. Although the atmospheric composition of some of these planets deviates significantly from chemical equilibrium, the impact on the temperature is moderate because the abundances of the main atmospheric species that provide opacity, such as H2O, CO2, CO, and/or CH4, are not seriously modified by disequilibrium chemistry. An impact on the temperature greater than 100 K appears in hot Jupiters due to TiO, which is predicted to be seriously depleted by UV photons in the upper layers. However, the extent of this depletion, and thus of its impact on the temperature, is uncertain due to the lack of knowledge about TiO photodestruction. In secondary atmospheres, the impact of disequilibrium chemistry on the temperature depends on the composition. In atmospheres dominated by H2O and/or CO2 the temperature is not affected to an important extent. However, reducing atmospheres dominated by CH4 and oxidizing atmospheres dominated by O2 see their temperature being seriously affected due to the important processing of the atmospheric composition induced by disequilibrium chemistry.

 - **Abstract**
 The energy spectrum of cosmic rays above 2.5 EeV has been measured across the declination range $-90^\circ \leq\delta\leq +44.8^\circ$ using data from $\sim 310{,}000$ events accrued at the Pierre Auger Observatory from an exposure of $(104{,}900\pm 3{,}100)$ km$^2\,$sr$\,$yr. No significant variations of energy spectra with declination are observed, after allowing or not for non-uniformities across the sky arising from the well-established dipolar anisotropies in the arrival directions of ultra-high energy cosmic rays. Additionally, the instep feature in the spectrum at $\simeq$ 10 EeV reported previously is now established at a significance above $5\,\sigma$. The quasi-uniformity of the energy spectrum across declinations disfavors an origin for the instep from a few distinctive sources.

 - **Abstract**
 Thousands of exoplanets orbit nearby stars, showcasing a remarkable diversity in mass, size, and orbits. With the James Webb Space Telescope now operational, we are observing exoplanet atmospheres and aiming to reach down to small, habitable-zone exoplanets in search of signs of habitability and possibly even biosignature gases. Given the scarcity of targets, it is imperative to embrace the known diversity and consider the range of exoplanets that might host life. We review how Earth life interacts with various atmospheric gases, noting that bacteria can survive in high concentrations of gases such as H2, He, CO2, and CO. Additionally, we consider the potential for life in alternative solvents and in cloud biospheres where rocky surfaces are excessively hot, as well as in hypothesized planetary global oceans. We highlight that life fundamentally requires metal ions for catalytic reactions, suggesting that environments without surface contact need meteoritic delivery to provide these essential elements. Despite today's observational limits, a suite of next-generation telescopes is being designed specifically for exoplanet studies, promising to expand our capabilities and understanding in the future.

 - **Abstract**
 The interpretation of the thermal evolution of the transiently accreting neutron stars MXB 1659-29 and KS 1731-260 after an outburst is challenging, both within the traditional deep-crustal heating paradigm and the thermodynamically consistent approach of Gusakov and Chugunov that accounts for neutron diffusion throughout the crust. All these studies assume that the neutron superfluid in the crust is at rest. However, we have recently shown that a finite superflow could exist and could lead to a new gapless superfluid phase if quantized vortices are pinned. We have revisited the cooling of MXB 1659-29 and KS 1731-260 and we have found that gapless superfluidity could naturally explain their late time cooling. We pursue here our investigation by performing new simulations of the thermal relaxation of the crust of MXB 1659-29 and KS 1731-260 within a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method accounting for neutron diffusion and allowing for gapless superfluidity. We have varied the global structure of the neutron star, the composition of the heat-blanketing envelope, and the mass accretion rate. In all cases, observations are best fitted by models with gapless superfluidity. Finally, we make predictions that could be tested by future observations.

 - **Abstract**
 The two giant protoplanets directly imaged in the dust-depleted cavity of PDS 70 offer a unique opportunity to study ongoing planet formation. Both planets have been detected in infrared thermal emission and in H$\alpha$, indicating active accretion. We calibrate and analyse archival ALMA Band 6 and 7 observations of PDS 70 from 2019, 2021, and 2023 to search for circumplanetary material and assess its motion. Using 2D visibility modelling of the high-resolution (~0.11"x0.08" in Band 6; ~0.05"x0.05" in Band 7) dust continuum from the outer disc, we subtract the model and image the cavity at multiple epochs. We re-detect compact dust emission around PDS 70 c in all datasets with >$3.8\sigma$ significance, and tentatively detect emission near PDS 70 b at ~$3\sigma$ in Band 6, with peak fluxes of $59\pm17\mu$Jy/beam and $46\pm14\mu$Jy/beam. The relative astrometry of the compact emission around PDS 70 c is consistent with the expected position of the planet between 2019-2023. We find a peak flux difference up to $64\pm34\mu$Jy/beam at 1$\sigma$, but Bayesian analysis indicates no significant variability. We detect no flux variability in the inner disc. The inferred dust mass near PDS 70 c and in the inner disc ranges from $0.008$-$0.063 M_\oplus$ and $0.04$-$0.31 M_\oplus$, respectively, consistent with prior estimates. Finally, we measure Band 6-7 spectral indices of $2.5\pm1.2$ (PDS 70 c) and $3.2\pm0.5$ (inner disc), suggesting that the inner disc emission is dominated by optically thin dust.

 - **Abstract**
 The next generation of radio surveys is going to be transformative for cosmology and other aspects of our understanding of astrophysics. Realistic simulations of radio observations are essential for the design and planning of radio surveys. They are employed in the development of methods for tasks, such as data calibration and reduction, automated analysis and statistical studies in cosmology. We implemented a software for machine learning-assisted simulations of realistic surveys with the LOFAR telescope, resulting in a synthetic radio sky model and a corresponding artificial telescope observation. We employed a diffusion model trained on LoTSS observations to generate individual radio galaxy images with control over the angular size. Single sources are assembled into a radio sky model, using an input catalog from cosmological simulations. We then transformed this sky model into visibilities corresponding to a typical LoTSS pointing. We added realistic noise to this synthetic measurement and obtained our final simulated sky maps through deconvolution. We explored different ways to evaluate our resulting sky model. We were able to simulate realistic LOFAR observations, covering a sky patch of 5x5 degrees at an effective resolution of 8.5 arcseconds. The simulated sources have flux and size distributions that match real observations, and the resulting maps have sensitivities compatible with LoTSS observations. Our diffusion model is able to synthesize high-quality realistic radio galaxy images with precise control over the source sizes. This software can readily be applied to other instruments.

          ALMA millimetre-wavelength imaging of HD 138965: New constraints on the debris dust composition and presence of planetary companions

 - **Abstract**
 HD 138965 is a young A type star and member of the nearby young Argus association. This star is surrounded by a broad, bright debris disc with two temperature components that was spatially resolved at far-infrared wavelengths by Herschel. Here we present ALMA millimetre-wavelength imaging of the cool outer belt. These reveal its radial extent to be $150^{+10}_{-7}$ au with a width ($\sigma$) of 49$^{+7}_{-6}$ au (${\Delta}R/R$ = 0.77), at a moderate inclination of 49$\fdeg$9^{+3.3}_{-3.7}$. Due to the limited angular resolution, signal-to-noise, and inclination we have no constraint on the disc's vertical scale height. We modelled the disc emission with both gravitational and radiation forces acting on the dust grains. As the inner belt has not been spatially resolved, we fixed its radius and width prior to modelling the outer belt. We find astronomical silicate is the best fit for the dust composition. However, we could not reject possible scenarios where there are at least 10 \% water-ice inclusions. Combining the spatially resolved imaging by ALMA with non-detection at optical wavelengths by HST, we obtain a limit on the scattering albedo $\omega \leq 0.09$ for the debris dust in the outer belt. Analysis of the outer belt's architecture in conjunction with simple stirring models places a mass limit of $2.3~\pm~0.4 M_{\rm Jup}$ on a companion interior to the belt ($a \leq 78$ au), a factor of two improvement over constraints from high contrast imaging.

 - **Abstract**
 Building on the recent lattice simulations of ultra-slow-roll (USR) dynamics presented in arXiv:2410.23942, we investigate the role of the nonlinear relation between the inflaton field configuration and the curvature perturbation $\zeta$, the key observable after inflation. Using a nonperturbative $\delta N$ approach applied to the lattice output, we generate fully nonlinear three-dimensional maps of $\zeta$. This calculation captures both the non-Gaussianity arising from the nonlinear mapping between $\phi$ and $\zeta$, and the intrinsic non-Gaussianity generated around Hubble crossing by the nonlinear field dynamics, which is neglected in stochastic approaches. We find that the nonlinear mapping has a profound impact on the statistics, significantly enhancing the positive tail of the $\zeta$ probability distribution, with important implications for observable quantities. A central part of this work is the comparison with the standard perturbative treatment based on a gauge transformation, which allows us to quantify when and how the perturbative picture breaks down as fluctuations grow large. Together with arXiv:2410.23942, this work sets the basis for robust, nonperturbative predictions of primordial black hole production and scalar-induced gravitational wave emission from inflation using lattice simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 InflationEasy is the first lattice code specifically developed for cosmological inflation. It simulates the nonlinear dynamics of a scalar field on a three-dimensional lattice in an expanding FLRW universe, using finite-difference spatial derivatives and a staggered leapfrog integrator for time evolution. Based in part on the well-known LATTICEEASY, it incorporates several improvements tailored to inflationary applications. Among other features, InflationEasy implements a nonperturbative $\delta N$ method to compute the curvature perturbation at the end of inflation $\zeta$ directly from the lattice, enabling fully nonlinear studies of scenarios with large fluctuations or nonperturbative non-Gaussianities. The code supports a broad range of inflationary models, including those relevant for primordial black hole formation, gravitational wave production, and large-scale structure. This makes InflationEasy a versatile and lightweight tool for studying inflationary dynamics beyond the reach of perturbation theory.

 - **Abstract**
 We derive analytical expressions for the growth factor, $D(z)$, and density-weighted growth rate, $f\sigma_8(z)$, for coasting cosmologies, in which the scale factor is a linear function of time. We fit the latter to data from redshift space distortion measurements in the redshift range $z<2$ using the \texttt{dynesty} implementation of a nested sampling algorithm. In total, four models are tested: three coasting models with curvature parameters ${k=\{-1, 0, +1\}}$ in $H^2_0c^{-2}$ units, as well as a flat $\Lambda$CDM model. We evaluate each model's consistency with the data by applying an Anderson-Darling test for normality on the normalized residuals. For the coasting models, we obtained ${\Omega_\mathrm{m,0}=\{ 0.206^{+0.073}_{-0.061},\, 0.297^{+0.085}_{-0.073},\, 0.412^{+0.097}_{-0.086}}\}$ and ${\sigma_{8}(z=0)=\{1.071^{+0.213}_{-0.151},\,0.867^{+0.128}_{-0.097},\,0.725^{+0.080}_{-0.065}\}}$. Fitting the $\Lambda$CDM model yielded ${\{\Omega_\mathrm{m,0}=0.286_{-0.047}^{+0.053},\,\sigma_{8}(z=0)= 0.764_{-0.035}^{+0.039}\}}$. All four models are consistent with the data, though coasting models are weakly favored over the $\Lambda$CDM model, with $\log$-Bayes factors of ${\log_{10}{\mathcal{B}} = \{0.197,\, 0.234,\,0.272\}}$. We also examined whether the $S_8$ tension can be resolved by linear expansion restricted to $z<2$. The curve fitting yielded ${S_8=\{0.890^{+0.024}_{-0.024},\,0.865^{+0.024}_{-0.024},\,0.850^{+0.026}_{-0.026}\}}$ for the ${k=\{-1, 0, +1\}}$ coasting models, respectively, resulting in ${\Delta S^\mathrm{Coasting}_8=\{1.94\sigma,\,1.07\sigma,\,0.52\sigma\}}$ discrepancies with the standard $\textit{Planck}$ 2018 value. The tension level was the highest for the $\Lambda$CDM model, as the constraint from our fit is $S_8=0.746^{+0.041}_{-0.039}$, indicating a tension level of ${\Delta S_8^{\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}}=2.00\sigma}$.

 - **Abstract**
 Axion inflation models coupled to a gauge sector via a Chern-Simons term exhibit an array of interesting phenomenology including a chiral gravitational wave spectrum and primordial black hole production. They may also provide a useful mechanism for generating lepton asymmetry. The possibility to embed this class of models in UV-finite theories and their intriguing, testable, signatures make for a compelling candidate for early acceleration. Due to the Chern-Simons coupling, gauge modes may undergo a finite tachyonic growth during which non-linearities become important. Naturally, this raises the question of whether such (self) interactions can lead to thermalization during inflation. We provide a set of conservative criteria for sustained thermalization in an axion-$SU(2)$ model and chart the parameter space of the model accordingly. We find that the cold inflation regime constitutes a very significant fraction of the parameter space. Our analysis accounts for a initially vanishing as well as non-zero gauge field vacuum expectation value (VEV). We also consider the possibility of a dynamically generated VEV.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmological constraints derived from weak lensing (WL) surveys are limited by baryonic effects, which suppress the non-linear matter power spectrum on small scales. By combining WL measurements with data from external tracers of the gas around massive structures, it is possible to calibrate baryonic effects and, therefore, obtain more precise cosmological constraints. In this study, we generate mock data for a Stage-IV weak lensing survey such as the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), X-ray gas fractions, and stacked kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) measurements, to jointly constrain cosmological and astrophysical parameters describing baryonic effects (using the Baryon Correction Model - BCM). First, using WL data alone, we quantify the level to which the BCM parameters will need to be constrained to recover the cosmological constraints obtained under the assumption of perfect knowledge of baryonic feedback. We identify the most relevant baryonic parameters and determine that they must be calibrated to a precision of $\sim 10$-$20\%$ to avoid significant degradation of the fiducial WL constraints. We forecast that long-term X-ray data from $\sim 5000$ clusters should be able to reach this threshold for the parameters that characterise the abundance of hot virialised gas. Constraining the distribution of ejected gas presents a greater challenge, however, but we forecast that long-term kSZ data from a CMB-S4-like experiment should achieve the level of precision required for full self-calibration.

 - **Abstract**
 When neutron stars accrete matter from a companion star, this matter forms a disc around them and eventually falls on their surface. Here, the fuel can ignite into bright flashes called Type I bursts. Theoretical calculations based on state-of-the-art nuclear reactions are able to explain many features of the bursts. However, models predict that the bursts should cease at high accretion rates, whereas in many sources they disappear at much lower rates. Moreover, their recurrence times also show strong discrepancies with predictions. Although various solutions have been proposed, none can account for all the observational constraints. Here we describe a new model that explains all the contradictory behaviours within a single picture. We are able to reconstruct the conditions on the star surface that determine the burst properties by comparing data to new simulations. We find strong evidence that the physical mechanism driving the burst behaviour is the structure of the accretion disc in the regions closest to the star. This connection reconciles the puzzling burst phenomenology with nuclear physics and also opens a new window on the study of accretion processes around compact objects.

 - **Abstract**
 We present observations of two binary systems within the cold classical region of the Kuiper belt -- 2001 XR254 and 2016 BP81 -- obtained with the JWST Near-Infrared Spectrograph. The measured reflectance spectrum of 2001 XR254 is characteristic of the red cold classicals, with strong features due to carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and methanol ices. In contrast, 2016 BP81 is a blue binary, with a water-ice-rich surface composition. The two components of the 2016 BP81 binary display identical spectral profiles, consistent with coeval formation from gravitational collapse. Through qualitative and quantitative comparisons of water-ice-rich Kuiper belt objects observed with JWST, we identify a small subclass, including 2016 BP81, that appears to differ in systematic ways from the rest of the population. The relatively deep carbon dioxide ice absorption bands and enhanced signatures of aliphatic organics suggest that objects within this subclass may have originated in a distinct formation environment from the other water-ice-rich Kuiper belt objects. The implications of our findings are discussed within the context of recent models of Kuiper belt formation and evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 TOI-3884~b is an unusual 6.4~R$_\oplus$ planet orbiting an M4 host, whose transits display large and persistent spot-crossing events. We used the \textit{Tierras} Observatory to monitor both the long-term photometric variability of TOI-3884 and changes in the spot-crossing events across multiple transits of the planet. We show that the star rotates with a period of $11.021 \pm 0.014$~days. We simultaneously model the rotational modulation of the star and variations in transit shapes that arise due to rotation of the spot, allowing us to determine the true stellar obliquity, $\psi_\star$. The data are best described by a planet on a misaligned orbit around a highly inclined star ($\psi_\star = {76.1^\circ} ^{+2.2^\circ}_{-2.6^\circ}$; $i_\star = {24.4^\circ}^{+1.8^\circ}_{-1.4^\circ}$) that hosts a large polar starspot ($r_\mathrm{spot} = {33.1^\circ}^{+2.0^\circ}_{-1.9^\circ}$; $\lambda_\mathrm{spot} = {79.4^\circ}^{+1.4^\circ}_{-1.2^\circ}$). Archival photometry from the Zwicky Transient Facility suggests that this polar spot has persisted on TOI-3884 for at least seven years. The TOI-3884 system provides a benchmark for studying the evolution of a polar spot on an M dwarf.

 Baryon acoustic oscillation data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) show evidence of a deviation from a cosmological constant $\Lambda$ within a Bayesian analysis. In this work, we validate that frequentist constraints from profile likelihoods on the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder parameters $w_0$, $w_a$ are in excellent agreement with the Bayesian constraints when combining with Planck cosmic microwave background, Planck and Atacama Cosmology Telescope lensing, and either Pantheon+ or Dark Energy Survey Y5 supernova data. Further, we assess which datasets drive these constraints by considering the contributions to the $\chi^2$ from the individual datasets. For profile likelihoods of the matter fraction $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$, such an investigation shows internal inconsistencies when assuming $\Lambda$, which are resolved when assuming a $w_0w_a$ dark-energy model. We infer the equations of state $w(z)$ at the pivot redshifts, supporting previous interpretations that current data appears to be more sensitive to the derivative of $w(z)$ rather than a mean offset from $\Lambda$. Thus our frequentist analysis corroborates previous findings on dynamical DE.

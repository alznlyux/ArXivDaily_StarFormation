 - **Abstract**
 The search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) targeted searches aim to observe specific areas and objects to find possible technosignatures. Many SETI researches have focused on nearby stars and their planets in recent years. In this paper, we report a targeted SETI observations using the most sensitive L-band Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) toward three nearby M dwarfs, all of which have been discovered exoplanet candidates. The minimum equivalent isotropic radiant power of the lower limit from the three sources we can detect is $6.19 \times 10^{8}$ W, which is well within the reach of current human technology. Applying the multibeam coincidence matching (MBCM) blind search mode, we search for narrowband drifting signals across 1.05-1.45 GHz in each of the two orthogonal linear polarization directions. An unusual signal at 1312.50 MHz detected from the observation toward AD Leo originally piqued our interest. However, we finally eliminate the possibility of an extraterrestrial origin based on much evidence, such as the polarization, frequency, and beam coverage characteristics.

 - **Abstract**
 The neutron star merger is a promising site of heavy element production. By producing heavy elements, the neutron star merger gives rise to a thermal transient called a kilonova. Studying kilonova spectra enables us to quantify the heavy element production. Among the heaviest elements, doubly ionized Thorium (Th, Z=90) is one of the important candidates for producing detectable absorption features in kilonova spectra. This paper investigates the atomic properties of Th III to provide energy level and transition data. The multiconfiguration Dirac-Hartree-Fock and relativistic configuration interaction methods, which are implemented in the general-purpose relativistic atomic structure package GRASP2018, are used to compute energy levels of the $\mathrm{5f6d}$, $\mathrm{6d^2}$, $\mathrm{7s^2}$, $5\mathrm{f^2}$, $\mathrm{6d7s}$, $\mathrm{5f7p}$ and $\mathrm{5f7s}$ configurations and electric dipole transitions between states of these configurations. The accuracy of energy levels is evaluated by comparing it with experimental data and with various theoretical methods. Our calculated energy levels are consistent with the experimental results with a root mean square (RMS) deviation of 436 cm$^{-1}$. The accuracy of transition data is investigated using the quantitative and qualitative evaluation this http URL performing radiative transfer simulations for kilonova spectra with our transition data, we show that kilonova including Th with a mass fraction of $(3-10) \times 10^{-5}$ can produce Th III absorption features around 18,000 A.

          General Constraints on Isocurvature from the CMB and Ly-$α$ Forest

 - **Abstract**
 Current cosmological data are well-described by the Lambda-Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model, which assumes adiabatic initial conditions for the primordial density perturbations. This agreement between data and theory enables strong constraints on new physics that generates isocurvature perturbations. Existing constraints typically assume a simple power law form for the isocurvature power spectrum. However, many new physics scenarios -- such as cosmological phase transitions and gravitational particle production -- can deviate from this assumption. To derive general constraints which apply to a wide variety of new physics scenarios, we consider four types of isocurvature modes (dark matter, baryon, dark radiation and neutrino density isocurvature) and parametrize the isocurvature power spectrum using two general forms: a delta function and a broken power law. Using data from the cosmic microwave background (CMB), baryon acoustic oscillations, the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest, and CMB spectral distortions, we place constraints on the isocurvature power spectrum across a wide range of scales, from $10^{-4}\,\textrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ to $10^{4}\,\textrm{Mpc}^{-1}$.

          Cluster Ages to Reconstruct the Milky Way Assembly (CARMA). II. The age-metallicity relation of Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus globular clusters

 - **Abstract**
 We present the age determination of 13 globular clusters dynamically associated with the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE) merger event, as part of the CARMA project effort to trace the Milky Way assembly history. We used deep and homogeneous archival $Hubble$ $Space$ $Telescope$ data, and applied isochrone-fitting to derive homogeneous age estimates. We find that the majority of the selected clusters form a well-defined age-metallicity relation, with a few outliers. Among these, NGC 288 and NGC 6205 are more than 2 Gyr older than the other GSE globular clusters at similar metallicity, and are therefore interpreted as of likely in-situ origin. Moreover, NGC 7099 is somewhat younger than the average GSE trend, this suggesting a possible alternative dwarf galaxy progenitor, while NGC 5286 is mildly older, as if its progenitor was characterised by an higher star-formation efficiency. Another remarkable feature of the resulting age-metallicity relation is the presence of two epochs of globular cluster formation, with a duration of $\sim0.3$ Gyr each and separated by $\sim2$ Gyr. These findings are in excellent agreement with the age-metallicity relation of halo field stars found by González-Koda et al., clearly hinting at episodic star-formation in GSE. The age of the two formation epochs is similar to the mean age of the two groups of in-situ globular clusters previously studied by CARMA. These epochs might therefore be precisely pinpointing two important dynamical events that GSE had with the Milky Way during its evolutionary history. Finally, we discuss the correlation between the recent determination of Si and Eu with the clusters age and origin.

          Probing the Origins I: Generalised Additive Model inference of birth radii for Milky Way stars in the solar vicinity

 - **Abstract**
 We employ a Generalised Additive Model (GAM) to address the limitations inherent in radial metallicity gradients predicted by chemical evolution models, thereby facilitating the estimation of birth radii for the thin disc stars in our sample based on their ages and chemical composition. We then juxtapose the birth radius predictions derived from the GAM with the calculated guiding radii, among other dynamic parameters. Metal-rich stars, formed in the inner regions of the Milky Way, seem to be predominantly churned outward. Their metal-poor counterparts, formed in the outer thin disc, exhibit the opposite behaviour. The proportion of blurred/undisturbed stars generally increases with decreasing metallicity when compared to their churned counterparts. Approximately $3/4$ of the sample has been affected by (inward or outward) churning, while the remaining $\sim 1/4$ has either been influenced by blurring or remained undisturbed. These percentages vary considerably across different metallicity-stratified groups. Also, a large age gap is identified between churned and blurred/undisturbed sub-samples within each HC-based group, being the outward-churned stars systematically the oldest, inward-churned stars the youngest, and blurred/undisturbed stars in intermediate ages. We also detect significant differences in angular momenta in the $z$ component, for stars that have either churned inward or outward, when compared to their blurred/undisturbed counterparts. Additionally, we observe the potential effects of the pericentric passage of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy in our most metal-poor subset of stars, formed in the outer disc. Finally, we estimate that the Sun's most probable birth radius is $7.08 \pm 0.24$ kpc, with a 3$\sigma$ range spanning from 6.46 to 7.81 kpc, in agreement with previous studies.

          Vlasov Perturbation Theory and the role of higher cumulants

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/
 - **Abstract**
 We develop a new approach to Vlasov Perturbation Theory (VPT) that solves for the hierarchy of cumulants of the phase-space distribution function to arbitrarily high truncation order in the context of cosmological structure formation driven by collisionless dark matter. We investigate the impact of higher cumulants on density and velocity power spectra as well as the bispectrum, and compare to scale-free $N$-body simulations. While there is a strong difference between truncation at the first cumulant, i.e. standard perturbation theory (SPT), and truncation at the second (i.e. including the velocity dispersion tensor), the third cumulant has a small quantitative impact and fourth and higher cumulants only have a minor effect on these summary statistics at weakly non-linear scales. We show that spurious exponential growth is absent in vector and tensor modes if scalar-mode constraints on the non-Gaussianity of the background distribution function that results from shell-crossing are satisfied, guaranteeing the screening of UV modes for all fluctuations of any type, as expected physically. We also show analytically that loop corrections to the power spectrum are finite within VPT for any initial power spectra consistent with hierarchical clustering, unlike SPT. Finally, we discuss the relation to and contrast our predictions with effective field theory (EFT), and discuss how the advantages of VPT and EFT approaches could be combined.

          Turbulence in virtual: I. Thermodynamic perspective of the $σ^2$-M relation

 - **Abstract**
 Turbulence is a mysterious phenomenon of physical systems and plays a critical role in the interstellar medium (ISM). We present a thermodynamic perspective on turbulence, aiming to explain the origin of the variance (\(\sigma^2\)) of the lognormal probability density function (PDF) of gas density caused by turbulence. By introducing a virtual dissipation process, in which the entropy-increasing processes of turbulent dissipation and structural dissipation are assumed to be coupled, we directly derive the empirical relation between the variance of the (near) log-normal PDF ($\sigma^2$) and the Mach number ($\mathcal{M}$): $\sigma^2 = \ln(1 + b^2\mathcal{M})^2$. We also explain why $b = 1$ for compressive forcing and $b = 1/D$ for solenoidal forcing, where $D$ is the dimension of the system. Furthermore, by introducing a delay parameter $q$ for the local gas temperature, we quantitatively derive the deviation of $\sigma^2$ from the empirical relation at high $\mathcal{M}$, which is consistent with previous simulations and observations.

 - **Abstract**
 While the number of detected molecules, particularly complex organic molecules, in the solid-state in astrophysical environments is still rather limited, laboratory experiments and astrochemical models predict many potential candidates. Detection of molecules in protoplanetary disks provides a bridge between the chemical evolution of the interstellar medium and the chemistry of planets and their atmospheres. The excellent spectral sensitivity, broad wavelength coverage and high spatial resolution of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) allows for making progress in exploring chemical compositions of various astrophysical environments including planet-forming disks. They are a prerequisite for probing the disk content by means of sensitive absorption studies. In this paper, we present initial results of the JWST Cycle 1 GO program 1741 on d216-0939, a highly inclined TTauri disk located in the outskirts of the Orion Nebula Cluster. We utilise the NIRSpec and MIRI integral field unit spectrographs to cover its spectrum from 1.7 to 28~$\mu$m. In the d216-0939 disk, we give assignments of the composition of silicate grains. We unambiguously detect solid-state features of H$_2$O, CO$_2$, $^{13}$CO$_2$, CO, OCN$^-$, and tentatively OCS; species that had been detected recently also in other circumstellar disks. For the first time in disks, we provide unique detections of ices carrying NH$_4^+$ and the complex organic molecule ammonium carbamate (NH$_4^+$NH$_2$COO$^-$). The latter detections speak for a very efficient NH$_3$ chemistry in the disk. We also show the very important role of scattering in the analysis of observational spectra of highly inclined disks.

 - **Abstract**
 This study investigates the potential of a pre-trained visual transformer (VT) model, specifically the Swin Transformer V2 (SwinV2), to classify photometric light curves without the need for feature extraction or multi-band preprocessing. The goal is to assess whether this image-based approach can accurately differentiate astronomical phenomena and serve as a viable option for working with multi-band photometric light curves. We transformed each multi-band light curve into an image. These images serve as input to the SwinV2 model, which is pre-trained on ImageNet-21K. The datasets employed include the public Catalog of Variable Stars from the Massive Compact Halo Object (MACHO) survey, using both one and two bands, and the first round of the recent Extended LSST Astronomical Time-Series Classification Challenge (ELAsTiCC), which includes six bands. The performance of the model was evaluated on six classes for the MACHO dataset and 20 distinct classes of variable stars and transient events for the ELAsTiCC dataset. The fine-tuned SwinV2 achieved better performance than models specifically designed for light curves, such as Astromer and the Astronomical Transformer for Time Series and Tabular Data (ATAT). When trained on the full MACHO dataset, it attained a macro F1-score of 80.2 and outperformed Astromer in single-band experiments. Incorporating a second band further improved performance, increasing the F1-score to 84.1. In the ELAsTiCC dataset, SwinV2 achieved a macro F1-score of 65.5, slightly surpassing ATAT by 1.3.

          Void and Density Walls Inhomogeneous Cosmic Web Cosmology

 - **Abstract**
 An approach to cosmological modelling is presented that incorporates the inhomogeneous structure of the Cosmic Web, specifically focusing on the interplay between cosmic voids and density walls. We extend the standard homogeneous and isotropic cosmological model to account for the observed large-scale structure of the universe. By modifying the Friedmann equations to include inhomogeneity terms representing voids and walls, we develop a more realistic description of cosmic evolution. Our model demonstrates how the presence of these structures affects the overall expansion rate of the universe and the growth of perturbations. We find that accounting for this inhomogeneous distribution leads to significant deviations from the predictions of standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology in the late-time universe. The Hubble and $\sigma_8$ structure growth tensions are addressed in the void-density wall model, leading to a resolution of these tensions. These results have important implications for the interpretation of cosmological observations when including the void and density wall Cosmic Web inhomogeneities.

          JWST COMPASS: NIRSpec/G395H Transmission Observations of TOI-776 c, a 2 Rearth M Dwarf Planet

 - **Abstract**
 The atmospheres of planets between the size of Earth and Neptune at short orbital periods have been under intense scrutiny. Of the ~dozen planets in this regime with atmospheres studied so far, a few appear to have prominent molecular features while others appear relatively void of detectable atmospheres. Further work is therefore needed to understand the atmospheres of these planets, starting with observing a larger sample. To this end, we present the 3-5 micron transmission spectrum of TOI-776 c, a warm (Teq ~420 K), ~2 Rearth, ~7 Mearth planet orbiting an M1V star, measured with JWST NIRSpec/G395H. By combining two visits, we measure a median transit precision of ~18 ppm and ~32 ppm in the NRS1 and NRS2 detectors, respectively. We compare the transmission spectrum to both non-physical and physical models, and find no strong evidence for molecular features. For cloud-top pressures larger than 10^-3 bar, we rule out atmospheric metallicities less than 180-240x solar (depending on the reduction and modeling technique), which corresponds to a mean molecular weight of ~6-8 g/mol. However, we find simple atmosphere mixture models (H2O+H2/He or CO2+H2/He) give more pessimistic constraints, and caution that mean molecular weight inferences are model dependent. We compare TOI-776 c to the similar planet TOI-270 d, and discuss possible options for further constraining TOI-776 c's atmospheric composition. Overall, we suggest these TOI-776 c observations may represent a combination of planetary and stellar parameters that fall just below the threshold of detectable features in small planet spectra; finding this boundary is one of the main goals of the COMPASS program.

          Surveying the Giant HII Regions of the Milky Way with SOFIA: VII. Galactic Center Regions Sgr B1, Sgr B2, and Sgr C

 - **Abstract**
 This study examines the mid-infrared properties of Giant HII (GHII) regions in the Milky Way's Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) -- Sgr B1, Sgr B2, and Sgr C -- using SOFIA-FORCAST imaging at 25 and 37 microns. It compares these mid-infrared data with previous multi-wavelength observations to explore their present star formation activity and global properties. The study identifies 77 massive young stellar object (MYSO) candidates in and around the three regions. Sgr B2 appears to host the youngest MYSOs and have much higher extinction than the other regions, containing several radio sources not detected in the mid-infrared even at 37 microns. Meanwhile, cm radio continuum regions of Sgr B1 shows remarkable correspondence to its mid-infrared emission. Sgr C has fewer confirmed MYSOs, and seems to have a higher fraction of low-mass young stellar objects and contamination from more evolved interloper/foreground stars. Derived MYSO densities are consistent with GHII regions elsewhere in the Galactic plane, though the CMZ GHII regions appear to have less prolific present star formation overall. Unlike Sgr B2, the cm continuum emission in Sgr B1 and Sgr C GHII regions appears to be absent cold dust and molecular gas, suggesting environmental differences, possibly driven by turbulence and rapid dynamical changes near the Galactic Center. Furthermore, unlike typical GHII regions, Sgr B1 and Sgr C are significantly ionized by evolved interloper stars, which likely did not form within these regions. In these ways, Sgr B1 and Sgr C deviate from classical GHII region behavior, thus potentially representing a new category of GHII region or challenging their classification as GHII regions.

          Orbital inclination of astrometric binaries and the dearth of face-on orbits in Gaia DR3 solutions

Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/
 - **Abstract**
 The orbital solutions for astrometric (unresolved) binary stars provided in the Gaia mission Data Release 3 reveal an obvious deficit of face-on orbits with line-of-sight inclinations close to 0 or $\pi$. This is shown to be an intrinsic mathematical feature of the orbit estimation technique involving the intermediate Thiele-Innes parameters, which are transformed to the Campbell geometric parameters. A direct condition equation defining the inclination angle via the Thiele-Innes values independently of the other orbital elements is used to investigate the origin of this near-degeneracy for face-on orbits. The emerging bias and correlation of inclination and semimajor axis are illustrated using Monte Carlo simulations for two specific template configurations representing face-on and edge-on orbits. The results have significant impact on the interpretation and follow-up confirmation of Gaia-detected binary systems, including candidate exoplanets and brown dwarf companions.

          Revised Mass and Orbit of $\varepsilon$ Eridani b: A 1 Jupiter-Mass Planet on a Near-Circular Orbit

 - **Abstract**
 The mature Jovian planet $\varepsilon$ Eridani b orbits one of the closest sun-like stars at a moderate separation of 3.5 AU, presenting one of the best opportunities to image a true analog to a solar system planet. We perform a thorough joint reanalysis and cross-validation of all available archival radial velocity and astrometry data, combining data from eight radial velocity instruments and four astrometric sources (Hipparcos, Hubble FGS, Gaia DR2, and Gaia DR3). We incorporate methodological advances that impact our findings including a principled treatment of correlation between Gaia DR2 and DR3 velocity and corrections for the changing light-travel time to this high proper motion system. We revise the planet's mass upward to $0.98 \pm 0.09 \, \mathrm{M_{jup}}$ and find that its orbit is nearly circular and close to coplanar with the outer debris disk. We further present one of the first models of an exoplanet orbit exclusively from absolute astrometry and independently confirm the planet's orbital period. We make specific predictions for the planet's location at key imaging epochs from past and future observing campaigns. We discuss and resolve tensions between previous works regarding the eccentricity, inclination, and mass. Our results further support that $\varepsilon$ Eridani b is one of the closest analogs to a Solar System planet yet detected around a nearby star.

 - **Abstract**
 Eclipsing double-lined spectroscopic binaries hosting $\delta$ Scuti-type pulsators offer a unique laboratory for simultaneously constraining stellar geometry and interior structure. In this study, we present a comprehensive analysis of five oscillating eclipsing Algol binaries. By combining high-precision, short-cadence TESS photometry with multi-epoch high-resolution spectroscopy, we derive precise stellar and orbital parameters. Frequency power spectra were obtained using residuals from binary modelling. We further investigate the evolutionary history of these systems using a grid of MESA binary evolution simulations. Our analysis suggests that the systems must have undergone either case A or case B mass transfer, with the primary components repositioned in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram and now pulsating in the $\delta$ Scuti regime, while the cooler secondaries are underluminous and inflated, filling their Roche lobes. This study contributes to the growing catalog of well-characterised oEA systems and our understanding of the effects of mass-transfer on the fate of these short-period binaries.

 - **Abstract**
 T CrB is among the brightest novae. It is recurrent with outbursts happening approximately every 80 years. The next outburst is imminent, expected in 2025. The T CrB binary consists of an M4 III red giant (RG) secondary and a white dwarf (WD) primary. A time series of spectra of the RG was obtained between 2022 and 2024. Radial velocities (RVs) from these data were combined with literature RVs and an updated orbit computed. The orbit is circular to a high precision and has a period of 227.5494 +/- 0.0049 days for the circular solution. An eccentric solution yields an eccentricity of 0.0072 +/- 0.0026. Rotational line broadening of the RG was also measured. Binary parameters are derived by maximum likelihood modeling of the available observational data. The WD, in accord with other estimates for recurrent novae, is massive. Assuming the Gaia distance, the WD mass is 1.37 +/- 0.01 M sun with the M giant secondary mass 0.69 +0.02/-0.01 M sun. We discuss the evolution of this system and both paths to and limitations on further refining the values of the system parameters.

 - **Abstract**
 Ultralight dark matter is an interesting dark matter candidate describing the lightest end of the mass parameter space. This model produces an oscillating granular pattern in halo densities. These fluctuations have the potential to produce a time-varying density along the line of sight creating a small lensing signal for any stars observed through a dark matter halo which oscillates on the de Broglie timescale. In this work, we study this stochastic lensing signal taking into account the impact of density granules as well as the central soliton. We calculate the amplitude and temporal properties of this signal and estimate how stellar observations may be used to constrain the ultralight dark matter mass and abundance.

 - **Abstract**
 With its extreme axial tilt, radiant energy budget and internal heat of Uranus remain among the most intriguing mysteries of our Solar System. Here, we present the global radiant energy budget spanning a complete orbital period, revealing significant seasonal variations driven primarily by the highly variable solar flux. Despite these fluctuations, emitted thermal power consistently exceeds absorbed solar power, indicating a net energy loss and ongoing global cooling. Based on the seasonal variations of radiant energy budget, we determine a statistically significant internal heat flux. This finding resolves a long-standing debate over whether Uranus possesses internal heat. We also examine the energy budget of the weather layer by combining the internal heat with the radiant energies, revealing significant energy imbalances at both global and hemispheric scales. These global and hemispheric imbalances should be considered in theoretical and numerical models. The Uranus flagship mission, as recommended by the recent survey, will provide crucial observations to address more unresolved questions and advance our understanding of this enigmatic ice giant.

We first improve on the previous forecast by including the impact of CMB component separation and find that we can achieve $\sigma_r\simeq3.5\times10^{-3}$ by combining upcoming experiments, i.e., LiteBIRD, CMB-S4 and the Advanced Simons Observatory. With a more futuristic experiment, we can achieve even tighter constraints on $r$ if improved delensing can be realized. Using a simulated analysis pipeline, we also explore possible biases from higher-order terms in the lensing potential, which were previously not examined in detail. We find that these bias terms are negligible compared to a detectable signal from inflationary gravitational waves. Our simulated results confirm that this new method is capable of obtaining powerful constraints on $r$. The method is immune to Gaussian Galactic foregrounds and has a different response to non-Gaussian Galactic foregrounds than the $B$-mode power spectrum, offering an independent cross-check of $r$ constraints from the standard power spectrum analysis.

 - **Abstract**
 Using two dimensional hydrodynamic simulations, we studied the evolution of hot advective accretion flow and its properties. In our investigation, we examined the stability properties of shocked flows around black holes upon introducing non-axisymmetric perturbations. The quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) appeared in power density spectra obtained in several cases of our simulation results and their distribution is in the range 0.44 - 146.67 Hz which encompasses low- to high-frequency QPOs observed in black hole X-ray binaries.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the discovery and timing results of 15 pulsars discovered in a high Galactic latitude survey conducted with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST). The survey targeted a region as close as possible to the Galactic Center, encompassing an area near the Galactic this http URL newly discovered pulsars consist of eleven normal pulsars and four millisecond pulsars (MSPs). Among the MSPs, three are identified in binary systems with orbital periods of ~3.1, 4.6 and 12.5 days, respectively. We have successfully obtained coherent timing solutions for three of the normal pulsars (PSRs J1745-0059, J1746-0156 and J1800-0059). Furthermore, within our data set we found that four pulsars (three new and one known) show mode-changing and/or subpulse drifting phenomena. Comparing our discoveries with simulations of the Galactic disk and Bulge MSP populations indicates that these new pulsars are most likely located in the disk. Nonetheless, our discoveries demonstrate that deep surveys at high Galactic latitudes have significant potential to enhance our understanding of the MSP population in the direction of the Bulge.

          Pattern and Origin for the Extreme $γ$-ray Flares of 3C 454.3 and 3C 279: An Astrophysical Critical Damper?

 - **Abstract**
 We apply a Gaussian process method to the extreme $\gamma$-ray flares of 3C 454.3 and 3C 279 to discover the variable patterns and then to investigate the physical origins of the giant flares. The kernels of stochastically driven damped simple harmonic oscillator (SHO), the damped random-walk (DRW), and Mat$\acute{\rm e}$rn-3/2 are respectively used to describe the adaptive-binning $\gamma$-ray light curves of the two flares. Our findings show that both the extreme $\gamma$-ray flares of 3C 454.3 and 3C 279 clearly prefer the SHO kernel in the over-damped mode and the Mat$\acute{\rm e}$rn-3/2 kernel over the DRW kernel. The resulted SHO and Mat$\acute{\rm e}$rn-3/2 power spectral densities (PSDs) are the same for each object, with the index changing from -4 at high frequencies to 0 at low frequencies. The patterns of the two flares are both approaching the critical damping mode with the quality factor Q $\approx$ 0.4 (i.e., the damping ratio $\eta \approx$ 1.25), but with slightly different damping timescales. The characteristic timescale (corresponding to the broken frequency in the PSD) for 3C 454.3 is 2-3 days and 3-5 days for 3C 279. The variable patterns found here suggest that once the system responds to the energy injection disturbance, the release of the energy in the system is finished abruptly. The obtained timescale provides a constraint on the size of energy dissipation region for each source.

 - **Abstract**
 The isotropy and homogeneity of our Universe are the cardinal principles of modern cosmology built on the definition of metric through the prescription by Friedmann-Lema$\hat{i}$tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW). From the aspects of geometry, the presence of anisotropy, inhomogeneity, or both are allowed in the metrics defined as the Bianchi type I and V metrics. In this letter, the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) formalism, and the latest observational constraints on nuclear abundances are being used to put bounds on the global anisotropy offered in the Bianchi type I metrics, providing a new path to explore in the background of global anisotropy.

 - **Abstract**
 Strong laser emission from hydrogen cyanide (HCN) at 805 and 891 GHz has been discovered towards carbon-rich (C-rich) AGB stars, originating from the Coriolis-coupled system between two (1,1^{1e},0) and (0,4^0,0) vibrational states. However, other lines (at 894, 964, 968 and 1055 GHz) in this system remained unexplored due to observational challenges. Using SOFIA/4GREAT observations and Herschel/HIFI archival data, we analyzed the six HCN transitions in eight C-rich AGB stars. We report new HCN transitions show laser action at 964, 968, and 1055 GHz. The 805, 891, and 964 GHz lasers were detected in seven C-rich stars, the 968 GHz laser in six, and the 1055 GHz laser in five, while the 894 GHz line was not detected in any target. Among the detected lasers, the 891 GHz laser is always the strongest, and the 964 GHz laser, like a twin of the 891 GHz line, is the second strongest. Towards IRC+10216, all five HCN laser transitions were observed in six to eight epochs and exhibited significant variations in line profiles and intensities. The cross-ladder lines at 891 and 964 GHz exhibit similar variations, and their intensity changes do not follow the near-infrared light curve (i.e. non-periodic variations). In contrast, the variations of the rotational lines at 805, 968, and 1055 GHz appear to be quasi-periodic, with a phase lag of 0.1 - 0.2 relative to the near-infrared light curve. A comparative analysis indicates that these HCN lasers may be seen as analogues to vibrationally excited SiO and water masers in oxygen-rich stars. We suggest chemical pumping and radiative pumping could play an important role in the production of the cross-ladder HCN lasers, while the quasi-periodic behavior of the rotational HCN laser lines may be modulated by additional collisional and radiative pumping driven by periodic shocks and variations in infrared luminosity.

 - **Abstract**
 Will it be possible in the future to realize large, complex space missions dedicated to basic science like HST, Chandra and JWST? Or will their cost be just too great? Today's space scene is completely different from that of even five years ago, and certainly from that of the time when HST, Chandra and JWST were conceived and built. Space-related investments have grown exponentially in recent years, with monetary investment exceeding half a trillion dollars in 2023. This boom is largely due to the rise of the so-called 'new space' economy driven by private commercial funding, which for the first time last year surpassed public investments in space. The introduction of a market logic to space activities results in more competition, and a resulting dramatic cost and schedule reduction. Can space science take advantage of the benefits of the new space economy to reduce cost and development time and at the same time succeed in producing powerful missions in basic science? The prospects for Europe and the USA are considered here. We argue that this goal would be attainable if the scientific community could take advantage of the three pillars underlying the innovation of the new space economy: (1) technology innovation proceeding through both incremental innovation and disruptive innovation, (2) business innovation, through vertical integration, scale production, and service oriented business model, and (3) cultural innovation, through openness to risk and iterative development.

          Probing the interstellar medium toward GRB 221009A through X-ray dust scattering

 - **Abstract**
 The observation of 21 X-ray dust-scattering rings around the extraordinarily bright gamma-ray burst (GRB) 221009A provides a unique opportunity to study the interstellar medium (ISM) through which the X-ray radiation traveled in our Galaxy and, by difference, in the host galaxy as well. In particular, since the ring intensity and radius at a given time depend on the amount of dust and on its distance, respectively XMM-Newton and Swift images allowed us to map the ISM around the direction of the GRB with better resolution than in the existing optical and infrared-based 3D dust maps, both in the plane of the sky (few arcminutes) and along the line of sight (from $\simeq 1$ pc for dust clouds within 1 kpc to $\simeq 100$ pc for structures at distances larger than 10 kpc). As a consequence, we can revise prior estimates of the GRB soft X-ray fluence, obtaining a $\sim$35\% lower value, which, however, still indicates a substantial excess with respect to the extrapolation of the spectral models constrained by hard X-ray observations. Additionally, we detect significant spectral variability in two azimuthal sectors of the X-ray rings, which can be fully attributed to different Galactic absorption in these two directions. The comparison of the total hydrogen column density inferred from spectral fitting, with the Galactic contribution derived from the intensity of the X-ray rings, in the same sectors, allowed us to more robustly constrain the absorption in the host galaxy to $N_{\rm{H,z=0.151}}= (3.7\pm0.3)\,\times\,10^{21}\,\rm{cm^{-2}}$. This result is relevant not only to characterize the ISM of the host galaxy and to understand how the GRB radiation might have affected it, but also to model the broad-band spectrum of the GRB afterglow and to constrain the properties of a possible underlying supernova.

 - **Abstract**
 The next mission dedicated to the study of planetary atmospheres is the Ariel space mission, planned for launch in 2029, which will observe a variety of planetary systems belonging to different classes around stars with spectral types from M to A. To optimise the scientific outcome of the mission, such stars need to be homogeneously characterised beforehand. In this work, we focus on a methodology based on spectral synthesis for the characterisation of FGK-type stars from the Ariel Tier 1 Mission Candidate Sample (MCS) which exhibit fast rotation. In addition, we analyse slow-rotating FGK-type stars, with either new observations or archival spectra available, consistently as in our previous work using the equivalent width (EW) analysis. To ensure consistency between our methods, we re-analysed a sample of FGK-type stars with the spectral synthesis method and compared it to our previous work. The results of our analysis show excellent agreement with the previous set of derived parameters. We also computed their orbital parameters establishing whether they belong to the Galactic thin or thick discs. With the current set of stellar parameters, we almost double the analysed hosts in the Ariel MCS to 353 stars in total. Using our homogeneous set of stellar parameters, we studied the correlations between stellar and planetary properties for the Ariel MCS analysed so far. We confirmed a close relationship between stellar mass (up to 1.8 solar masses) and giant planet radius, with more inflated planets at lower metallicity. We confirm that giant planets are more frequent around more metal-rich stars that belong to the thin disc, while lower-mass planets are also found in more metal-poor environments, and are more frequent than giant planets in the thick disc as also seen in other works in the literature.

 - **Abstract**
 The Epoch of Reionization (EoR) and Cosmic Dawn (CD) are pivotal stages during the first billion years of the universe, exerting a significant influence on the development of cosmic structure. The detection of the redshifted 21-cm signal from these epochs is challenging due to the dominance of significantly stronger astrophysical foregrounds and the presence systematics. This work used the 21cm E2E pipeline, followed by simulation methodology described \cite{2022Mazumder} to conduct synthetic observations of a simulated sky model that includes both the redshifted 21-cm signal and foregrounds. A framework was constructed using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Bayesian techniques to directly deduce astrophysical parameters from the measured power spectrum. This approach eliminates the need for explicit telescope effects correction in interferometric arrays such as SKA-Low and HERA. The present work investigates the impact of calibration and position errors on retrieving the redshifted 21-cm power spectrum for the above arrays. We assessed the effects of these inaccuracies on the deduced astrophysical parameters and established acceptable tolerance levels. Based on our results, the calibration error tolerance for ideal signal detection is 0.001 %. However, if the position errors exceed 0.048 arcseconds, the remaining foregrounds would obscure the target signal.

 - **Abstract**
 The aim is to document in some detail the last 35 years of meridian circles, a type of instrument with a fundamental role in astronomy for a very long time, and to do so while witnesses are still alive and can contribute. This is about finding facts. Meridian circles provided fundamental star positions for centuries. These positions were tied to a well-defined celestial coordinate system of right ascension and declination, and accurate proper motions ensured a transformation of the positions over long periods of time. This function of the meridian circles has been taken over by space astrometry and VLBI. The Hipparcos astrometric satellite was approved by ESA in 1980 and launched to a successful 3-year mission in 1989, and the successor, Gaia, has in 2025 completed a mission of over 10 years. An account is given of the last 18 meridian instruments, which were active for some part of the 35 years until 2015. This account is based on information found on the internet, and on input kindly supplied in correspondence with many colleagues.

 The mechanisms responsible for chemical depletion across diverse astrophysical environments are not yet fully understood. In this paper, we investigate chemical depletion in post-AGB/post-RGB binary stars hosting second-generation transition discs using high-resolution optical spectra from HERMES/Mercator and UVES/VLT. We performed a detailed chemical abundance analysis of 6 post-AGB/post-RGB stars and 6 post-AGB/post-RGB candidates with transition discs in the Galaxy and in the Large Magellanic Cloud. The atmospheric parameters and elemental abundances were obtained through 1D LTE analysis of chemical elements from C to Eu, and 1D NLTE corrections were incorporated for elements from C to Fe. Our results confirmed that depletion efficiency, traced by the [S/Ti] abundance ratio, is higher in post-AGB/post-RGB binaries with transition discs compared to the overall sample of post-AGB/post-RGB binaries. We also examined correlations between derived abundances and binary system parameters (astrometric, photometric, orbital, pulsational). Additionally, we compared the depletion patterns in our sample to those observed in young stars with transition discs and in the interstellar medium. We confirmed that the depletion is significantly stronger in post-AGB/post-RGB binaries with transition discs than in young stars with transition discs. Furthermore, we found that [X/Zn] abundance ratio trends of volatile and refractory elements in post-AGB/post-RGB binaries with transition discs generally resemble similar trends in the interstellar medium (except for trends of [Si/Zn] and [Mg/Zn] ratios). These findings, although based on a limited sample, provide indirect constraints for depletion mechanism in circumbinary discs around post-AGB/post-RGB stars.

 - **Abstract**
 In recent years, the utilisation of the radio spectrum has dramatically increased. Digital telecommunication applications, be it terrestrial cell-phone networks or new-space low-earth orbit satellite constellations, have not only acquired unprecedented amounts of spectrum but also use their frequencies everywhere on Earth. The consequences for radio astronomy and other scientific radio services are severe. A single cell-phone tower within hundreds of kilometers around a radio telescope can blind us and there is no place on Earth to escape the ubiquitous transmissions of satellite megaconstellations. Since 1988, the Committee on Radio Astronomy Frequencies (CRAF) is advocating for astronomers' rights to use the spectrum. CRAF does this by participation in the national and international regulatory frameworks. Hundreds if not thousands of documents need to be processed every year. CRAF not only contributes to regulatory texts, but even more importantly, performs spectrum compatibility calculations. In this contribution, CRAF's latest activities are summarized with a focus on matters relevant to EVN operations.

          JWST/MIRI Study of the Enigmatic Mid-Infrared Rings in the Planetary Nebula NGC 1514

 - **Abstract**
 While NGC 1514 is an elliptical, but complex, planetary nebula at optical wavelengths, it was discovered to have a pair of infrared-bright, axisymmetric rings contained within its faint outer shell during the course of the WISE all-sky survey. We have obtained JWST mid-infrared imaging and spectroscopy of the nebula through the use of simultaneous observations with the MIRI Imager and Medium Resolution Spectrometer, selecting the F770W, F1280W, and F2550W filters to match each of the MRS's three grating positions. These observations show that the rings are clearly resolved and relatively distinct structures, with both filamentary and clumpy detail throughout. There is also cloud-like material that has a turbulent appearance in the interior of the rings, particularly at the longest wavelengths, and faint ejecta-like structures just outside the ring boundaries. Despite their brightness, the emission from the rings within the three imager passbands is shown to be dominated by thermal emission from very small grains, not line emission from atomic hydrogen or forbidden atomic lines, shocked molecular hydrogen, or PAHs. The doppler velocities derived from the two brightest emission lines in the rings, however, suggest that the material from which the rings were formed was ejected during an early period of very heavy mass loss from the PN progenitor, then shaped by asymmetrical fast winds from the central binary pair.

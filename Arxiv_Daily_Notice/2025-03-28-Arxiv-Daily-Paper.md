 - **Abstract**
 Blue supergiants (BSGs) mediate between the main sequence and the late stages of massive stars, which makes them valuable for assessing the physics that drives the stars across the diverse evolutionary channels. By exploring correlations between the parameters of BSGs and their variability properties, we aim to improve the constraints on the models of the evolved star structure and on the physics of the post-main-sequence evolution. We conducted a variability study of 41 BSGs with known spectroscopic parameters in the Galaxy using photometry from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite. We described the time domain of the stars by means of three statistical measures and extracted frequencies via iterative pre-whitening. Alongside, we investigated the stochastic low-frequency (SLF) variability, which manifests itself in all amplitude spectra. We report a positive correlation between the amplitude of variability and the stellar luminosity. For log(L/L$_{\odot}\lesssim 5$), stars display frequencies that match the rotational one, suggesting that variability is driven by surface spots and/or features embedded in the wind. For log(L/L$_{\odot}\gtrsim 5$), variables of the $\alpha$ Cyg class manifest themselves with their diverse and/or time-variant properties. Moreover, we report a positive correlation between the SLF variability amplitude and $T_{\rm eff}$, indicating an influential role that the stellar age plays on the emergence of the background signal beyond the main sequence. Positive, though weak, correlation is observed between the intrinsic brightness and the SLF variability amplitude, similar to the findings in the Large Magellanic Cloud, which suggests an in common excitation mechanism that depends only mildly on metallicity. Exceptionally, the $\alpha$ Cyg variables display a suppressed SLF variability that prompts to the interior changes that the evolving stars undergo.

 - **Abstract**
 We report on the detection of optical/near-infrared (O-IR) quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) from the black hole X-ray transient Swift J1727.8-1613. We obtained three X-ray and O-IR high-time-resolution observations of the source during its intermediate state (2023 September 9, 15 and 17) using NICER, HAWK-I@VLT, HIPERCAM@GTC and ULTRACAM@NTT. We clearly detected a QPO in the X-ray and O-IR bands during all three epochs. The QPO evolved, drifting from 1.4 Hz in the first epoch, up to 2.2 Hz in the second and finally reaching 4.2 Hz at the third epoch. These are among the highest O-IR QPO frequencies detected for a black hole X-ray transient. During the first two epochs, the X-ray and O-IR emission are correlated, with an optical lag (compared to the X-rays) varying from +70 ms to 0 ms. Finally, during the third epoch, we measured for the first time, a lag of the $z_s$-band respect to the $g_s$-band at the QPO frequency ($\approx$+10 ms). By estimating the variable O-IR SED we find that the emission is most likely non-thermal. Current state-of-the-art models can explain some of these properties, but neither the jet nor the hot flow model can easily explain the observed evolution of the QPOs. While this allowed us to put tight constraints on these components, more frequent coverage of the state transition with fast multi-wavelength observations is still needed to fully understand the evolution of the disc/jet properties in BH LMXBs.

          Origin of the two-armed vertical phase-spiral in the inner Galactic disk

 - **Abstract**
 Gaia recently revealed a two-armed spiral pattern in the vertical phase-space distribution of the inner Galactic disk (guiding radius $R_\textrm{g} \sim 6.2$ kpc), indicating that some non-adiabatic perturbation symmetric about the mid-plane is driving the inner disk out of equilibrium. The non-axisymmetric structures in the disk (e.g., the bar or spiral arms) have been suspected to be the major source for such a perturbation. However, both the lifetime and the period of these internal perturbations are typically longer than the period at which stars oscillate vertically, implying that the perturbation is generally adiabatic. This issue is particularly pronounced in the inner Galaxy, where the vertical oscillation period is shorter and therefore adiabatically shielded more than the outer disk. We show that two-armed phase spirals can naturally form in the inner disk if there is a vertical resonance that breaks the adiabaticity; otherwise, their formation requires a perturber with an unrealistically short lifetime. We predict analytically and confirm with simulations that a steadily rotating (non-winding) two-armed phase spiral forms near the resonance when stars are subject to both periodic perturbations (e.g., by spiral arms) and stochastic perturbations (e.g., by giant molecular clouds). Due to the presence of multiple resonances, the vertical phase-space exhibits several local phase spirals that rotate steadily at distinct frequencies, together forming a global phase spiral that evolves over time. Our results demonstrate that, contrary to earlier predictions, the formation of the two-armed phase spiral does not require transient perturbations with lifetimes shorter than the vertical oscillation period.

          Explaining the $^{12}\text{C}/^{13}\text{C}$ ratio in the Galactic halo: the contribution from shell mergers in primordial massive stars

 - **Abstract**
 Recent campaigns of observations have provided new measurements of the carbon isotopes in the most metal-poor stars of the Galaxy. These stars are so metal-poor that they could only have been enriched by one or few generations of massive progenitors. However, explaining the primary production of $^{13}$C and the low $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratio measured in these stars is challenging. Making use of the most up-to-date models for zero-metal and low-metallicity stars, we investigate the possible sources of $^{13}$C at low metallicity and verify whether massive stars could be the sole responsible for the $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratio observed in halo stars. We employ the stochastic model for Galactic chemical evolution GEMS to reproduce the evolution of CNO elements and $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratio, including the enrichment from rotating massive stars, some of which show the occurrence of H-He shell mergers. We find that stars without H-He shell mergers do not produce enough $^{13}$C to be compatible with the observations. Instead, the primary production by shell mergers and later ejection during the supernova explosion can explain 30 < $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C < 100. The observations are best reproduced assuming a large frequency of shell mergers. The $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C < 30 can only be reproduced assuming an outer layer ejection and no explosion, but requiring a larger production of $^{12}$C and $^{13}$C. Zero-metal and low-metallicity spinstars with H-He shell mergers appear as the most plausible scenario to explain the low $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratio in CEMP-no stars. The entire range of $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C values can be explained by assuming that some stars fully explode while others only eject their outer layers. Shell mergers should be also more frequent and productive, which is allowed by the current uncertainties in the treatment of convection in stellar modelling.

          Postmerger: a new and dominant contribution to the gravitational-wave background from binary neutron stars

 - **Abstract**
 The stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) generated by the inspiral and merger of binary neutron stars is traditionally modelled assuming that the inspiral is promptly followed by the collapse of the merger remnant to a rotating black hole. While this is reasonable for the most massive binaries, it is not what is expected in general, where a remnant is produced and may survive for up to hundreds of milliseconds and radiate an amount of energy that is significantly larger than that lost during the whole inspiral. To account for this additional contribution to the SGWB, we consider a waveform model that includes both the inspiral and the postmerger emission. We show for the first time that for a large set of parameterized equations of state compatible with observational constraints, there is typically five times more power spectral density in the SGWB from the postmerger emission than from the inspiral one, leading to a normalized GW energy density $\Omega_{\rm GW} \simeq 10^{-10}-10^{-9}$. This power is predominantly located in the $1-2\,{\rm kHz}$ frequency range, hence distinct from that associated with the inspiral only. We discuss the significantly enhanced detectability of the SGWB with special attention to third-generation detectors, such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, and show how it depends on the signal-to-noise ratio of foreground binaries and on the metastable remnant survival time. Interestingly, even a non-detection of the high-frequency part of the SGWB could provide valuable constraints on the remnant lifetime, offering novel insights into the postmerger dynamics and into the equation of state of nuclear matter.

          Structure Formation with Warm White Noise: Effects of Finite Number Density and Velocity Dispersion in Particle and Wave Dark Matter

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the evolution of density perturbations in dark matter with finite number density and velocity dispersion. Using a truncated BBGKY hierarchy, we derive analytical expressions for the dark matter power spectrum during radiation and matter domination. A component of {\it warm white noise} emerges in our analysis, which arises due to the finite number density and undergoes scale-dependent evolution because of the velocity dispersion. Although free streaming erases adiabatic initial perturbations on small scales, warm white noise persists below the free-streaming length and grows during matter domination, with growth suppressed below the dark matter Jeans length. Our calculated power spectra agree with $N$-body simulations in the linear regime and accurately predict halo mass functions in the nonlinear regime. Effects of warm white noise can emerge on observable quasi-linear scales for ultralight dark matter produced after inflation with a subhorizon correlation length. Our formalism is applicable to these scenarios (with de Broglie-scale quasi-particles), to cases in which dark matter includes macroscopic structures (such as primordial black holes), and to traditional warm and cold dark matter scenarios.

 - **Abstract**
 1998~KY$_{26}$ is a tiny near-Earth asteroid ($H=26.1$) discovered in 1998. It has been selected as the target of the Hayabusa2 extended mission, which will rendezvous with 1998 KY$_{26}$ in 2031. However, one of the most basic physical properties, size, remains poorly constrained, posing potential challenges for spacecraft operations. We aimed at constraining the size of 1998 KY$_{26}$ by means of thermal infrared observations. We performed thermal infrared observations of 1998 KY$_{26}$ using the ESO Very Large Telescope/VISIR on three consecutive nights in May 2024. After stacking all frames, we find no apparent detection of 1998 KY$_{26}$ on the resulting images. The upper-limit flux density of 1998 KY$_{26}$ is derived as 2 mJy at 10.64 $\mu$m. From this upper-limit flux density obtained via non-detection, we conclude that the diameter of 1998 KY$_{26}$ is smaller than 17 m with thermophysical modeling. This upper limit size is smaller than the radar-derived 30 ($\pm$ 10)\,m. Our size constraint on 1998 KY$_{26}$ is essential for the operation of the Hayabusa2 spacecraft during proximity operations using remote sensing instruments as well as a possible impact experiment using the remaining projectile.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations and models of transiting hot Jupiter exoplanets indicate that atmospheric circulation features may cause large spatial flux contrasts across their daysides. Previous studies have mapped these spatial flux variations through inversion of secondary eclipse data. Though eclipse mapping requires high signal-to-noise data, the first successful eclipse map--made for HD 189733b using $8\mu m$ Spitzer IRAC data--showed the promise of the method. JWST eclipse observations provide the requisite data quality to access the unique advantages of eclipse mapping. Using two JWST MIRI LRS eclipse observations centered on $8\mu m$ to mimic the Spitzer bandpass used in previous studies, combined with the Spitzer IRAC $8\mu m$ eclipses and partial phase curve (necessitated to disentangle map and systematic signals), we present a 2-dimensional dayside temperature map. Our best-fit model is a 2-component 5th-degree harmonic model with an unprecedentedly constrained eastward hotspot offset of $33.0^{+0.7}_{-0.9}$ degrees. We rule out a strong hemispheric latitudinal hotspot offset, as 3+ component maps providing latitudinal degrees of freedom are strongly disfavored. As in previous studies we find some model dependence in longitudinal hotspot offset; when we explore and combine a range of proximal models to avoid an overly constrained confidence region, we find an eastward hotspot offset of $32.5^{+3.0}_{-10.6}$ degrees, indicating the presence of a strong eastward zonal jet. Our map is consistent with some previous eclipse maps of HD 189733b, though it indicates a higher longitudinal offset from others. It is largely consistent with predictions from general circulation models (GCMs) at the 115 mbar level near the $8\mu m$ photosphere.

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we modify the $\Lambda$CDM model by introducing a deformed algebra within the framework of the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP). We formulate the modified Raychaudhuri equation, where new terms are introduced which describe dynamical pressure components. For the quadratic GUP model, we derive the Hubble function, which leads to a time-dependent dark energy model. The free parameters are determined using late-time observational data, the Pantheon+ SNIa sample, the cosmic chronometers, and the DESI 2025 BAO data. We find that the modified model introduce only one new additional degree of freedom compared to the $\Lambda$CDM model. The GUP-Modified $\Lambda$CDM model provides a better fit to the data than the undeformed theory. Furthermore, we compare the same model with the DESI 2024 BAO data and find that the Bayesian evidence becomes stronger with the inclusion of the DESI 2025 release.

 - **Abstract**
 Circumbinary planets and brown dwarfs form in complex gravitational environments, offering insights into formation, orbital stability, and habitability prospects. However, they remain underrepresented, with only 60 confirmed or candidate systems known. In this work, we leverage TESS photometry to search for circumbinary companions through eclipse timing variations (ETVs), analyzing 152 detached eclipsing binaries. By modeling eclipse timings, we identify 26 systems with significant periodic signals, 14 of which have false alarm probabilities below 0.01. While no detections are confirmed, TIC 350297040 emerges as a candidate for a circumbinary brown dwarf ($0.06~M_{\odot}$) under the assumption of a $1~M_{\odot}$ binary system, though further investigation is required. Simulations using synthetic ETVs indicate a 5\% recovery rate for circumbinary brown dwarfs and 0.1\% for Jupiter-like planets, with median masses of $56.6^{+16.5}{-23.4}~M_{\rm J}$ and periods of $1404^{+1361}_{-953}$ d. Our simulations show that the smallest detectable mass is $1.6~M_{\rm J}$ at a period of 1860 d and confirm that ETV methods are effective in detecting misaligned systems. In the absence of a detection, we set an upper limit of 40\% on the occurrence rate of circumbinary brown dwarfs at the 2$\sigma$ confidence level, while a confirmed single detection would imply an occurrence rate of 13.08\%. These constraints are consistent with previous abundance estimates for circumbinary brown dwarfs ($\lesssim6.5\%$) but motivate a larger sample size. Furthermore, the very low recovery rates provide insights into the debate on first- and second-generation planet formation around post-common envelope binaries.

          Void and Density Walls Inhomogeneous Cosmic Web And Dark Energy

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI 2025) indicate a weakening of cosmic acceleration at low redshifts $z < 1$, with effective dark energy equation of state parameters $w_0 > -1$ and $w_a < 0$. We demonstrate that this evolution in dark energy can be explained by cosmic inhomogeneities and the Cosmic Web without modifying fundamental physics. Our model shows how the differential expansion between underdense voids and overdense walls creates an effective backreaction term that simulates evolving dark energy when interpreted within homogeneous cosmological frameworks. The inhomogeneous cosmic structure formation becomes significant $z\sim 1-2$, the increasing gravitational influence of wall regions counteracting the cosmic acceleration, producing both a weakening acceleration signal and a direction-dependent Hubble parameter consistent with local measurements. This mechanism reconciles the higher locally measured Hubble constant $H_0\approx 73~ km/s/Mpc$ with the lower value inferred from CMB observations $H_0\approx 67-69~ km/s/Mpc$ without introducing new energy components or modifying general relativity. Our model makes testable predictions regarding directional and scale-dependent variations in cosmological parameters that can be verified with next-generation surveys. This work suggests that properly accounting for cosmic structure may be essential for resolving apparent tensions in cosmological parameters.

 - **Abstract**
 Almost all the physics of star formation critically depends on the number density of the molecular gas. However, the methods to estimate this key property often rely on uncertain assumptions about geometry, depend on overly simplistic uniform models, or require time-expensive observations to constrain the gas temperature as well. An easy-to-use method to derive n(H2) that is valid under realistic conditions is absent, causing an asymmetry in how accurately this parameter is estimated, and how often dedicated tracers are used, compared to the gas temperature. We propose and calibrate a versatile tool based on CH3OH lines that greatly simplifies the inference of the number density. CH3OH is abundant in both cold and hot gas, and thus it can be applied to a wide variety of scales. Moreover, this tool does not need to be tailored to the specific source properties (e.g. distance, temperature, and mass). We perform RT calculations to investigate the robustness of the line ratios as density probes, also in the presence of density and temperature gradients. We find that the ratios of the (2_K-1_K) band transitions constrain the average n(H2) along the LOS within a factor of 2-3 in the range 5 x 10^4 - 3 x 10^7 cm^-3. The range can be extended down to a few times 10^3 cm^-3, when also using line ratios from the (5_K-4_K) and/or (7_K-6_K) bands. We provide practical analytic formulas and a numerical method for deriving n(H2) and its uncertainty from the line ratios. Thanks to our calibration and analytical recipes, we make the estimate of n(H2) much simpler, with an effort comparable or inferior to deriving Tex, contributing to offsetting the disparity between these two fundamental parameters of the molecular gas. Applying our method to a sub-sample of sources from the ATLASGAL TOP100 we show that the material in the clumps is being compressed, accelerating in the latest stages.

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-ray binaries are systems composed of a compact object orbiting a massive companion star. The interaction between these two objects can drive relativistic outflows, either jets or winds, in which particles can be accelerated to energies reaching hundreds of tera-electronvolts (TeV). It is however still debated where and under which physical conditions particles are accelerated in these objects and ultimately whether protons can be accelerated up to PeV energies. Among the well-known gamma-ray binaries, LS 5039 is a high-mass X-ray binary (HMXB) with an orbital period of 3.9 days that has been observed up to TeV energies by the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.). In this work, we present new observations of LS 5039 obtained with the High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) observatory. Our data reveal that the gamma-ray spectrum of LS 5039 extends up to 200 TeV with no apparent spectral cut-off. Furthermore, we confirm, with a confidence level of 4.7{\sigma}, that the emission between 2 TeV and 118 TeV is modulated by the orbital motion of the system, which indicates that these photons are likely produced within or near the binary orbit where they can undergo absorption by the stellar photons. In a leptonic scenario, the highest energy photons detected by HAWC can be emitted by ~200 TeV electrons inverse Compton scattering stellar photons, which would require an extremely efficient acceleration mechanism operating within LS 5039. Alternatively, a hadronic scenario could explain the data through proton-proton or proton-{\gamma} collisions of protons accelerated to peta-electronvolt (PeV) energies.

 - **Abstract**
 The International Pulsar Timing Array (IPTA)'s second data release (IPTA DR2) combines observations of 65 millisecond pulsars from 7 radio telescopes spanning decades, aiming to detect nanohertz gravitational waves (GWs). IPTA datasets are complex and take years to assemble, often excluding recent data crucial for low-frequency GW searches. To address this, we introduce the ``Lite'' analysis, a framework that informs the full data combination process. Using a Figure of Merit, we first select individual PTA datasets per pulsar, enabling immediate access to new data and providing an early estimate of fully combined dataset results. Applying this method to IPTA DR2, we create an uncombined dataset (DR2 Lite) and an early-combined subset (EDR2) before constructing the final Full DR2 dataset (IPTA DR2). We find that DR2 Lite can detect the common red noise process seen in Full DR2 but overestimates the amplitude as $A = 5.2^{+1.8}_{-1.7} \times 10^{-15}$ at $\gamma = 13/3$, likely due to unmodeled noise. In contrast, the combined datasets improve spectral characterization, with Full DR2 yielding an amplitude of $A = 4.0^{+1.0}_{-0.9} \times 10^{-15}$ at $\gamma = 13/3$. Furthermore, combined datasets yield higher, albeit small, detection statistics for Hellings-Downs correlations. Looking ahead, the Lite method will enable rapid synthesis of the latest PTA data, offering preliminary GW constraints before full dataset combinations are available while also motivating their construction.

 - **Abstract**
 It has been argued that the so-called memory-burden effect could cause black holes to become stabilized by the information that they carry, thereby suppressing the rate at which they undergo Hawking evaporation. It has furthermore been suggested that this opens a new mass window, between $10^{4}\,{\rm g} \lesssim M \lesssim 10^{10}\,{\rm g}$, over which primordial black holes could constitute the dark matter of our Universe. We show in this \textit{letter} that this is true only if the transition from the semi-classical phase of a black hole to its memory-burdened phase is practically instantaneous. If this transition is instead more continuous, Hawking evaporation will persist at relevant levels throughout the eras of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and recombination, leading to stringent constraints which rule out the possibility that black holes lighter than $\sim 4 \times 10^{16}\,{\rm g}$ could make up all or most of the dark matter.

 - **Abstract**
 We discuss what we call halo or galaxy root systems, collections of particle pathlines that show the infall of matter from the initial uniform distribution into a collapsed structure. The matter clumps as it falls in, producing filamentary density enhancements analogous to tree roots and branches, blood vessels, or even human transportation infrastructure in cities and regions. This relates to the larger-scale cosmic web, but is defined locally about one of its nodes; a physical, geometric version of a merger tree. We find dark-matter-halo root systems on average to exhibit more roots and root branches for the largest cluster haloes than in small haloes. This may relate to the `cosmic-web detachment' mechanism that likely contributes to star-formation quenching in galaxy groups and clusters. We also find that high spin manifests in these root systems as curvier roots.

 - **Abstract**
 A key question in cosmology is whether massive neutrinos exist on cosmic scales. Current cosmological observations have severely compressed the viable range for neutrino masses and even prefer phenomenologically an effective negative mass. This poses a great challenge to the cosmological search for neutrinos. Based on current background and large scale structure data, taking a full redshift and/or scale tomography method, we find one beyond $5\,\sigma$, two $3\,\sigma$ and two $2\,\sigma$ evidences of massive neutrinos, spanning both high and low redshifts, as well as both small and intermediate scales. Interestingly, these five neutrino masses are well consistent within $1\,\sigma$ confidence level, indicating a possible suppression of neutrino mass during the evolution of the universe. Using cosmic microwave background observations to constrain a redshift and scale dependent neutrino mass, we make the first neutrino mass map through the cosmic history and full scales for future high precision search.

 - **Abstract**
 We present initial simulations of the solar convection zone using a fully compressible hydrodynamic CHORUS++ code and discuss preliminary analysis. Fluid dynamics simulation of the global solar convection is a critically important tool to access the dynamics of solar cycle variations. The CHORUS++ code robustly and efficiently solves the fully compressible hydrodynamic equations using a compact local spectral method and semi-unstructured grid system. Using CHORUS++, we simulate, for the first time, the solar convection shell from 0.7 to 0.99 of the solar radius, using the actual values of the total luminosity and the sidereal rotation rate. The simulation results include the longitudinally averaged rotation rate, reasonably agreeing with the observed solar-type differential rotation. The divergence of simulated mass flux infers that the anelastic-type models are appropriate for modeling the global solar convection, except for the outermost part of the Sun, for which the temporal scale of density variation is estimated at an order of days. The spherical harmonics analysis yields that the horizontal flows are dominant in the large-scale structure, and the degree of the anisotropy of the plasma flow is rather small and constant for the small-scale structures and for a wide range of the radius.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The study of blue straggler stars (BSS) provides insight into the mechanisms of stellar mass exchange during binary stellar evolution and the complex gravitational interactions within dense stellar systems. In combination, they enhance our understanding of the possible life cycles of stars and the evolutionary pathways of star clusters. Aim. We study the populations of BSSs in 41 globular clusters (GCs) and 42 open clusters (OCs) adopting photometry, proper motion, and parallax from the Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3), confirming their cluster membership. We find a total of 4399 BSSs: all GCs show the presence of BSSs (3965 or ~90% of the sample), whereas only 42 out of 129 studied OCs show the presence of BSSs (434 or ~10% of the sample). Clusters younger than ~500 Myr do not host any BSSs. Methods. We derive their astrophysical parameters such as effective temperature, surface gravity, and mass based on color-temperature relations, isochrone models and Gaia DR3 spectroscopy (if available). We find values for $T_{\rm eff}=(6800 \pm 585) \ {\rm K}$ and $(7570 \pm 1400) \ {\rm K}$; and an average mass of $\langle M_{\rm BSS} \rangle = (1.02 \pm 0.1) \ {M_\odot}$ and $\langle M_{\rm BSS} \rangle = (1.75 \pm 0.45) \ {M_\odot}$ for GCs and OCs, respectively. We finally compute the difference of the BSS mass and the main sequence turn-off (MSTO) mass of its respective cluster, normalized by the MSTO mass, for every identified BSS. Results. Based on this parameter and BSSs ages derived from isochrone models, we find: i) GC BSSs that are most likely to be formed through collisions show a "boost" for ages ~ 1-2 Gyr, in agreement with ages for core-collapse events in GCs reported in previous studies; ii) a double sequence for GC BSSs that could indicate the hint of a pre/post-merger or close-binary scenario.

 - **Abstract**
 This study focuses on Class I, Flat Spectrum (FS), and Class II disks in the Ophiuchus molecular cloud, a nearby active star-forming region with numerous young stellar objects (YSOs), to unveil signs of substructure formation in these disks. We employ two-dimensional super-resolution imaging based on Sparse Modeling (SpM) for ALMA archival Band 6 continuum data, achieving images with spatial resolutions comparable to a few au (0".02-0".2) for 78 dust disks, all of which are spatially resolved. In our sample, we confirm that approximately 30-40% of the disks exhibit substructures, and we identify new substructures in 15 disks (4 Class I, 7 Class FS, and 4 Class II objects). Compared to the eDisk sample in terms of bolometric temperature, Tbol, our targets are in a relatively later accretion phase. By combining our targets with the eDisk sample, we confirm that substructure detection in available data is restricted to objects where Tbol exceeds 200-300 K and the dust disk radius, Rdust, is larger than ~30 au. Moreover, we find that the distribution of inclination angles for Class II disks has a deficit of high values and is not consistent with being random. Analyzing molecular line emission data around these objects will be crucial to constrain disk evolutionary stages further and understand when and how substructures form.

 - **Abstract**
 We report on the optical spectroscopic monitoring of the X-ray transient MAXI J0709$-$159 (identified as the Be star LY CMa) performed for about 1.5 months after the X-ray detection with MAXI. The observed spectrum showed a double-peaked H$\alpha$ line with a peak-to-peak separation of $\sim 230$ km s$^{-1}$, suggestive of the Be disk origin. We also detected a broad wing of the H$\alpha$ line with a line-of-sight velocity of $\gtrsim 900$ km s$^{-1}$, which could be explained by the accretion disk of the compact object or a stellar wind from the Be star. Initially the H$\alpha$ line showed an asymmetric profile with an enhanced blue peak, and then the blue peak decreased in $\sim$ 3 weeks to a similar strength to the red peak. We suggest that the evolution of the blue peak is associated with the X-ray activity and generated by the turbulence of the Be disk due to the passage of the compact object. We also investigated flux variation using the archival TESS data and found quasi-periodic variations with frequencies of $\sim 1$ and $\sim 2$ day$^{-1}$, which were likely caused by the pulsation of the B star. The overall variability properties on timescales of $\sim$ day were similar to those in Be X-ray binaries, rather than supergiant X-ray binaries.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the formation mechanisms of stellar-mass black holes in X-ray binaries (BHXBs) remains a fundamental challenge in astrophysics. The natal kick velocities imparted during black hole formation provide crucial constraints on these formation channels. In this work, we present a new-epoch very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observation of the Galactic BHXB AT2019wey carried out in 2023. Combining with archival VLBI data from 2020, we successfully measure the proper motion of AT2019wey over a 3-year timescale, namely $0.78\pm0.12$~\masyr\ in right ascension and $-0.42\pm0.07$~\masyr\ in declination. Employing the measured proper motion, we estimate its peculiar velocity and the potential kick velocity (PKV), through Monte Carlo simulations incorporating uncertainties of its distance and radial velocity. The estimated PKV distributions and height above the Galactic plane suggest that AT2019wey's black hole likely formed through a supernova explosion rather than direct collapse.

 - **Abstract**
 This research paper aims to compare different methods for calculating the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud (\textit{LMC}). The distance, $d_{LMC}$, is determined using stellar parallax, variable stars (RR Lyrae and Classical Cepheids), redshift, and celestial mechanics, from which the systematic and standard errors are calculated. After analyzing each method, the final distance is obtained as $d_{LMC} = 50.4802 \pm 0.0638_{\text{std}}$ Kpc, differing by $+0.5102$ Kpc from the currently most accepted value of $d_{LMC} = 49.97$ Kpc (Pietrzyński, 2014). In this paper, the value of $d_{LMC}$ was derived by combining the distances determined from RR Lyrae and Classical Cepheid variable stars, celestial mechanics and parallax.

 - **Abstract**
 Context: Astronomy and astrophysics demand rigorous handling of uncertainties to ensure the credibility of outcomes. The growing integration of artificial intelligence offers a novel avenue to address this necessity. This convergence presents an opportunity to create advanced models capable of quantifying diverse sources of uncertainty and automating complex data relationship exploration. What: We introduce a hierarchical Bayesian architecture whose probabilistic relationships are modeled by neural networks, designed to forecast stellar attributes such as mass, radius, and age (our main target). This architecture handles both observational uncertainties stemming from measurements and epistemic uncertainties inherent in the predictive model itself. As a result, our system generates distributions that encapsulate the potential range of values for our predictions, providing a comprehensive understanding of their variability and robustness. Methods: Our focus is on dating main sequence stars using a technique known as Chemical Clocks, which serves as both our primary astronomical challenge and a model prototype. In this work, we use hierarchical architectures to account for correlations between stellar parameters and optimize information extraction from our dataset. We also employ Bayesian neural networks for their versatility and flexibility in capturing complex data relationships. Results: By integrating our machine learning algorithm into a Bayesian framework, we have successfully propagated errors consistently and managed uncertainty treatment effectively, resulting in predictions characterized by broader uncertainty margins. This approach facilitates more conservative estimates in stellar dating. Our architecture achieves age predictions with a mean absolute error of less than 1 Ga for the stars in the test dataset.

 - **Abstract**
 ADITYA L1, India's first dedicated mission to study Sun and its atmosphere from the Sun-Earth Lagrangian L1 location was successfully launched on September 2, 2023 with seven payloads. Visible Emission Line Coronagraph (VELC) is a major payload on ADITYA-L1. VELC has provision to carry out imaging and spectroscopic observations (the latter in three emission lines of the corona), simultaneously. Images of the solar corona in continuum at 5000Å, with the field of view (FoV) from 1.05$R_\odot$ to 3$R_\odot$ can be obtained at variable intervals depending on the data volume that can be downloaded. Spectroscopic observations of solar corona in three emission lines, namely 5303Å [Fe XIV], 7892Å [Fe XI], and 10747Å [Fe XIII] are possible simultaneously, with different exposure times and cadence. Four slits, each of width 50${\mu}$m, separated by 3.75mm helps to simultaneously obtain spectra at four positions in the solar corona at all the aforementioned lines. A Linear Scan Mechanism (LSM) makes it possible to scan the solar corona up to ${\pm}$1.5$R_\odot$ with variable step size. The instrument has the facility to carry out spectropolarimetric observations at 10747Å also in the FoV range 1.05-1.5$R_\odot$. Various components of the instrument were tested interferometrically on the optical bench before installation. The individual components were aligned and performance of the payload was checked in the laboratory using laser source and tungsten lamp. Wavelength calibration of the instrument was verified using Sun as a light source. All the detectors were calibrated for different parameters such as dark current and its variation with exposure this http URL, we discuss the various features of the VELC, alignment, calibration, performance, possible observations, initial data analysis and results of initial tests conducted in-orbit.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate a minor merger event in M31 that simultaneously forms the Andromeda Giant Southern Stream (AGSS), Eastern Extent (EE), North-Eastern Shelf (NES), and Western Shel (WS), offering a unified model for these substructures. By varying the scale radius and mass of the progenitor's dark matter halo (DMH), around the range predicted by the $\Lambda$CDM model, we successfully reproduce the spatial features of these substructures. Across the limited range of parameters considered in this study, our analysis shows that the spatial evolution of NES and WS is independent of the gravitational potential of the DMH associated with the progenitor, while a shallower potential shifts EE further north. The simulations clearly demonstrate that the progenitor with a DMH mass of $9\times10^9M_\odot$ colliding with M31 850 Myr ago could simultaneously form al thes esubstructures. The simulation results indicate that EE lies several 10kpc closer to us than the aligned Stream Cp, which is actually a metal-poor component of Stream C, whose farther distance suggests overlapping debris from distinct collision events, while both remain closely aligned in celestial coordinates. Furthermore, we predict the existence of a positive stream along the AGSS, characterized by positive line-of-sight velocities relative to M31, which complements an already observed negative stream exhibiting negative line-of-sight velocities. Finally, we propose that three objects, namely Stream B, a metal-rich component of Stream C known as Stream Cr, and EE, are components of the Andromeda Giant Southern Arc (AGSA) connected to the AGSS. Although the existence of the positive stream and a complete picture of AGSA have yet to be confirmed observationally, we anticipate that future spectroscopic observations and further advances in theoretical studies will verify their existence.

 - **Abstract**
 Brown dwarfs at the L-T transition likely experience an inhomogeneous clearing of the clouds in their atmospheres. The resulting surface of thin and thick cloudy patches has been put forward to explain the observed variability, J-band brightening, and re-emergence of FeH absorption. We study the closest brown dwarf binary, Luhman 16A and B, in an effort to constrain their chemical and cloud compositions. As this binary consists of an L7.5 and T0.5 component, we gain insight into the atmospheric properties at the L-T transition. As part of the ESO SupJup Survey, we observed Luhman 16AB at high spectral resolution in the J-band ($1.1-1.4\ \mathrm{\mu m}$) using CRIRES$^+$. To analyse the spectra, we employ an atmospheric retrieval framework, coupling the radiative transfer code petitRADTRANS with the MultiNest sampling algorithm. For both objects, we report detections of H$_2$O, K, Na, FeH, and, for the first time in the J-band, hydrogen-fluoride (HF). The K doublet at $1250\ \mathrm{nm}$ shows asymmetric absorption in the blue line wings, which are reproduced via pressure- and temperature-dependent shifts of the line cores. We find evidence for clouds in both spectra and we place constraints on an FeH-depletion in the Luhman 16A photosphere. The inferred over-abundance of FeH for Luhman 16B opposes its predicted rainout into iron clouds. A two-column model, which emulates the patchy surface expected at the L-T transition, is weakly preferred ($\sim 1.8\sigma$) for component B but disfavoured for A ($\sim 5.5\sigma$). The results suggest a uniform surface on Luhman 16A, which is in good agreement with the reduced variability observed for this L-type component. While the presented evidence is not sufficient to draw conclusions about any inhomogeneity on Luhman 16B, future observations covering a broader wavelength range could help to test the cloud-clearing hypothesis.

 - **Abstract**
 We provide an overview of the Jiutian simulations, a hybrid simulation suite for the China Space Survey Telescope (CSST) extragalactic surveys. It consists of four complementary modules: the primary runs with high resolutions under the fiducial concordance cosmology, the emulator runs exploring the parameter uncertainties around the fiducial cosmology, the reconstruction runs intended for recovering the observed Universe site by site, and the extension runs employing extended cosmologies beyond the standard model. For the primary runs, two independent pipelines are adopted to construct subhaloes and merger trees. On top of them, four sets of mock galaxy light-cone catalogs are produced from semi-analytical models and subhalo abundance matching, providing a variety of observational properties including galaxy SED, emission lines, lensing distortions, and mock images. The 129 emulator runs are used to train the CSST emulator, achieving one percent accuracy in predicting a variety of cosmological statistics over $k\leq 10 h{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ and $z\leq 2$. The reconstruction runs employ a number of subgrid baryonic models to predict the evolution and galaxy population of certain regions in the real Universe with constrained initial conditions, enabling controlled investigation of galaxy formation on top of structure formation. The extension runs cover models with warm dark matter, $f(R)$ gravity, interacting dark energy, and nonzero neutrino masses, revealing differences in the cosmic structure under alternative cosmological models. We introduce the specifications for each run, the data products derived from them, the corresponding pipeline developments, and present some main tests. Using the primary runs, we also show that the subhalo peak mass functions of different levels are approximately universal. These simulations form a comprehensive and open library for the CSST surveys.

          Constraints on AvERA Cosmologies from Cosmic Chronometers and Type Ia Supernovae

 - **Abstract**
 We constrain AvERA cosmologies in comparison with the flat $\Lambda$CDM model using cosmic chronometer (CC) data and the Pantheon+ sample of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). The analysis includes CC fits performed with the \texttt{emcee} sampler and supernova fits based on a custom Markov Chain Monte Carlo implementation. For model comparison, we apply Anderson-Darling tests on normalized residuals to assess consistency with a standard normal distribution. Best-fit parameters are derived within the redshift ranges $z \leq 2$ for CCs and $z \leq 2.3$ for SNe. The best-fit values of the Hubble constant are ${H_0=68.28_{-3.24}^{+3.23}~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}}$ from the CC analysis and ${H_0=71.99_{-1.03}^{+1.05}~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}}$ from the SN analysis, for the AvERA cosmology. These results are consistent within $1\sigma$ with the corresponding AvERA simulation value of $H(z=0)$. Both the CC and SN datasets substantially favor AvERA cosmologies over the flat $\Lambda$CDM model. We have identified signs of overfitting in both models, which suggests the possibility of overestimating the uncertainties in the Pantheon+ covariance matrix.

 - **Abstract**
 CONTEXT: Dense cores are thought to be isolated from the surrounding cloud. However, observations of streamers and subsonic material outside core boundaries challenges this idea. AIMS: In this study, we aim to probe the extended subsonic region observed around the pre-stellar core H-MM1 in L1688 using multi-component kinematical analysis of very high-sensitivity NH3 data. METHODS: We used observations of NH3 (1,1) and (2,2) using GBT. We then fitted up to two components towards the core and its surrounding molecular cloud. RESULTS: We detect an extended region of subsonic turbulence in addition to the ambient cloud, which show supersonic turbulence. This extended subsonic region is approximately 12 times the size of and more than two times as massive as the previously detected subsonic material. The subsonic region is further split into two well-separated, velocity-coherent components, one of which is kinematically and spatially connected to the dense core. The two subsonic components are red- and blue-shifted with respected to the cloud component. We also detect a flow of material onto the dense core from the extended subsonic region via a streamer of length ~0.15 pc (~30000 au). CONCLUSIONS: We find that the extended subsonic component kinematically associated with the dense core contains 27% more mass than the core. This material could be further accreted by the core. The other subsonic component contains a mass similar to that of the core mass, and could be tracing material in the early stage of core formation. The H-MM1 streamer is kinematically similar to the ones observed towards protostellar systems, but is the first instance of such an accretion feature onto a core in its pre-stellar phase. This accretion of chemically fresh material by the pre-stellar core challenges our current understanding of a core evolving with a mass unchanged since the time of its formation.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational wave (GW) observations probe both a diffuse, stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) as well as individual cataclysmic events such as the merger of two compact objects. The detection and description of the gravitational-wave background requires somewhat different techniques than required for individual events. In this paper, we probe the sensitivity of present and future GW telescopes to different background sources, including both those expected from unresolved compact binaries in both their quasi-Newtonian quiescent and their eventual mergers, as well as more speculative cosmological sources such as inflation, cosmic strings, and phase transitions, over regions in which those sources can be described by a single power aw. We develop a Fisher matrix formalism to forecast coming sensitivities of single and multiple experiments, and novel visualizations taking into account the increase in sensitivity to a background over time.

 - **Abstract**
 Filaments are ubiquitous in astronomical data sets. Be it in particle simulations or observations, filaments are always tracers of a perturbation in the equilibrium of the studied system and hold essential information on its history and future evolution. However, the recovery of such structures is often complicated by the presence of a large amount of background and transverse noise in the observation space. While the former is generally detrimental to the analysis, the latter can be attributed to measurement errors and it can hold essential information about the structure. To further complicate the scenario, 1D manifolds (filaments) are generally non-linear and their geometry difficult to extract and model. In order to study hidden manifolds within the dataset, particular care has to be devoted to background noise removal and transverse noise modelling, while still maintaining accuracy in the recovery of their geometrical structure. We propose 1-DREAM: a toolbox composed of five main Machine Learning methodologies whose aim is to facilitate manifold extraction in such cases. Each methodology has been designed to address issues when dealing with complicated low-dimensional structures convoluted with noise and it has been extensively tested in previously published works. In this work all methodologies are presented in detail, joint within a cohesive framework and demonstrated for three interesting astronomical cases: a simulated jellyfish galaxy, a filament extracted from a simulated cosmic web and the stellar stream of Omega-Centauri as observed with the GAIA DR2. Two newly developed visualization techniques are also proposed, that take full advantage of the results obtained with 1-DREAM. The code is made publicly available to benefit the community. The controlled experiments on a purposefully built data set prove the accuracy of the pipeline in recovering the hidden structures.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent findings from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 2 (DR2) favor a dynamical dark energy characterized by a phantom crossing feature. This result also implies a lower value of the Hubble constant, thereby intensifying the so-called Hubble tension. To alleviate the Hubble tension, we consider the early dark energy and explore its impact on the evidence for dynamical dark energy including the Hubble constant calibrated by the SH0ES collaboration. We find that incorporating SH0ES prior with CMB, DESI DR2 BAO and Pantheon Plus/Union3/DESY5 data reduces the preference to dynamical dark energy to $1.8\sigma/1.8\sigma/2.9\sigma$ level, respectively. Our results suggest a potential tension between the Hubble constant $H_0$ of the SH0ES measurement and the phantom-to-quintessence transition in dark energy favored by DESI DR2 BAO data.

 - **Abstract**
 Using public data collected by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) over 16 years, and the 1523 days of survey data (3HWC) from the High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) observatory, we searched for possible GeV-TeV connections in globular clusters (GCs). In addition to the confirmed $\gamma-$ray GCs in the 4FGL catalog, we report a GeV detection at the position of UKS 1 with a post-trial probability of $\sim8\times10^{-5}$ of it being a fluctuation. Its spectrum within this energy range is well described by a power-law model with $\Gamma\simeq2.3\pm0.5$. Furthermore, this GeV feature appears to extend southeast in a direction towards the Galactic plane. From the 3HWC survey data, we have also identified a TeV feature in the direction of UKS 1. It is well-resolved from any known Very High Energy (VHE) source. The post-trial probability that this feature is a fluctuation is $\sim3\times10^{-4}$. If confirmed, this would be the second detection of a TeV feature in the proximity of a GC. While the GeV emission mostly coincides with the center of UKS 1, the TeV peak is displaced from the cluster center by several tidal radii in the trailing direction of the GC's proper motion. Given the supersonic speed of UKS 1 at $\sim270$ km s$^{-1}$, our findings are consistent with a scenario where the VHE $\gamma-$rays are produced by inverse Compton scattering between relativistic particles and ambient soft photon fields during the course of their propagation away from the head of the bow shock.

 - **Abstract**
 Possible interaction between dark energy and dark matter has previously shown promise in alleviating the clustering tension, without exacerbating the Hubble tension, when BAO data from SDSS DR16 is combined with CMB and SNIa datasets. With the recent DESI BAO DR2, there is now a compelling need to re-evaluate this scenario. We combine DESI DR2 with Planck 2018 and Pantheon+ SNIa datasets to constrain interacting dark matter dark energy models, accounting for interaction effects in both the background and perturbation sectors. Our results exhibit similar trends to those observed with SDSS, albeit with improved precision, reinforcing the consistency between the two BAO datasets. In addition to offering a resolution to the $S_8$ tension, in the phantom-limit, the dark energy equation of state exhibits an early-phantom behaviour, aligning with DESI DR2 findings, before transitioning to $w\sim-1$ at lower redshifts, regardless of the DE parametrization. However, the statistical significance of excluding $w=-1$ is reduced compared to their non-interacting counterparts.

 - **Abstract**
 Atmospheric retrievals are essential tools for interpreting exoplanet transmission and eclipse spectra, enabling quantitative constraints on the chemical composition, aerosol properties, and thermal structure of planetary atmospheres. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) offers unprecedented spectral precision, resolution, and wavelength coverage, unlocking transformative insights into the formation, evolution, climate, and potential habitability of planetary systems. However, this opportunity is accompanied by challenges: modeling assumptions and unaccounted-for noise or signal sources can bias retrieval outcomes and their interpretation. To address these limitations, we introduce a Gaussian Process (GP)-aided atmospheric retrieval framework that flexibly accounts for unmodeled features in exoplanet spectra, whether global or localized. We validate this method on synthetic JWST observations and show that GP-aided retrievals reduce bias in inferred abundances and better capture model-data mismatches than traditional approaches. We also introduce the concept of mean squared error to quantify the trade-off between bias and variance, arguing that this metric more accurately reflects retrieval performance than bias alone. We then reanalyze the NIRISS/SOSS JWST transmission spectrum of WASP-96 b, finding that GP-aided retrievals yield broader constraints on CO$_2$ and H$_2$O, alleviating tension between previous retrieval results and equilibrium predictions. Our GP framework provides precise and accurate constraints while highlighting regions where models fail to explain the data. As JWST matures and future facilities come online, a deeper understanding of the limitations of both data and models will be essential, and GP-enabled retrievals like the one presented here offer a principled path forward.

 - **Abstract**
 We perform a high resolution zoom-in simulation of star cluster assembly including the merger of two sub-clusters with initial conditions taken from previous large scale giant molecular cloud (GMC) simulations. We couple hydrodynamics to N-body dynamics to simulate the individual stars themselves, and the gas-rich environment in which they evolve. We include prescriptions for star formation and stellar feedback and compare directly to previous simulations of the same region without these prescriptions to determine their role in shaping the dynamics inherited from the cluster assembly process. The stellar mass of the cluster grows through star formation within the cluster and accretion of new stars and star forming gas from a nearby filament. This growth results in an enhancement in the cluster's rotation and anisotropic expansion compared to simulations without star formation. We also analyze the internal kinematics of the cluster once it has lost most of its gas and find that the rotational velocity and the velocity anisotropy profiles are qualitatively similar to those expected of clusters that have undergone violent relaxation. As well, rotation and anisotropic expansion are still present by the time of gas removal. This implies that evolution within the GMC was unable to completely erase the kinematics inherited by the merger.

 - **Abstract**
 Radio-frequency interference (RFI) is a major systematic limitation in radio astronomy, particularly for science cases requiring high sensitivity, such as 21-cm cosmology. Traditionally, RFI is dealt with by identifying its signature in the dynamic spectra of visibility data and flagging strongly affected regions. However, for RFI sources that do not occupy narrow regions in the time-frequency space, such as persistent local RFI, modeling these sources could be essential to mitigating their impact. This paper introduces two methods for detecting and characterizing local RFI sources from radio interferometric visibilities: matched filtering and maximum a posteriori (MAP) imaging. These algorithms use the spherical wave equation to construct three-dimensional near-field image cubes of RFI intensity from the visibilities. The matched filter algorithm can generate normalized maps by cross-correlating the expected contributions from RFI sources with the observed visibilities, while the MAP method performs a regularized inversion of the visibility equation in the near field. We also develop a full polarization simulation framework for RFI and demonstrate the methods on simulated observations of local RFI sources. The stability, speed, and errors introduced by these algorithms are investigated, and, as a demonstration, the algorithms are applied to a subset of NenuFAR observations to perform spatial, spectral, and temporal characterization of two local RFI sources. We assess the impact of local RFI on images, the uv plane, and cylindrical power spectra through simulations and describe these effects qualitatively. We also quantify the level of errors and biases that these algorithms induce and assess their implications for the estimated 21-cm power spectrum with radio interferometers. The near-field imaging and simulation codes are made available publicly in the Python library nfis.

 - **Abstract**
 Pair-instability supernovae (PISNe) are predicted thermonuclear explosions of massive stars with helium core masses exceeding $\sim 65M_\odot$ and synthesize substantial amounts of radioactive $\mathrm{^{56}Ni}$ ($M(\mathrm{^{56}Ni})\sim60M_\odot$ in extreme cases). To investigate their observational signatures, we developed a 1D Monte Carlo radiation transport code and performed simulations of gamma-ray and hard X-ray emissions from the decay chain $\mathrm{^{56}Ni}\to\mathrm{^{56}Co}\to\mathrm{^{56}Fe}$. We find that key gamma-ray lines (847 and 1238 keV) from $\mathrm{^{56}Co}$ decay in the $130M_\odot$ helium core model can be detected up to 300-400 Mpc by next-generation MeV gamma-ray telescopes. In contrast, the signals from the $100M_\odot$ model remain below the detection limits. Our results provide the template for gamma-ray follow-up observations of PISNe. Considering theoretical predictions and observational constraints, we estimate PISN event rates within 300 Mpc to be approximately 0.1 events per year, highlighting their rarity but also emphasizing their feasibility as targets for future gamma-ray observations over the decade.

 - **Abstract**
 What happens when a black box (neural network) meets a black box (simulation of the Universe)? Recent work has shown that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can infer cosmological parameters from the matter density field in the presence of complex baryonic processes. A key question that arises is, which parts of the cosmic web is the neural network obtaining information from? We shed light on the matter by identifying the Fourier scales, density scales, and morphological features of the cosmic web that CNNs pay most attention to. We find that CNNs extract cosmological information from both high and low density regions: overdense regions provide the most information per pixel, while underdense regions -- particularly deep voids and their surroundings -- contribute significantly due to their large spatial extent and coherent spatial features. Remarkably, we demonstrate that there is negligible degradation in cosmological constraining power after aggressive cutting in both maximum Fourier scale and density. Furthermore, we find similar results when considering both hydrodynamic and gravity-only simulations, implying that neural networks can marginalize over baryonic effects with minimal loss in cosmological constraining power. Our findings point to practical strategies for optimal and robust field-level cosmological inference in the presence of uncertainly modeled astrophysics.

 - **Abstract**
 A longstanding prediction in interstellar theory posits that significant quantities of molecular gas, crucial for star formation, may be undetected due to being ``dark" in commonly used molecular gas tracers, such as carbon monoxide. We report the discovery of Eos, the closest dark molecular cloud, located just 94 parsecs from the Sun. This cloud is the first molecular cloud ever to be identified using H$_2$ far ultra-violet (FUV) fluorescent line emission, which traces molecular gas at the boundary layers of star-forming and supernova remnant regions. The cloud edge is outlined along the high-latitude side of the North Polar Spur, a prominent x-ray/radio structure. Our distance estimate utilizes 3D dust maps, the absorption of the soft X-ray background, and hot gas tracers such as O\,{\sc vi}; these place the cloud at a distance consistent with the Local Bubble's surface. Using high-latitude CO maps we note a small amount (M$_{\rm{H}_2}\approx$20-40\,M$_\odot$) of CO-bright cold molecular gas, in contrast with the much larger estimate of the cloud's true molecular mass (M$_{\rm{H}_2}\approx3.4\times 10^3$\,M$_\odot$), indicating most of the cloud is CO-dark. Combining observational data with novel analytical models and simulations, we predict this cloud will photoevaporate in 5.7 million years, placing key constraints on the role of stellar feedback in shaping the closest star-forming regions to the Sun.

          Tracing the Galactic Origins of Selected Four G-type Stars in the Solar Neighbourhood

 - **Abstract**
 We present a multi-method investigation of four metal-poor G-type main-sequence stars to resolve their Galactic origins. By combining high-resolution spectroscopy from PolarBase, photometric/astrometric data from Gaia DR3, and spectral energy distribution (SED) modelling, we derive precise stellar parameters, chemical abundances, kinematics and Galactic orbital parameters. The stars HD 22879, HD 144579, HD 188510, and HD 201891 show effective temperatures of 5855 +/- 110, 5300 +/- 160, 5370 +/- 60, and 5880 +/- 90 K; surface gravities of 4.40 +/- 0.18, 4.52 +/- 0.37, 4.57 +/- 0.13, and 4.48 +/- 0.18 (in cgs units); and metallicities of -0.86 +/- 0.08, -0.55 +/- 0.12, -1.60 +/- 0.07, and -1.15 +/- 0.07 dex, respectively. Kinematic analysis suggests that HD 22879, HD 144579, and HD 201891 are potential bulge-origin escapees, possibly ejected by the Galactic bar or spiral arm perturbations. HD 188510, however, shows halo-like dynamics, including a retrograde orbit. Chemical abundance trends ([alpha/Fe] vs. [Fe/H]) reveal mixed origins, challenging kinematic classifications. This discrepancy highlights the importance of integrative methodologies in Galactic archaeology. We associate HD 22879, HD 144579, and HD 201891 with the bulge globular clusters NGC 6441, NGC 5927, and NGC 6544, respectively. HD 188510's retrograde motion and low metallicity align with ejection from the halo globular cluster NGC 5139 (omega Centauri). These results illustrate the complex interplay of dynamical processes -- including bar resonances, spiral arm perturbations, and tidal stripping -- in depositing metal-poor stars into the solar neighborhood.

 - **Abstract**
 Phosphorus is a key element that plays an essential role in biological processes important for living organisms on Earth. The origin and connection of phosphorus-bearing molecules to early Solar system objects and star-forming molecular clouds is therefore of great interest, yet there are limited observations throughout different stages of low-mass ($M < $ a few M$_\odot$) star formation. Observations from the Yebes 40 m and IRAM 30 m telescopes detect for the first time in the 7mm, 3mm, and 2mm bands multiple transitions of PN and PO, as well as a single transition of PO$^{+}$, toward a low-mass starless core. The presence of PN, PO and PO$^{+}$ is kinematically correlated with bright SiO(1-0) emission. Our results reveal not only that shocks are the main driver of releasing phosphorus from dust grains and into the gas-phase, but that the emission originates from gas not affiliated with the shock itself, but quiescent gas that has been shocked in the recent past. From radiative transfer calculations, the PO/PN abundance ratio is found to be $3.1^{+0.4}_{-0.6}$, consistent with other high-mass and low-mass star-forming regions. This first detection of PO$^{+}$ toward any low-mass star-forming region reveals a PO$^{+}$/PO ratio of $0.0115^{+0.0008}_{-0.0009}$, a factor of ten lower than previously determined from observations of a Galactic Center molecular cloud, suggesting its formation can occur under more standard Galactic cosmic-ray ionization rates. These results motivate the need for additional observations that can better disentangle the physical mechanisms and chemical drivers of this precursor of prebiotic chemistry.

 - **Abstract**
 The Eos cloud, recently discovered in the far ultraviolet via H$_2$ fluorescence, is one of the nearest known dark molecular clouds to the Sun, with a distance spanning from $\sim94-136$pc. However, with a mass ($\sim5.5\times10^3$M$_\odot$) just under $40$ per cent that of star forming clouds like Taurus and evidence for net molecular dissociation, its evolutionary and star forming status is uncertain. We use Gaia data to investigate whether there is evidence for a young stellar population that may have formed from the Eos cloud. Comparing isochrones and pre-main sequence evolutionary models there is no clear young stellar population in the region. While there are a small number of $<10$Myr stars, that population is statistically indistinguishable from those in similar search volumes at other Galactic latitudes. We also find no unusual spatial or kinematic clustering toward the Eos cloud over distances $70-150$pc. Overall we conclude that the Eos cloud has most likely not undergone any recent substantial star formation, and further study of the dynamics of the cloud is required to determine whether it will do so in the future.

          Advancing accuracy in age determinations of old-disk stars using an oscillating red giant in an eclipsing binary

 - **Abstract**
 The study of resonant oscillation modes in low-mass red giant branch stars enables their ages to be inferred with exceptional ($\sim$10%) precision, unlocking the possibility to reconstruct the temporal evolution of the Milky Way at early cosmic times. Ensuring the accuracy of such a precise age scale is a fundamental yet difficult challenge. Since the age of red giant branch stars primarily hinges on their mass, an independent mass determination for an oscillating red giant star provides the means for such assessment. We analyze the old eclipsing binary KIC10001167, which hosts an oscillating red giant branch star and is a member of the thick disk of the Milky Way. Of the known red giants in eclipsing binaries, this is the only member of the thick disk that has asteroseismic signal of high enough quality to test the seismic mass inference at the 2% level. We measure the binary orbit and obtain fundamental stellar parameters through combined analysis of light curve eclipses and radial velocities, and perform a detailed asteroseismic, photospheric, and Galactic kinematic characterization of the red giant and binary system. We show that the dynamically determined mass $0.9337\pm0.0077 \rm\ M_{\odot}$ (0.8%) of this 10 Gyr-old star agrees within 1.4% with the mass inferred from detailed modelling of individual pulsation mode frequencies (1.6%). This is now the only thick disk stellar system, hosting a red giant, where the mass has been determined both asteroseismically with better than 2% precision, and through a model-independent method at 1% precision, and we hereby affirm the potential of asteroseismology to define an accurate age scale for ancient stars to trace the Milky Way assembly history.

          Which is the most eccentric binary known? Insights from the 2023/4 pericenter passages of Zeta Boötis and Eta Ophiuchi

 - **Abstract**
 There is a clear dearth of very eccentric binaries among those for which individual eccentricities can be measured. In this paper we report on observations of the two nearby, bright and very eccentric visual binaries Zeta Boötis ($\zeta$ Boo) and Eta Ophiuchi ($\eta$ Oph), for which VLTI/GRAVITY interferometric observations were obtained during their pericenter passages in 2023/4. Previous observations of $\zeta$ Boo suggest an eccentricity $e>0.99$ with high significance, implying that it has the highest eccentricity of any known binary. However, our interferometric measurements near periastron passage reveal that the eccentricity is actually $e=0.980450\pm0.000064$ (second highest well constrained eccentricity) with a pericenter distance $a_p=0.818\pm0.009\text{ au}$. We attribute the previous over-estimation to a degeneracy that plagues very eccentric visual binary orbital solutions. For $\eta$ Oph we find an eccentricity $e=0.93077\pm0.00013$ (compared to previous estimates of $e=0.95\pm 0.02$), a pericenter distance $a_p=2.15\pm0.10 \text{ au}$ and attribute the over-estimated dynamical mass in the previous solution to an underestimated error in the semi-major axis. In both systems full circularization is expected as the stars evolve and expand, ultimately leading to close binaries with no memory of their very eccentric past.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The 1.8 MeV gamma-rays corresponding to the decay of the radioactive isotope Al-26 (with a half-life of 0.72 Myr) have been observed by the SPI detector on the INTEGRAL spacecraft and extensively used as a tracer of star formation and current nucleosynthetic activity in the Milky Way Galaxy. Further information is encoded in the observation related to the higher Al-26 content found in regions of the Galaxy with the highest line-of-sight (LoS) velocity relative to an observer located in the Solar System. However, this feature remains unexplained. Aims. We ran a cosmological "zoom-in" chemodynamical simulation of a Milky Way-type galaxy, including the production and decays of radioactive nuclei in a fully self-consistent way. We then analyzed the results to follow the evolution of Al-26 throughout the lifetime of the simulated galaxy to provide a new method for interpreting the Al-26 observations. Methods. We included the massive star sources of Al-26 in the Galaxy and its radioactive decay into a state-of-the-art galactic chemical evolution model, coupled with cosmological growth and hydrodynamics. This approach allowed us to follow the spatial and temporal evolution of the Al-26 content in the simulated galaxy. Results. Our results are in agreement with the observations with respect to the fact that gas particles in the simulation with relatively higher Al-26 content also have the highest LoS velocities. On the other hand, gas particles with relatively lower Al-26 content (i.e., not bright enough to be observed) generally display the lowest LoS velocities. However, this result is not conclusive because the overall rotational velocity of our simulated galaxy is higher than that observed for cold CO gas in the Milky Way Galaxy. Furthermore, we found no significant correlation between gas temperature, rotational velocity, and Al-26 content at any given radius. We also [...]

 - **Abstract**
 Young stellar objects (YSOs) are surrounded by protoplanetary disks, which are the birthplace of young planets. Ring and gap structures are observed among evolved protoplanetary disks, often interpreted as a consequence of planet formation. The pre-Main Sequence (pre-MS) star MP Mus hosts one of the few known examples of protoplanetary disks within ~100 pc. Previously, a disk ring structure, with a radius of 80-85 au, was detected in scattered light via near-infrared coronographic/polarimetric imaging. This ring structure may be indicative of the disk clearing process. Although such ring structures were not seen in the ALMA Band 6 images, some features were detected at $\sim$50 au. In this paper, we analyzed new ALMA Band 7 observations of MP Mus in order to investigate the details of its disk substructures. By subtracting the continuum profile generated from Band 7 data, we discovered a ring structure in the Band 7 dust continuum image at $\sim$50 au. We calculated the overall dust mass as $28.4\pm2.8 M_{\oplus}$ at 0.89 mm and $26.3\pm2.6 M_{\oplus}$ at 1.3 mm and the millimeter spectral index $\alpha_{0.89-1.3mm} \sim 2.2 \pm 0.3$ between 0.89 mm and 1.3 mm. Moreover, we display the spatial distribution of the spectral index ($\alpha_{mm}$), estimating values ranging from 1.3 at the inner disk to 4.0 at a large radius. Additionally, we observed an extended gas disk up to $\sim$120 au, in contrast with a compact continuum millimeter extent of $\sim$60 au. We conclude that there are strong indicators for an active radial drift process within the disk. However, we cannot discard the possibility of a dust evolution process and a grain growth process as responsible for the outer disk structures observed in the ALMA continuum imaging.

          Sun Close-Encounter Model of Long-Period Comet and Meteoroid Orbit Stochastic Evolution

 - **Abstract**
 The dynamical evolution of long-period comets (LPCs) and their meteoroid streams is usually described with the Sun as the primary body, but over most of their orbits the Solar System barycenter (SSB) is effectively the orbital focus. Detailed numerical integrations show that the orbital elements in the barycentric reference frame are nearly constant, except within the orbit of Jupiter where the comet or meteoroid shifts to a heliocentric orbit. Here we show that this encounter can be modeled in the barycentric frame analogously to how planetary close encounters are treated in the heliocentric frame, with the comet captured into an elliptic orbit about the Sun as it in turn orbits SSB. Modeling the encounters as a two-body interaction in the SSB frame gives a different insight into the dynamics than offered by secular perturbation analyses, and reveals that a large portion of the stochasticity seen in the evolution of the comet's orbit is due to the Sun's state relative to SSB at the time of encounter. LPCs sample the Sun's state randomly at each return, so that a statistical characterization of Sun's state is sufficient to determine the qualitative evolution of their orbits, including stream dispersion. The barycentric orbital elements are shown to execute random walks well-characterized by Maxwellian distributions. This is superimposed atop a systematic orbital precession induced by planetary torques. Planetary close encounters add a second stochastic component, but this component does not typically dominate the solar perturbations. Based on the statistics of Sun's state alone, the age of a long-period comet meteoroid stream in a given orbit can be derived to reasonable precision from the observed random dispersion of the angular orbital elements at Earth.

 This study presents photometric analysis of the intermediate-age open cluster King 6, utilizing photometric data in UBV(RI)$_c$ passband and data from the 2MASS mission. The Gaia DR3 kinematic data were used to estimate the membership probabilities and TESS data is employed to search for variable stars within the cluster. The cluster's radius is estimated to be 9$^\prime$.0 based on the stellar density profile, while optical and near-infrared color-color diagrams} revealed color excesses of E(B-V) = 0.58$ \pm$ 0.03, E(J-K) = 0.24 $\pm$ 0.03, and E(V-K) = 1.53 $\pm$ 0.01 mag. Interstellar extinction law is normal in the direction of the cluster. The cluster$^\prime$s estimated age is $\sim$251 Myr and distance is 724 $\pm$ 5 pc. The mass function slope was found to be x = 0.57 $\pm$ 0.28 by considering stars $\geq$ 1 M$_\odot$. Our analysis indicates that the cluster is dynamically relaxed. Furthermore, we identified three new variable stars for the first time in the cluster region using TESS data. These variables belong to the category of slow pulsating B-type variables, with periods of 46.70, 47.92, and 37.56 hours.

 - **Abstract**
 In this article, we report the multiwavelength and multiview observations of transverse oscillations of two loop strands induced by a jet-related, confined flare in active region NOAA 13056 on 11 July 2022. The jet originates close to the right footpoint of the loops and propagates in the northeast direction. The average rise time and fall time of the jet are $\approx$ 11 and $\approx$ 13.5 minutes, so that the lifetime of the jet reaches $\approx$ 24.5 minutes. The rising motion of the jet is divided into two phases with average velocities of $\approx$ 164 and $\approx$ 546\,km\,s$^{-1}$. The falling motion of the jet is coherent with an average velocity of $\approx$ 124\,km\,s$^{-1}$. The transverse oscillations of the loops, lasting for 3 $-$ 5 cycles, are of fundamental standing kink mode. The maximal initial amplitudes of the two strands are $\approx$ 5.8 and $\approx$ 4.9 Mm. The average periods are $\approx$ 405\,s and $\approx$ 407\,s. Both of the strands experience slow expansions during oscillations. The lower limits of the kink speed are 895$_{-17}^{+21}$\,km\,s$^{-1}$ for loop\_1 and 891$_{-35}^{+29}$\,km\,s$^{-1}$ for loop\_2, respectively. The corresponding lower limits of the Alfvén speed are estimated to be 664$_{-13}^{+16}$\,km\,s$^{-1}$ and 661$_{-26}^{+22}$\,km\,s$^{-1}$.

          Role of Diffusive and Non-Diffusive Grain-Surface Processes in Cold Cores: Insights from the PEGASIS Three-Phase Astrochemical Model

 - **Abstract**
 Cold dense cores are unique among the structures found in the interstellar medium (ISM), as they harbor a rich chemical inventory, including complex organic molecules (COMs), which will be inherited by future evolutionary stages. These molecules exist both in the gas phase and as ices accreted onto grain surfaces. To model these environments, we present Pegasis, a new, fast, and extensible three-phase astrochemical code to explore the chemistry of cold cores, with an emphasis on the role of diffusive and non-diffusive chemistry in shaping their gas and grain chemical compositions. We incorporated the 2024 KIDA chemical network and compared our results with current astrochemical models. Using a traditional rate-equation-based approach, we implemented both diffusive and non-diffusive chemistry, coupled with either an inert or chemically active ice mantle. We identify crucial reactions that enhance the production of COMs through non-diffusive mechanisms on the grain surface as well as the mechanisms through which they can accumulate in the gas phase. Across all models with non-diffusive chemistry, we observe a definite enhancement in the concentration of COMs on both the grain surface as well as in the grain mantle. Finally, our model broadly reproduces the observed abundances of multiple gas-phase species in the cold dense core TMC-1 (CP) and provides insights into its chemical age. Our work demonstrates the capabilities of Pegasis in exploring a wide range of grain-surface chemical processes and modeling approaches for three-phase chemistry in the ISM, providing robust explanations for observed abundances in TMC-1 (CP). In particular, it highlights the role of non-diffusive chemistry in the production of gas-phase COMs on grain surfaces, which are subsequently chemically desorbed, especially when the precursors involved in their formation on the surfaces are heavier than atomic hydrogen.

          SSOXmatch: a Java pipeline to compute cross-matches of Solar System bodies in astronomical observations

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper I will describe a new software package developed using the Java programming language, aimed to compute the positions of any Solar System body (among asteroids, comets, planets, and satellites) to help to perform cross-matches of them in observations taken from earth- and space-based observatories. The space telescopes supported are Hubble, James Webb, Euclid, XMM-Newton, Spitzer, Herschel, Gaia, Kepler, Chandra, and TESS, although the flexibility of the software allows to support any other mission without the need to change a single line of code. The orbital elements can be selected among the asteroid database from the Lowell observatory (completed with the cometpro database of comets maintained by the LTE), and the JPL database of minor bodies. The software does not depend on external tools, and performs its own numerical integration of minor bodies. The dynamical model implemented for the Solar System includes the gravity effects of all major bodies, including the Earth, Moon, and Pluto as individual bodies, 16 perturbing asteroids as in other tools, the General Relativity effects, the oblateness of the Sun, Earth, and Moon, and the non-gravitational forces for both comets and asteroids. A complete set of web services allow to compute the cross-matches (that are later to be confirmed, for instance by visual inspection of the images) and also ephemerides of specific bodies. The code is highly optimized and follows the highest standards in terms of software quality and documentation.

          A post-common-envelope binary with double-peaked Balmer emission lines from TMTS

 - **Abstract**
 The dynamical method provides an efficient way to discover post-common-envelope binaries (PCEB) with faint white dwarfs (WDs), thanks to the development of time-domain survey projects. We perform a comprehensive analysis of the PCEB system TMTS J15530469+4457458 (J1553), discovered by the Tsinghua University-Ma Huateng Telescopes for Survey, to explore its physical origin and evolutionary fate. This system is characterized by double-peaked Balmer emission lines, and a cross-correlation function is applied to derive its radial velocity (RV) from a series of phase-resolved Keck spectra. Analyses with the cross-correlation function suggest that this system is a single-lined spectroscopic binary and only one star is optically visible. Further analysis through Doppler tomography indicates that J1553 is a detached binary without an accretion disk. Under such a configuration, the simultaneous light-curve and RV fitting reveal that this system contains an unseen WD with mass $M_{\rm A}=0.56\pm 0.09\, M_{\odot}$, and an M4 dwarf with mass $M_{\rm B}=0.37\pm 0.02\,M_{\odot}$ and radius $R_{\rm B}=0.403^{+0.014}_{-0.015}\,R_{\odot}$. The extra prominent Balmer emission lines seen in the spectra can trace the motion of the WD, which are likely formed near the WD surface as a result of wind accretion. According to the MESA simulation, J1553 could have evolved from a binary consisting of a 2.0-4.0 ${M}_{\odot}$ zero-age-main-sequence star and an M dwarf with an initial orbital period $P_i\approx 201-476$ d, and the system has undergone a common-envelope (CE) phase. After about $3.3\times10^6$ yr, J1553 should evolve into a cataclysmic variable, with a transient state as a supersoft X-ray source at the beginning. J1553 is an excellent system for studying wind accretion, CE ejection physics, and binary evolution theory.

 - **Abstract**
 Ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs) are X-ray bright (L$_{\rm X-ray} >$3$\times$10$^{39}$erg s$^{-1}$) extra-galactic objects that are powered by either neutron stars, or stellar or intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) but few have been detected in the radio waveband. In the nearby galaxy M82, the brightest ULX - M82 X$-$1, is thought to be associated with an IMBH but to date does not have a radio counterpart. We present deep wide-band reprocessed e-MERLIN images observed in 2015 May with an r.m.s. sensitivity of 7$\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$ and report the discovery of a new radio source with an integrated flux of S$_{\rm \nu=4.88\,GHz}$ = 174$\pm$15$\mu$Jy, which is spatially co-incident with the Chandra X-ray position of M82 X$-$1. This source is not detected in archival MERLIN/e-MERLIN observations in the last three decades. A search for intra-observation variability in the 2015 e-MERLIN data was inconclusive, but a comparison with 1.5 GHz e-MERLIN observations taken a week prior yielded no detection. We also detect the source at the same position with milliarcsecond angular resolution in EVN+e-MERLIN data from 2021 March at 53$\pm$10$\mu$Jy. The radio source position is ICRF J2000 RA: 09$^{h}$55$^{m}$50.1172$^{s}$, Dec: +69$^{\circ}$40'46.606" ($\pm$1.5 mas). These radio fluxes are consistent with other radio-detected ULXs on the radio:X-ray plane and points towards a stellar/intermediate-mass black hole. The black hole mass inferred by the `fundamental plane of black hole activity' is 2650 M$_{\odot}$, but this value remains highly uncertain.

 - **Abstract**
 The origin and evolution of the sub-Neptune population is a highly debated topic in the exoplanet community. With the advent of JWST, atmospheric studies can now put unprecedented constraints on the internal composition of this population. In this context, the THIRSTEE project aims to investigate the population properties of sub-Neptunes with a comprehensive and demographic approach, providing a homogeneous sample of precisely characterised sub-Neptunes across stellar spectral types. We present here the precise characterisation of the planetary system orbiting one of the THIRSTEE M-dwarf targets, TOI-771 (V = 14.9 mag), known to host one planet, TOI-771 b, which has been statistically validated using TESS observations. We use TESS, SPECULOOS, TRAPPIST and M-Earth photometry together with 31 high-precision ESPRESSO radial velocities to derive the orbital parameters and investigate the internal composition of TOI-771 b, as well as exploring the presence of additional companions in the system. We derive precise mass and radius for TOI-771 b, a super-Earth with R_b = 1.36 +/- 0.10 R_e and M_b = 2.47 +/- 0.32 M_e orbiting at 2.3 d. Its composition is consistent with an Earth-like planet, and it adds up to the rocky population of sub-Neptunes lying below the density gap identified around M dwarfs. With a 13% precision in mass, a 7% radius precision, and a warm equilibrium temperature of T_eq= 543 K, TOI-771 b is a particularly interesting target for atmospheric characterisation, and it is indeed one of the targets under consideration for the Rocky World DDT program. Additionally, we discover the presence of a second, non-transiting planet, TOI-771 c, with a period of 7.6 d and a minimum mass of Mp sin(i) = 2.9 +/- 0.4 M_e. Even though the inclination is not directly constrained, the planet likely belongs to the temperate sub-Neptune population, with an equilibrium temperature of 365 K.

 Primordial black holes are a unique probe of the early Universe and offer a potential link between inflationary dynamics and dark matter. In a recent work \cite{Inui:2024fgk}, we analyse PBH formation and the associated stochastic gravitational wave background from scalar induced gravitational waves, while taking into account the contributions from local non-Gaussianities. We highlight the observable consequences for the LISA and PTA experiments.

 - **Abstract**
 As part of the IRAM NOEMA Large Program SOLIS, we imaged the protostellar sources SVS13-A and SVS13-B in SiO, SO, CS, and CH3OH at a spatial resolution of 2"-3" (600-900 au). The CS and SO emission traces the 5000 au envelope that hosts the SVS13-A and VLA3 young stellar objects, and CH3OH probes the compact hot corino associated with SVS13-A. In addition, CS blue-shifted emission reveals a molecular shell in the direction of the jet driven by SVS13-A that is revealed by high-velocity SiO, SO and low-velocity H_2 emission. We also imaged the protostellar jet driven by SVS13-B in SiO, and in SO, CS, and CH3OH for the first time as well. The molecules peak at different distances from the driving source: SiO(2-1) peaks at about 1600 au, and SO(2_3-1_2), CS(2--1) and CH3OH(2_k,k-1_k,k) peak at about 2000-2850 au. Moreover, SiO(2-1) emits at larger distances than SiO(5--4), indicating a lower excitation at a larger distance from the protostar. The multi-species observations revealed a stratified chemical structure in the jet of SVS13-B. A jet-like component with a transversal size < 450 au is traced by SiO, which is efficiently formed in high-velocity shocks (> 25 km/s) by sputtering and vaporisation of the grain cores and mantles. A slower and wider (transversal size of about 750 au) component is probed by methanol, which is released from dust mantles at lower shock velocities (< 10 km/s). The SO and CS emission traces an intermediate component with respect to the components probed by SiO and CH3OH. High spatial resolution imaging (down to 10 au) of the jet of SVS13-B in multiple species will aid in reconstructing the chemistry of shocked material in protostellar jets.

 - **Abstract**
 Symbolic Regression (SR) is a machine learning approach that explores the space of mathematical expressions to identify those that best fit a given dataset, balancing both accuracy and simplicity. We apply SR to the study of Gray-Body Factors (GBFs), which play a crucial role in the derivation of Hawking radiation and are recognized for their computational complexity. We explore simple analytical forms for the GBFs of the Schwarzschild Black Hole (BH). We compare the results obtained with different approaches and quantify their consistency with those obtained by solving the Teukolsky equation. As a case study, we apply our pipeline, which we call \texttt{ReGrayssion}, to the study of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) as Dark Matter (DM) candidates, deriving constraints on the abundance from observations of diffuse extragalactic $\gamma$-ray background. These results highlight the possible role of SR in providing human-interpretable, approximate analytical GBF expressions, offering a new pathway for investigating PBH as a DM candidate.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an analysis of the cross-correlation between optical brightness and polarization degree in different types of blazars. The aim is to identify objects with simultaneous and consistent changes in characteristics and to determine if this behavior relates to the types of objects studied. The analysis includes 23 objects: 11 FSRQ, 11 BL Lac, and 1 radio galaxy. Dense overlapping observation series in the R band were used, collected over more than 10 years as part of a monitoring program for bright blazars at St. Petersburg State University. The cross-correlation analysis procedure is detailed, including a method for assessing significance based on Monte Carlo simulations of synthetic light curves modeled using a Damped Random Walk. Significant correlations were found for 5 FSRQ and 1 BL Lac. No significant correlation was detected for 10 BL Lac and 6 FSRQ. One object did not yield a reliable estimate. Based on the current results, we cannot claim that the observed difference in the behavior of these emission characteristics for different classes of blazars is significant. It is possible that observed correlations may be explained by the contribution of simultaneous flare events to the changes in flux and polarization degree curves, which occur more frequently in FSRQ objects.

          Dust-driven vortex cascades originating at water snow region: A pathway to planetesimal formation

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of observed planetary systems, including our solar system, as well as their diversity is still an open question. Streaming instability (SI) is an important mechanism for the formation of gravitationally bound planetesimals, which can grow to form planetary embryos and eventually planets. Snow lines in a protoplanetary disk can assist this process, as they can form pressure maxima and promote both dust accumulation and growth. Since the sublimation of a volatile is gradual due to opacity changes, a snow line in a protoplanetary disk is in fact a radially extended "snow region" of constant temperature. Regály et al. (2021) showed that the dust can affect the disk viscosity by adsorption of charged particles and a small perturbation in gas can lead to excitation of multiple small-scale Rossby vortices. Here we investigate the possibility of excitation of Rossby vortices and rapid planetesimal formation at temperature substructures associated with the snow regions, with the help of global, two dimensional, gas-dust coupled hydrodynamic simulations, which include dust feedback and self-gravity. We find that an initial temperature substructure in a protoplanetary disk can seed a rapid cascade of long-lived, self-sustaining Rossby vortices. The vortices accumulate significant amount of dust and the local conditions are favorable for streaming instability as well as gravitational collapse. However, the vortex formation via this mechanism requires sufficient decoupling between dust and gas, and such conditions may not be satisfied at early time when the disk is dense in gas, resulting in a delayed onset of vortex formation. The self-sustaining Rossby vortices offer exceptionally favorable conditions for dust growth and formation of planetesimals, as well as a possible pathway for rapid formation of planetary cores.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a systematic comparison of statistical approaches to Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) analysis using DESI DR2 data. We evaluate four methods for handling the nuisance parameter $\beta=1/(H_0 r_d)$: marginalization, profiling, Taylor expansion, and full likelihood analysis across multiple cosmological models. Our results demonstrate that while these methods yield consistent constraints for $\Lambda$CDM and $\Omega_K$CDM models, they produce notable differences for models with dynamical dark energy parameters. Through eigenvalue decomposition of Fisher matrices, we identify extreme parameter degeneracies in $ww_a$CDM and $\Omega_Kww_a$CDM models that explain these statistical sensitivities. Surprisingly, $\Omega_K$CDM shows the highest information content across datasets, suggesting BAO measurements are particularly informative about spatial curvature. We further use skewness and kurtosis analysis to identify deviations from Gaussianity, highlighting limitations in Fisher approximations in the dark energy models. Our analysis demonstrates the importance of careful statistical treatment when extracting cosmological constraints from increasingly precise measurements.

 - **Abstract**
 We use a probability theory framework to discuss the search for biosignatures. This perspective allows us to analyse the potential for different biosignatures to provide convincing evidence of extraterrestrial life and to formalise frameworks for accumulating evidence. Analysing biosignatures as a function of planetary context motivates the introduction of 'peribiosignatures', biosignatures observed where life is unlikely. We argue, based on prior work in Gaia theory, that habitability itself is an example of a peribiosignature. Finally, we discuss the implications of context dependence on observational strategy, suggesting that searching the edges of the habitable zone rather than the middle might be more likely to provide convincing evidence of life.

 - **Abstract**
 This work aims to develop a method based on a structurally reliable ice model and a statistically and physico-chemically robust approach for BE distribution inference, with the aim to be applicable to various relevant interstellar species. A multiscale computational approach is presented, with a Molecular Dynamics (MD) Heat & Quench protocol for the amorphous water ice model, and an ONIOM(B3LYP-D3(BJ)/6-311+G**:GFN2-xtb) scheme for the BE inference, with a prime emphasis onto the BE/real system size convergence. The sampling of the binding configurations is twofold, exploring both regularly spaced binding sites, as well as various adsorbate-to-substrate orientations on each locally distinct site. This second source of BE diversity accounts for the local roughness of the potential energy landscape of the substrate. Three different adsorbate test cases are considered, i.e. NH3, CO and CH4, owing to their significance in dust icy mantles, and their distinct binding behavior with water ices. The BE distributions for NH3, CO and CH4 have been inferred, with converged statistics. The distribution for NH3 is better represented by a double Gaussian component profile. Three starting adsorbate orientations per site are required to reach convergence for both Gaussian components of NH3, while 2 orientations are sufficient for CO, and one unique for CH4 (symmetric). Further geometrical and molecular surrounding insights have been provided. These results encompass previously reported results.

 - **Abstract**
 The emerging generation of radio-interferometric (RI) arrays are set to form images of the sky with a new regime of sensitivity and resolution. This implies a significant increase in visibility data volumes, scaling as $\mathcal{O}(Q^{2}B)$ for $Q$ antennas and $B$ short-time integration intervals (or batches), calling for efficient data dimensionality reduction techniques. This paper proposes a new approach to data compression during acquisition, coined modulated rank-one projection (MROP). MROP compresses the $Q\times Q$ batchwise covariance matrix into a smaller number $P$ of random rank-one projections and compresses across time by trading $B$ for a smaller number $M$ of random modulations of the ROP measurement vectors. Firstly, we introduce a dual perspective on the MROP acquisition, which can either be understood as random beamforming, or as a post-correlation compression. Secondly, we analyse the noise statistics of MROPs and demonstrate that the random projections induce a uniform noise level across measurements independently of the visibility-weighting scheme used. Thirdly, we propose a detailed analysis of the memory and computational cost requirements across the data acquisition and image reconstruction stages, with comparison to state-of-the-art dimensionality reduction approaches. Finally, the MROP model is validated in simulation for monochromatic intensity imaging, with comparison to the classical and baseline-dependent averaging (BDA) models, and using the uSARA optimisation algorithm for image formation. An extensive experimental setup is considered, with ground-truth images containing diffuse and faint emission and spanning a wide variety of dynamic ranges, and for a range of $uv$-coverages corresponding to VLA and MeerKAT observation.

 - **Abstract**
 We report cosmological results from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) when combined with recent data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT). By jointly analyzing ACT and {\it Planck} data and applying conservative cuts to overlapping multipole ranges, we assess how different {\it Planck}+ACT dataset combinations affect consistency with DESI. While ACT alone exhibits a tension with DESI exceeding 3$\sigma$ within the $\Lambda$CDM model, this discrepancy is reduced when ACT is analyzed in combination with {\it Planck}. For our baseline DESI DR2 BAO+{\it Planck} PR4+ACT likelihood combination, the preference for evolving dark energy over a cosmological constant is about 3$\sigma$, increasing to over 4$\sigma$ with the inclusion of Type Ia supernova data. While the dark energy results remain quite consistent across various combinations of {\it Planck} and ACT likelihoods with those obtained by the DESI collaboration, the constraints on neutrino mass are more sensitive, ranging from $\sum m_\nu < 0.061$ eV in our baseline analysis, to $\sum m_\nu < 0.077$ eV (95\% confidence level) in the CMB likelihood combination chosen by ACT when imposing the physical prior $\sum m_\nu>0$ eV.

          Gravitational Slip in the Parameterized Post-Newtonian Cosmology

 - **Abstract**
 A key signature of general relativity is that the two scalar potentials $\Phi$ and $\Psi$, when expressed in the longitudinal gauge, are equal in the absence of fluids with anisotropic stress. This is often expressed by stating that their ratio, the "gravitational slip", is equal to unity. However, the equality of $\Phi$ and $\Psi$ is typically broken in alternative theories of gravity. Observational constraints on the slip parameter are therefore of direct interest for testing Einstein's theory. In this paper we derive theory-independent expressions for the slip parameter on both large and small scales in Friedmann cosmologies, expressing it as a function of the post-Newtonian parameters. This is the final ingredient required for a complete parameterization of dust and dark energy-dominated cosmologies within the framework of Parameterized Post-Newtonian Cosmology (PPNC), which allows for the fully self-consistent modelling of cosmological observables without assuming any specific theory of gravity.

 - **Abstract**
 High quality wavelength calibration is crucial for science cases like radial-velocity studies of exoplanets, the search for a possible variation of fundamental constants, and the redshift drift experiment. However, for state-of-the-art spectrographs it has become difficult to verify the wavelength calibration on sky, because no astrophysical source provides spectra with sufficiently stable or accurate wavelength information. We therefore propose to use iodine absorption cells to validate the wavelength calibration. Observing a bright and featureless star through the iodine cell emulates an astrophysical target with exactly known spectral features that can be analyzed like any other science target, allowing to verify the wavelength calibration derived from the internal calibration sources and to identify systematics in the data processing. As demonstration, we temporarily installed an I$_2$ absorption cell at ESPRESSO. Employing a full forward modeling approach of the I$_2$ spectrum, including the instrumental line-spread function, we demonstrate wavelength calibration accuracy at the level of a few m/s. We also show that wavelength measurements do depend on the geometry of the light-injection into the spectrograph fibers. This highlights the importance of probing exactly the same light path as science targets, something not possible with internal calibration sources alone. We also demonstrate excellent radial-velocity stability at the <20 cm/s level in a full end-to-end fashion, from sky to data product. Our study therefore showcases the great potential of absorption cells for the verification and long-term monitoring of the wavelength calibration as well as the unique insights they can provide.

 - **Abstract**
 Identification of specific stellar populations using photometry for spectroscopic follow-up is a first step to confirm and better understand their nature. In this context, we present an unsupervised machine learning approach to identify candidates for spectroscopic follow-up using data from the Southern Photometric Local Universe Survey (S-PLUS). First, using an anomaly detection technique based on an autoencoder model, we select a large sample of objects ($\sim 19,000$) whose Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) is not well reconstructed by the model after training it on a well-behaved star sample. Then, we apply the t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) algorithm to the 66 color measurements from S-PLUS, complemented by information from the SIMBAD database, to identify stellar populations. Our analysis reveals 69 carbon-rich star candidates that, based on their spatial and kinematic characteristics, may belong to the CH or Carbon-Enhanced Metal-Poor (CEMP) categories. Among these chemically peculiar candidates, we identify four as likely carbon dwarf stars. We show that it is feasible to identify three primary white dwarf (WD) populations: WDs with hydrogen-dominated atmospheres (DA), WDs with neutral helium-dominated atmospheres (DB), and the WDs main sequence binaries (WD + MS). Furthermore, by using eROSITA X-ray data, we also highlight the identification of candidates for very active low-mass stars. Finally, we identified a large number of binary systems using the autoencoder model, but did not observe a clear association between the overdensities in the t-SNE map and their orbital properties.

 - **Abstract**
 Chemical tagging is a central pursuit of galactic archaeology, but requires sufficiently discriminative abundances to uniquely identify sites of star formation. This task is complicated by intrinsic scatter among conatal stars, inter-element correlations, imprecise abundance measurements, and systematics across stellar evolutionary states. In this work, we formalize the abundance correlation structure of the disk by quantifying the amplitude of information in individual element abundances once a subset is known, and map inter-element residual correlations to uncover hidden signatures of nucleosynthesis. We use two datasets of 79 (593) stars across $-0.15<\rm [Fe/H]<0.13$ ($-1<\rm [Fe/H]<0.41$) with measurements of 30 (19) element abundances of solar neighborhood stars, including 11 (7) light and $\alpha$, 7 (3) Fe-peak, and 12 (9) neutron capture elements. With a simple linear regression model, we predict most $\alpha$ and Fe-peak element abundances within 0.03~dex ($\sim7\%$), and neutron capture elements within 0.05~dex ($\sim10\%$). Including first and second peak s-process elements as predictors improves most neutron capture element predictions to within 0.02~dex (5\%), although no predictive power is gained by including an r-process element. We uncover strong (anti-)correlations in small residual abundances between and within element families. Our finding that disk abundance space is rigidly coupled, from light to heavy elements, implies chemical tagging is infeasible at $>2\%$ precision for $\sim$30 elements. However, the residual structure encodes fingerprints of star formation history, inherited from nucleosynthesis and environmental variations, and provides critical constraints for chemical evolution models. Future disk surveys must achieve sub-2-5\% precision in 30+ elements to access this independent information.

 The redshifted 21-cm signal of neutral hydrogen from the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) can potentially be detected using low-frequency radio instruments such as the Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR). So far, LOFAR upper limits on the 21-cm signal power spectrum have been published using a single target field: the North Celestial Pole (NCP). In this work, we analyse and provide upper limits for the 3C196 field, observed by LOFAR, with a strong ${\approx}80\,$Jy source in the centre. This field offers advantages such as higher sensitivity due to zenith-crossing observations and reduced geostationary radio-frequency interference, but also poses challenges due to the presence of the bright central source. After constructing a wide-field sky model, we process a single 6-hour night of 3C196 observations using direction-independent and direction-dependent calibration, followed by a residual foreground subtraction with a machine learned Gaussian process regression (ML-GPR). A bias correction is necessary to account for signal suppression in the GPR step. Still, even after this correction, the upper limits are a factor of two lower than previous single-night NCP results, with a lowest $2\sigma$ upper limit of $(146.61\,\text{mK})^2$ at $z = 9.16$ and $k=0.078\,h\,\text{cMpc}^{-1}$ (with $\text{d}k/k\approx 0.3$). The results also reveal an excess power, different in behaviour from that observed in the NCP field, suggesting a potential residual foreground origin. In future work, the use of multiple nights of 3C196 observations combined with improvements to sky modelling and ML-GPR to avoid the need for bias correction should provide tighter constraints per unit observing time than the NCP.

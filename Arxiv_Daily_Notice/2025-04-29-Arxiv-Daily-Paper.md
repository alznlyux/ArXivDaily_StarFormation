          Investigating the ground energy distribution of particles produced in extensive air showers

 - **Abstract**
 The energy spectra of particles arriving at the ground is a significant observable in the analysis of extensive air showers (EAS). Energy distributions at ground were studied for primary particles (12C,56Fe, p, and 28Si) with high primary energies (10^17, 10^18, 10^19, and 10^20 eV) from two zenith angles (0 and 30 Deg.). 960 EAS were simulated using the Monte-Carlo program Aires (version 19.04.00) with three models of hadronic interaction (EPOS-LHC, QGSJET-II-04, and Sibyll2.3c). Good agreement was obtained by comparing the present results with results simulated using CORSIKA for primary iron at an energy of 10^20 eV. In this study we investigated various secondary particles that arrive at the ground and deposit a portion of their energy on ground detectors. These results show that the distinction in energy distribution at ground is greater for primary protons than carbon, iron, or silicon nuclei at higher energies and steeper zenith angles.

 - **Abstract**
 Tidal disruption events (TDEs) are X-ray and gamma-ray radiations emerging from the tidal disintegration of a star or substellar object that passes too close to a supermassive black hole (SMBH) at the center of a galaxy. In November 2010, a TDE designated as IGR J12580+0134 occurred in the galaxy NGC 4845, which was traced by follow-up XMM-Newton observations in January 2011. To identify a further TDE based on the radio outburst cycle, we requested NICER monitoring observations for nearly a year beginning in March 2023, which we studied here along with the previous XMM-Newton observations. We analyzed X-ray brightness changes using hardness analysis and principal component analysis (PCA), and conducted spectral analysis of the source continuum. The NICER observations revealed the presence of some X-ray flares during March--June 2023, which were much fainter than the TDE observed using XMM-Newton in 2011. The PCA component that mainly contributes to the X-ray outbursts during the TDE is a heavily absorbed power-law continuum emission, whereas there is a small contribution from collisionally ionized plasma in the soft excess, likely from a colliding wind or jet. Similarly, the PCA of the NICER data relates the X-ray flares to a power-law spectrum, albeit with a much lower absorbing column, and partially to soft collisional plasma. The faint X-ray flares captured by NICER could be associated with extremely weak accretion onto the SMBH resident in this galaxy, and thus, potentially a low-luminosity active galactic nucleus.

 - **Abstract**
 Classifying potentially hazardous asteroids (PHAs) is crucial for planetary defense and deep space navigation, yet traditional methods often overlook the dynamical relationships among asteroids. We introduce a Graph Neural Network (GNN) approach that models asteroids as nodes with orbital and physical features, connected by edges representing their similarities, using a NASA dataset of 958,524 records. Despite an extreme class imbalance with only 0.22% of the dataset with the hazardous label, our model achieves an overall accuracy of 99% and an AUC of 0.99, with a recall of 78% and an F1-score of 37% for hazardous asteroids after applying the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique. Feature importance analysis highlights albedo, perihelion distance, and semi-major axis as main predictors. This framework supports planetary defense missions and confirms AI's potential in enabling autonomous navigation for future missions such as NASA's NEO Surveyor and ESA's Ramses, offering an interpretable and scalable solution for asteroid hazard assessment.

 - **Abstract**
 The chemical feedback from stellar winds in low metallicity (Z) environments is key for understanding the evolution of globular clusters and the early Universe. With disproportionate mass lost from the most massive stars (M > 100Msun), and an excess of such stars expected at the lowest metallicities, their contribution to the enrichment of the early pristine clusters could be significant. In this work, we examine the effect of mass loss at low metallicity on the nucleosynthesis and wind yields of (very) massive stars. We calculate stellar models with initial masses ranging from 30 to 500Msun during core Hydrogen and Helium burning phases, at four metallicities ranging from 20% Zsun down to 1% Zsun. The ejected masses and net yields are provided for each grid of models. While mass-loss rates decrease with Z, we find that not only are wind yields significant, but the nucleosynthesis is also altered due to the change in central temperatures and therefore also plays a role. We find that 80-300Msun models can produce large quantities of Na-rich and O-poor material, relevant for the observed Na-O anti-correlation in globular clusters.

          Peeking under the clouds: Is exoplanet imaging with the solar gravitational lens feasible?

 - **Abstract**
 Exoplanet imaging using the solar gravitational lens is an enticing prospect. The fundamental physical properties of the lens, including its angular resolution and light amplification, promise exceptional capabilities. These expectations, however, are tempered by the realization of numerous challenges, including imperfections of the lens itself, noise sources, the properties of the imaging target and difficult technical issues. We discuss, in particular, a subject not previously addressed, the impact of temporally varying surface features, notably a variable cloud cover, obscuring the target exoplanet. This has a substantial detrimental effect on image recovery, leading to our cautious assessment of the practical feasibility of using the Sun's gravitational field as an effective telescope.

 - **Abstract**
 Galactic archeology has long been limited by a lack of precise masses and ages for metal-poor stars in the Milky Way's thick disk. However, with TESS providing a growing number of photometric observations, it is possible to calculate masses and ages for more solar-like oscillators than ever using asteroseismology. We have used the pySYD pipeline to determine global asteroseismic parameters and calculated the masses and ages of $506$ metal-poor ([M/H] $<$ -0.5) red giants observed by TESS. Our findings appear to show metallicity-dependent mass loss on the upper red giant branch and identify a set of "young" high-$\alpha$ stars that have been detected in other studies. We also find that $32.6\%$ of the metal-poor stars appear to be binary interaction products and four stars with stellar ages that could be from the Gaia Enceladus/Sausage system. In combination with existing ages from Kepler/K2, this data can be compared to galactic evolution models to better determine the formation history of the galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 Forward modeling is often used to interpret substructures observed in protoplanetary disks. To ensure the robustness and consistency of the current forward modeling approach from the community, we conducted a systematic comparison of various hydrodynamics and radiative transfer codes. Using four grid-based hydrodynamics codes (FARGO3D, Idefix, Athena++, PLUTO) and a smoothed particle hydrodynamics code (Phantom), we simulated a protoplanetary disk with an embedded giant planet. We then used two radiative transfer codes (mcfost, RADMC-3D) to calculate disk temperatures and create synthetic 12CO cubes. Finally, we retrieved the location of the planet from the synthetic cubes using DISCMINER. We found strong consistency between the hydrodynamics codes, particularly in the density and velocity perturbations associated with planet-driven spirals. We also found a good agreement between the two radiative transfer codes: the disk temperature in mcfost and RADMC-3D models agrees within $\lesssim 3~\%$ everywhere in the domain. In synthetic $^{12}$CO channel maps, this results in brightness temperature differences within $\pm1.5$ K in all our models. This good agreement ensures consistent retrieval of planet's radial/azimuthal location with only a few % of scatter, with velocity perturbations varying $\lesssim 20~\%$ among the models. Notably, while the planet-opened gap is shallower in the Phantom simulation, we found that this does not impact the planet location retrieval. In summary, our results demonstrate that any combination of the tested hydrodynamics and radiative transfer codes can be used to reliably model and interpret planet-driven kinematic perturbations.

          Effect of kappa-modified polarization force on Jeans instability in nonthermal EiBI-gravitating dust clouds

 - **Abstract**
 A semi-analytic model is developed to study the effects of kappa-distributed lighter constituents and the associated kappa-modified polarization force on the classical Jeans instability in dust molecular clouds (DMCs). The constitutive electrons and ions are considered to follow a nonthermal kappa-velocity distribution law, while the constitutive massive dust grains are treated as the EiBI-gravitating fluids. A linearized quadratic dispersion relation is derived using spherical normal mode analysis. The resulting dispersion relation and its corresponding modified instability criteria are analyzed in the hydrodynamic and kinetic regimes. The oscillatory and propagating mode characteristics are illustratively analyzed. It is seen that the EiBI gravity introduces a new velocity term in the dispersion relation. In contrast, the nonthermal kappa-distributed constituents significantly enhance the polarization force against their respective Maxwellian counterparts. The kappa-modified polarization force and the negative EiBI gravity parameter have destabilizing influences, unlike the positive EiBI parameter. An enhanced polarization interaction parameter and a positive EiBI parameter reduce the real normalized frequency. Consequently, the phase velocity exhibits strong dispersion, increasing with wavenumber until reaching saturation, after which it transitions into a weakly dispersive regime. These findings provide new insights into the formation of smaller astrophysical structures via the non-local Jeans instability in the ultracompact HII regions of dense DMCs.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the instrument design and initial results for the Galactic Radio Explorer (GReX), an all-sky monitor for exceptionally bright transients in the radio sky. This instrument builds on the success of STARE2 to search for fast radio bursts (FRBs) from the Milky Way and its satellites. This instrument has deployments across the globe, with wide sky coverage and searching down to $32\,\mu\text{s}$ time resolution, enabling the discovery of new super giant pulses. Presented here are the details of the hardware and software design of the instrument, performance in sensitivity and other key metrics, and experience in building a global-scale, low-cost experiment. We follow this discussion with experimental results on validation of the sensitivity via hydrogen-line measurements. We then update the rate of Galactic FRBs based on a non-detection in $0.5\,\text{sky}\,\text{yr}$ of exposure, with twice the sensitivity of STARE2. Our results suggest FRB-like events are even rarer than initially implied by the detection of a MJy burst from SGR J1935+2154 in April 2020.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we apply an exploratory joint Bayesian transit detector (Taaki et al. 2020), previously evaluated using Kepler data, to the 2 min simple aperture photometry light curve data in the continuous viewing zone for the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) over three years of observation. The detector uses Bayesian priors, adaptively estimated, to model unknown systematic noise and stellar variability incorporated in a Neyman-Pearson likelihood ratio test for a candidate transit signal; a primary goal of the algorithm is to reduce overfitting. The detector was adapted to the TESS data and refined to improve outlier rejection and suppress false alarm detections in post-processing. The statistical performance of the detector was evaluated using transit injection tests, where the joint Bayesian detector achieves an 80.0 % detection rate and a 19.1% quasi-false alarm rate at a detection threshold {\tau} = 10; this is a marginal, although not statistically significant, improvement of 0.2% over a reference sequential detrending and detection algorithm. In addition, a full search of the input TESS data was performed to evaluate the recovery rate of known TESS objects of interest (TOI) and to perform an independent search for new exoplanet candidates. The joint detector has a 73% recall rate and a 63% detection rate for known TOI; the former considers a match against all detection statistics above threshold while the latter considers only the maximum detection statistic.

          exoALMA. X. channel maps reveal complex $^{12}$CO abundance distributions and a variety of kinematic structures with evidence for embedded planets

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze the $^{12}$CO $J=3-2$ data cubes of the disks in the exoALMA program. 13/15 disks reveal a variety of kinematic substructures in individual channels: large-scale arcs or spiral arms, localized velocity kinks, and/or multiple faints arcs that appear like filamentary structures on the disk surface. We find kinematic signatures that are consistent with planet wakes in six disks: AA Tau, SY Cha, J1842, J1615, LkCa 15 and HD 143006. Comparison with hydrodynamical and radiative transfer simulations suggests planets with orbital radii between 80 and 310\,au and masses between 1 and 5 M$_\mathrm{Jup}$. Additional kinematic substructures limit our ability to place tight constraints on the planet masses. When the inclination is favorable to separate the upper and lower surfaces (near 45$^\mathrm{o}$, i.e. in 7/15 disks), we always detect the vertical CO snowline and find that the $^{12}$CO freeze-out is partial in the disk midplane, with a depletion factor of $\approx 10^{-3}$ - $10^{-2}$ compared to the warm molecular layer. In these same seven disks, we also systematically detect evidence of CO desorption in the outer regions.

 - **Abstract**
 The exoALMA Large Program targeted a sample of 15 disks to study gas dynamics within these systems, and these observations simultaneously produced continuum data at 0.9 mm (331.6 GHz) with exceptional surface brightness sensitivity at high angular resolution. To provide a robust characterization of the observed substructures, we performed a visibility space analysis of the continuum emission from the exoALMA data, characterizing axisymmetric substructures and nonaxisymmetric residuals obtained by subtracting an axisymmetric model from the observed data. We defined a nonaxisymmetry index and found that the most asymmetric disks predominantly show an inner cavity and consistently present higher values of mass accretion rate and near-infrared excess. This suggests a connection between outer disk dust substructures and inner disk properties. The depth of the data allowed us to describe the azimuthally averaged continuum emission in the outer disk, revealing that larger disks (both in dust and gas) in our sample tend to be gradually tapered compared to the sharper outer edge of more compact sources. Additionally, the data quality revealed peculiar features in various sources, such as shadows, inner disk offsets, tentative external substructures, and a possible dust cavity wall.

          exoALMA XII: Weighing and sizing exoALMA disks with rotation curve modelling

 - **Abstract**
 The exoALMA large program offers a unique opportunity to investigate the fundamental properties of protoplanetary disks, such as their masses and sizes, providing important insights in the mechanism responsible for the transport of angular momentum. In this work, we model the rotation curves of CO isotopologues $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO of ten sources within the exoALMA sample, and we constrain the stellar mass, the disk mass and the density scale radius through precise characterization of the pressure gradient and disk self gravity. We obtain dynamical disk masses for our sample measuring the self-gravitating contribution to the gravitational potential. We are able to parametrically describe their surface density, and all of them appear gravitationally stable. By combining dynamical disk masses with dust continuum emission data, we determine an averaged gas-to-dust ratio of approximately 400, not statistically consistent with the standard value of 100, assuming optically thin dust emission. In addition, the measurement of the dynamical scale radius allows for direct comparison with flux-based radii of gas and dust. This comparison suggests that substructures may influence the size of the dust disk, and that CO depletion might reconcile our measurements with thermochemical models. Finally, with the stellar mass, disk mass, scale radius, and accretion rate, and assuming self-similar evolution of the surface density, we constrain the effective $\alpha_S$ for these systems. We find a broad range of $\alpha_S$ values ranging between $10^{-5}$ and $10^{-2}$.

          The Relationship between Image Dynamic Range and Antenna-based Gain Errors

 - **Abstract**
 The ngVLA science requirements call for continuum image dynamic ranges of 45 dB and 35 dB at 8 and 27 GHz respectively. In interferometric aperture synthesis imaging, visibility amplitude and phase errors result in errors in the final images, limiting the dynamic range attained. In order to achieve the ngVLA dynamic range requirements it is necessary to limit the amplitude and phase errors to within appropriate levels. The relationship between the number of antennas N in an interferometric aperture synthesis array and the error in the constructed image has been previously derived and conventionally adopted to be a scaling of \approx N. In this short memo, we argue that this relationship may not hold everywhere in an image and derive the relationship in a more stringent limit. We derive a more stringent \sqrt N dependence as opposed to the previous, generally adopted N scaling and compare with existing simulations. This relationship is at the root of allowable amplitude and phase errors arising from practically every corrupting effect, e.g. antenna pointing, primary beam characteristics, tropospheric and ionospheric phase fluctuations and polarimetric imperfections, among others. Thus, it is central to ngVLA calibration requirements and strategies. We recommend the adoption of a conservative \sqrt N dependence as the basis to derive the requirements and to identify applicable strategies.

 - **Abstract**
 Quasars accreting at very high rates are believed to be prime movers of galactic evolution because of their high radiative and mechanical output. The study presented in this paper investigates a sample of six highly accreting quasars at redshifts \( z = 2-3 \) using near-infrared observations from the LUCI spectrograph at the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT). The aim is obtain a precise measure of the quasar systemic redshift and accretion parameters (black hole mass and Eddington ratio) primarily from the \hb\ line, \ and on second stance from other intermediate and low ionization lines. Outflow dynamical parameters (mass rate of outflowing gas, its kinetic power and momentum rate) were estimated from the \civ\ emission line that is perhaps the most easily accessible tracer of high-ionization winds from the accretion disk, obtained from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. In addition, the joint analysis of the rest-frame optical and UV spectra allowed us to estimate the chemical composition of the broad line emitting gas. The high metal content of the outflowing gas ($Z \gtrsim 10 Z_\odot$) and the high values of thrust and kinetic power may induce a chemical feedback effect in the quasar host, in addition to mechanical feedback.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the impact of baryonic feedback on the small-scale ($k \gtrsim 1\,h\,$Mpc$^{-1}$) matter power spectrum is a key astrophysical challenge, and essential for interpreting data from upcoming weak-lensing surveys, which require percent-level accuracy to fully harness their potential. Astrophysical probes, such as the kinematic and thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effects, have been used to constrain feedback at large scales ($k \lesssim 5\,h\,$Mpc$^{-1}$). The sightline-to-sightline variance in the fast radio bursts (FRBs) dispersion measure (DM) correlates with the strength of baryonic feedback and offers unique sensitivity at scales upto $k \sim 10\,h\,$Mpc$^{-1}$. We develop a new simulation-based formalism in which we parameterize the distribution of DM at a given redshift, $p(\mathrm{DM}|z)$, as a log-normal with its first two moments computed analytically in terms of cosmological parameters and the feedback-dependent electron power spectrum $P_\mathrm{ee}(k, z)$. We find that the log-normal parameterization provides an improved description of the $p(\mathrm{DM}|z)$ distribution observed in hydrodynamical simulations as compared to the standard $F$-parameterization. Our model robustly captures the baryonic feedback effects across a wide range of baryonic feedback prescriptions in hydrodynamical simulations, including IllustrisTNG, SIMBA and Astrid. Leveraging simulations incorporates the redshift evolution of the DM variance by construction and facilitates the translation of constrained feedback parameters to the suppression of matter power spectrum relative to gravity-only simulations. We show that with $10^4$ FRBs, the suppression can be constrained to percent-level precision at large scales and $\sim 10$\% precision at scales $k \gtrsim 10\,h\,$Mpc$^{-1}$ with prior-to-posterior $1\sigma$ constraint width ratio $\gtrsim 20$.

          Global Simulations of Gravitational Instability in Protostellar Disks with Full Radiation Transport II. Locality of Gravitoturbulence, Clumpy Spirals, and Implications for Observable Substructure

 - **Abstract**
 Spiral perturbations in a gravitationally unstable accretion disk regulate disk evolution through angular-momentum transport and heating and provide an observational signature of gravitational instability (GI). We use global 3D simulations to systematically characterize and understand these spiral perturbations. The spiral perturbations and the resulting transport are overall insensitive to the cooling type, with the exception that radiative cooling, especially in the optically thick regime, reduces the amplitude of temperature perturbations. Spiral perturbations are localized around corotation, allowing transport to be approximated by a local $\alpha$ viscosity to zeroth order in aspect ratio ($H/R$), but only after averaging over multiple orbits in time and/or multiple scale heights in space. Meanwhile, large-amplitude perturbations from strong gravitoturbulence can cause $\mathcal O(\alpha^{1/2})$ deviation in the cooling rate of the disk. We develop empirical prescriptions for the angular-momentum transport, heating, and cooling in a gravitoturbulent disk that capture the deviation from a viscous, unperturbed disk to first order in $H/R$ and $\alpha^{1/2}$. The spiral perturbations in saturated gravitoturbulence are clumpy, with dense clumps forming through the nonlinear coupling between multiple modes at different $m$. Observationally, the clumpy gravitoturbulence produced by saturated GI can be mistaken with observational noise or embedded companions, especially under finite resolution. Meanwhile, grand-design spirals with $m$-fold symmetry may be uncommon among disks in saturated gravitoturbulence, and we speculate that they may instead be a signature of recently triggered or decaying GI.

 - **Abstract**
 This study investigates the metallicity distribution in M31 and M33 by using the near-infrared color index $J-K$ of tip-red-giant-branch (TRGB) of the member stars from \cite{2021ApJ...907...18R} after removing the foreground dwarf stars by the near-infrared $J-H/H-K$ diagram as well as the Gaia astrometric measurements. We employ the Voronoi binning technique to divide the galaxy into sub-regions, the PN method to determine the TRGB position in the $J-K$/$K$ diagram, and the bootstrap method to estimate the uncertainties. The TRGB positions are calculated to be $J-K = 1.195 \pm 0.002$ and $1.100 \pm 0.003$, and $K = 17.615 \pm 0.007$ and $18.185 \pm 0.053$ for M31 and M33 respectively as an entity, consistent with previous results. The $J-K$ gradient of M31 is found to be $-$0.0055 kpc$^{-1}$ at $R_{\rm GC}=(0, 24)$ kpc and $-$0.0002 kpc$^{-1}$ at $R_{\rm GC}=(24, 150)$ kpc. Notably, two dust rings are evident at 11.5 kpc and 14.5 kpc, in agreement with previous studies. The $J-K$ of M33 is analyzed in four directions and generally shows a trend of gradually decreasing from the inside to the outside, however, it shows an increasing trend of 0.022 kpc$^{-1}$ in the inner 0$-$2 kpc in the west. Through the color$-$metallicity relation of TRGB, the metallicity gradient of M31 turns to be $-0.040 \pm 0.0012$ dex kpc$^{-1}$ with $R_{\rm GC}<30$ kpc and $-0.001 \pm 0.0002$ dex kpc$^{-1}$ with $R_{\rm GC}>30$ kpc, and for M33, $-$0.269 $\pm$ 0.0206 dex kpc$^{-1}$ with $R_{\rm GC}<9$ kpc.

 - **Abstract**
 The advent of JWST has marked a new era in exoplanetary atmospheric studies, offering higher-resolution data and greater precision across a broader spectral range than previous space-based telescopes. Accurate analysis of these datasets requires advanced retrieval frameworks capable of navigating complex parameter spaces. We present NEXOTRANS, an atmospheric retrieval framework that integrates Bayesian inference using UltraNest/PyMultiNest with four machine learning algorithms: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, K-Nearest Neighbor, and Stacking Regressor. This hybrid approach enables a comparison between traditional Bayesian methods and computationally efficient machine learning techniques. Additionally, NEXOTRANS incorporates NEXOCHEM, a module for solving equilibrium chemistry. We applied NEXOTRANS to JWST observations of the Saturn-mass exoplanet WASP-39 b, spanning wavelengths from 0.6 microns to 12.0 microns using NIRISS, NIRSpec PRISM, and MIRI. Four chemistry models-free, equilibrium, modified hybrid equilibrium, and modified equilibrium-offset chemistry-were explored to retrieve precise Volume Mixing Ratios (VMRs) for H2O, CO2, CO, H2S, and SO2. Absorption features in both NIRSpec PRISM and MIRI data constrained SO2 log VMRs to values between -6.67 and -5.31 for all models except equilibrium chemistry. High-altitude aerosols, including ZnS and MgSiO3, were inferred, with constraints on their VMRs, particle sizes, and terminator coverage fractions, providing insights into cloud composition. For the best-fit modified hybrid equilibrium model, we derived super-solar elemental abundances of O/H = 7.94 (+0.18/-0.18) x solar, C/H = 10.96 (+0.42/-0.41) x solar, and S/H = 3.98 (+0.29/-0.35) x solar, along with a C/O ratio of 1.17 (+0.03/-0.03) x solar, demonstrating NEXOTRANS's potential for atmospheric characterization in the JWST era and beyond.

 - **Abstract**
 Rotating primordial black holes (PBHs) in the early universe can emit particles through superradiance, a process particularly efficient when the particle's Compton wavelength is comparable to the PBH's gravitational radius. Superradiance leads to an exponential growth of particle occupation numbers in gravitationally bound states. We present an analysis of heavy bosonic dark matter (DM) production through three gravitational mechanisms: Hawking radiation, superradiant instabilities, and ultraviolet (UV) freeze-in. We consider PBHs that evaporate before Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). For both scalar and vector DM, our analysis incorporates the evolution of a second superradiant mode. We demonstrate that the growth of a second superradiant mode causes the decay of the first mode, and thus the second mode cannot further enhance the DM abundance beyond that already achieved by the first mode. Our study also reveals that while superradiance generally enhances DM production, gravitational wave (GW) emission from the superradiant cloud may significantly modify this picture. For scalar DM, GW emission reduces the parameter space where superradiance effectively augments relic abundance. For vector DM, rapid GW emission from the superradiant cloud may yield relic abundances below those achieved through Hawking radiation alone. These findings demonstrate that multiple-mode effect and GW emission play critical roles in modeling DM production from PBHs in the early universe.

 The Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope (\insight) detected GRB 221009A, the brightest gamma-ray burst observed to date, with all its three telescopes, i.e. High Energy telescope (HE, 20-250 keV), Medium Energy telescope (ME, 5-30 keV), and Low Energy telescope (LE, 1-10 keV). Here we present the detailed observation results of all three telescopes of \insight~ on the prompt emission of GRB 221009A. After dead-time and data saturation correction, we recovered the light curves of HE, ME and LE telescopes and find that they generally track the GECAM-C low gain light curves that are free of data saturation issues. Particularly, the ME light curve matches the GECAM-C light curve in low gain mode above 400 keV, while the LE light curve is more consistent with the GECAM-C above 1.5 MeV. Based on simulation, we find that the signals recorded by the ME and LE are actually caused by the secondary particles produced by the interaction between GRB gamma-ray photons and the material of the satellite. Interestingly, the consistency between ME and LE light curves and GECAM-C demonstrates that ME and LE data could be used to characterize the GRB properties. Espeically, the high time resolution light curve of ME allowed us, for the first time, to calculate the minimum variability timescale (MVT = 0.10 s) of the main burst episode of GRB 221009A.

 - **Abstract**
 When a (non-)Abelian gauge field acquires an isotropic background configuration during inflation, strong gravitational waves (GWs) with parity-violating polarization, known as chiral GWs, can be produced in addition to the intrinsic unpolarized GWs. However, previous studies have analyzed individual models, leaving the generality of this phenomenon unclear. To perform a model-independent analysis, we construct an effective field theory (EFT) of chiral GWs by extending the EFT of inflation and incorporating gauge fields. The resulting action unifies inflationary models with a $SU(2)$ gauge field, such as chromo-natural inflation and gauge-flation, and ones with a triplet of $U(1)$ gauge fields, systematically encompassing all possible GW production mechanisms consistent with the symmetry breaking induced by the gauge field background. We find that chiral GWs are generically and inevitably produced, provided that the effective energy density of the background gauge field is positive and the gauge kinetic function is not fine-tuned to a specific time dependence. This EFT offers a useful foundation for future phenomenological studies as well as for deepening our theoretical understanding of chiral GWs.

 - **Abstract**
 The planet-hunting ALMA large program exoALMA observed 15 protoplanetary disks at ~0.15" angular resolution and ~100 m/s spectral resolution, characterizing disk structures and kinematics in enough detail to detect non-Keplerian features (NKFs) in the gas emission. As these features are often small and low-contrast, robust imaging procedures are critical for identifying and characterizing NKFs, including determining which features may be signatures of young planets. The exoALMA collaboration employed two different imaging procedures to ensure the consistent detection of NKFs: CLEAN, the standard iterative deconvolution algorithm, and regularized maximum likelihood (RML) imaging. This paper presents the exoALMA RML images, obtained by maximizing the likelihood of the visibility data given a model image and subject to regularizer penalties. Crucially, in the context of exoALMA, RML images serve as an independent verification of marginal features seen in the fiducial CLEAN images. However, best practices for synthesizing RML images of multi-channeled (i.e. velocity-resolved) data remain undefined, as prior work on RML imaging for protoplanetary disk data has primarily addressed single-image cases. We used the open source Python package MPoL to explore RML image validation methods for multi-channeled data and synthesize RML images from the exoALMA observations of 7 protoplanetary disks with apparent NKFs in the 12CO J=3-2 CLEAN images. We find that RML imaging methods independently reproduce the NKFs seen in the CLEAN images of these sources, suggesting that the NKFs are robust features rather than artifacts from a specific imaging procedure.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the impact of repulsive self-interaction in ultralight dark matter (ULDM) on dynamical friction in circular orbits in ULDM halos and its implications for the Fornax dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxy's globular clusters. Using the Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson equations, we derive the dynamical friction force considering soliton density profiles for both non-interacting and strongly self-interacting ULDM. Our results show that self-interactions reduce the dynamical friction effect further than both the non-interacting ULDM and standard cold dark matter models. Furthermore, we derive the low Mach number approximation to simplify the analysis in the subsonic motion, where the tangential component of dynamical friction dominates. Applying these findings to the Fornax dSph, we calculate the infall timescales of globular clusters, demonstrating that strong self-interaction can address the timing problem more effectively. We constrain the parameter space for ULDM particle mass and self-coupling constant, which are consistent with other constraints from astronomical and cosmological observations.

          Probing the Bounce Energy Scale in Bouncing Cosmologies with Pulsar Timing Arrays

 - **Abstract**
 In this work we constrain the bounce energy scale $\rho_{s\downarrow}^{1/4}$ in a generic framework of bouncing cosmologies using the nanohertz stochastic gravitational-wave background recently detected by pulsar timing arrays (NANOGrav 15-yr, EPTA DR2, PPTA DR3, IPTA DR2). A full Bayesian fit of the analytic SGWB spectrum for this bounce scenario reveals, for the first time, two distinct posterior branches in $(\rho_{s\downarrow}^{1/4},w_1)$: one near $w_1\approx0.3$ and one at $w_1\gg1$, where $w_1$ is the contraction phase equation of state. We find that the bouncing model attains larger Bayes factors against each of six conventional SGWB sources (SMBHBs, inflationary GWs, cosmic strings, domain walls, first order phase transitions, scalar induced GWs), demonstrating strong preference of current PTA data for the bounce hypothesis. Compared to the more generic dual inflation bounce scenario, the concrete bounce realization yields smaller Bayes factors, indicating that PTA measurements impose tighter constraints when the bounce scale is explicit. Moreover, the two posterior branches illuminate distinct theoretical frontiers. The right branch ($w_1\gg1$) violates the dominant energy condition (DEC), thereby providing direct empirical impetus for models with novel early Universe physics, e.g. ghost condensates, higher-derivative or modified gravity operators, and extra dimensional effects. Independently, both branches infer $\rho_{s\downarrow}^{1/4}$ above the Planck scale $M_\mathrm{pl}$, demonstrating that current PTAs already probe trans-Planckian regimes. Together, these findings offer a rare observational window into UV completions of cosmology. We further describe how normalizing flow based machine learning can accelerate such Bayesian analyses as PTA data volumes increase.

 - **Abstract**
 Of the many discoveries uncovered by the Gaia astrometric mission, some of the most exciting are related to nearby dispersed stellar structures. We analyze one such structure in the Milky Way disk, OCSN-49, a coeval stellar stream with 257 identified members spanning approximately 30$^\circ$ across the sky. We obtained high-resolution spectroscopic data for four members that span the stream's extent, finding these four stars to have solar metallicities and remarkably homogeneous chemistry. Through a combination of isochrone fitting, lithium abundance analysis, and gyrochronology, we find a consistent stellar age of 400--600 Myr. Integrating stellar orbits backwards reveals that OCSN-49 converged to a single point at a much younger age. By integrating unbound model stars forward and comparing them to the current phase-space distribution of OCSN-49, we derive a dynamical age of 83$\pm$1 Myr, inconsistent with the age of the stellar population. The discrepancy between the kinematic and stellar age indicators is naturally explained by a disruptive event that unbound OCSN-49 roughly 500 Myr into its lifetime. Based on rate estimates, disruption due to a passing giant molecular cloud (GMC) is the most likely culprit. Assuming a single encounter, we find that a nearly head-on collision with a fairly massive GMC ($\sim$10$^5$ M$_\odot$) was necessary to unbind the cluster, although encounters with multiple GMCs may be responsible. To our knowledge, OCSN-49 serves as the first known remnant of a catastrophically disrupted open cluster and therefore serves as a benchmark for further investigating cluster disruption in the Milky Way.

 Icy ocean worlds attract significant interest for their astrobiological potential due to subsurface oceans, organics, and chemical energy sources. We quantify thermodynamic viability of metabolism-relevant reactions at pressure-temperature conditions of Enceladus, Europa, Titan, Ganymede, and the Lost City Hydrothermal Field for comparison. We examine the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and a plausible prebiotic reaction network leading to it, using DEWPython (based on the Deep Earth Water model) and SUPCRT to compute equilibrium constants and Gibbs free energy changes across temperatures from 0-1200°C and pressures between 1 bar-60 kbar. We found that across most oceanic P-T profiles, certain TCA cycle species accumulate (citrate, succinate) while others diminish (fumarate, oxaloacetate), suggesting ocean worlds' conditions may not thermodynamically favor a unidirectional TCA cycle, requiring additional energy to overcome bottlenecks. Similar bottlenecks exist at Lost City, which is inhabited. In the prebiotic network, pyruvate and acetate show remarkable stability, feeding the TCA cycle through citrate production, bypassing the oxaloacetate bottleneck. Formation of most TCA cycle species from inorganic compounds (CO$_2$ + H$_2$) is highly favored throughout ocean world geotherms, except for oxaloacetate. While based on uncertain chemical concentrations, our non-equilibrium thermodynamic predictions are relatively insensitive to activity changes and may aid interpretation of future mission data.

 - **Abstract**
 The gas masses of protoplanetary disks are important but elusive quantities. In this work we present new ALMA observations of N2H+ (3-2) for 11 exoALMA disks. N2H+ is a molecule sensitive to CO freeze-out and has recently been shown to significantly improve the accuracy of gas masses estimated from CO line emission. We combine these new observations with archival N2H+ and CO isotopologue observations to measure gas masses for 19 disks, predominantly from the exoALMA Large program. For 15 of these disks the gas mass has also been measured using gas rotation curves. We show that the CO + N2H+ line emission-based gas masses typically agree with the kinematically measured ones within a factor 3 (1-2{\sigma}). Gas disk masses from CO + N2H+ are on average a factor 2.3(+0.7,-1.0) x lower than the kinematic disk masses, which could suggest slightly lower N2 abundances and/or lower midplane ionization rates than typically assumed. Herbig disks are found to have ISM level CO gas abundances based on their CO and N2H+ fluxes, which sets them apart from T-Tauri disks where abundances are typically 3-30x lower. The agreement between CO + N2H+ -based and kinematically measured gas masses is promising and shows that multi-molecule line fluxes are a robust tool to accurately measure disk masses at least for extended disks.

 - **Abstract**
 The gas surface density is one of the most relevant physical quantities in protoplanetary disks. However, its precise measurement remains highly challenging due to the lack of a direct tracer. In this study, we report the spatially-resolved detection of pressure-broadened line wings in the CO $J=3-2$ line in the RX J1604.3-2130 A transition disk as part of the exoALMA large program. Since pressure-broadened line wings are sensitive to the total gas volume density, we robustly constrain the radial dependence of the gas surface density and midplane pressure in the region located $50-110$ au from the central star, which encompasses the dust ring of the system. The peak radius of the midplane pressure profile matches the dust ring radial location, directly proving radial dust trapping at a gas pressure maximum. The peak gas surface density is $18-44\ {\rm g\ cm^{-2}}$} and decreases at radii interior to and exterior of the dust ring. A comparison of the gas and dust surface densities suggests that the disk turbulence is as low as $\alpha_{\rm turb} \sim 2\times10^{-4}$. Despite dust trapping, the gas-to-dust surface density ratio at the ring peak is { $70-400$}, which implies already-formed protoplanets and/or less efficient dust trapping. The gas surface density drop at radii interior to the ring is consistent with a gas gap induced by a Jupiter-mass planet. The total gas mass within $50 < r < 110$ au is estimated to be $\sim 0.05-0.1\ M_\odot$ ($50-100\ {M_{\rm Jup}}$), suggesting that planetary system formation is possible.

          Strong Toroidal Recirculation Zones at the Inner Dust Rim as the Origin of Meteoric Chondrules and Calcium-Aluminum Inclusions

 - **Abstract**
 We hypothesize strong (transonic) twin toroidal recirculation zones above and below the accretion disk midplane, rather close-in to the protosun, to be the source of chondrules and calcium-aluminum inclusions (CAIs). The recirculation zones act as centrifugal separators. In the case of chondrules, we suggest this happens during Class II (T~Tauri) stage of protostellar accretion, and in the case of CAIs, during an earlier higher-$\dot M$ phase of accretion. The recirculation zones advect and raise dust and solid aggregates above the midplane, making a ``mushroom-cap,'' and they also generate weak standing oblique shocks that heat and fuse protochondrules. We do not model the emission of these shocks, but point out that they will produce Doppler-broadened, possibly twin-peaked line emission with width of the order of $\simeq 200\ {\rm km\ s^{-1}}$. For concreteness, we focus on chondrules in the paper. Small ($\lessapprox 10 {\rm\ \mu m}$) diameter protochondrules are evaporated by the standing shocks, whereas large ($\gtrapprox 1\ {\rm cm}$) protochondrules are too heavy to be entrained and accelerated by the outer recirculation zone and outflow. Intermediate-size protochondrules, however, are centrifugally ejected and carried by high-speed diffuse gas outflow to the outer regions of the disk, where they rain down. The recirculation-induced dust mushroom caps will create significant IR continuum emission. We suggest they coincide with observed inner ``puffed-up'' dust rims. We also suggest that the recent interferometric inferences of arcs or ellipses in the sub-AU continuum IR of low-mass Class II protostars may be observations of corresponding chondrule-producing recirculation zones in those systems.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate neutrino signals associated with black hole formation resulting from the gravitational collapse of massive stars, motivated by the candidate failed supernova M31-2014-DS1 in the Andromeda Galaxy (M31). By compiling numerical simulation results for stellar collapse, we predict the expected neutrino emission and compare these predictions with observational limits from Super-Kamiokande (SK). The simulations reveal a characteristic precursor signal consisting of a short, intense burst whose average neutrino energy rises rapidly and then ceases abruptly once the black hole forms. We examine several nuclear equations of state, specifically the Lattimer \& Swesty, Shen, Togashi, and SFHo models, to evaluate how the emission depends on neutron-star properties and nuclear-physics uncertainties. Comparison of the predicted event counts with SK's non-detection of neutrinos coincident with M31-2014-DS1 already rules out part of the model space and highlights the sensitivity of current neutrino detectors to both progenitor mass and the EOS. These findings demonstrate the capability of neutrino astronomy to probe core collapse and black hole formation in failed supernova scenarios.

 - **Abstract**
 Pulsar scintillation observations have revealed ubiquitous discrete scintillation screens in the interstellar medium. A major obstacle in identifying the nature of these screens is the uncertainty in their distances, which prevents precise correlation with known structures in the Milky Way. We used the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) to observe PSR B1237+25, PSR 1842+14, and PSR 2021+51. We detected 10 scintillation arcs in PSR B1237+25, 1 in PSR 1842+14, and at least 6 in PSR 2021+51. By modeling the annual modulation of these scintillation arcs, we constrained the distances of the scintillation screens, as well as the anisotropic scattering directions and the projected velocities in those directions. The scintillation screens are distributed throughout the entire paths between Earth and the pulsars. Among these, the distance to the main scintillation screen toward PSR B1237+25 is $267^{+32}_{-28}$ pc, the scintillation screen toward PSR B1842+14 is at a distance of $240^{+210}_{-120}$ pc, and the main scintillation screen toward PSR B2021+51 is located at $887^{+167}_{-132}$ pc. Several screens in our sample appear at distances coinciding with the Local Bubble boundary, particularly the brightest scintillation arc toward PSR B1237+25. We provide a substantial sample of scintillation screen measurements, revealing the rich plasma density fluctuation structures present in the Milky Way.

 - **Abstract**
 Extremely-Low Lunar Orbits (eLLOs) (altitudes $\leq 50$ km) exhibit severe perturbations due to the highly non-spherical lunar gravitational field, presenting unique challenges to orbit maintenance. These altitudes are too low for the existence of stable `frozen' orbits, and naive stationkeeping methods, such as circularization, perform poorly. However, mission designers have noticed a particular characteristic of low lunar orbits, which they have found useful for stationkeeping and dubbed the "translation theorem", wherein the eccentricity vector follows a predictable monthly pattern that is independent of its starting value. We demonstrate this feature results from the low orbital eccentricity combined with the dominant effect of a particular subset of sectoral and tesseral harmonics. Subsequently, automated stationkeeping strategies for eLLOs are presented, utilizing this theorem for eccentricity vector control. Several constraints within the eccentricity vector plane are explored, including circular, annular, and elevation-model derived regions, each forming distinct stationkeeping strategies for varying orbital configurations. Subsequently, the optimal control profiles for these maneuvers within the eccentricity plane are obtained using Sequential Convex Programming (SCP). The proposed strategies offer computational simplicity and clear advantages when compared to traditional methods and are comparable to full trajectory optimization.

 - **Abstract**
 We explore constraints on the size of cool gas clouds in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) obtainable from the presence, or lack thereof, of refractive scattering in fast radio bursts (FRBs). Our refractive analysis sets the most conservative bounds on parsec-scale CGM clumpiness as it does not make assumptions about the turbulent density cascade. We find that the bulk of low-redshift cool CGM gas, constrained to have densities of $n_{\rm e} \lesssim 10^{-2}\,{\rm cm^{-3}}$, likely cannot produce two refractive images and, hence, scattering. It is only for extremely small cloud sizes $\lesssim 0.1$ pc (about a hundred times smaller than the so-called shattering scale) that such densities could result in detectable scattering. Dense $n_{\rm e} \gtrsim 0.1\,{\rm cm^{-3}}$ gas with shattering-scale cloud sizes is more likely to inhabit the inner several kiloparsecs of the low-redshift CGM: such clouds would result in multiple refractive images and large scattering times $\gtrsim 1 - 10$ ms, but a small fraction FRB sightlines are likely to be affected. We argue that such large scattering times from an intervening CGM would be a signature of sub-parsec clouds, even if diffractive scattering from turbulence contributes to the overall scattering. At redshift $z\sim 3$, we estimate $\sim 0.1\%$ of FRBs to intersect massive proto-clusters, which may be the most likely place to see scattering owing to their ubiquitous $n_{\rm e} \approx 1\,{\rm cm^{-3}}$ cold gas. While much of our discussion assumes a single cloud size, we show similar results hold for a CGM cloud-size distribution motivated by hydrodynamic simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) combines the signals of telescopes distributed across thousands of kilometres to provide some of the highest angular resolution images of astrophysical phenomena. Due to computational expense, typical VLBI observations are restricted to a single target and a small (few arcseconds) field-of-view per pointing. The technique of wide-field VLBI was born to enable the targeting of multiple sources and has been successful in providing new insights into Active Galactic Nuclei, the interstellar medium, supernovae, gravitational lenses and much more. However, this technique is still only employed in a few experiments, restricting the scientific potential of VLBI observations. In this conference proceeding, we outline new developments in wide-field VLBI, including an end-to-end correlation and calibration workflow, distributed correlation, and new calibration routines. These developments aim to enable wide-field VLBI to be a standard observing mode on all major VLBI arrays.

 - **Abstract**
 Interstellar complex organic molecules (iCOMs) may have a link to prebiotic species, key building blocks for life. In Galactic star-forming (SF) regions, spatial variations of iCOMs emission could reflect the source physical structure or different chemical formation pathways. Investigating iCOMs in extragalactic SF regions may thus provide crucial information about these regions. As an active extragalactic SF region, the central molecular zone (CMZ) of the nearby galaxy NGC 253 provides an ideal template for studying iCOMs under more extreme conditions. We aim to investigate the emission of a few selected iCOMs and understand if a difference between the iCOMs could reflect on the source's chemical or physical structure. Using the high angular resolution ($\sim 27$ pc) observations from the ALCHEMI ALMA large program, we imaged the emission of selected iCOMs and precursors; CH$_3$CHO, C$_2$H$_5$OH, NH$_2$CHO, CH$_2$NH, and CH$_3$NH$_2$. We estimated the iCOMs gas temperatures and column densities using a rotational diagram analysis, and by performing a non-LTE analysis for CH$_2$this http URL iCOM emission concentrates mostly towards the inner part of the CMZ of NGC 253 and can be reproduced with two gas components. Different emission processes can explain iCOM emission towards the CMZ of NGC 253: at Giant Molecular Cloud (GMC) scales ($\sim 27$ pc), the iCOMs could trace large-scale shocks whilst at smaller scales (few pc), both shock and heating processes linked with ongoing star formation may be involved. Using column density correlation trends and known formation pathways, we find that more than one formation path could be involved to explain the iCOM emission. Finally, we found chemical differences between the GMCs, such as a decrease of abundance for the N-bearing species towards one of the GMCs or different excitation conditions for NH$_2$CHO and CH$_3$CHO towards two of the GMCs.

 - **Abstract**
 The accurate determination of chemical abundances in stars plays a pivotal role in understanding stellar structure and evolution, nucleosynthesis, and the chemical enrichment history of the Milky Way. Benchmark stars with precise and accurate atmospheric parameters and abundances are indispensable for calibrating spectroscopic surveys and testing stellar atmosphere models. This study focuses on the compilation of high-quality spectra and the determination of LTE chemical abundances of iron-peak and $\alpha$ elements for the third version of the Gaia FGK Benchmark Stars (GBSv3). We compiled spectra of the GBSv3 from public archives and complemented these with our own observations. We use fundamental atmospheric parameters from Soubiran et al. 2024 to derive the chemical abundances and perform a spectroscopic analysis using the public code iSpec. We compile a homogeneous spectral library of high-resolution (42,000) and high signal-to-noise ($>100$) normalised spectra for 202 stars: including the 192 GBSv3, 9 stars with indirect measurement of the angular diameter from previous GBS versions, and the Sun. Using four radiative transfer codes, we derive chemical abundances of 13 chemical species (Fe I, Fe II, Mg I, Si I, Ca I, Ti I, Ti II, Sc II, V I, Cr I, Mn I, Co I, Ni I). We make an in-depth study of several sources of error. The GBSv3 contributes to the legacy samples of spectroscopic reference stars with improved statistics and homogeneity. The compiled high-resolution spectral library and the determination of abundances for iron-peak and $\alpha$ elements, together with an extensive discussion of the linked uncertainties, provides a sample of reference abundances to the community.

 - **Abstract**
 While delta Scuti stars are the most numerous class of kappa-mechanism pulsators in the instability strip, the short periods and small peak-to-peak amplitudes have left them understudied and underutilized. Recently, large-scale time-domain surveys have significantly increased the number of identified delta Scuti stars. Notably, the Tsinghua University-Ma Huateng Telescopes for Survey (TMTS), with its high-cadence observations at 1-minute intervals, has identified thousands of delta Scuti stars, greatly expanding the sample of these short-period pulsating variables. Using the delta Scuti stars from the TMTS catalogs of Periodic Variable Stars, we cross-matched the dataset with Pan-STARRS1, 2MASS, and WISE to obtain photometric measurements across optical and infrared bands. Parallax data, used as Bayesian priors, were retrieved from Gaia DR3, and line-of-sight dust extinction priors were estimated from a three-dimensional dust map. Using PyMC, we performed a simultaneous determination of the 11-band P-L relations of delta Scuti stars, which not only yields precise measurements of these relations, but also greatly improves constraints on the distance moduli and color excesses, as evidenced by the reduced uncertainties in the posterior distributions. Furthermore, our methodology enables an independent estimation of the color excess through the P-L relations, offering a potential complement to existing 3-D dust maps. Moreover, by cross-matching with LAMOST DR7, we investigated the influence of metallicity on the P-L relations. Our analysis reveals that incorporating metallicity might reduce the intrinsic scatter at longer wavelengths. However, this result does not achieve 3 sigma significance, leaving open the possibility that the observed reduction is attributable to statistical fluctuations.

          On Neutron Star Natal Kicks in High-Mass X-Ray Binaries: Insights from Population Synthesis

 - **Abstract**
 The motion of neutron stars (NSs) in the Galaxy is largely dependent on natal kicks received by the NSs during supernova explosions. Thus, the measured peculiar velocities of NS high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs) provide valuable clues to natal kicks, which also play an important role in the evolution of HMXBs. In this work, we collect proper motions, radial velocities and parallaxes for 36 NS HMXBs to derive their peculiar velocities at the birth of the NSs. We then use binary population synthesis to simulate the velocities of NS HMXBs with various choices of the kick velocity distribution for both core-collapse and electron-capture supernovae. Comparing the simulated and measured velocities, orbital periods, and eccentricities, we show that the natal kick distribution that can best match the observations is characterized by a bimodal Maxwellian distribution with $\sigma_1$ = 320 km s$^{-1}$ (for core-collapse supernovae) and $\sigma_2$ = 80 km s$^{-1}$ (for electron-capture supernovae) and the He core mass for the latter in the range of $(1.83-2.25)$ $M_{\odot}$. Our findings provide useful insights for further population synthesis and binary evolution studies of NS binaries.

 - **Abstract**
 SHARK-NIR is a new compact instrument for coronagraphic imaging, direct imaging, and coronagraphic spectroscopy in the near-infrared wavelengths mounted at LBT. Taking advantage of the telescope's adaptive optics system, it provides high contrast imaging with coronagraphic and spectroscopic capabilities and is focused on the direct imaging of exoplanets and circumstellar discs. We present SHINS, the SHARK-NIR instrument control software, mainly realized with the TwiceAsNice framework from MPIA - Heidelberg and the ICE framework using the C++ programming language. We describe how we implemented the software components controlling several instrument subsystems, through the adaptation of already tested libraries from other instruments at LBT, such as LINC-NIRVANA. The scientific detector comes with its own readout electronic and control software interfaced with our software through INDI. We describe the C++ core software Observation Control Software, responsible for dispatching commands to the subsystems, also implementing a software solution to avoid a potential collision between motorized components, fully transparent to final users. It exposes an ICE interface and can be controlled by clients developed in different languages. Observation, calibration, and maintenance procedures are implemented by means of template scripts, written in python language, controlling Observation Control Software through its ICE interface. These templates and their parameters are configured using "ESO-style", XML Observation Blocks prepared by observers, or in general SHARK-NIR users. The high-level control is carried out by REST HTTP APIs implemented in a python back-end, also acting as a web server for the several browser-based front-end GUIs. Finally, we present the first scientific results obtained by SHARK-NIR using coronagraphic mode.

 - **Abstract**
 The HMYSO G24.33+0.14 (G24), has recently been observed to undergo an accretion burst since September 2019, lasting approximately two years. By utilizing 1.3 mm observational data from the NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA) in March 2020 and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in September 2019, we have examined the physical environment changes in gas and dust within G24 region during the decay phase of the accretion burst. Following the burst, the continuum emission in the inner core region of G24 diminished by approximately 20%, while the emission in the outer region exhibited an increase by a factor of ~30%. This pattern indicates that the heat wave, triggered by the accretion burst, radiated outward from the core's interior to its periphery over the half-year period, with a calculated propagation speed of 0.08-0.38 times the speed of light. Moreover, the methanol emission intensity in this area has experienced a notable decline, with the rate of flux reduction correlating positively with the energy of the upper energy states. This, in conjunction with the analysis of methanol molecular line rotation temperature diagrams for different emitting regions, further substantiates that the core region of G24 cooled down, contrasted with the persistent heating in the outer region following the burst.

 We present high-contrast imaging observations of seven protoplanetary disks at 4um using the ERIS on the VLT. This study focuses on detecting scattered light from micron-sized dust particles and assessing the potential of the vAPP coronagraph for disk and planet characterization. Observations were performed in pupil-stabilized mode with the vAPP coronagraph. Data were reduced using reference differential imaging and angular differential imaging techniques, incorporating principal component analysis for point-source detection. Contrast curves and detection limits were computed for planetary companions and disk features. The infrared disk signal was resolved in all systems, with first-time 4um detections around AS 209 and Elias 2-24, revealing mostly axisymmetric structures extending up to 60au. Two gaps were detected in the radial profiles of TW Hya (22au, 35au) and AS 209 (50au, 100au). For Elias 2-24, scattered light emission matched ALMA observations of inner disk structures, marking their first mid-infrared detection. In the case of HD 100546, the vAPP uncovered flared disk structures and faint spiral arms consistent with previous observations. HD 163296 shows a bright inner dust ring, confirming disk asymmetries and features, but we did not detect any planet candidate within the achieved contrast limits. The disk around PDS 70 exhibits clear features, with faint structures detected within the cavity. The observations achieved contrasts enabling the detection of planets down to 800 K, but no companions were detected, implying either low-mass planets, cooler formation scenarios, or a large dust extinction of Av>20 mag. The vAPP performed robustly for imaging structures in protoplanetary disks at 4um, providing critical insights into disk morphology and constraints on planet formation processes. No planetary-mass companions with temperatures >1000K are present in our sample.

 Comets, during their journeys into the inner solar system, deliver volatile gases, organics, and particulates into their comae that provide crucial information for assessing the physico-chemical conditions in the outer disk from which they formed. Here we present observational and modeling results of a JWST NIRSpec and MIRI MRS integral-field-unit (IFU) spatial-spectral study of the inner coma of the Oort Cloud comet C/2017 K2 (PanSTARRS) at a heliocentric distance of 2.35 au. We find the comet is hyperactive (water ice active fraction greater than or equal to 86%), with a nucleus radius of $<$4.2 km, exhibiting strong emission from H$_{2}$O, $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, and CO$_{2}$ as well as CN, H$_2$CO, CH$_3$OH, CH$_4$, C$_2$H$_6$, HCN, NH$_2$, and OH prompt emission. The water ortho-to-para ratio is greater than or equal to 2.75. The modeled dust composition (relative mass fraction of the sub-micron grains) in the coma is dominated by amorphous carbon ($\simeq 25$%), amorphous Mg:Fe olivine ($\simeq 19$%), amorphous Mg:Fe pyroxene ($\simeq 16$%), and Mg-rich crystalline olivine ($\simeq 39$%) and the crystalline mass fraction of the sub-micron grains in the coma is, $f_{cryst} \simeq 0.384 \pm 0.065$. Analysis of residuals in 3 to 8 $\mu$m region of the spectral energy distribution strongly suggests the presence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAHs) species in the coma.

 - **Abstract**
 Asteroseismology gives us the opportunity to better characterize binaries and their products, and shed light on their role in Galactic populations. We estimate occurrence rates, mass distributions, and evolutionary states of asteroseismic binaries, exhibiting solar-like oscillations from both components, and of products of binary interactions with detectable solar-like oscillations. Additionally, we explore the effects of mass accretion or loss on apparent age-metallicity relations. Using the TRILEGAL code, we simulate Kepler's field of view adopting the Eggleton and Moe & Di Stefano distributions of initial binary parameters, and run an additional simulation with non-interacting binaries for comparison. We find that asteroseismic binaries require an initial mass ratio close to one, and even small mass transfer events can prevent the detection of oscillations from both components. The fraction of asteroseismic binaries for red giant stars with detectable oscillations ranges from 0.5\% for non-interacting binaries to a minimum of 0.06% when taking interactions into account. Moreover, asteroseismic binaries composed of two red clump stars are not expected at separations $\leq 500~\text{R}_\odot$ due to the interplay of stellar evolution and binary interactions. Finally, we estimate that at least ~1% of the Kepler red giants with detectable oscillations have undergone significant mass accretion or loss, potentially affecting Galactic age-metallicity relations, although there is a strong dependence on the assumed initial binary parameters. Comparing predicted and observed asteroseismic binaries, as well as over- and under-massive stars, offers a way to constrain key binary evolution assumptions, and to reduce uncertainties in mass-transfer modeling.

 - **Abstract**
 In the past decade, the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) has revealed a plethora of substructures in the disks surrounding young stars. These substructures have several proposed formation mechanisms, with one leading theory being the interaction between the disk and newly formed planets. In this Letter, we present high angular resolution ALMA observations of LkCa~15's disk that reveal a striking difference in dust and CO emission morphology. The dust continuum emission shows a ring-like structure characterized by a dust-depleted inner region of $\sim$40 au in radius. Conversely, the CO emission is radially smoother and shows no sign of gas depletion within the dust cavity. We compare the observations with models for the disk-planet interaction, including radiative transfer calculation in the dust and CO emission. This source is particularly interesting as the presence of massive planets within the dust cavity has been suggested based on previous NIR observations. We find that the level of CO emission observed within the dust cavity is inconsistent with the presence of planets more massive than Jupiter orbiting between 10-40 au. Instead, we argue that the LkCa~15 innermost dust cavity might be created either by a chain of low-mass planets, or by other processes that do not require the presence of planets.

 The exoALMA Large Program was designed to search for subtle kinematic deviations from Keplerian motion, indicative of embedded planets, in high angular and spectral resolution Band 7 observations of $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO and CS emission from protoplanetary disks. This paper summarizes the calibration and imaging pipelines used by the exoALMA collaboration. With sources ranging in diameter from 2.4" to 13.8" when probed by $^{12}$CO, multiple antennae configurations were required to maximally recover all spatial information (including the ACA for 7 sources). Combining these datasets warranted particular care in their alignment during calibration and prior to imaging, so as not to introduce spurious features that might resemble the kinematic deviations being investigated. Phase decoherence was found in several datasets, which was corrected by an iterative self-calibration procedure, and we explored the effects of the order of operations of spatial alignment, flux scaling, and self-calibration. A number of different imaging sets were produced for the continuum and line emission, employing an iterative masking procedure that minimizes bias due to non-Keplerian motions in the disk.

 - **Abstract**
 The "cosmic shoreline", a semi-empirical relation that separates airless worlds from worlds with atmospheres as proposed by Zahnle & Catling (2017), is now guiding large-scale JWST surveys aimed at detecting rocky exoplanet atmospheres. We expand upon this framework by revisiting the shorelines using existing hydrodynamic escape models applied to Earth-like, Venus-like, and steam atmospheres for rocky exoplanets, and we estimate energy-limited escape rates for CH4 atmospheres. We determine the critical instellation required for atmospheric retention by calculating time-integrated atmospheric mass loss. Our analysis introduces a new metric for target selection in the Rocky Worlds DDT and refines expectations for rocky planet atmosphere searches in Cycle 4. Exploring initial volatile inventory ranging from 0.01% to 1% of planetary mass, we find that its variation prevents the definition of a unique clear-cut shoreline, though non-linear escape physics can reduce this sensitivity to initial conditions. Additionally, uncertain distributions of high-energy stellar evolution and planet age further blur the critical instellations for atmospheric retention, yielding broad shorelines. Hydrodynamic escape models find atmospheric retention is markedly more favorable for higher-mass planets orbiting higher-mass stars, with carbon-rich atmospheres remaining plausible for 55 Cancri e despite its extreme instellation. Dedicated modeling efforts are needed to better constrain the escape dynamics of secondary atmospheres, such as the role of atomic line cooling, especially for Earth-sized planets. Finally, we illustrate how density measurements can be used to statistically test the existence of the cosmic shorelines, emphasizing the need for more precise mass and radius measurements.

 - **Abstract**
 Cloudy atmospheres produce electric discharges, including lightning. Lightning, in turn, provides sufficient energy to break down air molecules into reactive species and thereby affects the atmospheric composition. The climate of tidally locked rocky exoplanets orbiting M-dwarf stars may have intense and highly localised thunderstorm activity associated with moist convection on their day side. The distribution and structure of lightning-producing convective clouds is shaped by various climate parameters, of which a key one is atmospheric mass, i.e. surface air pressure. In this study, we use a global storm-resolving climate model to predict thunderstorm occurrence for a tidally locked exoplanet over a range of surface pressures. We compare two lightning parameterisations: one based on ice cloud microphysics and one based on the vertical extent of convective clouds. We find that both parameterisations predict that the amount of lightning monotonically decreases with surface pressure due to weaker convection and fewer ice clouds. The spatial distribution of lightning on the planet changes with respect to the surface pressure, responding to the changes in the large-scale circulation and the vertical stratification of the atmosphere. Our study provides revised, high-resolution estimates for lightning activity on a tidally locked Earth-like exoplanet, with implications for global atmospheric chemistry.

 - **Abstract**
 A near-infrared (NIR) excess has been discovered in the emission of the representative fast blue optical transient (FBOT): AT 2018cow. It was suggested that this NIR excess could be emitted by the dust surrounding the source and, thus, could provide a probe into the nature of its progenitor. We develop a model to describe the influence of the FBOT emission on the environmental dust and, as a result, a dust-free evaporation cavity can be formed on a timescale of one day. Outside this cavity, the surviving dust grains can have different size distributions at different distances to the source. With such a special dust environment, we fit the multi-wavelength light curves of AT 2018cow by taking into account the evolutionary dust echo of the FBOT emission. It is found that the dust temperature can vary with time along with the evolution of the irradiating FBOT emission. Even at a fixed time, the dust temperature can be distributed in a wide range rather than having only a unique value. Furthermore, both the mass of the dust shell and its distance to the FBOT are found to be much larger than those derived with a direct empirical fitting of the NIR spectra but without considering the evolutionary relationship between the spectra.

 - **Abstract**
 Analysis of the gaseous component in protoplanetary disks can inform us about their thermal and physical structure, chemical composition, and kinematic properties, all of which are crucial for understanding various processes within the disks. By exploiting the asymmetry of the line emission, or via line profile analysis, we can locate the emitting surfaces. Here, we present the emission surfaces of the exoALMA sources in $^{12}$CO $J=3-2$, $^{13}$CO $J=3-2$, and CS $J=7-6$. We find that $^{12}$CO traces the upper disk atmosphere, with mean <$z/r$> values of $\approx$ 0.28, while $^{13}$CO and CS trace lower regions of the disk with mean <z/r> values of $\approx$ 0.16 and $\approx$ 0.18, respectively. We find that $^{12}$CO <$z/r$> and the disk mass are positively correlated with each other; this relationship offers a straightforward way to infer the disk mass. We derive 2-D $r-z$ temperature distributions of the disks. Additionally, we search for substructure in the surfaces and radial intensity profiles; we find evidence of localized substructure in the emission surfaces and peak intensity profiles of nearly every disk, with this substructure often being co-incident between molecular tracers, intensity profiles, and kinematic perturbations. Four disks display evidence of potential photo-desorption, implying that this effect may be common even in low FUV star-forming regions. For most disks, we find that the physical and thermal structure is more complex than analytical models can account for, highlighting a need for more theoretical work and a better understanding of the role of projection effects on our observations.

 Gravitational microlensing of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) provides a unique opportunity to probe compact dark matter and small-scale structures in the universe. However, identifying such microlensed GRBs within large datasets is a significant challenge. In this study, we develop a machine learning approach to distinguish Lensed GRBs from their Non-lensed counterparts using simulated light curves. A comprehensive dataset was generated, comprising labeled light curves for both categories. Features were extracted using the Cesium package, capturing critical temporal properties of the light curves. Multiple machine learning models were trained on the extracted features, with Random Forest achieving the best performance, delivering an accuracy of 94\% and an F1 score of 95\% (94\%) for Non-Lensed (Lensed) class. This approach successfully demonstrates the potential of machine learning for identifying gravitational lensing in GRBs, paving the way for future observational applications.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an analysis of the archival XMM-Newton observations of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) supernova remnant N132D totaling more than 500ks. We focus on the high temperature plasma ($kt\sim 4.5$keV) that is responsible for the high energy continuum and exciting the Fe K emission. An image analysis shows that the Fe K emission is mainly concentrated in the southern part of the remnant interior to the region defined by the forward shock. This Fe K distribution would be consistent with an asymmetric distribution of the Fe ejecta and/or an asymmetric interaction between the reverse shock and the Fe ejecta. We compare the EPIC-pn and EPIC-MOS spectra in the 3.0 -- 12.0keV bandpass with a model based on RGS data plus a higher temperature component, in collisional ionization equilibrium (CIE), or non-equilibrium (NEI) (both ionizing and recombining). We find that the data are equally well-fitted by the CIE and ionizing models. Assuming the CIE and ionizing spectral models, the Fe in this high temperature component is significantly enhanced with respect to typical LMC abundances. We can place only an upper limit on the neutral Fe K line. We conclude that the Fe~K emission is due to ejecta heated by the reverse shock given the spatial distribution, relatively high temperature, and enhanced abundance. We estimate the progenitor mass based on the Ca/Fe and Ni/Fe mass ratios to be $13\le M_P \le 15 M_\odot$.

 The ALMA large program exoALMA offers a unique window into the three-dimensional physical and dynamical properties of 15 circumstellar disks where planets may be actively forming. Here, we present an analysis methodology to map the gas disk structure and substructure encoded in 12CO, 13CO, and CS line emission from our targets. To model and characterize the disk structure probed by optically thin species, such as CS and, in some cases, 13CO, we introduce a composite line profile kernel that accounts for increased intensities caused by the projected overlap between the disk's front and back side emission. Our workflow, built on the Discminer modelling framework, incorporates an improved iterative two-component fitting method for inclined sources ($i>40^\circ$), to mitigate the impact of the disk backside on the extraction of velocity maps. Also, we report best-fit parameters for the Keplerian stellar masses, as well as inclinations, position angles, systemic velocities, rotation direction, and emission surfaces of the disks in our sample.

 - **Abstract**
 The availability of exquisite data and the development of new analysis techniques have enabled the study of emitting heights in proto-planetary disks. In this paper we introduce a simple model linking the emitting height of CO to the disk surface density and temperature structure. We then apply the model to measurements of the emitting height and disk temperature conducted as part of exoALMA, integrated with additional legacy measurements from the MAPS Large Programme, to derive CO column densities and surface density profiles (assuming a CO abundance) for a total of 14 disks. A unique feature of the method we introduce to measure surface densities is that it can be applied to optically thick observations, rather than optically thin as conventionally done. While we use our method on a sample of well studied disks where temperature structures have been derived using two emission lines, we show that reasonably accurate estimates can be obtained also when only one molecular transition is available. With our method we obtain independent constraints from $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO and we find they are in general good agreement using the standard $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C isotopic ratio. The masses derived from our method are systematically lower compared with the values derived dynamically from the rotation curve if using an ISM CO abundance, implying that CO is depleted by a median factor $\sim$20 with respect to the ISM value, in line with other works that find that CO is depleted in proto-planetary disks.

 - **Abstract**
 The key planet-formation processes in protoplanetary disks remain an active matter of research. One promising mechanism to radially and azimuthally trap millimeter-emitting dust grains, enabling them to concentrate and grow into planetesimals, is anticyclonic vortices. While dust observations have revealed crescent structures in several disks, observations of their kinematic signatures are still lacking. Studying the gas dynamics is, however, essential to confirm the presence of a vortex and understand its dust trapping properties. In this work, we make use of the high-resolution and sensitivity observations conducted by the exoALMA large program to search for such signatures in the $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO molecular line emission of four disks with azimuthal dust asymmetries: HD 135344B, HD 143006, HD 34282, and MWC 758. To assess the vortex features, we constructed an analytical vortex model and performed hydrodynamical simulations. For the latter, we assumed two scenarios: a vortex triggered at the edge of a dead zone and of a gap created by a massive embedded planet. These models reveal a complex kinematical morphology of the vortex. When compared to the data, we find that none of the sources show a distinctive vortex signature around the dust crescents in the kinematics.

          Local primordial non-Gaussianity from 'zero-bias' 21cm radiation during reionization

 - **Abstract**
 We revisit the potential of 21cm radiation fluctuations, during the epoch of reionization, in constraining the amplitude of local primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG) $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}$. There generically exists an epoch at which the linear bias of the 21cm field crosses zero, independent of the precise astrophysics of reionization. This epoch implies the 21cm radiation is a natural "zero-bias tracer" in the sense of Castorina et al (2018). We identify new noise-like contributions which directly compete with the zero-bias effect, but which should be mitigated through sophisticated analysis techniques such as field-level reconstruction. These noise-like terms act to hinder the constraining power on local PNG of the brightness temperature fluctuations, making $\sigma (f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}) \leq 1$ unachievable even in simplified forecasts. We show that analyses which can reach the 'sampling noise' floor for this tracer and harness its full power can potentially unlock a 10-fold reduction in error bars, even in the presence of large-scale cuts from foregrounds. The potential of this epoch motivates searching for it in future 21cm surveys, along with developing analysis techniques that can reach the noise floor required for the zero-bias epoch to saturate Fisher information.

 - **Abstract**
 The bulk motion of the gas in protoplanetary disks around newborn stars is nearly Keplerian. By leveraging the high angular and spectral resolution of ALMA, we can detect small-scale velocity perturbations in molecular line observations caused by local gas pressure variations in the disk, possibly induced by embedded protoplanets. This paper presents the azimuthally averaged rotational velocity and its deviations from Keplerian rotation ($\delta\upsilon_{\phi}$) for the exoALMA sample, as measured in the $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO emission lines. The rotation signatures show evidence for vertically stratified disks, in which $^{13}$CO rotates faster than $^{12}$CO due to a distinct thermal gas pressure gradient at their emitting heights. We find $\delta\upsilon_{\phi}$-substructures in the sample on both small ($\sim$10 au) and large ($\sim$100 au) radial scales, reaching deviations up to 15% from background Keplerian velocity in the most extreme cases. More than 75% of the rings and 80% of the gaps in the dust continuum emission resolved in $\delta\upsilon_{\phi}$ are co-located with gas pressure maxima and minima, respectively. Additionally, gas pressure substructures are observed far beyond the dust continuum emission. For the first time, we determined the gas pressure derivative at the midplane from observations and found it to align well with the dust substructures within the given uncertainties. Based on our findings, we conclude that gas pressure variations are likely the dominant mechanism for ring and gap formation in the dust continuum.

 - **Abstract**
 Fast-rotating Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars are potential progenitors of long gamma-ray bursts, but observational verification is challenging. Spectral lines from their expanding stellar wind obscure accurate rotational velocity measurements. Intrinsic polarization from wind rotation may help determine rotational speeds, requiring precise wind models. Our study aims to investigate the intrinsic polarization due to the rotational distortion of WR winds considering multiple scattering of photons and compare it to a single-scattering model, where we use an analytical expression of the polarization. We study the polarization signatures resulting from the prolate structure of rotating winds of two WR stars using a 3D Monte Carlo radiative transfer code Hyperion. We estimated the intrinsic polarization resulting from multiple scattering in WR winds for different rotational velocities, inclination angles, and mass-loss rates. Our results indicate that at a rotation rate of less than 50 % of the critical rate, the intrinsic polarization from multiple scattering is close to that of a single scattering model. However, at higher rotation velocities, the polarization from multiple scattering increases with inclination up to 40$^\circ$, while it decreases for inclinations higher than about 60$^\circ$. This dependence is inconsistent with the single-scattering model. We also discuss the effect of the mass-loss rate on the polarization and find that the polarization changes linearly with the mass-loss rate. However, it is important to note that the relationship between polarization and mass-loss rate may vary for different types of stars. The results have implications for future studies of stellar winds and mass loss and may help to improve our understanding of the complex environments of massive stars. Our research offers valuable information on the complex polarization patterns observed in stellar winds.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the tightest cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing constraints to date on the growth of structure by combining CMB lensing measurements from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), the South Pole Telescope (SPT) and \textit{Planck}. Each of these surveys individually provides lensing measurements with similarly high statistical power, achieving signal-to-noise ratios of approximately 40. The combined lensing bandpowers represent the most precise CMB lensing power spectrum measurement to date with a signal-to-noise ratio of 61 and an amplitude of $A_\mathrm{lens}^\mathrm{recon} = 1.025 \pm 0.017$ with respect to the theory prediction from the best-fit CMB \textit{Planck}-ACT cosmology. The bandpowers from all three lensing datasets, analyzed jointly, yield a $1.6\%$ measurement of the parameter combination $S_8^\mathrm{CMBL} \equiv \sigma_8\,(\Omega_m/0.3)^{0.25} = 0.825^{+0.015}_{-0.013}$. Including Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data improves the constraint on the amplitude of matter fluctuations to $\sigma_8 = 0.829 \pm 0.009$ (a $1.1\%$ determination). When combining with uncalibrated supernovae from \texttt{Pantheon+}, we present a $4\%$ sound-horizon-independent estimate of $H_0=66.4\pm2.5\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}} $. The joint lensing constraints on structure growth and present-day Hubble rate are fully consistent with a $\Lambda$CDM model fit to the primary CMB data from \textit{Planck} and ACT. While the precise upper limit is sensitive to the choice of data and underlying model assumptions, when varying the neutrino mass sum within the $\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}$ cosmological model, the combination of primary CMB, BAO and CMB lensing drives the probable upper limit for the mass sum towards lower values, comparable to the minimum mass prior required by neutrino oscillation experiments.

 - **Abstract**
 We confront the star formation rate in different dark matter (DM) models with UV luminosity data from JWST up to $z\simeq25$ and legacy data from HST. We find that a transition from a Salpeter population to top-heavy Pop-III stars is likely at $z\simeq10$ and that beyond $z=10-15$ the feedback from supernovae and active galactic nuclei is progressively reduced, so that at $z\simeq25$ the production of stars is almost free from any feedback. We compare fuzzy and warm DM models that suppress small-scale structures with the CDM paradigm, finding that the fuzzy DM mass $> 4.5 \times 10^{-22}{\rm eV}$ and the warm DM mass $> 1.5\, {\rm keV}$ at the 95\% CL. The fits of the star formation rate parametrization do not depend strongly on the DM properties within the allowed range. We find no preference over CDM for enhanced matter perturbations associated with axion miniclusters or primordial black holes. The scale of the enhancement of the power spectrum should be $> 27\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ at the 95\% CL, excluding axion miniclusters produced for $m_a < 7.5 \times 10^{-17}\,{\rm eV}$ or heavy primordial black holes that constitute a fraction $f_{\rm PBH}$ of DM in the range $10^{-4} (m_{\rm PBH}/10^4 \,M_{\odot})^{-0.09} < f_{\rm PBH} < 8.7\times 10^{-3} (m_{\rm PBH}/10^4\, M_{\odot})^{-1}$.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the properties of cosmological ionization fronts during the Epoch of Reionization using the CROC simulations. By analyzing reionization timing maps, we characterize ionization front velocities and curvatures and their dependence on the density structure of the intergalactic medium (IGM). The velocity distribution of ionization fronts in the simulations indicates that while the barrier-crossing analytical model captures the overall shape in high-velocity regions, it fails to reproduce the low-velocity tail, highlighting the non-Gaussian nature of the IGM's density field. Ionization front velocities are inversely correlated with local density, propagating faster in underdense regions and more slowly in overdense environments. Faster ionization fronts also lead to higher post-ionization temperatures, reaching a plateau at $\sim 2 \times 10^4$ K for velocities exceeding 3000 km/s. Examining curvature statistics further establishes a connection between ionization front structure and the normalized density contrast $\nu$, with trends in overdense regions aligning well with barrier-crossing model predictions, while deviations appear in underdense environments due to model limitations. These results provide a detailed characterization of ionization front dynamics and their interaction with the underlying density field, bridging small-scale reionization physics with large-scale observables such as the 21 cm signal and the IGM's thermal history.

 - **Abstract**
 The spin of a black hole (BH) encodes information about its formation and evolution history. Yet the understanding of the distribution of BH spins in X-ray binaries (XBs), of the models used to measure spin, and of their impact on systematic uncertainties remains incomplete. In this work, we expand on previous analyses of the entire NuSTAR archive of accreting BH XBs. Prior work compiled a sample of 245 spectral fits using the relativistic reflection method for NuSTAR observations of 36 BH systems. Here, we aim to probe two aspects: the connection between BH spin and binary system properties, and the relationship between parameters in spectral fits. We identify moderate negative correlations between spin uncertainty and both BH mass and system inclination, and a moderate positive correlation with distance. We also point out tentative multi-dimensional degeneracies between inclination, disk density, Fe abundance, ionization, and the presence or absence of absorption features from ionized outflows linked to disk winds. Lastly, we provide a comprehensive view of the observed distribution of BH spins in XBs, in comparison to spins inferred from gravitational waves. We find that the distribution of BH spins in XBs can be described by a Beta distribution with $\alpha=5.66$ and $\beta=1.09$. This data set is highly complex, and the analysis presented here does not fully explore all potential parameter correlations. We make the full data set available to the community to encourage further exploration.

          Early Growth of Structure in Warm Wave Dark Matter

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the growth of structure in wave-like dark matter models, where the field and density spectra are peaked at sub-horizon wavenumbers. Starting with the Schrödinger-Poisson system, we derive the scale-dependent evolution of the matter power spectrum during radiation and matter domination. We find a suppression of adiabatic perturbations during radiation domination, controlled by a free-streaming length, and scale-dependent growth of the initially white-noise isocurvature power, controlled by a Jeans scale during matter domination. The results are in qualitative, and in some regimes quantitative, agreement with the quasi-particle picture. We verify the analytic results of the power spectrum with 3+1-dimensional cosmological Schrödinger-Poisson simulations. We propose an analytic formula for the halo mass function, which is in rough agreement with the simulation results at early times after matter-radiation equality. Our simulations show that early halos typically host a soliton.

          Collision-induced mass loss and mass gain on an extremely massive star. An analytical approach and a static proto-globular cluster test-case

 - **Abstract**
 The objective of this study is to analytically explore mass loss and gain induced by stellar collisions on a gas-accreting extremely massive star (aEMS, 10^3 <= M/M_sun <= 10^4). We also consider its contribution to the mass budget in the context of forming multiple stellar populations in a typical protoglobular cluster. We used MESA to build a series of aEMS models up to 2e4 M_sun for three [Fe/H] values, covering the metallicity range of Galactic GCs, with different treatments of super-adiabatic convection. We set analytical prescriptions to quantify collision-induced mass loss when a star spirals in and deposits energy into the envelope of the aEMS. We used a Monte Carlo approach to simulate the effects of multiple collisions on an aEMS of initial mass 10^3 M_sun in a static proto-GC, accounting for mass loss and gain from collisions, gas accretion, and stellar winds. We show that assumptions on super-adiabaticity in radiation-dominated layers significantly impact aEMS properties and their collision responses: extended stars tend to lose mass, while compact ones are more likely to gain it. Our MC simulations predict total mass lost and gained, along with timescales and contributions from winds and collisions. The results depend on both the aEMS structure and the gas accretion rate during the collision phase. Under certain conditions, the EMS shows a "conveyor belt" behavior, processing up to 10^5.5 M_sun of material in 5 Myr. This study provides theoretical predictions supporting aEMSs as contributors to the abundance anomalies observed in GCs. It emphasizes the need to include collision dynamics and mass transfer in aEMS formation and evolution models in dense stellar environments. We provide a grid of predictions for stellar M-R-[Fe/H]-structure relations and collision-induced mass loss and gain, suitable for hydro and N-body simulations.

          Luminous, rapidly declining supernovae as stripped transitional objects in low metallicity environments: the case of SN 2022lxg

 - **Abstract**
 We present an analysis of the optical and near-infrared properties of SN 2022lxg, a bright ($\rm M_{g\, \mathrm{peak}}=-19.41$ mag) and rapidly evolving SN. It was discovered within a day of explosion, and rose to peak brightness in 10 d. Two distinct phases of circumstellar interaction are evident in the data. The first is marked by a steep blue continuum (T $>15,000$ K) with flash-ionisation features due to hydrogen and He II. The second, weaker phase is marked by a change in the colour evolution accompanied by changes in the shapes and velocities of the spectral line profiles. Narrow P-Cygni profiles (~ $150$ km s$^{-1}$) of He I further indicate the presence of slow-moving unshocked material and suggesting partial stripping of the progenitor. The fast decline of the light curve from peak (3.48$\pm$ 0.26 mag $\rm (50\,d)^{-1}$ in $g$-band) implies that the ejecta mass must be low. Spectroscopically, until $+35$ d there are similarities to some Type IIb SNe but then there is a transition to spectra that are more reminiscent of an interacting SN II. However, metal lines are largely absent in the spectra, even at epochs of 80 d. Its remote location from the presumed host galaxy, a dwarf with $\rm M_B$ ~ $-14.4$ mag, is consistent with our metallicity estimate - close to the SMC value - obtained from scaling relations. Furthermore, several lines of evidence (including intrinsic polarisation of $p$ ~ (0.5-1.0) %) point to deviations from spherical symmetry. We suggest that a plausible way of uniting the observational clues is to consider a binary system that underwent case C mass transfer. This failed to remove the entire H-envelope of the progenitor before it underwent core-collapse. In this scenario, the progenitor itself would be more compact and perhaps straddle the boundary between blue and yellow supergiants, tying in with the early spectroscopic similarity to Type IIb SNe.

 - **Abstract**
 Ly-$\alpha$ observations provide a powerful probe of stellar activity and atmospheric escape in exoplanetary systems. We present here an analysis of 104 HST/STIS orbits monitoring the TRAPPIST-1 system between 2017 and 2022, covering 3--5 transits for each of its seven planets. We rule out transit depths $\gtrsim20\%$, which translates into an upper limit on the escape rate of $1064~EO_H$/Gyr for planet b ($1~EO_H$ is the Earth-ocean-equivalent hydrogen content), in agreement with recent claims that planet b should be airless. These upper limits are $\sim$3 times larger than expected from the photon noise due to a large baseline scatter, which we ultimately link to TRAPPIST-1's intrinsic Ly-$\alpha$ variability from frequent ``microflares.'' While JWST observations of TRAPPIST-1 in the near infrared have shown that $\sim10^{30}$-erg flares occur every $\sim$6 hours, we report here $\sim10^{29}$-erg flares on sub-hour timescales in the HST/STIS and also Very Large Telescope (VLT) $g^{'}$ observations. The FUV and optical amplitudes ($\sim$400$\%$ vs $\sim$3$\%$, respectively) for flares with similar waiting-times indicate flare temperatures of 11000$^{+4200}_{-3100}$~K over 0.011$^{+0.03}_{-0.01}$\% of the stellar disk. Finally, our multi-year baseline reveals a variability with $P = 3.27 \pm 0.04$ days, providing further validation of the previously reported 3.295-day rotation period for TRAPPIST-1. These results highlight the importance of accounting for stellar microvariability when searching for exospheres around active M dwarfs.

          The Detection-vs-Retrieval Challenge: Titan as an Exoplanet

 - **Abstract**
 Cassini's observations of Titan's atmosphere are exemplary benchmarks for exoplanet atmospheric studies owing to (1) their precision and (2) our independent knowledge of Titan. Leveraging these observations, we perform retrievals (i.e., analyses) of Titan's transmission spectrum to investigate the strengths/limitations of exoplanet atmospheric retrievals with a particular focus on the underlying assumptions regarding the molecular species included in the retrieval. We find that multiple hydrocarbons can be ``retrieved'' depending on the selection made ahead of a retrieval. More importantly, we find that the estimates of other parameters such as the abundance of key absorbers like methane can be biased by $\sim$0.5 dex (by a factor of $\sim$3) due to such choices. This shows that beyond the possible misidentification of a molecular feature (e.g., current debate surrounding dimethyl sulfide, DMS, in K2-18 b), the implicit molecular detections made pre-retrieval to avoid retrieving for hundreds of molecules at a time can bias a large range of parameters. We thus recommend sensitivity analysis to assess the dependencies of atmospheric inferences on such selections in tandem with complementary information (e.g., chemistry models) to support any pre-retrieval selection. Finally, we introduce an independent path to constrain the dominant atmospheric constituent, even when lacking observable absorption feature (e.g., H$_2$ and N$_2$) through the scale height.

 - **Abstract**
 This textbook provides a systematic treatment of statistical machine learning for astronomical research through the lens of Bayesian inference, developing a unified framework that reveals connections between modern data analysis techniques and traditional statistical methods. We show how these techniques emerge from familiar statistical foundations. The consistently Bayesian perspective prioritizes uncertainty quantification and statistical rigor essential for scientific inference in astronomy. The textbook progresses from probability theory and Bayesian inference through supervised learning including linear regression with measurement uncertainties, logistic regression, and classification. Unsupervised learning topics cover Principal Component Analysis and clustering methods. We then introduce computational techniques through sampling and Markov Chain Monte Carlo, followed by Gaussian Processes as probabilistic nonparametric methods and neural networks within the broader statistical context. Our theory-focused pedagogical approach derives each method from first principles with complete mathematical development, emphasizing statistical insight and complementing with astronomical applications. We prioritize understanding why algorithms work, when they are appropriate, and how they connect to broader statistical principles. The treatment builds toward modern techniques including neural networks through a solid foundation in classical methods and their theoretical underpinnings. This foundation enables thoughtful application of these methods to astronomical research, ensuring proper consideration of assumptions, limitations, and uncertainty propagation essential for advancing astronomical knowledge in the era of large astronomical surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxy mergers, each hosting a supermassive black hole (SMBH), are thought to form SMBH binaries. Motivated by recent observations from the East Asian VLBI Network (EAVN) showing periodic behavior in the M87 jet, a precession of about 11 years and a transverse oscillation of about 0.9 years, we constrain the mass of a hypothetical secondary black hole orbiting the primary SMBH in M87. To constrain the mass ratio between the primary SMBH ($M_{1}$) and the secondary black hole ($M_{2}$) defined as $q \equiv M_{2}/M_{1} \leq 1$, and the length of the semimajor axis of the binary system ($a$), we impose the following three constraints: (i) the lower limit of $a$, below which the SMBH binary is expected to merge. (ii) the strain amplitude of the gravitational wave background (GWB) at nanohertz frequencies shown in the NANOGrav 15-year dataset. (iii) a finite length of the semimajor axis of $M_{1}$, that can induce periodic behavior in the jet. By combining these constraints, we obtain the allowed parameter space for $q$ and $a$. If either of the EAVN-detected periods ($T$) corresponds to the binary's orbital period, the allowed range of $q$ is $6.9 \times 10^{-3} \le q \le 4.2 \times 10^{-2}$ for $T \approx 11$ years, and $3.7\times 10^{-2} \le q \le 1$ for $T \approx 0.9$ years. VLBI astrometric monitoring of the jet base of M87 is essential to explore the allowed parameter space for $q$ and $a$.

 - **Abstract**
 In light of the recent results from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), which have provided a notable shift in the constraints on $(n_s, r)$ and placed several otherwise viable models of inflation in tension with the latest data, we investigate the possible effects that radiative corrections can have on $\xi$-attractor and $\alpha$-attractor models of inflation. These models, which share much in common with Starobinsky-Higgs inflation, have likewise been put under pressure by these results. We find that percent (and even sub-percent) level radiative corrections can easily shift both of these classes of inflation models comfortably into the regions of parameter space favoured by the most recent constraints. However, the flexibility under such corrections (which one can argue should be generally expected) calls into question to what extent it is possible to precisely pin down model-specific predictions for important cosmological observables.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Radio frequency molecular absorption lines appear along sight lines with AV well below 1 mag, revealing the presence of H2 in diffuse gas even when 2.6mm CO emission is absent. Aims. We discuss absorption lines of HCO+, C2H, HCN, CS, and HCO in a larger sample (88 sight lines) than was available before. Methods. We observed millimeter-wave absorption at the IRAM and ALMA interferometers over the past 30 years and gathered the results for to compare with observations of HCO+ and CO emission taken at the ARO KP12m and IRAM 30m telescopes. Results: We detected HCO+ along 72 of 86 sightlines where it was observed, C2H along 53 of 76 sightlines and HCN along 38 of 57 sightlines. C2H is ubiquitous and N(C2H)/N(HCO+) increases at smaller EB-V and smaller N(HCO+) but C2H absorption is intrinsically weaker, decreasing the number of sightlines with low column density along which it was this http URL dense-gas tracer HCN was uniformly detected down to N(H2) = 10^20 cm-2 with little change in the relative abundance N(HCN)/N(HCO+) = 1.25. HCO was detected along only 4 of 46 sight lines that were newly observed at ALMA because its lines are intrinsically weak, but HCO is ubiquitous in the interstellar medium with N(HCO)/N(HCO+) = 1/3 or N(HCO)/N(H2) = 10^-9. The line widths of HCN features are (like those of CO) narrower than those of matching features observed in HCO+, and those of C2H are broader. HCO+ emission is commonly observed at log levels -2+/-0.3 dex with respect to CO emission.

          Tides Tighten the Hycean Habitable Zone

 - **Abstract**
 Hycean planets -- exoplanets with substantial water ice layers, deep surface oceans, and hydrogen-rich atmospheres -- are thought to be favorable environments for life. Due to a relative paucity of atmospheric greenhouse gases, hycean planets have been thought to have wider habitable zones than Earth-like planets, extending down to a few times 0.001 au for those orbiting M dwarfs. In this Letter, we reconsider the hycean habitable zone accounting for star-planet tidal interaction. We show that for a moderately eccentric hycean planet, the surface temperature contribution from tidal heating truncates the habitable zone at significantly larger orbital radii, and that moderate eccentricity is readily obtained from any massive outer companion in the system. Though few current hycean planet candidates orbit stars of low enough mass for tides to plausibly significantly alter the extent of the habitable zone, this effect will be important to note as more such candidates are identified orbiting M dwarfs. We suggest that tides are a significant factor both for determining the extent of the hycean habitable zone around low-mass stars and for the development of a detectable hycean biosphere.

          Constraints on Dark Energy Models Using Late Universe Probes

 - **Abstract**
 We use late Universe probes - Type Ia Supernovae from the PantheonPlus compilation, Quasars, and Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 1 (DR1) BAO data - along with Cosmic Chronometers or Megamasers to constrain various dark energy parameterizations. These include the standard $\Lambda$CDM model ($w_0=-1,w_a=0$), as well as the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL), Barboza-Alcaniz (BA), Jassal-Bagla-Padmanabhan (JBP), Exponential (EXP), and Transitional Dark Energy (TDE) parameterizations. We find that across all parameterizations, the constrained values of $w_0$ and $w_a$ remain within $(1-2)\sigma$ of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, irrespective of spatial curvature, dataset combinations, or prior choices. We find from Bayesian model comparison that $\Lambda$CDM remains the most favored model for both flat and non-flat cases, with results remaining robust under different priors. Across all dataset combinations, we reaffirm the fact that LRG1 and LRG2 data points from the DESI BAO dataset are responsible for driving the preference for dynamical dark energy.

          The Rotating Bulge and Halo in the Milky Way: Evidence of Angular Momentum Transferred from the Decelerating Bar

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations indicate that both the Milky Way bulge and inner halo exhibit angular momentum, although the origin and evolution of this prograde signature remain ambiguous. One plausible scenario involves secular evolution induced by the central bar and spiral arms. In this study, we identified a component consisting of 1,175,737 stars with net rotation through the application of a neural network (NN) method. To investigate the composition of this rotating sample and the origin of its rotation, we conducted a test particle simulation incorporating an equilibrium axisymmetric background potential together with a central decelerating bar. The test particles were generated using a distribution function (DF) model derived from observational constraints. Our results indicate that the decelerating bar transfers angular momentum to the pseudo-stars, and the rotational profile from our simulation shows strong agreement with observational data. These findings suggest that the rotating sample identified by our NN model predominantly comprises bulge, halo, and thick disk stars, and that the central decelerating bar is pivotal in shaping the inner Galaxy's kinematics through angular momentum transfer.

          The Multi-Wavelength Context of Delayed Radio Emission in TDEs: Evidence for Accretion-Driven Outflows

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations presented in Cendes et al. (2024a) show that optically selected tidal disruption events (TDEs) commonly produce delayed radio emission that can peak years post-disruption. Here, we explore the multi-wavelength properties of a sample of radio-observed optically selected TDEs to shed light on the physical process(es) responsible for the late-rising radio emission. We combine new late-time X-ray observations with archival optical, UV, X-ray, and radio data to conclude that a diversity of accretion-driven outflows may power delayed radio emission in TDEs. Simultaneous X-ray data and modeling of the UV/optical emission suggest that some late radio outflows may be launched by a delayed phase of super-Eddington accretion onto the central supermassive black hole (SMBH), while others may result from a state transition to a "low-hard" radiatively inefficient accretion flow or the deceleration of an off-axis relativistic jet. We additionally find weak statistical evidence that TDEs with delayed radio emission have larger optical/UV photospheric radii than other TDEs and are less likely to exhibit helium emission lines at early times, possibly also supporting the hypothesis that the onset of SMBH accretion is delayed in these systems. Our results have implications for our understanding of state changes in SMBH accretion flows, the circularization timescale for TDE debris, and the prevalence of off-axis jets in TDEs, and motivates systematic, long-term monitoring of these unique transients. The brightest objects in our sample are also detected in the VLA Sky Survey (VLASS), demonstrating that all-sky radio surveys can play an important role in discovering unexpected radio properties of the TDE population.

 - **Abstract**
 Constraining the chemical structure of exoplanetary atmospheres is pivotal for interpreting spectroscopic data and understanding planetary evolution. Traditional retrieval methods often assume thermochemical equilibrium or free profiles, which may fail to capture disequilibrium processes like photodissociation and vertical mixing. This study leverages the TauREx 3.1 retrieval framework coupled with FRECKLL, a disequilibrium chemistry model, to address these challenges. The study aims to (1) assess the impact of disequilibrium chemistry on constraining metallicity and C/O ratios; (2) evaluate the role of refractory species (TiO and VO) in spectral retrievals; (3) explore consistency between transit and eclipse observations for temperature and chemical profiles; and (4) determine the effects of retrieval priors and data reduction methods. Ten hot-Jupiter atmospheres were reanalyzed using Hubble Space Telescope (HST) WFC3 data in eclipse and transit. The TauREx-FRECKLL model incorporated disequilibrium chemistry calculations with a Bayesian framework to infer atmospheric properties. The disequilibrium approach significantly altered retrieved metallicity and C/O ratios compared to equilibrium models, impacting planet formation insights. Retrievals reconciled transit and eclipse temperature profiles in deeper atmospheric layers but not in upper layers. Results were highly dependent on spectral resolution and retrieval priors, emphasizing limitations of HST data and the need for broader spectral coverage from instruments like JWST. This study demonstrates the feasibility and importance of incorporating disequilibrium chemistry in atmospheric retrievals, highlighting its potential for advancing our understanding of exoplanetary atmospheres with next-generation telescopes.

          21 cm Signal from the Thermal Evolution of Lyman-$α$ during Cosmic Dawn

 - **Abstract**
 The Lyman-$\alpha$ photons couple the spin temperature of neutral hydrogen (HI) to the kinetic temperature during the era of cosmic dawn. During this process, they also exchange energy with the medium, heating and cooling the HI. In addition, we expect X-ray photons to heat the mostly neutral gas during this era. We solve this coupled system (Lyman-$\alpha$-HI system along with X-ray heating) for a period of 500 Myr (redshift range $8 <z < 25$). Our main results are: (a) without X-ray heating, the temperature of the gas reaches an equilibrium which is nearly independent of photon intensity and only weakly dependent on the expansion of the universe. The main determinant of the quasi-static temperature is the ratio of injected and continuum Lyman-$\alpha$ photons, (b) while X-ray photons provide an additional source of heating at initial times, for large enough Lyman-$\alpha$ photon intensity, the system tends to reach the same quasi-static temperature as expected without additional heating. This limit is reached when the density of photons close to the Lyman-$\alpha$ resonance far exceeds the HI number density, (c) we compute the global HI signal for these scenarios. In the limit of the large density of Lyman-$\alpha$ photons, the spin temperature of the hyperfine line is fixed. This freezes the global HI signal from the era of cosmic dawn and the cross-over redshift from absorption to emission. This feature depends only on the ratio of injected to continuum Lyman-$\alpha$ photons, and the global HI signal can help us determine this ratio.

          Broadband Spectral Modeling of Blazars: Constraining the Lorentz Factor and Gamma-Ray Emission Site

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive temporal and spectral analysis of a few blazars using multi-wavelength observations. Rapid flux variations are quantified via the doubling/halving timescale method, revealing the shortest variability timescales of a few hours in $\gamma$-ray emissions. The broadband fractional variability is systematically computed and examined as a function of frequency, displaying a characteristic double-hump structure akin to the typical spectral energy distribution (SED) of blazars. To distinguish between different emission states, we utilize the Bayesian block algorithm, which effectively identifies distinct flux states for targeted spectral modeling. A one-zone leptonic emission framework is employed to model the broadband emission during these states. The minimum Doppler factors are estimated based on the shortest variability timescales observed in the $\gamma$-ray emissions. Under the external Compton scenario, we constrain the location of the gamma-ray emitting region and the Lorentz factor using three physical conditions: the upper limit on the jet collimation parameter, $\Gamma \theta < 1$; the upper limit on the synchrotron self-Compton contribution, $L_{\mathrm{SSC}} \lesssim L_X$; and the observational constraint on the cooling break energy, $E_{\mathrm{cool, obs}} \lesssim 100$ MeV.

 - **Abstract**
 An unusual orbital element clustering of Kuiper belt objects (KBOs) has been observed. The most promising dynamic solution is the presence of a giant planet in the outer Solar system, Planet Nine. However, due to its extreme distance, intensive searches in optical have not been successful. We aim to find Planet Nine in the far-infrared, where it has the peak of the black body radiation, using the most sensitive all-sky far-infrared survey to date, AKARI. In contrast to optical searches, where the energy of reflected sunlight decreases by $d^{4}$, thermal radiation in the infrared decreases with the square of the heliocentric distance $d^{2}$. We search for moving objects in the AKARI Single Scan Detection List. We select sources from a promising region suggested by an N-body simulation from Millholland and Laughlin 2017: $30^{\circ}<$ R.A. $<50^{\circ}$ and $-20^{\circ}<$ Dec. $<20^{\circ}$. Known sources are excluded by cross-matching AKARI sources with 9 optical and infrared catalogues. Furthermore, we select sources with small background strength to avoid sources in the cirrus. Since Planet Nine is stationary in a timescale of hours but moves on a monthly scale, our primary strategy is to select slowly moving objects that are stationary in 24 hours but not in six months, using multiple single scans by AKARI. The selected slowly moving AKARI sources are scrutinised for potential contamination from cosmic rays. Our analysis reveals two possible Planet Nine candidates whose positions and flux are within the theoretical prediction ranges. These candidates warrant further investigation through follow-up observations to confirm the existence and properties of Planet Nine.

 - **Abstract**
 Photoionization by high-energy photons creates nonthermal electrons with a broad range of energies that heat and chemically transform the atmospheres of planets. The specifics of the interactions are notably different when the gas is atomic or molecular. Motivated by the idea that molecules survive to high altitudes in some exoplanets, we built a model for the energy transfer from nonthermal electrons to the H2O, H2, and O2 molecules. Our calculations show that the primary electrons of energy above about a hundred eV, a likely outcome from X-ray photoionization at moderately high atmospheric densities, expend most of their energy in ionization, dissociation, and electronic excitation collisions. In contrast, the primary electrons of less than about ten eV, such as those produced by extreme-ultraviolet photons at low densities, expend most of their energy in momentum transfer (heating), rotational, and vibrational excitation collisions. The partitioning between channels with weak thresholds is particularly sensitive to local fractional ionization. The transition between these two situations introduces a parallel transition in the way that the stellar energy is deposited in the atmosphere. Our calculations show that the nonthermal electrons enhance the ionization rate by a factor of a few or more with respect to photoionization alone but may not greatly contribute to the direct dissociation of molecules unless the local flux of far-ultraviolet photons is relatively weak. These findings highlight the importance of tracking the energy from the incident photons to the nonthermal electrons and onto the gas for problems concerned with the remote sensing and energy balance of exoplanet atmospheres.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the first detection of HS2 towards the cold dark cloud TMC-1. This is the first observation of a chemical species containing more than one sulphur atom in this type of sources. The astronomical observations are part of QUIJOTE, a line survey of TMC-1 in the Q band (31-50 GHz). The detection is confirmed by the observation of the fine and hyperfine components of two rotational transitions (2(0,2)-1(0,1) and 3(0,3)-2(0,2)). Assuming a rotational temperature of 7 K, we derived an HS2 column density of 5.7x10^11 cm-2, using a local thermodynamic equilibrium model that reproduces the observed spectra. The abundance of HS2 relative to H2 is 5.7x10^-11, which means that it is about seven times more abundant than its oxygenated counterpart HSO. We also explored the main formation and destruction mechanisms of HS2 using a chemical model, which reproduces the observed abundance of HS2 and indicates that dissociative recombination reactions from the ions H2S2+ and H3S2+ play a major role in forming HS2.

          New Field OB and OBe Binaries of the SMC Wing: Observational Properties and Population Modeling

 - **Abstract**
 We present a radial velocity (RV) survey of the field OB and OBe stars of the SMC Wing. We use multi-epoch observations of 55 targets obtained with the Magellan IMACS and M2FS multi-object spectrographs to identify single- and double-lined spectroscopic binaries. We also use TESS light curves to identify new eclipsing binary candidates. We find that 10 each of our 34 OB (29\%) and 21 OBe (48\%) stars are confirmed binaries, and at least $\sim$ 6 more are candidates. Using our RV measurements, we set constraints on the companion masses, and in some cases, on periods, eccentricities and inclinations. The RV data suggest that OB binaries favor more circular orbits (mean eccentricity $\langle e\rangle = 0.08\pm 0.02$) while OBe binaries are eccentric ($\langle e\rangle = 0.45\pm 0.04$). We identify 2 candidate black hole binaries, [M2002] 77616, and 81941. We use BPASS to predict the frequencies of ejected OB and OBe stars and binaries, assuming OBe stars are binary mass gainers ejected by the companion supernova. We also predict the frequencies of black-hole, neutron-star, and stripped-star companions, and we model the distributions of primary and secondary masses, periods, eccentricities, and velocity distributions. The models are broadly consistent with the binary origin scenario for OBe stars, and predict an even larger number of post-supernova OB binaries. Comparison with the kinematics supports a significant contribution from dynamical ejections for both OB and OBe stars, although less so for binaries.

 - **Abstract**
 The Lyman-alpha forests observed in the spectra of high-redshift quasars can be used as a tracer of the cosmological matter density to study baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) and the Alcock-Paczynski effect. Extraction of cosmological information from these studies requires modeling of the forest correlations. While the models depend most importantly on the bias parameters of the intergalactic medium (IGM), they also depend on the numbers and characteristics of high-column-density systems (HCDs) ranging from Lyman-limit systems with column densities log NHI/1cm^{-2} > 17 to damped Lyman-alpha systems (DLAs) with log NHI/1cm^{-2} > 20.2. These HCDs introduce broad damped absorption characteristic of a Voigt profile. Consequently they imprint a component on the power spectrum whose modes in the radial direction are suppressed, leading to a scale-dependent bias. Using mock data sets of known HCD content, we test a model that describes this effect in terms of the distribution of column densities of HCDs, the Fourier transforms of their Voigt profiles and the bias of the halos containing the HCDs. Our results show that this physically well-motivated model describes the effects of HCDs with an accuracy comparable to that of the ad-hoc models used in published forest analyses. We also discuss the problems of applying the model to real data, where the HCD content and their bias is uncertain.

 - **Abstract**
 With the rapid advancement of aerospace technology and the large-scale deployment of low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations, the challenges facing astronomical observations and deep space exploration have become increasingly pronounced. As a result, the demand for high-precision orbital data on space objects-along with comprehensive analyses of satellite positioning, constellation configurations, and deep space satellite dynamics-has grown more urgent. However, there remains a notable lack of publicly accessible, real-world datasets to support research in areas such as space object maneuver behavior prediction and collision risk assessment. This study seeks to address this gap by collecting and curating a representative dataset of maneuvering behavior from Starlink satellites. The dataset integrates Two-Line Element (TLE) catalog data with corresponding high-precision ephemeris data, thereby enabling a more realistic and multidimensional modeling of space object behavior. It provides valuable insights into practical deployment of maneuver detection methods and the evaluation of collision risks in increasingly congested orbital environments.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent analyses from the DESI collaboration suggest that the dark energy density of the Universe may be decreasing with time, slowing the acceleration of the scale factor $a$. Typically these studies are performed assuming an ansatz for the equation of state $w(a)$. In this work, we instead consider simple models of a scalar quintessence potential with linear and quadratic behavior, which could be more representative of real models than particular parametrizations of $w(a)$. We observe a significant preference for dynamical dark energy when using supernova data from DESY5 along with DESI BAO and Planck data, at the cost of slightly exacerbating the Hubble tension. However, when using supernova data from Pantheon+ or Union3, we find only a mild preference for dynamical dark energy.

 - **Abstract**
 Current gravitational wave detectors are sensitive to coalescing black holes and neutron stars. However, double white dwarfs (DWDs) have long been recognized as promising sources of gravitational waves, and upcoming detectors like LISA will be able to observe these systems in abundance. DWDs are expected to be the dominant gravitational wave (GW) sources in parts of the LISA frequency range, making it crucial to understand their formation for future detections. The Milky Way contains many white dwarfs (WDs) in both the field and star clusters, promising a rich population of DWDs for LISA. However, the large number of sources may make it difficult to resolve individual binaries, and DWDs in the field and clusters often have similar properties, complicating the identification of their origins from GW signals alone. In this work, we focus on eccentric and tight DWDs, which cannot form in the field, but require dynamical interactions in dense clusters to increase their eccentricity after circularization through mass transfer phases and common-envelope evolution during binary evolution. These binaries may also form in three- and four-body dynamical interactions where a DWD binary may directly form with high eccentricity and low separation. Our results show that we should expect eccentric and tight DWDs in clusters that can provide meaningful GW signal, however, the number is low; with an upper limit of 10-15 in the MW. These can be used to independently obtain distances of their host cluster.

 Weak lensing has become a powerful tool for probing the matter distribution in the Universe and constraining cosmological parameters. This paper aims to explore the fast mock generation pipeline to obtain the covariance matrix of the $3\times 2$pt analysis for the upcoming China Space Station Telescope (CSST). We adopt the $N_\mathrm{side}$ pipeline, which generates matter distribution with lognormal assumptions, to create full-sky galaxy mocks with certain two-point statistics. We also employ the Markov-Chain Monte Carlo simulation to test the accuracy of the covariance matrix from the mock-generated galaxy catalogue. Our work validates the accuracy of the $3\times 2$pt statistics in both spherical harmonic space and real space. The critical scale below which the fractional error of correlation exceeds 1$\%$ can decrease as the resolution parameter $N_\mathrm{side}$ increases. After excluding certain scales, the covariance matrix from the mock-generated galaxy catalogue can constrain the cosmological parameters with 0.1$\%$ accuracy. This work demonstrates the potential of $\texttt{GLASS}$ for real-space cosmological measurements and highlights the importance of discarding appropriate scales.

 - **Abstract**
 Core rotation rates of red-giant stars inferred from asteroseismic observations are substantially lower than predicted by current stellar models. This indicates the lack of an efficient angular momentum transport mechanism in radiative interiors. Mixed pressure-gravity modes are a promising candidate to extract angular momentum from the core of red giants. We focus on determining the effect of mixed modes on the rotation rates of stars evolving along the red giant branch (RGB). We developed a post-processing code that computes the angular momentum transport by meridional currents, shear-induced turbulence and mixed modes. Rotation rates were computed for models along the RGB with different stellar masses and different initial rotation profiles. We find that the mixed modes can explain some of the spin down observed in red giant stars, however, the values of non-radial mode amplitudes strongly affect the efficiency of this mechanism. Rotation rates from models neglecting radiative damping on the mixed mode amplitudes overlap with observations and produce a localised spin down around the hydrogen-burning shell, whereas the inclusion of radiative damping strongly suppresses and delays this spin down. We also show that including an additional viscosity term with values in the range $10^3-10^4$ cm$^2$s$^{-1}$ redistributes the localised spin down due to the mixed modes, enhancing their efficiency. Our results reveal that the mixed mode amplitudes need to be constraint to precisely quantify the spin down of red giant cores. Nevertheless, the mixed mode mechanism by itself cannot explain the full spread in observed core rotation rates along the RGB. This will only be possible with an additional mechanism for angular momentum transport.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent work by Kocheril \textit{et al.}\cite{kocheril2025} claimed that phenylium--the cyclic structure of the \ce{C6H5+} species--is unreactive toward key interstellar molecules such as molecular hydrogen (\ce{H2}) and acetylene (\ce{C2H2}). This finding challenges the previously proposed role of phenylium as a cornerstone in the formation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) \cite{cherchneff1992,byrne2024}. Here, we present new experimental and theoretical evidence that challenge this assumption. The study focused on the reactivity of \ce{C6H5+}, formed via the radiative association between \ce{C4H3+} and \ce{C2H2}, believed to be a major pathway for phenylium formation. Our results demonstrate that phenylium does indeed react with \ce{C2H2} under astrophysically relevant conditions. Quantum chemical calculations support this finding by revealing a barrierless mechanism, indicating that the reaction is feasible even in cold interstellar environments. We believe this clarification is critically important, as the conclusions of Kocheril et al. could mislead the community and hinder further investigations into the formation of the first aromatic ring in space--a process that remains a key bottleneck in our understanding of PAHs formation and growth.

          Scrutinizing the impact of the solar modulation on AMS-02 antiproton excess

 - **Abstract**
 This study examines the impact of solar modulation on the antiproton excess observed by AMS-02, which may indicate dark matter (DM) annihilation. We analyze three solar modulation models: the force-field approximation (FFA), a time-, charge-, and rigidity-dependent FFA, and a three-dimensional numerical simulation based on the Parker transport equation. Based on AMS-02 latest antiproton data (2025), our results show that the significance of the DM signal is sensitive to the chosen modulation model, with a 2$\sigma$ signal for the FFA (4$\sigma$ if including data from H, He, C, O, B/C, and B/O) and a reduced significance for more complex models. We also address systematic uncertainties using two methods: the add-in-quadrature method, which assumes uncorrelated uncertainties between energy bins, and the nuisance parameter method, which treats systematic uncertainties as nuisance parameters during the fitting process. Fitted to AMS-02 antiproton data, DM annihilation to the $b\bar{b}$ scenario with three different solar modulation models shows that the add-in-quadrature method causes overfitting, whereas the nuisance parameters approach leads to underfitting. Statistically, the signal region of the FFA model using the add-in-quadrature method is the most reliable. This work highlights the need for refined solar modulation models and a better treatment of uncertainties for a conclusive interpretation of the AMS-02 data.

 - **Abstract**
 Using a large sample of 9617 molecular clouds (MCs) from the Milky Way Imaging Scroll Painting survey, we mainly measure one-dimensional cloud-to-cloud velocity dispersions across a 450 deg$^{2}$ segment of the Local arm in the Galactic second quadrant. We define the cloud-to-cloud velocity dispersion using two metrics: the standard deviation ($\sigma_{\rm bin}$) and flux-weighted root-mean-squared value ($\sigma_{\rm bin, w}$) of the centroid velocities of $^{12}$CO-detected MCs within spatial bins. The typical values of $\sigma_{\rm bin}$ and $\sigma_{\rm bin, w}$ are 7.5$\pm$0.5 km s$^{-1}$ and 6.2$\pm$0.5 km s$^{-1}$, respectively. After categorizing clouds by sizes into three types: Type $S$ (0.15 $-$ 1.2 pc), Type $M$ (1.2 $-$ 4.8 pc), and Type L ($\gtrsim$ 4.8 pc), we find that the spatial distribution of Type $S$ and $M$ MCs projected onto the Galactic longitude-latitude (l-b) plane is generally uniform. Additionally, the cloud-to-cloud velocity dispersion among Type $S$ clouds ($\sim$ 7.6 and 7.4 km s$^{-1}$ for $\sigma_{\rm bin}$ and $\sigma_{\rm bin, w}$, respectively) is systematically greater than that among Type $M$ clouds ($\sim$ 6.7 and 6.0 km s$^{-1}$ for $\sigma_{\rm bin}$ and $\sigma_{\rm bin, w}$, respectively), with differences of 0.9 $-$ 1.4 km s$^{-1}$. From these measurements, we estimate merger timescales between MCs to be approximately 0.3 to 0.9 Myr, which is shorter than their internal crossing timescales ($\sim$ 1 Myr for Type $S$, $\sim$ 2 Myr for Type $M$, and $\gtrsim$ 5 Myr for Type $L$). This disparity, particularly pronounced for larger Type $L$ clouds, suggests that MCs are dynamically transient structures, with their gas content changing due to frequent interactions with neighboring clouds.

 - **Abstract**
 We present cosmological constraints from Dark Energy Survey Year 3 (DES Y3) weak lensing data using persistent homology, a topological data analysis technique that tracks how features like clusters and voids evolve across density thresholds. For the first time, we apply spherical persistent homology to galaxy survey data through the algorithm TopoS2, which is optimized for curved-sky analyses and HEALPix compatibility. Employing a simulation-based inference framework with the Gower Street simulation suite, specifically designed to mimic DES Y3 data properties, we extract topological summary statistics from convergence maps across multiple smoothing scales and redshift bins. After neural network compression of these statistics, we estimate the likelihood function and validate our analysis against baryonic feedback effects, finding minimal biases (under $0.3\sigma$) in the $\Omega_\mathrm{m}-S_8$ plane. Assuming the $w$CDM model, our combined Betti numbers and second moments analysis yields $S_8 = 0.821 \pm 0.018$ and $\Omega_\mathrm{m} = 0.304\pm0.037$-constraints 70% tighter than those from cosmic shear two-point statistics in the same parameter plane. Our results demonstrate that topological methods provide a powerful and robust framework for extracting cosmological information, with our spherical methodology readily applicable to upcoming Stage IV wide-field galaxy surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 Here we analyse the archival data for a set of 27 Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) Targets of Interest (TOIs) in search for artificially generated radio signals, or 'technosignatures', interrupted by occultation. Exoplanetary eclipses are notable events to observe in the search for technosignatures, as they mark the geometrical alignment of the target, its host star, and Earth. During an eclipse event, any signal emanating from the target of interest should cease for the duration of the eclipse, and resume after the line-of-sight has been restored. Target observations were made by Breakthrough Listen (BL) using Murriyang, the CSIRO Parkes 64-m radio telescope, coupled with the Ultra-wide Low frequency (UWL) receiver covering a continuous range of frequencies spanning 704-4032 MHz inclusive. Each target was observed in a pattern consisting of six back-to-back 5-minute source and reference sky positions for comparison during data analysis. We performed a Doppler search for narrowband signals with a minimum signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio of 10, a minimum drift rate of $\pm0.1$ Hz/s, and a maximum drift rate of $\pm4.0$ Hz/s using the turboSETI pipeline. In the analysis of 1,954,880 signals, 14,639 passed automated radio interference filters where each event was presented as a set of stacked dynamic spectra. Despite manually inspecting each diagram for a signal of interest, all events were attributed to terrestrial radio frequency interference (RFI).

 - **Abstract**
 The EHT collaboration released in 2019 the first horizon-scale images of a black hole accretion flow, opening a novel route for plasma physics comprehension and gravitational tests. Although the present unresolved images deeply depend on the astrophysical properties of the accreted matter, GR predicts that they contain highly lensed observables, the "photon rings", embodying the effects of strong-field gravity. Focusing on the supermassive black hole M87* and adopting a geometrically thin, equatorial disc as a phenomenological configuration for the accreting matter, our goal is to study the degeneracy of spacetime curvature and of physically-motivated emission processes on EHT-like images observed at 230 and 345 GHz. In a parametric framework, we simulate adaptively ray-traced images using GYOTO in various spherically-symmetric spacetime geometries, for a comprehensive class of disc velocities and realistic synchrotron emission profiles. We then extract the width and the peak position of 1D intensity cross sections on the direct image and the first photon ring. We show that, among the investigated quantities, the most appropriate observables to probe the geometry are the peak positions of the first photon ring. Small geometric deviations can be unequivocally detected, regardless of the motion of the disc, ranging from a Keplerian to a radially infalling one, if the black hole mass-to-distance estimate is accurate up to around 2%; the current uncertainty of 11% being sufficient just to access extreme deviations. The equatorial set-up of this paper, favoured by present EHT observations of M87*, is adapted to model future measurements at higher observing frequencies, where absorption effects are negligible, and with higher resolution, indispensable to resolve the photon rings. Additional work is needed to investigate if our conclusions hold for more realistic disc configurations.

          A New Determination of the Mass of NGC 3603-A1: the Most Massive Binary Known?

 - **Abstract**
 The star NGC 3603-A1 has long been known to be a very massive binary, consisting of a pair of O2-3If*/WN5-6 stars, which show Wolf-Rayet-like emission due to their luminosities being near the Eddington limit. The system has been poorly characterized until now, due to the difficulties of obtaining reliable radial velocities from broad, blended emission lines and the extreme crowding in the cluster. However, previously unpublished archival HST/STIS spectra revealed that some of the upper Balmer lines (seen in absorption) are well separated at favorable orbital phases, prompting us to obtain our own carefully-timed new HST/STIS spectra, which we have analyzed along with the older data. Radial velocities measured from these spectra allow us to obtain an orbit for this 3.77298 day system. We also used archival STIS imaging of the cluster to obtain a more accurate light curve for this eclipsing system, which we then modeled, yielding the orbital inclination and providing values for the stellar radii and temperatures. Together, these data show that the NGC 3603-A1 system consists of a 93.3+/-11.0 Mo O3If*/WN6 primary with an effective temperature of 37,000 K, and a 70.4+/-9.3 Mo O3If*/WN5 secondary that is slightly hotter, 42,000 K. Although a more massive binary is known in the LMC, NGC 3603-A1 is the most massive binary in our own Galaxy for which a direct measurement of its mass has been made by a fundamental method. The secondary has been spun up by mass accretion from the primary, and we discuss the evolutionary status of this intriguing system.

 - **Abstract**
 In the last years with the increasing precision in cosmological observations we have been able to establish an standard model of cosmology, the so-called $\Lambda$CDM, but also find some tensions between cosmological probes that are difficult to explain within the context of this model. We tested several phenomenological extensions of the $\Lambda$CDM with the newest datasets from the chain CMB+BAO+SNIa, to see whether they are able to alleviate the aforementioned tensions. We find that when the updated version of the Planck CMB likelihood (PR4 LoLLiPoP and HiLLiPoP), with respect to the more used likelihoods (PR4 CamSpec and PR3), is considered, the lensing anomaly is reduced, and the preference for $A_L>1$ and $\Omega_k<0$ is less significant. From the CMB+BAO+SNIa dataset, in the context of the parameterization $w_0w_a$CDM we find a preference for a time-evoling dark energy over the rigid cosmological constant which is consistent with the most recent results from DESI collaboration.

 - **Abstract**
 How the large-scale kinematics of the Milky Way (MW) relate -- or even regulate -- the formation of large-to-small scale structures is incredibly hard to infer from observations. Here we investigate this interplay through a detailed analysis of a MW-like galaxy simulation, generated through the self-consistent evolution of gas, stars, and dark matter. We show that our model provides a close match to many of the MW's stellar structure and kinematic features (including in the inner Galaxy, and around the Solar neighbourhood), and find that the stellar spiral pattern in our model is very faint, with significantly less multiplicity than the sharper gaseous this http URL taken as an analogue to the MW, this finding would explain the difficulty in observational studies to agree on the number and location of our Galaxy's spiral arms. We also examine radial and tangential velocity residuals in the disc, and find that sharp kinematic transitions correlate with spiral arms, especially in the gas, where values reach $30 - 50$\,km\,s$^{-1}$. We find strong radial converging flows promoting spiral-arm growth, while diverging flows disrupt them. A time-resolved analysis of spiral-ridge segments confirms that convergence precedes density enhancements and potential star-forming conditions, while divergence leads to fragmentation and mass redistribution. These patterns evolve on relatively short timescales ($\sim10-20$\,Myr), highlighting the transient nature of spiral arms. Our model's spiral arms are dynamically driven, short-lived features shaped by evolving flows, rather than static density waves, which could explain the observed lack of contrast of cloud properties and star formation within and outside spiral arms in the MW.

 The mutual inclination $\psi$ between orbits within multi-planetary systems is difficult to measure directly. Through a joint analysis of RVs, Hipparcos-Gaia absolute astrometry and relative astrometry of JWST, \citet{Bardalez2025} recently found two possible values of $\psi_{bc}={32_{-15.1}^{+13.6}}^{\circ}$ and $\psi_{bc}={145.0_{-11.1}^{+15.8}}^{\circ}$ for the nearby, non-transit planet system, 14\,Her. By incorporating additional astrometry from Gaia second data release (DR2), we have further constrained the orbital orientation of 14\,Her\,b, resulting in a definitive and unambiguous mutual inclination of $\psi_{bc}={35.3_{-7.3}^{+6.8}}^{\circ}$. The unusual misaligned orbital architecture of 14\,Her system may serve as a benchmark for dynamical studies.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Very massive clusters and regions of intense star formation such as the center of our Milky Way contain young, hydrogen-burning stars very close to the Eddington Limit. Formally classified as hydrogen-rich Wolf-Rayet stars, the winds and spectra of these stars are distinctively different to the more evolved, classical Wolf-Rayet (cWR) stars. Results. We find an overall downward trend of the mass-loss rate with increasing temperature and decreasing metallicity. However, at SMC metallicities and above, we find a maximum in the wind efficiency with the mass-loss eventually decreasing again at lower temperatures. For intermediate metallicities, we also find strong discontinuities in the mass-loss trends, which do not appear at high or very low metallicities. For the lowest metallicities, a more homogeneous behavior is obtained without any maximum in the wind efficiency. The terminal velocities are generally higher for hotter temperatures. For cooler temperatures, the combined effect of metallicity and mass-loss change significantly reduces the changes in terminal velocity with metallicity. Conclusions. Contrary to cWR stars, the spectral appearance of late-type WNh stars rules out supersonic winds launched at the hot iron bump. Instead, a more extended quasi-hydrostatic regime is necessary. The proximity to the Eddington limit and the complex interactions cause a lot of substructure in the global wind parameter trends. While the strong discontinuities show resemblances to the bi-stability jump predicted for the B-supergiant regime, our models reveal a more complex origin. At sub-SMC metallicity, iron is no longer a major key for setting the mass-loss rate in this WNh regime. Instead, other elements (e.g. nitrogen) and continuum contributions become important.

          Planetary waves can activate resonant drag instabilities in 3D dusty gaseous discs

 - **Abstract**
 Resonant Drag Instabilities (RDIs) in protoplanetary discs are driven by the aerodynamic back-reaction of dust on gas and occur when the relative dust-gas motion resonate with a wave mode intrinsic to the gas fluid. Axisymmetric models indicate that the RDI generates filamentary perturbations, leading to grain clumping and planetesimal formation. Motivated by these findings, we investigate the dust-gas interaction in a non-axisymmetric inviscid protoplanetary disc with an embedded low-mass planet ($M_{\mathrm{p}}\in[0.3, 3] M_\oplus$, here $M_\oplus$ is the Earth mass). We conduct global 3D high-resolution two-fluid simulations, with the dust being parametrized by the Stokes number $\mathrm{St}\in[0.01,0.5]$. We find that planetary waves (PWs; also known as Rossby waves), which propagate along the downstream separatrices of the horseshoe region, resonate with the streaming motion and trigger the RDI. The consequent development of a global-scale filamentary dust distribution does not sensitively depend on the Stokes number, nor does it depend on the fast dust settling that takes place in an inviscid disc. The rapid onset of this instability, which is comparable to the dynamical orbital time-scale, suppresses the formation of asymmetric structures in the dust in the vicinity of the planet (such as dust voids and filaments). Additionally, we find that the dust feedback enables buoyancy resonances in an otherwise non-buoyant (globally isothermal) disc. Therefore, our results provide the first numerical evidence of RDIs generation driven by planetary waves.

 - **Abstract**
 A tidal disruption event (TDE) occurs when a star travels too close to a supermassive black hole. In some cases, accretion of the disrupted material onto the black hole launches a relativistic jet. In this paper, we present a long term observing campaign to study the radio and sub-millimeter emission associated with the fifth jetted/relativistic TDE: AT2022cmc. Our campaign reveals a long lived counterpart. We fit three different models to our data: a non-thermal jet, a spherical outflow consisting of both thermal and non-thermal electrons, and a jet with thermal and non-thermal electrons. We find that the data is best described by a relativistic spherical outflow propagating into an environment with a density profile following R^-1.8. Comparison of AT2022cmc to other TDEs finds agreement in the density profile of the environment but also that AT2022cmc is twice as energetic as the other well-studied relativistic TDE Swift J1644. Our observations of AT2022cmc allow a thermal electron population to be inferred for the first time in a jetted transient providing, new insights into the microphysics of relativistic transients jets.

 - **Abstract**
 The gravitational $N$-body problem is a nearly universal problem in astrophysics which, despite its deceptive simplicity, still presents a significant computational challenge. For collisional systems such as dense star clusters, the need to resolve individual encounters between $N$ stars makes the direct summation of forces - with quadratic complexity - almost infeasible for systems with $N\gtrsim 10^6$ particles over many relaxation times. At the same time, the most common Monte Carlo $N$-body algorithm - that of Hénon - assumes the cluster to be spherically symmetric. This greatly limits the study of many important features of star clusters, including triaxiality, rotation, and the production of tidal debris. In this paper, we present a new hybrid code, KRIOS, that combines 3D collisionless relaxation using an adaptive self-consistent field method with a collisional dynamics part handled via Hénon's method. We demonstrate that KRIOS can accurately model the long-term evolution of clusters and provide its complete phase-space information over many relaxation times. As a test of our new code, we present detailed comparisons to two well-known results from stellar dynamics: (i) the collisional evolution of an isotropic Plummer sphere to core collapse, and (ii) the emergence of the radial-orbit instability in radially anisotropic star clusters, including its non-spherical effects.

 - **Abstract**
 Several supernova remnants and young neutron stars were recently discovered relatively high above the Galactic plane. One possibility is that they originate from runaway OB stars born in the Galactic disk. Understanding their origin will provide key insights into the properties of the Galactic halo. This paper aims to determine the spatial distribution of supernova explosions from runaway OB stars and to assess whether this model can explain certain observed neutron stars. We map the distribution of supernova events produced by runaway OB stars by incorporating their birth rate, initial spatial distribution, lifetime, ejection mechanisms, and velocity distributions. By tracking their motion in the Galactic potential, we determine their final distribution right before the explosion. We show that the neutron star Calvera, which is found at z around 2.2 kpc, could have originated from a runaway OB star. In addition, we compare the probabilities of finding a supernova remnant originating from Type Ia and core-collapse supernovae high above the Galactic plane, showing that supernova remnants related to core-collapse supernovae outnumber those related to Type Ia supernovae.

 - **Abstract**
 The possibility of discovering twin stars, two neutron stars (NSs) with the same mass but different radii, is usually studied in forward modelings by using a restricted number of NS matter equation of state (EOS) encapsulating a first-order phase transition from hadronic to quark matter (QM). Informing our likelihood function with the NS radius data from GW170817 and using a meta-model with 9-parameters capable of mimicking most NS EOSs available in the literature, we conduct a Bayesian quantification of the observability and underlying EOSs of twin stars. Of the accepted EOSs, between 12-18\% yield twin stars, depending on the restrictions we place on the twin branch. We show that many of these twin star scenarios are observable with currently available levels of accuracy in measuring NS radii. We also present the marginalized posterior probability density functions (PDFs) of every EOS parameter for each of four mass-radius correlation topologies. We find that the inferred EOS depends sensitively on not only whether twin stars are present, but also the category of twin stars, indicating that the observation of twin stars would provide a strong constraint on the underlying EOS. In particular, for two coexisting hybrid stars having QM cores at different densities, the PDF for QM speed of sound squared $c_{\rm qm}^2$ has two peaks, one below and another above the conformal limit $c_{\rm qm}^2=1/3$ predicted by perturbative QCD.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational instability (GI) is typically studied in cooling-dominated discs, often modelled using simplified prescriptions such as $\beta$-cooling. In this paper, we investigate the onset and evolution of GI in accretion discs subject to continuous mass injection, combining 1D and 3D numerical simulations. We explore an alternative self-regulation mechanism in which mass replenishment drives the system toward marginal stability $Q\sim 1$. In this regime, the disc establishes a steady-state disc-to-star mass ratio, balancing the mass transported to the central object with that added to the disc. Our 3D simulations reveal that the general scaling predicted from the linear theory are respected, however there are important difference compared to the cooling case in terms of morphology and pattern speed. Unlike the flocculent spirals seen in cooling-driven instability, the power is concentrated towards the dominant modes in infall-driven spirals. Additionally, spiral waves generate at the mass injection location, and propagate at constant pattern speed, unlike in the cooling case. This suggests a fundamental difference in how mass-regulated and cooling-regulated discs behave and transport angular momentum.

 - **Abstract**
 Extrasolar planetary systems commonly exhibit planets on eccentric orbits, with many systems located near or within mean-motion resonances, showcasing a wide diversity of orbital architectures. Such complex systems challenge traditional secular theories, which are limited to first-order approximations in planetary masses or rely on expansions in orbital elements--eccentricities, inclinations, and semi-major axis ratios--that are subject to convergence issues, especially in highly eccentric, inclined, or tightly-packed systems. To overcome these limitations, we develop a numerical approach to second-order perturbation theory based on the Lie transform formalism. Our method avoids the need for expansions in orbital elements, ensuring broader applicability and more robust convergence. We first outline the Hamiltonian framework for the 3-body planetary problem, and apply a canonical transformation to eliminate fast angle dependencies, deriving the secular Hamiltonian up to second order in the mass ratio. We then use the fast Fourier transform algorithm to numerically simulate, in an accurate way, the long-term evolution of planetary systems near or away from mean-motion resonances. Finally, we validate our methods against well-known planetary configurations, such as the Sun-Jupiter-Saturn system, as well as to exoplanetary systems like WASP-148, TIC 279401253 and GJ 876, demonstrating the applicability of our models across a wide range of planetary configurations.

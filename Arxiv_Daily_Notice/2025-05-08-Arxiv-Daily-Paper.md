 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we demonstrate that a dynamical dark energy component predicted by massive gravity gives rise to a distinctive evolution of the equation of state. This scenario is favoured over the standard $\Lambda$CDM model when confronted with the latest combined datasets from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), the cosmic microwave background (CMB), and supernova observations. The model stands out as a rare example of a healthy, self-consistent theory that accommodates phantom dark energy while maintaining a technically natural, small asymptotic cosmological constant. Our analysis indicates a preferred graviton mass of approximately $5 \times 10^{-33} \text{eV}$, suggesting the emergence of a new cosmological length scale. This leads to a maximal deviation of the equation of state around $z \sim 2.5$, a prediction that will be robustly tested by upcoming, deeper surveys of baryon acoustic oscillations.

 - **Abstract**
 Recently, Currie et al. simulated the detection of molecules in the atmospheres of temperate rocky exoplanets transiting nearby M-dwarf stars. They simulated detections via spectral cross-correlation applied to high resolution optical and near-IR transit spectroscopy using the ELTs. Currie et al. did not consider the effect of unocculted star spots, but we do that here for possible detections of molecular oxygen, carbon dioxide, methane, and water vapor. We find that confusion noise from unocculted star spots becomes significant for large programs that stack tens to hundreds of transits to detect these molecules. Noise from star spots increases with greater spot filling factors, and star spot temperature has less effect than filling factor. Nevertheless, molecular oxygen, carbon dioxide, and methane could be detected in temperate rocky planets transiting nearby M-dwarfs without correcting for star spots. Water vapor detections are the most affected, with star spots contaminating the exoplanet signal as well as producing extra noise. Unocculted spots only affect transit spectroscopy when normalizing by dividing by the total flux from the star. We describe an alternate normalization method that minimizes star spot effects by deriving and implementing an unspotted proxy spectrum for the normalization. We show that the method works in principle using realistic levels of random observational noise. Alternate normalization would be broadly applicable to all types of transit spectroscopy, and we discuss challenges to applying it in practice. We also outline a comprehensive approach that has the potential to overcome those challenges.

          Using anomaly detection to search for technosignatures in Breakthrough Listen observations

 - **Abstract**
 We implement a machine learning algorithm to search for extra-terrestrial technosignatures in radio observations of several hundred nearby stars, obtained with the Parkes and Green Bank Telescopes by the Breakthrough Listen collaboration. Advances in detection technology have led to an exponential growth in data, necessitating innovative and efficient analysis methods. This problem is exacerbated by the large variety of possible forms an extraterrestrial signal might take, and the size of the multidimensional parameter space that must be searched. It is then made markedly worse by the fact that our best guess at the properties of such a signal is that it might resemble the signals emitted by human technology and communications, the main (yet diverse) contaminant in radio observations. We address this challenge by using a combination of simulations and machine learning methods for anomaly detection. We rank candidates by how unusual they are in frequency, and how persistent they are in time, by measuring the similarity between consecutive spectrograms of the same star. We validate that our filters significantly improve the quality of the candidates that are selected for human vetting when compared to a random selection. Of the ~ 10^11 spectrograms that we analyzed, we visually inspected thousands of the most promising spectrograms, and thousands more for validation, about 20,000 in total, and report that no candidate survived basic scrutiny.

 - **Abstract**
 Deep astronomical images are often constructed by digitially stacking many individual sub-exposures. Each sub-exposure is expected to show small differences in the positions of stars and other objects in the field, due to the movement of the celestial bodies, changes/imperfections in the opto-mechanical imaging train, and other factors. To maximize image quality, one must ensure that each sub-exposure is aligned to a common frame of reference prior to stacking. This is done by reprojecting each exposure onto a common target grid defined using a World Coordinate System (WCS) that is defined by mapping the known angular positions of reference objects to their observed spatial positions on each image. The transformations needed to reproject images involve complicated trigonometric expressions which can be slow to compute, so reprojection can be a major bottleneck in image processing pipelines. To make astronomical reprojections faster to implement in pipelines, we have written `dfreproject`, a Python package of GPU-optimized functions for this purpose. The package's functions break down coordinate transformations using Gnomonic projections to define pixel-by-pixel shifts from the source to the target plane. The package also provides tools for interpolating a source image onto a target plane with a single function call. This module follows the FITS and SIP formats laid out in the seminal papers. Compared to common alternatives, `dfreproject`'s routines result in speedups of up to 20X when run on a GPU and 10X when run on a CPU.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the impact of neutrino masses on the evolution of Universe is a crucial aspect of modern cosmology. Due to their large free streaming lengths, neutrinos significantly influence the formation of cosmic structures at non-linear scales. To maximize the information yield from current and future galaxy surveys, it is essential to generate precise theoretical predictions of structure formation. One approach to achieve this is by running large sets of cosmological numerical simulations, which is a computationally intensive process. In this study, we propose a deep learning-based generative adversarial network (GAN) model to emulate the Universe for a variety of neutrino masses. Our model called $\nu$GAN (for neutrino GAN) is able to generate 2D cosmic webs of the Universe for a number of neutrino masses ranging from 0.0 eV to 0.4 eV. The generated maps exhibit statistical independence, lack correlations with training data, and very closely resemble the distribution of matter in true maps. We assess the accuracy of our results both visually and through key statistics used in cosmology and computer vision analyses. Our results indicate that samples generated by $\nu$GAN are accurate within a 5% error on power spectrum between k=0.01 to k=0.5 h/Mpc. Although this accuracy covers the mildly non-linear scales, consistent with other works and observations, achieving higher accuracy at fully non-linear scales requires more sophisticated models, such as diffusion models. Nevertheless, our work opens up new avenues for building emulators to generate fast and massive neutrino simulations, potentially revolutionizing cosmological predictions and analyses. This work serves as a proof-of-concept, paving the way for future extensions with higher-resolution 3D data and advanced generative models.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results of a three-year X-ray, optical, and radio polarimetric monitoring campaign of the prototypical black hole X-ray binary Cyg X-1, conducted from 2022 to 2024. The X-ray polarization of Cyg X-1 was measured 13 times with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE), covering both hard and soft spectral states. The X-ray polarization degree (PD) in the hard state was found to be $\approx4.0\%$, roughly twice as high as in the soft state, where it was around $2.2\%$. In both states, a statistically significant increase of PD with the energy was found. Moreover, a linear relation between PD and spectral hardness suggests a gradual and continuous evolution of the polarization properties, rather than an abrupt change of polarization production mechanism between states. The polarization angle (PA) was independent of the spectral state and showed no trend with the photon energy. The X-ray PA is well aligned with the orientation of the radio jet, as well as the optical and radio PAs. We find significant orbital changes of PA in the hard state, which we attribute to scattering of X-ray emission at intrabinary structure. No significant superorbital variability in PD or PA was found at the period $P_{\rm{so}}$ = 294 d. We also find no correlation between the X-ray and optical polarization; if any, there is a long-term anti-correlation between the X-ray PD and the radio PD.

          Spectropolarimetric Evolution of SN 2023ixf: an Asymmetric Explosion in a Confined Aspherical Circumstellar Medium

 - **Abstract**
 We present complete spectropolarimetric coverage of the Type II supernova (SN) 2023ixf ranging from 1 to 120 days after explosion. Polarimetry was obtained with the Kast double spectrograph on the Shane 3m telescope at Lick Observatory. As the ejecta interact with circumstellar material (CSM) during the first week, the intrinsic polarization of SN 2023ixf is initially high at $\lesssim$1%, dropping steeply within days down to $\sim$ 0.4% when the ejecta sweep up the optically-thick CSM. The continuum polarization stays low at $\sim$ 0.2% thereafter, until it rises again to $\sim$ 0.6% as the ejecta transition to the nebular phase. We model this evolution using a combination of archival and newly-computed 2D polarized radiative-transfer models. In this context, we interpret the early-time polarization as arising from an aspherical CSM with a pole-to-equator density contrast $\gtrsim$ 3. We propose that the surge in polarization at late times originates from an asymmetric distribution of $^{56}$Ni deep in the ejecta. The distinct sources of asymmetries at early and late times are consistent with the temporal evolution of the observed polarization and the polarization angle in SN 2023ixf.

          Probing Abundance Variations among Multiple Stellar Populations in the Metal-Poor Globular Cluster NGC 2298 using Gemini-South/GHOST

 - **Abstract**
 Studying the abundances in metal-poor globular clusters is crucial for understanding the formation of the Galaxy and the nucleosynthesis processes in the early Universe. We observed 13 red giant stars from the metal-poor globular cluster NGC 2298 using the newly commissioned GHOST spectrograph at Gemini South. We derived stellar parameters and abundances for 36 species across 32 elements, including 16 neutron-capture elements. We find that the stars exhibit chemical anomalies among the light elements, allowing us to classify them into first-generation (8 stars) and second-generation (5 stars). We derive a mean cluster metallicity of [Fe/H]=-1.98 +/- 0.10 with no significant variation among cluster members. Most alpha- and Fe-peak elements display low star-to-star abundance dispersion, with notable exceptions for Sc, Ni, and Zn for which the dispersions in Sc vary significantly between stars from different generations to 2\sigma levels. Similarly, among the neutron-capture elements, we observed considerable differences in dispersion for Sr and Eu among the first and second generation stars to 2 sigma levels. We also confirm an intrinsic scatter beyond observational uncertainties for several elements using a maximum likelihood approach among stars from different generations. Additionally, we note an increase in [Sr/Eu] and [Ba/Eu] with [Mg/Fe] in first-generation stars indicating correlations between the productions of light r-process and Mg. We find the universal r-process pattern, but with larger dispersions in the main r-process than the limited-r elements. These differences in abundance dispersion, among first- and second-generation stars in NGC 2298, suggest complex and inhomogeneous early chemical enrichment processes, driven by contributions from multiple nucleosynthetic events, including massive stars and rare r-process events.

          Extremely Low Mass Ratio Contact Binaries. II. The First Photometric and Spectroscopic Investigations of Six Systems with Orbital Periods Longer than 0.5 days

 - **Abstract**
 The photometric and spectroscopic studies of six contact binaries were performed for the first time. The orbital periods of all the six targets are longer than 0.5d, and we discovered that their mass ratios are smaller than 0.15. So, they are extremely low mass-ratio contact binaries. Only one target is a W-subtype contact binary (ASASSN-V J105032.88+420829.0), while the others are A-subtype contact binaries. From orbital period analysis, ASASSN-V J075442.44+555623.2 shows no orbital period change. Three of the six targets demonstrate a secular period increase, and two targets for a secular period decrease. We investigated the LAMOST spectra employing the spectral subtraction method. All six contact binaries show no chromospheric emission line, implying no chromospheric activity. Their absolute parameters, initial masses, ages, energy transfer parameters, and instability parameters were calculated. The bolometric luminosity ratios ($(L_2/L_1)_{bol}$), the energy transfer parameters ($\beta$), the contact degrees ($f$), and the mass ratios ($q$) were collected for a sample of 218 contact binaries and we analyzed and discussed some correlations. The results by analyzing the relation between $\beta$, $f$ and $q$ indicate that the energy transfer parameter between the two components of extremely low mass-ratio contact binaries is independent of the contact degree. And the predicted cutoff mass ratio was estimated as 0.021 by analyzing the relation between $f$ and $q$.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the serendipitous radio-continuum discovery of a likely Galactic supernova remnant (SNR) G305.4-2.2. This object displays a remarkable circular symmetry in shape, making it one of the most circular Galactic SNRs known. Nicknamed Teleios due to its symmetry, it was detected in the new Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU) radio-continuum images with an angular size of 1320"x1260" and PA = 0 deg. While there is a hint of possible H$\alpha$ and gamma-ray emission, Teleios is exclusively seen at radio-continuum frequencies. Interestingly, Teleios is not only almost perfectly symmetric, but it also has one of the lowest surface brightnesses discovered among Galactic SNRs and a steep spectral index of $\alpha=-0.6\pm 0.3$. Our estimates from HI studies and the Sigma-D relation place Teleios as a type Ia SNR at a distance of either ~2.2 kpc of ~7.7 kpc. This indicates two possible scenarios, either a young (under 1000 yr) or an older SNR (over 10000 yr). With a corresponding diameter of 14/48 pc, our evolutionary studies place Teleios at the either early or late Sedov phase, depending on the distance estimate. However, our modelling also predicts X-ray emission, which we do not see in the present generation of eROSITA images. We also explored a type Iax explosion scenario that points to a much closer distance of <1 kpc and Teleios size of only ~3.3 pc, which would be similar to the only known type Iax remnant SN1181. Unfortunately, all examined scenarios have their challenges, and no definitive supernova (SN) origin type can be established at this stage. Teleios's symmetrical shape suggests expansion into a rarefied and isotropic ambient medium. The low radio surface brightness and the lack of pronounced polarisation can be explained by a high level of ambient rotation measure (RM), with the largest RM being observed at centre.

 - **Abstract**
 Since the variety of their light curve morphologies, the vast majority of the known heartbeat stars (HBSs) have been discovered by manual inspection. Machine learning, which has already been successfully applied to the classification of variable stars based on light curves, offers another possibility for the automatic detection of HBSs. We propose a novel feature extraction approach for HBSs. First, the light curve is transformed into the frequency domain via Fourier transform, then the amplitudes of the first 100 harmonics are extracted, and finally these harmonics are normalised as feature vectors of the light curve. A training data set of synthetic light curves is constructed using ELLC, and their features are fed into recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for supervised learning, with the expected output being the eccentricity of these light curves. The performance of RNNs is evaluated using a test data set of synthetic light curves, achieving 95$\%$ accuracy. When applied to known HBSs from OGLE, Kepler, and TESS surveys, the networks achieve an average accuracy of 88$\%$. This method successfully identify four new HBSs within the eclipsing binary catalog of Kirk et al. The use of orbital harmonics as features for HBSs proves to be an effective approach that significantly reduces the computational cost of neural networks. RNNs show excellent performance in recognising this type of time series data. This method not only allows efficient identification of HBSs, but can also be extended to recognise other types of periodic variable stars.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the eccentricity distribution of warm sub-Saturns (4-8 Re, 8-200 day periods) as derived from an analysis of transit light curves from NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission. We use the "photoeccentric" effect to constrain the eccentricities of 76 planets, comprising 60 and 16 from single- and multi-transiting systems, respectively. We employ Hierarchical Bayesian Modelling to infer the eccentricity distribution of the population, testing both a Beta and Mixture Beta distribution. We identify a few highly eccentric (e ~ 0.7-0.8) warm sub-Saturns with eccentricities that appear too high to be explained by disk migration or planet-planet scattering alone, suggesting high-eccentricity migration may play a role in their formation. The majority of the population have a mean eccentricity of e = 0.103+0.047-0.045, consistent with both planet-disk and planet-planet interactions. Notably, we find that the highly eccentric sub-Saturns occur in single-transiting systems. This study presents the first evidence at the population level that the eccentricities of sub-Saturns may be sculpted by dynamical processes.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first systematic study of bipolar outflows using HC$_3$N as a tracer in a sample of 146 massive star-forming regions from ALMA-ATOMS survey. Protostellar outflows arise at the initial stage of star formation as a consequence of active accretion. In general, these outflows play a pivotal role in regulating the star formation processes by injecting energetic material in the parent molecular clouds. In such process, lower velocity components of outflows contain a significant portion of the energy. However, extraction of those component is difficult as the corresponding gas is often mixed with that of the ambient cloud. In our sample, we identified 44 bipolar outflows and one explosive outflow in HC$_3$N (J=11--10). The host clumps of these outflows are found to be at different evolutionary stages, suggesting that outflows in HC$_3$N are detectable in different stages of star formation. Also, the non-correlation of HC$_3$N outflows with clump evolutionary stages suggests that HC$_3$N is an unbiased tracer of outflows. Analyses revealed that HC$_3$N performs slightly better in detecting low-velocity components of outflows than traditionally employed tracers like SiO. The derived outflow parameters (i.e outflow mass, momentum, and energy) show moderate correlations with clump mass and luminosity. Our analysis of outflow opening angles and position-velocity diagrams across the outflow lobes show that, HC$_3$N is not only a good tracer of low-velocity outflows, but can also detect high-velocity collimated outflows. Overall, this study indicates that HC$_3$N can be used as a complementary outflow tracer along with the traditionally known outflow tracers, particularly in the detection of the low-velocity components of outflows.

          Dust enrichment and growth in their earliest stages of protoplanetary disk formation

 - **Abstract**
 Aims. Dust enrichment and growth during the initial stages of protoplanetary disk formation were numerically investigated. A particular objective was to determine the effects of various growth barriers, which were mimicked by setting a series of upper permissible limits on maximum dust sizes. Methods. We used the ngFEOSAD code to simulate the three-dimensional dynamics of gas and dust in the polytropic approximation starting from the gravitational collapse of a slowly rotating Bonnor-Ebert sphere to $\approx 12$ kyr after the first hydrostatic core and disk formation. Results. We found that dust growth starts in the contracting cloud in the evolution stage that precedes disk formation and the disk begins to form in an environment that is already enriched in grown dust. The efficiency of dust growth in the disk is limited by dust growth barriers. For dust grains with maximum size < 100 $\mu$m these are likely electrostatic or bouncing barriers, and for larger grains the fragmentation and drift barriers play the major role. The disk midplane becomes quickly enriched with dust, while the vertically integrated distribution of dust shows notable local variations around the canonical 1:100 dust-to-gas mass ratio. These positive and negative deviations are likely caused by local hydrodynamic flows, since the globally integrated dust-to-gas ratio deviates negligibly from the initial 1:100 value. We note that care should be taken when considering models with a fixed dust size, as it may attain a profound negative radial gradient already in the very early stages of disk formation. Models with a constant Stokes number may be preferable in this context. Conclusions. The early dust enrichment and growth may facilitate planet formation as suggested by observations of protoplanetary disk substructures.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a dataset of high resolution spectra of the Sun of many strongly polarized lines belonging to the second solar spectrum, i.e. the spectrum near the limb in linear polarization (scattering polarization). These solar spectra were obtained in full Stokes polarimetry (I, Q/I, U/I, V/I) in the quiet Sun at various distances from the limb, and at disk centre for comparison, with the ground based CNRS THEMIS telescope. Polarization rates Q/I up to 7% are obtained in CaI 4227 Å line at $\mu$ = cos$\theta$ = 0, while 2% is reached in SrI 4607 Å line and 1.4% in BaII 4554 Å. The spectra shown here are freely available in FITS format to the research community.

 - **Abstract**
 Fisher-matrix forecasts are presented for the cosmological surveys of the Javalambre Physics of the Accelerating Universe Astrophysical Survey (J-PAS) and the Subaru Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS). The wide, low-redshift coverage of J-PAS and the high-density, high-redshift mapping of PFS are strongly complementary: combining the two reduces marginalized uncertainties on all primary parameters compared with either survey individually. Adding the joint J-PAS+PFS data to next-generation CMB measurements from CMB-S4 and \textsc{LiteBird} yields an expected precision of $\sigma(\sum m_\nu)=0.017\,$eV in the $\Lambda$CDM$+\sum m_\nu+N_{\rm eff}$ framework, sufficient to disfavour the inverted neutrino hierarchy at $2.35\,\sigma$ if the true mass sum equals the normal-ordering minimum. Motivated by recent DESI results, we also forecast within a $w_0w_a$CDM$+\sum m_\nu+N_{\rm eff}$ cosmology, adopting the DESI\,DR2 best-fit values ($w_0=-0.758$, $w_a=-0.82$) as fiducial. The combination CMB+J-PAS+PFS then delivers $\sigma(w_0)=0.044$ and $\sigma(w_a)=0.18$, corresponding to a $5.1\,\sigma$ preference for a time-varying dark-energy equation of state. These findings show that J-PAS and PFS, especially when coupled with Stage-IV CMB observations, will provide competitive tests of neutrino physics and the dynamics of cosmic acceleration.

 Whether the current observational data indicate any evidence of interaction between the dark sector is a matter of supreme interest at the present moment. This article searched for an interaction in the dark sector between a pressure-less dark matter and a dark energy fluid with constant equation of state, $w_{\rm DE}$. For this purpose, two non-parametric approaches, namely, the Gaussian Process (GP) and the Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) have been employed and using the Hubble data from Cosmic Chronometers (CC), Pantheon+ from Supernovae Type Ia and their combination we have reconstructed the interaction function. We find that for $w_{\rm DE} =-1$, the interaction in the dark sector is not prominent while for $w_{\rm DE} \neq -1$, evidence of interaction is found depending on the value of $w_{\rm DE}$. In particularly, we find that if we start deviating from $w_{\rm DE} = -1$ either in the quintessence ($w_{\rm DE} > -1$) or phantom ($w_{\rm DE} < -1$) direction, an emergence of dark interaction is observed from both GP and ANN reconstructions. We further note that ANN which is applied for the first time in this context seems to play a very efficient role compared to GP.

 - **Abstract**
 The primary epoch of planetary accretion concludes with giant impacts - highly energetic collisions between proto-planets that can play a key role in shaping a planet's inventory of volatile elements. Previous work has shown that single giant impacts have the potential to eject a significant amount of a planet's atmosphere but that the efficiency of atmospheric loss depends strongly on the impact parameters and atmospheric properties. Fully quantifying the role of giant impacts in planetary volatile evolution requires a more complete understanding of the mechanisms driving loss during impacts. Here, we use a suite of 3D smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations to show that loss in giant impacts is controlled primarily by ejecta plumes near the impact site and breakout of the impact shock in the far field, with the efficiency of the latter well approximated by 1D ground-kick calculations. The relative contributions of each mechanism to loss changes drastically with varying impact parameters. By considering the near and far field separately, we present a scaling law that precisely approximates (to within an average of $\sim$3%) loss from 0.35 to 5.0 Earth mass planets with 5% mass fraction H$_2$-He atmospheres for any combination of impactor mass, impact velocity, and angle. Finally, we apply our scaling law to the results of $N$-body simulations for different solar system formation scenarios. We find that while individual impacts rarely cause significant loss ($>$10%) from roughly Earth-mass planets with such massive primary atmospheres, the cumulative effect of multiple impacts can be substantial (40-70% loss).

          Formation of Al II lines and photospheric aluminium abundances in B-type stars

 - **Abstract**
 Aluminium abundances of B-type stars were spectroscopically determined in order to get information about the galactic gas composition at the time of their formation. For this purpose, two AlII lines at 6243 and 4663A were employed. The non-LTE effect of these AlII lines generally acts in the direction of weakening (i.e., profile becomes shallower) caused by a decrease of line opacity (due to overionization) along with an enhanced line source function (overexcitation), and this effect tends to become progressively larger with an increase in Teff as well as with a decrease in log g (surface gravity). Regarding the AlII 6243 line, while the non-LTE calculation qualitatively reproduces its overall behavior (e.g., transition from absorption to emission at early B-type), some Teff-dependent systematic trend remains unremoved in the non-LTE abundances of normal stars, which means that non-LTE corrections evaluated for this line are quantitatively insufficient. Meanwhile, for the case of the Al II 4663 line, which is more advantageous than the 6243 line in the sense that it is stronger without showing any emission, the resulting non-LTE abundances of ordinary B stars are almost constant at the solar abundance (A~6.5) over the wide Teff range (~10000-20000K), suggesting that the abundances derived from this line are successfully non-LTE-corrected and trustable. Therefore, according to the results from the AlII 4663 line, we may conclude that the Al abundance of the galactic gas in the recent past (several times ~10^7-10^8 yr ago) is almost consistent with the solar composition. As to the Al abundances of HgMn stars (Teff<15000K), our analysis confirmed that this element is conspicuously deficient (by ~0.5-2 dex in comparison with the Sun) in the photosphere of these chemically peculiar stars, as already reported in previous studies.

          Double Hot Jupiters Through ZLK Migration

 - **Abstract**
 The von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai (ZLK) mechanism with tidal friction has been demonstrated as a promising avenue to generate hot Jupiters in stellar binary systems. Previous population studies of hot Jupiter formation have largely examined this mechanism in systems comprised of three bodies: two stars and one planet. However, because stars in a binary system form in similar environments with comparable metallicities, the formation of a single hot Jupiter in such a system may imply that the conditions are more likely met for the companion star, as well. We investigate the ZLK mechanism with tidal friction as a potential mechanism to produce double hot Jupiter systems in stellar binaries. Using N-body simulations, we characterize the evolution of two cold Jupiters, each orbiting one star in a binary system, undergoing mirrored ZLK migration. We then examine the robustness of this mechanism to asymmetries in stellar masses, planet masses, and planet orbital inclinations relative to the binary plane. We predict that, under the assumptions that (1) most hot Jupiters in binary star systems form through ZLK migration of primordially formed cold Jupiters and (2) if one star in a binary system forms a cold Jupiter, the second does as well, a comprehensive search could identify double hot Jupiters in up to ~9% of the close- to moderate- separation a<2000 AU) binary systems that already host a known hot Jupiter. We also argue that a blind search for ZLK-migrated double hot Jupiters should prioritize twin stellar binaries with pericenter approaches of a few hundred AU.

 We present improved collision support for TRACE, a state-of-the-art hybrid integrator in REBOUND. TRACE now supports collisional fragmentation and can handle both removing and adding particles mid-timestep. We describe the back-end logic implemented for robust collision support, and compare TRACE's performance to other integrators including MERCURIUS on a large-N protoplanetary disk simulation with various collision prescriptions, a system which TRACE previously could not handle. TRACE matches the behavior of these integrators, while offering potentially vast speedups of over 70x. All updates described in this Note are available with the most recent public release of REBOUND.

 - **Abstract**
 We report on an observational campaign performed with Swift/XRT on the wind-fed supergiant X-ray binary 4U 1909+07 to investigate the nature of the orbital and superorbital modulation of its X-ray emission. A total of 137 XRT observations have been carried out, summing up to a total effective exposure time of 114 ks and covering a total of 66 orbital and 19 superorbital cycles of the source. The XRT data folded on the orbital period of the source confirmed and improved the previously reported variability in intensity and absorption column density, which can be ascribed to the neutron star accreting from the wind of its B supergiant companion across a fairly circular orbit. The XRT data folded on the superorbital period did not provide evidence of significant variations in either the absorption column density and/or the power-law photon index. This may be due to a significant weakening of the superorbital modulation during the times when the XRT observations were carried out, as confirmed by the BAT dynamic power spectrum. We discuss the implications of these findings within the corotating interaction region model proposed to interpret the superorbital variability in wind-fed supergiant X-ray binaries.

 - **Abstract**
 Dynamical friction is an important phenomena in stellar dynamics resulting in the slowing down of a test particle upon many two-body scatters with background particles. Chandrasekhar's original formulation, developed for idealized infinite and homogeneous systems, has been found to be sufficiently accurate even in models of finite extent and radially dependent density profiles. However, in some cases $N-$body simulations evidenced a breakdown of Chandrasekhar's formalism. In particular, in the case of cored stellar systems, the analytical predictions underestimate the rate of in-fall of the test particle. Several explanations for such discrepancy have been proposed so far, in spite of this it remains unclear whether the origin is a finite N effect or an effect arising from the resonance of the orbits of the test and field particles, which is independent on $N$, such as dynamical buoyancy. Here we aim at shedding some light on this issue with tailored numerical experiments. We perform ad hoc simulations of a massive tracer initially placed on a low eccentricity orbit in spherical equilibrium models with increasing resolution. We use an $N-$body code where the self-consistent interaction among the background particles can be substituted with the effect of the static smooth potential of the system's continuum limit, so that the higher order contributions to the dynamical friction arising from the formation of a wake can be neglected if needed. We find that, contrary to what reported in the previous literature, a suppression of dynamical friction happens in both cuspy and cored models. When neglecting the interaction among field particles we observe in both cases a clear $N^{-1/2}$ scaling of the radius at which dynamical friction ceases to be effective. This hints towards a granularity-induced origin of the so-called core-stalling of the massive tracer in cored models.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic strings are predicted in many extensions of the Standard Model and constitute a plausible source of gravitational waves (GWs) from the early Universe. In a previous article [1], we pointed out that the GW spectrum from a population of string loops in the scaling regime can exhibit a sharp cutoff frequency associated with the fundamental oscillation mode of string loops. In this paper, we study the effect of particle decay due to kink-kink collisions and cusps on the GW spectrum in the nonscaling scenario introduced in Ref. [2]. We find analytical conditions for the existence of a cutoff frequency in the fundamental spectrum and provide expressions for this frequency. In large regions of parameter space, our results in the nonscaling model turn out to be identical to those in the scaling model. Finally, we demonstrate how the spectrum changes when transitioning from the regime with a cutoff frequency to the regime without a cutoff frequency. Our analytical estimates are validated at qualitatively different benchmark points by comparing them with numerical spectra.

          Scintillometry of Fast Radio Bursts: Resolution effects in two-screen models

 - **Abstract**
 Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) exhibit scintillation and scattering, often attributed to interactions with plasma screens in the Milky Way and the host galaxy. When these two screens appear "point-like" to each other, two scales of scintillation can be observed with sufficient frequency resolution. A screen perceives a second screen as extended or resolved when the angular size of the latter is smaller than the angular resolution of the former. We define the ratio of these two as the Resolution Power (RP). Previous observational studies have argued that, in the resolving regime, scintillations disappear, assuming that a screen resolving another screen is equivalent to a screen resolving an incoherent emission region. In this theoretical and simulation-based study of resolving effects in two-screen scenarios, we argue that resolving quenches only the relatively broad-scale scintillation and that this quenching is a gradual process. We present qualitative and quantitative predictions for dynamic spectra, spectral autocorrelation functions (ACF), and modulation indices in resolved and unresolved regimes of two-screen systems. We show that the spectral ACF of a two-screen system has a product term in addition to the sum of individual screen contributions, causing the total modulation index to rise to \sqrt(3) in the unresolved regime. To aid in discovering resolving systems, we also present observable trends in multi-frequency observations of a screen resolving another screen or incoherent emission. Additionally we introduce a new formula to estimate the distance between the FRB and the screen in its host galaxy. We also show that this formula, like previous ones in the literature, is only applicable to screens that are two-dimensional in the plane of the sky.

          I-Love-Q Relations of Fermion-Boson Stars

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the properties of fermion-boson stars (FBSs), which can be viewed as neutron stars with a bosonic dark matter (DM) admixture. A challenge in studying the impact of DM on neutron stars is the absence of a universally accepted nuclear-matter equation of state (EOS), making it difficult to distinguish between the effects of DM and various EOS models. To address this issue, we extend the study of the I-Love-Q universal relations of neutron stars to FBSs with a nonrotating bosonic component by solving the Einstein-Klein-Gordon system. We study how DM parameters, such as the boson particle mass and self-interaction strength, would affect the structure of FBSs and explore the parameter space that leads to deviations from the I-Love-Q relations. The properties of FBSs and the level of deviations in general depend sensitively on the DM parameters. For boson particle mass within the range of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-10} \ \mathrm{eV})$, where the Compton wavelength is comparable to the Schwarzschild radius of a $1 M_\odot$ star, the deviation is up to about 5% level if the star contains a few percent of DM admixture. The deviation increases significantly with a higher amount of DM. We also find that the universal relations are still valid to within a 1% deviation level for boson particle mass $m_b \geq 26.8\times10^{-10} \ \mathrm{eV}$. This effectively sets an upper bound on the boson particle mass, beyond which it becomes not feasible to probe the properties of FBSs by investigating the I-Love-Q relation violations.

          Axion Dark Matter Archaeology with Primordial Gravitational Waves

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the complementary information to be gained from inflationary gravitational wave (IGW) signals and searches for QCD axion dark matter. We focus on post-inflationary Peccei-Quinn (PQ) breaking axion models that are cosmologically safe. Recent work has shown that a greater number of such models exist. This is because the heavy quarks required for the colour anomaly can provoke a period of heavy quark domination (HQD), which, through decay, dilutes the axion abundance. In this work we show for the first time that the axion dark matter mass can be as low as $m_a\sim10^{-8}\,{\rm eV}$ for models where the heavy quarks decay via dimension 6 terms. This is achieved by allowing the mass of the heavy quarks to differ from the axion decay constant, $m_Q\neq f_a$. Consequently, the observables that would distinguish between pre- and post-inflationary PQ breaking, $m_a$ and the additional relativistic degrees of freedom $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$, now become indiscernible. To solve this, we propose using blue-tilted IGWs to probe HQD. By leveraging the features of the GW signal, future interferometers can probe $m_Q$ and $f_a$ complementing the sensitivity of haloscope experiments, potentially pinning down all relevant parameter that describe the physics. Specifically, we find that BBO and ET GW detectors will both be able to optimistically probe $f_a\gtrsim 10^{14}\,{\rm GeV}$.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the implications of recent CMB observations for Higgs-Starobinsky inflationary models and their associated reheating dynamics, utilizing data from ACT DR6, Planck 2018, BICEP/Keck 2018, and DESI, collectively referred to as P-ACT-LB-BK18. In addition to direct CMB constraints, we incorporate indirect bounds arising from the potential overproduction of primordial gravitational waves (PGWs), particularly through limits on the effective number of relativistic species, $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$, during Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). These constraints become especially relevant in scenarios featuring a stiff post-inflationary equation of state $w_{\rm RH}\geq 0.58$. Our analysis shows that, when both P-ACT-LB-BK18 data and $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ bounds are considered, the viable number of inflationary e-folds is restricted to the range ($57.9$-$62.2$) at the $2\sigma$ confidence level (C.L.). Correspondingly, the reheating temperature is constrained to lie between the BBN energy scale and $10^{12}$ GeV, with the post-inflationary equation-of-state parameter satisfying $w_{\rm RH} > 0.41$. However, no parameter space remains viable at the $1\sigma$ C.L. once $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ constraints from PGWs are included, rendering the Higgs-Starobinsky model highly restricted.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the stability of a hot saturated gas coexisting with condensed particles in an optically thin medium. Such a situation may obtain downstream of a shock, at condensation fronts, or in vaporizing impacts. We show that the gas-particle mixture is subject to a thermal instability whereby a region of lower temperature and higher condensate density cools faster to condense faster. If the region of runaway condensation has a sound-crossing time shorter than its cooling time, then it accretes more mass, in gas and particles, from its higher pressure surroundings. Numerical integration of the linearized perturbation equations demonstrates that this radiation-condensation instability can create particle clumps and voids out of a secularly cooling gas. Provided radiation can escape to cool particle overdensities, thermal instability can help assemble chondrite parent bodies out of the vaporized debris of asteroid collisions, and form planetesimals generally.

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze 15 years of Fermi-LAT data and produce a detailed model of the Sun's inverse-Compton scattering emission (solar halo), which is powered by interactions between ambient cosmic-ray electrons and positrons with sunlight. By developing a novel analysis method to analyze moving sources, we robustly detect the solar halo at energies between 31.6 MeV and 100 GeV, and angular extensions up to 45$^\circ$ from the Sun, providing new insight into spatial regions where there are no direct measurements of the galactic cosmic-ray flux. The large statistical significance of our signal allows us to sub-divide the data and provide the first $\gamma$-ray probes into the time-variation and azimuthal asymmetry of the solar modulation potential, finding time-dependent changes in solar modulation both parallel and perpendicular to the ecliptic plane. Our results are consistent with (but with independent uncertainties from) local cosmic-ray measurements, unlocking new probes into both astrophysical and beyond-standard-model processes near the solar surface.

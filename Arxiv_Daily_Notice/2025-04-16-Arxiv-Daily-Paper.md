          A possible wave-optical effect in lensed FRBs

 - **Abstract**
 Context: Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are enigmatic extragalactic bursts whose properties are still largely unknown, but based on their extremely small time duration, they are proposed to have a compact structure, making them candidates for wave-optical effects if gravitational lensed. If an FRB is lensed into multiple-images bursts at different times by a galaxy or cluster, a likely scenario is that only one image is detected, because the others fall outside the survey area and time frame. Aims: In this work we explore the FRB analog of quasar microlensing, namely the collective microlensing by stars in the lensing galaxy, now with wave optics included. The eikonal regime is applicable here. Methods. We study the voltage (rather than the intensity) in a simple simulation consisting of (a) microlensing stars, and (b) plasma scattering by a turbulent interstellar medium. Results: The auto-correlation of the voltage shows peaks (at order-microsecond separations) corresponding to wave-optical interference between lensed micro-images. The peaks are frequency dependent if plasma-scattering is significant. While qualitative and still in need of more realistic simulations, the results suggest that a strongly-lensed FRB could be identified from a single image. Conclusions: Microlensing could sniff out macro-lensed FRBs

 - **Abstract**
 The characterization and analysis of light curves are vital for understanding the physical and rotational properties of artificial space objects such as satellites, rocket stages, and space debris. This paper introduces the Light Curve Dataset Creator (LCDC), a Python-based toolkit designed to facilitate the preprocessing, analysis, and machine learning applications of light curve data. LCDC enables seamless integration with publicly available datasets, such as the newly introduced Mini Mega Tortora (MMT) database. Moreover, it offers data filtering, transformation, as well as feature extraction tooling. To demonstrate the toolkit's capabilities, we created the first standardized dataset for rocket body classification, RoBo6, which was used to train and evaluate several benchmark machine learning models, addressing the lack of reproducibility and comparability in recent studies. Furthermore, the toolkit enables advanced scientific analyses, such as surface characterization of the Atlas 2AS Centaur and the rotational dynamics of the Delta 4 rocket body, by streamlining data preprocessing, feature extraction, and visualization. These use cases highlight LCDC's potential to advance space debris characterization and promote sustainable space exploration. Additionally, they highlight the toolkit's ability to enable AI-focused research within the space debris community.

 - **Abstract**
 Strongly lensed supernovae are a promising new probe to obtain independent measurements of the Hubble constant (${H_0}$). In this work, we employ simulated gravitationally lensed Type Ia supernovae (glSNe Ia) to train our machine learning (ML) pipeline to constrain $H_0$. We simulate image time-series of glSNIa, as observed with the upcoming Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, that we employ for training an ensemble of five convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The outputs of this ensemble network are combined with a simulation-based inference (SBI) framework to quantify the uncertainties on the network predictions and infer full posteriors for the $H_0$ estimates. We illustrate that the combination of multiple glSN systems enhances constraint precision, providing a $4.4\%$ estimate of $H_0$ based on 100 simulated systems, which is in agreement with the ground truth. This research highlights the potential of leveraging the capabilities of ML with glSNe systems to obtain a pipeline capable of fast and automated $H_0$ measurements.

          Probing Primordial Power Spectrum and Non-Gaussianities With Fast Radio Bursts

 - **Abstract**
 We use the precision measurements of the arrival time differences of the same fast radio burst (FRB) source along multiple sightlines to measure the primordial power spectrum and Non-Gaussianities. The anticipated experiment requires a sightline separation of 100 AU, achieved by sending three or more radio telescopes to the outer solar system. The Shapiro time delays, measured relatively between different telescopes, are sensitive to the gradient field of the gravitational potential between different sightlines. Since the arrival time difference is independent of when the transient signal is emitted from the source, every measurement of the detected FRB source can be correlated. With enough FRB sources discovered, we can map the gravitational potential across the sky. We further calculate the two-point and three-point correlation function of the arrival time difference between telescopes for different FRB sources in the sky. If $10^4$ FRBs were to be detected, our results suggest that this technique can test the inflationary scale-invariant power spectrum down to $\sim 10^3\,\rm Mpc^{-1}$ and primordial Non-Gaussianities at a level of $f_{\rm NL}\sim 1$.

          Do We Know How to Model Reionization?

 - **Abstract**
 I compare the power spectra of the radiation fields from two recent sets of fully-coupled simulations that model cosmic reionization: "Cosmic Reionization On Computers" (CROC) and "Thesan". While both simulations have similar power spectra of the radiation sources, the power spectra of the photoionization rate are significantly different at the same values of cosmic time or the same values of the mean neutral hydrogen fraction. However, the power spectra of the photoionization rate can be matched at large scales for the two simulations when the matching snapshots are allowed to vary independently. I.e., on large scales, the radiation field in two simulations proceeds through the same evolutionary stages, but the timing of these stages is different in different simulations and is not parameterized by an easily interpretable physical quantity like the mean neutral fraction or the mean free path. On small scales, large differences are present and remain partially unexplained. Both CROC and Thesan use the Variable Eddington Tensor approximation for modeling radiative transfer, but adopt different closure relations (optically thin OTVET versus M1). The role of this key difference is tested by using smaller simulations with a new cosmological simulation code that implements both closure relations in a controlled environment (the same hydro, cooling, and gravity solvers and the star formation recipe). In these controlled tests, both the M1 closure and the OTVET ansatz follow the expected behavior from a simple analytical approximation, demonstrating that the differences in the 2-point function of the radiation field induced by the choice of the Eddington tensor are not dominant.

 - **Abstract**
 Radio-bright, jetted quasars at $z>5$ serve as unique laboratories for studying supermassive black hole activity in the early Universe. In this work, we present a sample of high-$z$ jetted quasars selected from the combination of the radio Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey (RACS) with deep wide-area optical/near-infrared surveys. From this cross-match we selected 45 new high-$z$ radio quasar candidates with S$_{888MHz}>1$ mJy and mag$z<21.3$ over an area of 16000deg$^2$. Using spectroscopic observations, we confirmed the high-$z$ nature of 24 new quasars, 13 at $4.5<z<5$ and 11 at $z>5$. If we also consider similar, in terms of radio/optical fluxes and sky position, quasars at $z>5$ already reported in the literature, the overall $z>5$ RACS sample is composed by 33 powerful quasars, expected to be ~90% complete at mag$z<21.3$ and S$_{888MHz}>1$ mJy. Having rest-frame radio luminosities in the range $\nu L_{1.4GHz}=10^{41.5}-10^{44.4}$ erg s$^{-1}$, this sample contains the most extreme radio quasars currently known in the early Universe. We also present all X-ray and radio data currently available for the sample, including new, dedicated {\it Chandra}, uGMRT, MeerKAT and ATCA observations for a sub-set of the sources. from the modelling of their radio emission, either with a single power law or a broken power law, we found that these systems have a wide variety of spectral shapes with most quasars (22) having a flat radio emission (i.e., $-0.5<\alpha_{r}<0.5$). At the same time, the majority of the sources with X-ray coverage present a high-energy luminosity larger than the one expected from the X-ray corona only. Both the radio and X-ray properties of the high-$z$ RACS sample suggest that many of these sources have relativistic jets oriented close to our line of sight. (i.e., blazars) and can therefore be used to perform statistical studies on the entire jetted population at high redshift.

          Smooth sailing or ragged climb? -- Increasing the robustness of power spectrum de-wiggling and ShapeFit parameter compression

 - **Abstract**
 The baryonic features in the galaxy power spectrum offer tight, time-resolved constraints on the expansion history of the Universe but complicate the measurement of the broadband shape of the power spectrum, which also contains precious cosmological information. In this work we compare thirteen methods designed to separate the broadband and oscillating components and examine their performance. The systematic uncertainty between different de-wiggling procedures is at most $2$%, depending on the scale. The ShapeFit parameter compression aims to compute the slope $m$ of the power spectrum at large scales, sensitive to matter-radiation equality and the baryonic suppression. We show that the de-wiggling procedures impart large (50%) differences on the obtained slope values, but as long as the theory and data pipelines are set up consistently, this is of no concern for cosmological inference given the precision of existing and on-going surveys. However, it still motivates the search for more robust ways of extracting the slope. We show that post-processing the power spectrum ratio before taking the derivative makes the slope values far more robust. We further investigate eleven ways of extracting the slope and highlight the two most successful ones. We derive a systematic uncertainty on the slope $m$ of $\sigma_{m,\mathrm{syst}} = 0.023|m| + 0.001$ by studying the behavior of the slopes in different cosmologies within and beyond $\Lambda$CDM and the impact in cosmological inference. In cosmologies with a feature in the matter-power spectrum, such as in the early dark energy cosmologies, this systematic uncertainty estimate does not necessarily hold, and further investigation is required.

 - **Abstract**
 In the coming age of precision neutrino physics, neutrinos from the Sun become robust probes of the conditions of the solar core. Here, we focus on $^8$B neutrinos, for which there are already high precision measurements by the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory and Super-Kamiokande. Using only basic physical principles and straightforward statistical tools, we calculate projected constraints on the temperature and density of the $^8$B neutrino production zone compared to a reference solar model. We outline how to better understand the astrophysics of the solar interior using forthcoming neutrino data and solar models.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a detailed study of the elemental abundances distribution of the intracluster medium (ICM) within the A3266 cluster using {\it XMM-Newton} observations. This analysis uses EPIC-pn data, including a new energy scale calibration, which allows us to measure velocities with uncertainties down to $\Delta v \sim 80$ km/s, and MOS observations. We measured radial O, Mg, Si, S, Ar, Ca, and Fe profiles. This is the first study of elemental abundances beyond Fe using X-ray observations within the A3266 cluster. The abundance profiles display discontinuities similar to those obtained for the temperature. We modeled the X/Fe ratio profiles with a linear combination of type~Ia supernovae (SNIa) and core-collapse supernovae (SNcc) models. We found that the SNIa ratio over the total cluster enrichment tends to be uniform, with a $42\pm 5\%$ contribution. Such a trend supports an early ICM enrichment scenario, with most metals produced before clustering.

 - **Abstract**
 The gravitational capture of a small compact object by a supermassive black hole is one of the most intriguing sources of gravitational waves to be detected by space-borne observatories. Modeling gravitational waves is a challenging task. However, various approximations exist that enable us to claim detection and perform parameter extraction with high accuracy on synthetic data. The first numerical implementation of relativistic corrections for an astrophysical system was conducted in a post-Newtonian (PN) framework, and since then, most comparable programmes have followed a similar approach. Nevertheless, the PN approach has been developed for two particles in a vacuum. Here, we present the first results on the impact of cross-terms in the PN scheme for ``monochromatic'' sources (meaning that the peak frequency does not evolve over the observational time), which account for the interplay between different bodies. We present a conceptual and illustrative study of the cross-terms on the first PN term in a group of three bodies representing asymmetric binaries (X-MRIs, E-EMRIs, and X-MRIs with E-EMRIs). We find that these cross-terms can lead to a complete phase shift of the gravitational wave by a few times $2\pi$ over periods of time of less than one year for the close binaries. Ignoring the cross-terms in the relativistic semi-Keplerian system can significantly complicate parameter extraction for monochromatic sources.

          TESS Light Curve of the Interacting Binary W Serpentis

 - **Abstract**
 The unusual light curve of the massive eclipsing binary W Ser was recently observed with high S/N and fast cadence by the NASA TESS mission. The TESS light curve records two eclipses and relatively fast variations outside of the eclipses. The eclipse timings verify the period increase of the binary, and the period derivative implies a mass transfer rate in excess of 10^{-5} solar masses per year.. The light curve shows a fading trend from just after an eclipse until the start of the next eclipse. The brightest flux source in the system is the accretion torus surrounding the mass gainer star, and we argue that these orbital-phase related fadings are the result of the injection of cooler gas from the mass donor entering the outskirts of the accretion torus. There are cyclic variations in the out-of-eclipse sections of the light curve that vary on a 2.8 day timescale. This equals the orbital period for gas in the outer regions of the accretion torus, so the photometric variations are probably the result of transitory, over-dense regions that form at the rim of the accretion torus.

          Probing progression of heating through the lower flare atmosphere via high-cadence IRIS spectroscopy

 - **Abstract**
 Recent high-cadence flare campaigns by the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) have offered new opportunities to study rapid processes characteristic of flare energy release, transport, and deposition. Here, we examine high-cadence chromospheric and transition region spectra acquired by IRIS during a C-class flare from 2022 September 25. Within the flare ribbon, the intensities of the Si IV 1402.77, C II 1334.53 and Mg II k 2796.35 lines peaked at different times, with the transition region Si IV typically peaking before the chromospheric Mg II line by 1 - 6 seconds. To understand the nature of these delays, we probed a grid of radiative hydrodynamic flare simulations heated by electron beams, thermal conduction-only, or Alfvén waves. Electron beam parameters were constrained by hard X-ray observations from the Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) onboard the Fermi spacecraft. Reproducing lightcurves where Si IV peaks precede those in Mg II proved to be a challenge, as only a subset of Fermi/GBM-constrained electron beam models were consistent with the observations. Lightcurves with relative timings consistent with the observations were found in simulations heated by either high-flux electron beams or by Alfvén waves, while the thermal conduction heating does not replicate the observed delays. Our analysis shows how delays between chromospheric and transition region emission pose tight constraints on flare models and properties of energy transport, highlighting the importance of obtaining very high-cadence datasets with IRIS and other observatories.

          The nature of spectral variability of the accreting pulsar Centaurus X-3 unveiled by NuSTAR observation covering two orbital cycles

 - **Abstract**
 We conducted a $369\;{\rm ks}$ NuSTAR observation on the X-ray pulsar Centaurus X-3, which covered two consecutive orbital cycles of the source, including two eclipse durations. We investigated the orbital-phase spectral variability over the two orbital cycles. We divided the entire observation data into multiple segments, each covering an orbital interval of $\Delta\Phi=0.005$. The phenomenological spectral modeling applied to these orbital-phase-resolved spectra reveals that the photon index is the key parameter with the most variability and a strong correlation with the continuum flux. The photon index becomes softer during the high-flux phases and harder in the low-flux phases. The relation between the photon index and continuum flux remains consistent when investigating specific spin phases, suggesting that the spectral variability originates from extrinsic factors apart from the neutron star. Furthermore, the 3-5 keV pulse fraction also exhibits variability, being enhanced in the high-flux phases and suppressed in the low-flux phases, which indicates the presence of multiple emission components with different pulse fractions. These phenomenological analysis results enabled us to estimate the physical origin of the spectral variability. We successfully fitted the orbital-phase-resolved spectra with a physical model that assumes (1) stable emission from the neutron star, (2) attenuation by inhomogeneous, clumpy stellar wind, and (3) an additional non-pulsed emission component arising from thermal emission from the accretion disk. The thermal emission from the accretion disk can be described by a blackbody with a temperature of $kT\sim0.5\;{\rm keV}$ and a luminosity of $\sim10^{37}\;{\rm erg\;s^{-1}}$.

 - **Abstract**
 Models predict that more than half of all impacting meteoroids should be carbonaceous, reflecting the abundance of carbon-rich asteroids in the main belt and near-Earth space. Yet carbonaceous chondrites represent only about 4% of meteorites recovered worldwide. Here we analyse 7,982 meteoroid impacts and 540 potential meteorite falls from 19 global observation networks and demonstrate that intense thermal stress at low perihelion distances coupled with the filtering effect of Earth`s atmosphere explains this mismatch. Meteoroids repeatedly subjected to intense thermal cycling near the Sun fracture and weaken, removing the most friable objects even before atmospheric entry. Our data also show that tidally disrupted meteoroid streams produce especially fragile fragments that rarely survive to the ground. Consequently, compact, higher-strength, thermally cycled bodies dominate the meteorite record. These findings reconcile the predicted carbonaceous flux with its scarcity in collections, underscoring how orbital evolution and atmospheric filtering shape the materials that reach Earth`s surface.

          Inferring Fireball Velocity Profiles and Characteristic Parameters of Meteoroids from Incomplete Datasets

 - **Abstract**
 Extracting additional information from old or incomplete fireball datasets remains a challenge. To address missing point-by-point observations, we introduce a method for estimating atmospheric flight parameters of meteoroids using metaheuristic optimization techniques. Using a fireball catalog from the European Fireball Network (EN), we reconstruct velocity profiles, meteoroid bulk densities, mass loss rates, and ablation and ballistic coefficients, based on the initial and terminal points' height, velocity, and mass with the purely dynamical $\alpha$-$\beta$ model. Additionally, the method's performance is compared to the Meteorite Observation and Recovery Project (MORP) derived fits, confirming the robustness of the computed parameters for objects with asteroidal compositions. Our findings show that $\alpha$-$\beta$ model yields parameters consistent with the photometric and dynamic mass estimates in the EN catalog for $P_E$ type I events. However, in the implementation proposed here, $\alpha$-$\beta$ model encounters limitations in accurately representing the final deceleration of more fragile high-velocity meteoroids. This is likely due to challenges in representing complex fragmentation processes by fitting only two points, even when initial and terminal residuals are minimal. The retrieved $\alpha$-$\beta$ distribution differs from the one derived from MORP data, likely due to the imposed mass constraints, which strongly influence the results, especially the bulk density. The results suggest that $P_E$ constraints reduce fitting accuracy (from 90\% to 44\%), while flexibility and freedom from assumptions improve $\alpha$-$\beta$ performance. The method yields 26\% of the events compatible with the catalog $P_E$ classification. Our approach is well-suited for interpreting historical or sparse datasets.

 - **Abstract**
 The energy spectra of cosmic rays (CRs) below tens of GeV are significantly modulated by solar activity within the heliosphere. To investigate the properties of Galactic CRs, it is important to determine the unmodulated local interstellar spectrum (LIS). Recent high-precision temporal measurements of CR energy spectra, released by the AMS-02 collaboration, provide a crucial observational foundation for this endeavor. In this study, we employ the widely used force-field approximation (FFA) model to analyze the AMS-02 data, and attempt to derive the LIS for CR protons and positrons. By applying a non-LIS method, we derive temporal variations of the relative solar modulation potential, $\Delta\phi$, for individual particle species. Our analysis demonstrates that the FFA provides sufficient accuracy in explaining the AMS-02 spectral measurements of all particles during the low solar activity period. Notably, the derived $\Delta\phi(t)$ for protons and positrons, as well as for electrons and antiprotons, exhibit excellent consistency, indicating that particles with the same charge sign can be effectively described within a unified FFA framework during the low solar activity period. Having established a well-constrained proton LIS and its associated modulation potential, we apply the common modulation behavior between positrons and protons to demodulate the AMS-02 positron measurements, and derive the positron LIS without necessitating prior knowledge of its characteristics. This LIS is useful for quantitative investigations into potential exotic origins of CR positrons.

 - **Abstract**
 The Fokker-Planck equation describing the transport of energetic particles interacting with turbulence is difficult to solve analytically. Numerical solutions are of course possible but they are not always useful for applications. In the past a subspace approximation was proposed which allows to compute important quantities such as the characteristic function as well as certain expectation values. This previous approach was applied to solve the one-dimensional Fokker-Planck equation which contains only a pitch-angle scattering term. In the current paper we extend this approach in order to solve the Fokker-Planck equation with a focusing term. We employ two- and three-dimensional subspace approximations to achieve a pure analytical description of particle transport. Additionally, we show that with higher dimensions, the subspace method can be used as a hybrid analytical-numerical method which produces an accurate approximation. Although the latter approach does not lead to analytical results, it is much faster compared to pure numerical solutions of the considered transport equation.

 - **Abstract**
 Cataclysmic variables (CVs), binary systems with a white dwarf accreting from a low-mass star, are significant Galactic X-ray sources. We present a systematic search for X-ray emitting CV candidates by cross-matching four X-ray catalogs (eROSITA, XMM-Newton, Swift, and ROSAT) with Gaia sources located in the bridge region between the main sequence and white dwarf cooling sequence in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. From 444 candidates (267 confirmed CVs and 177 new candidates), we detect orbital modulation in 56 sources using ZTF/TESS light curves. The eROSITA catalog contributes 51% of candidates, outperforming other surveys due to its wider sky coverage and higher sensitivity (~10^{-14} erg cm^{-2} s^{-1}). Our method demonstrates the efficiency of combining X-ray data with time-domain analysis for CV identification, with future eROSITA observations expected to expand the population of X-ray emitting CVs.

 - **Abstract**
 Extreme eclipsing binaries may harbor peculiar physical properties. In this work, we aim to identify a sample of such systems by selecting binaries with pronounced eclipsing light curves, characterized of large variability ($\Delta \mathrm{mag} > 0.3$ in ZTF $g$ band) and significant differences between primary and secondary eclipses (eclipse depth ratio $>$ 20 in ZTF $g$ band). We identified 23 candidates by combining the photometric data and the LAMOST spectroscopic survey. Spectroscopic analysis revealed that all of these systems are dominated by A-type stars in the optical band. Further investigation confirmed that all 23 candidates are Algol-type binaries, with 22 of them being newly discovered. Their orbital periods range from 2.57 to 19.21 days. These systems consist of low-luminosity, highly stripped subgiant donors and accreting A-type stars. The donor stars, with radii of $2.5-8.9~R_\odot$ and effective temperatures around 4000 K, have typical masses of $M_2 \sim 0.3~M_\odot$, indicating substantial mass loss through Roche-lobe overflow. The presence of ellipsoidal variability and H$\alpha$ emission provides strong evidence for ongoing mass transfer. By fitting the spectral energy distributions, spectra, and light curves, we found that most of the accretors have luminosities lower than expected from the mass-luminosity relation, aligning with the predicted faint phase for mass-gaining stars. Three objects of our sample exhibit pulsations with periods from 18 minutes to 8 hours, providing opportunities for asteroseismic studies. The low mass transfer rates and stability make the sample excellent systems for studying mass accretion, advancing our understanding of the Algol-type binary evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 The detection of a $\simeq220$~PeV muon neutrino by the KM3NeT neutrino telescope offers an unprecedented opportunity to probe the Universe at extreme energies. We analyze the origin of this event under three scenarios, viz., a transient point source, a diffuse astrophysical emission, and line-of-sight interaction of ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays (UHECR; $E \gtrsim 0.1$~EeV). Our analysis includes the flux from both a KM3NeT-only fit and a joint fit, incorporating data from KM3NeT, IceCube, and Pierre Auger Observatory. If the neutrino event originates from transients, it requires a new population of transient that is energetic, gamma-ray dark, and more abundant than known ones. In the framework of diffuse astrophysical emission, we compare the required local UHECR energy injection rate at $\gtrsim4$ EeV, assuming a proton primary, with the rate derived from the flux measurements by Auger. This disfavors the KM3NeT-only fit at all redshifts, while the joint fit remains viable for $z\gtrsim 1$, based on redshift evolution models of known source populations. For cosmogenic origin from point sources, our results suggest that the luminosity obtained at redshifts $z \lesssim 1$ from the joint fit is compatible with the Eddington luminosity of supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei.

 - **Abstract**
 Quasars serve as important cosmological probes and constructing accurate luminosity relations for them is essential for their use in cosmology. If the coefficients of quasar's luminosity relation vary with redshift, it could introduce biases into cosmological constraints derived from quasars. In this paper, we conduct a detailed analysis of the redshift variation in the X-ray luminosity and ultraviolet (UV) luminosity ($L_\mathrm{X}$-$L_\mathrm{UV}$) relations of quasars. For the standard $L_\mathrm{X}$-$L_\mathrm{UV}$ relation, we find that the relation coefficients exhibit a strong and linear correlation with redshift, which is not attributable to the selection effect. Additionally, we examine two three-dimensional, redshift-evolving $L_\mathrm{X}$-$L_\mathrm{UV}$ relations and find that the inclusion of a redshift-dependent term does not eliminate the impact of redshift evolution, as the relation coefficients continue to evolve with redshift. Finally, we construct a new $L_\mathrm{X}$-$L_\mathrm{UV}$ relation in which the redshift evolution of the relation coefficients is nearly eliminated. Calibrating the luminosity relations using Hubble parameter measurements, we demonstrate that quasars utilizing our new relation yield effective constraints on cosmological parameters that are consistent with results from Planck CMB data, unlike constraints derived from the standard relation.

 - **Abstract**
 The Vainu Bappu Telescope (VBT) is a 2.34-m reflector, primarily supported on-axis field of view, offering high-resolution and low-to-medium resolution spectroscopic observations in its prime and Cassegrain configurations. This study presents the design and fabrication of a compact, lightweight, three-element wide-field corrector (WFC) utilizing three spherical lenses to cover a polychromatic wavelength range over a 30$'$ FoV at prime focus. The WFC design was optimized using ZEMAX, ensuring precision in aberrations, tolerances, and atmospheric dispersion. The fabricated lenses met stringent tolerances, with a $\pm$1 mm deviation in radius of curvature and 2 mm deviation in center thickness. A mechanical mount was developed to integrate all the WFC lenses, and wavefront error testing for the WFC system was performed using ZYGO interferometry, yielding a Wavefront Error of 0.05 $\lambda$. Laboratory performance tests were designed and conducted using a dedicated setup with achromatic lenses and 100 $\mu m$ fiber-coupled polychromatic light source showed a deviation of 0.1 pixel on-axis and 0.5 pixel at the extreme off-axis field compared to the ZEMAX design, demonstrating that the optical performance of WFC is with minimal aberrations across the entire FoV. The successful integration of the WFC at the VBT prime focus will increase the FoV, enabling the multi-fiber, multi-spectrograph setup in 30 arcmin field that will facilitate both OMR and Echelle spectrograph to be used on the same night along with the addition of new multi-object spectrograph and an integral field unit instrument. This will mark a significant upgrade for the VBT, broadening its research potential, and expanding its observational versatility.

 - **Abstract**
 GJ1061 is a very nearby M star hosting three low-mass temperate planets detected from radial velocity variations. The close to 4:2:1 period commensurability of the planets, the available long-term monitoring of the system and new very high-precision radial velocity measurements from ESPRESSO enable the determination of masses from the planet-planet interaction. Using nested sampling, we derived parameter distributions for a co-planar configuration. The three planets (Mb =1.07 +- 0.11M_Earth, Pb =3.2073 +- 0.0003 d, Mc=1.76 +- 0.13M_Earth, Pc=6.6821 +- 0.0008 d, Md =1.55 +- 0.17M_Earth, Pd =13.066 +- 0.002 d) are potentially all rocky with equilibrium temperatures between 360 K and 240 K. This makes the GJ1061 system one of the prime targets for future ground or space based instruments suitable for a direct detection of the planetary atmospheres.

 - **Abstract**
 Dust is expected to form on a year timescale in core-collapse supernova (SN) ejecta. Its existence is revealed through an infrared brightening, an optical dimming, or a blue-red emission-line profile asymmetry. To investigate how the dust location and amount impact observations, we computed ultraviolet-to-optical spectra of interacting and standard, noninteracting Type II SNe using state-of-the-art models -- for simplicity we adopted 0.1micron silicate grains. These models account for the full ejecta and treat both radioactive decay and shock power that arises from interaction of the ejecta with circumstellar material. In a Type IIn SN such as 1998S at one year, approximately 3e-4Msun of dust within the dense shell reproduces the broad, asymmetric Halpha profile. It causes an optical dimming of ~2mag (which obscures any emission from the inner, metal-rich ejecta) but, paradoxically, a more modest dimming of the ultraviolet, which originates from the outer parts of the dense shell. In Type II SNe with late-time interaction, such as SN2017eaw, dust in the low-mass, fast outer ejecta dense shell tends to be optically thin, impacting little the optical spectrum for dust masses of order 1e-4Msun. In such SNe II with interaction, dust in the inner metal-rich ejecta has negligible effect on observed spectra in the ultraviolet and optical. In noninteracting SNe II, dust within the metal-rich ejecta preferentially quenches the [OI]6300,6364 and [CaII]7291,7323 metal lines, biasing the emission in favor of the H-rich material which generates the Halpha and FeII emission below 5500A. Our model with 5e-4Msun of dust below 2000km/s matches closely the optical spectrum of SN1987A at 714d. Modeling historical SNe requires treating both the ejecta material and the dust, as well as multiple power sources, although interaction power will generally dominate.

 - **Abstract**
 Spatial data fusion is a bottleneck when it meets the scale of 10 billion records. Cross-matching celestial catalogs is just one example of this. To challenge this, we present a framework that enables efficient cross-matching using Learned Index Structures. Our approach involves a data transformation method to map multi-dimensional data into easily learnable distributions, coupled with a novel search algorithm that leverages the advantages of model pairs, significantly enhancing the efficiency of nearest-neighbor search. In this study, we utilized celestial catalog data derived from astronomical surveys to construct the index and evaluated the speed of the cross-matching process. Using the HEALPix segmentation scheme, we built an independent model object for each tile and developed an end-to-end pipeline to construct a framework with semantic guarantees for record retrieval in query and range search. Our results show that the proposed method improves cross-matching speed by more than four times compared to KD-trees for a radius range between 1 milli-arcseconds and 100 arcseconds.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational tidal interactions drive long-term rotational and orbital evolution in planetary systems, in multiple (particularly close binary) star systems and in planetary moon systems. Dissipation of tidal flows in Earth's oceans is primarily responsible for producing gradual expansion of the Moon's orbit at a few centimetres per year as the Earth's day lengthens by a few milliseconds per century. Similar processes occur in many astrophysical systems. For example, tidal dissipation inside (slowly rotating) stars hosting short-period planets can cause the orbits of these planets to decay, potentially leading to planetary destruction; tidal dissipation inside stars in close stellar binary systems -- and inside short-period planets such as hot Jupiters in planetary systems -- can cause initially eccentric orbits to become circular. To model these processes, explain many current observational results, and make predictions for future observations, we require a detailed theoretical understanding of tidal flows and the mechanisms by which -- and how efficiently -- they are dissipated inside stars and planets. This article will introduce our current understanding of tidal flows and dissipation inside stars (and to a lesser extent giant planets), as well as highlight some unsolved problems.

 - **Abstract**
 The Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer is an X-ray observatory measuring the X-ray polarization in the 2-8 keV energy range. Highly sensitive to the system's geometry, X-ray polarization is a unique method to probe the structure of X-ray binaries. The Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer observed the High-Mass X-ray Binary Cygnus X-1 and the Low-Mass X-ray Binary Swift J1727.8-1613 in different accretion states: in the hard state and in the soft state. The X-ray polarimetry analysis of both sources shows a linear polarization degree increasing with energy, with higher values in the hard state than in the soft state. However, the linear polarization angle stays similar in both states and is aligned with the radio jet within $5^\circ$. Furthermore, the Low-Mass X-ray Binary Swift J1727.8-1613 has a lower optical intrinsic polarization and a lower X-ray polarization degree for a softer spectrum. The similarities observed in this analysis between the X-ray polarization results of different types of X-ray Binaries show that the innermost accretion processes are independent of the companion star's type.

 - **Abstract**
 Pan and Daphnis are embedded in Saturn's rings and opening a gap with satellite wakes at the gap edges. Furthermore, in the case of Daphnis, pronounced vertical wall structures casting shadows on the rings are also observed in the satellite wakes. In this paper, we perform a global 3D N-body simulation with non-zero $e_{\rm s}$ or non-zero $i_{\rm s}$ of the satellite orbit to investigate how they affect the gap edge structures. We found that the effect of satellite eccentricity is important both in the satellite wakes and the vertical walls at the gap edges. The non-sinusoidal sawtooth-like satellite wakes and azimuthally more localized vertical walls observed by Cassini are simultaneously reproduced in the detailed structures and spatial scales. Both of them periodically vary due to the satellite excursions between the apocenter and the pericenter. The ring particles in outer (inner) rings that undergo closest encounters with the satellite near the apocenter (pericenter) are excited the most highly. Because the excited eccentricities of the ring particles are converted to the inclinations through physical collisions, the conversion is the most active for the particles that acquire the highest eccentricities, resulting in the azimuthally more localized vertical wall structures. The predicted height of the tallest vertical walls is $\sim 0.2$ times the satellite Hill radius in the case of the satellite eccentricity comparable to Daphnis when adopting Hill scaling, which is twice as much as the height obtained in the case of the circular satellite orbit and is quantitatively more consistent with the Cassini observation. These results show that the observed vertical walls are actually formed by the satellite wakes followed by their conversion to the vertical motions through inter-particle collisions, rather than by the out-of-plane perturbation from the satellite in an inclined orbit.

 - **Abstract**
 Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are intense repeating soft X-ray bursts with recurrence times about a few hours to a few weeks from galactic nuclei. More and more analyses show that (at least a fraction of) QPEs are the result of collisions between a stellar mass object (SMO, a stellar mass black hole or a main sequence star) and an accretion disk around a supermassive black hole (SMBH) in galactic nuclei. Previous studies have shown that the SMO trajectory can be reconstructed from QPE timing data, consequently the SMBH mass can be robustly measured from tracing a single SMO. In this Letter, we construct a comprehensive Bayesian framework for implementing the QPE timing method, explore the optimal QPE observation strategy for measuring SMBH masses, and forecast the measurement precision expected in the era of multi-target X-ray telescope, Chasing All Transients Constellation Hunters (CATCH). As a result, we find the QPE timing method is of great potential in precise measurement of SMBH masses (and spins), especially in the lower mass end ($\lesssim 10^7 M_\odot$) where QPEs prevail and relevant dynamical timescales are reasonably short to be measured.

 - **Abstract**
 The search for long-term variability of compact components of radio sources B0821+394 and B1812+412 over an interval of 10 years was carried out. The LPA LPI radio telescope with an operating frequency of 111 MHz was used for observations. According to our estimates, the characteristic time of variability for both sources is 1.5-2.5 years. It is shown that the observed variability is not related to intrinsic variations in the radiation flux, but is due to refractive scintillation on inhomogeneities of the interstellar medium. From the obtained upper estimates of the apparent angular dimensions of the sources, it follows that the main contribution to the scattering of radio emission is made by turbulent plasma concentrated in sufficiently thin screens, the distance to which does not exceed 300-400 pc.

 - **Abstract**
 The disk around PDS 70 hosts two directly imaged protoplanets in a gap. Previous VLT/SPHERE and recent James Webb Space Telescope/NIRCam observations have hinted at the presence of a third compact source in the same gap at ~13 au, interior to the orbit of PDS 70 b. We reduce seven published and one unpublished VLT/SPHERE datasets in YJH and K bands, as well as an archival VLT/NaCo dataset in L' band, and an archival VLT/SINFONI dataset in H+K band. We combine angular-, spectral- and reference star differential imaging to search for protoplanet candidates. We recover the compact source in all epochs, consistent with the JWST detection, moving on an arc that can be fit by Keplerian motion of a protoplanet which could be in a resonance with PDS 70 b & c. We find that the spectral slope is overall consistent with the unresolved star and inner disk emission at 0.95--1.65$\mu$m, which suggests a dust scattering dominated spectrum. An excess beyond 2.3$\mu$m could be thermal emission from either a protoplanet or heated circumplanetary dust, variability, or inner disk contamination, and requires confirmation. While we currently cannot rule out a moving inner disk feature or a dust clump associated with an unseen planet, the data supports the hypothesis of a third protoplanet in this remarkable system.

 - **Abstract**
 High-energy physics often motivates multi-field inflationary scenarios where stochastic effects play a crucial role. Peculiar to multi-field models, the noise-induced centrifugal force results in a longer duration of inflation depending on the number of fields, even when the stochastic noises themselves are small. We show that, in such small-noise regimes, the number of fields generically discriminates whether inflation successfully terminates or lasts forever. Our results indicate that inflation with an extremely large number of fields may fail to realise our observable Universe.

 Recent findings on retrograde co-orbital mean-motion resonances in the Earth-Moon system, highlight the potential use of spacecraft in retrograde resonances. Based on these discoveries, this study investigates retrograde co-orbital resonances within the Earth-Moon system, focusing on both optimal and sub-optimal orbital transfers to such configurations. The paper provides a comprehensive analysis of retrograde co-orbital resonances, optimization techniques to evaluate and enhance the performance of bi-impulsive transfers to these configurations. The results reveal the feasibility of low-cost transfers, which could support a range of future missions, including space exploration and satellite deployment. Combining advanced optimization processes, we obtained solutions for orbital transfers for different arrival points in retrograde co-orbitals improving mission efficiency and offering a cost-effective approach to interplanetary exploration.

 - **Abstract**
 Hot- and cold-start planet formation models predict differing luminosities for the young, bright planets that direct imaging surveys are most sensitive to. However, precise mass estimates are required to distinguish between these models observationally. The presence of two directly imaged planets, PDS 70 b and c, in the PDS 70 protoplanetary disk provides us a unique opportunity for dynamical mass measurements, since the masses for these planets are currently poorly constrained. Fitting orbital parameters to new astrometry of these planets, taken with VLTI/GRAVITY in the $K$~band, we find $2\sigma$ dynamical upper mass limits of 4.9 $M_{\rm Jup}$ for b and 13.6 $M_{\rm Jup}$ for c. Adding astrometry from the newly proposed planet candidate PDS 70 d into our model, we determine $2\sigma$ dynamical upper mass limits of 5.3 $M_{\rm Jup}$, 7.5 $M_{\rm Jup}$ and 2.2 $M_{\rm Jup}$ for b, c, and the candidate d respectively. However, $N$-body analysis of the orbits fit in this case suggest that the inclusion of $d$ makes the system unstable. Using the upper mass limits for b and c we rule out the coldest-start formation models for both planets, calculating minimum post-formation entropies ($S_i$) of 9.5 $k_{\rm B}/{\rm baryon}$ and 8.4 $k_{\rm B}/{\rm baryon}$ respectively. This places PDS 70 b and c on the growing list of directly-imaged planets inconsistent with cold-start formation.

 - **Abstract**
 Over the past decade, there has been a significant increase in the reporting of extensive and luminous star-forming regions associated with explosive outflows. Nevertheless, there is still a lack of understanding of the possible physical mechanisms that produce such energetic and isotropic events. Then, we propose a gravitational interaction as a likely mechanism that could trigger explosive outflows in dense star-forming regions. This could constrain the physical conditions that generate an explosive outflow produced by the close dynamical encounter of a runaway star with a clump cluster in dynamical equilibrium. Then, we have produced a set of $N$-body simulations that account for the collision of a 10M$_\odot$ stellar object with a cluster of particles with a mass that ranges from 0 to 50 \msun. We propose a parameter to describe the interaction, the evaporation parameter, that represents the fraction of stars that become unbound. The main result is that, when the cluster mass is less than, or up to a few times the stellar mass, the collision will produce an explosive outflow, ejecting a significant fraction of the cluster members with velocities larger than the impact velocity. All of our models produce an explosive outflow, with different characteristics, which increases the probability that a close encounter could be responsible for producing the observed flows.

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the cosmological implications of generalized entropic models within the framework of Gravity-Thermodynamics (GT) approaches. These models, characterized by three or four additional free parameters, are designed to capture deviations from the standard Bekenstein-Hawking entropy and can reproduce well-known entropic formulations, including Tsallis, Rényi, Sharma-Mittal, Barrow, Kaniadakis, and Loop Quantum Gravity entropies in various analytical limits. We implement the corresponding cosmological models using a fully numerical GT approach to constrain the model parameters and to study the evolution of the dark energy equation of state as a function of the scale factor. Our Bayesian analysis, which incorporates the Pantheon+ and DESy5 supernovae data alongside the recently released DESI-DR2/DR1 Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements, shows that the data favor the standard Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, leading to a $\Lambda$CDM-like late-time behavior. In this context, the three-parameter ($\mathcal{S}_3$) entropic model appears to be sufficient to capture the observed dark energy phenomenology. Furthermore, a direct comparison of the Bayesian evidence indicates that the three-parameter model is preferred over the four-parameter ($\mathcal{S}_4$) variant by a factor of $\Delta\log\mathcal{B} \sim -6$, while the GT approach as a whole is significantly disfavored relative to the $\Lambda$CDM model with at least $\Delta\log\mathcal{B} \sim -8$ ($\mathcal{S}_3$) to $\Delta\log\mathcal{B} \sim -13$ ($\mathcal{S}_4$), when using the DESy5 and DESI-DR2 datasets.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigated the impact of a spatially varying matter potential $\lambda$, coming from neutrino-electron forward scattering, on the emergence of fast neutrino flavor conversion (FFC) triggered by the presence of zero crossings in the angular distribution of the neutrino electron lepton number (ELN). We find that FFC can be significantly affected as the spatial variation rate of $\lambda$ increases, and strong spatial variations can completely stabilize initially unstable systems. Using stability analysis based solely on initial conditions, we identified for the first time a critical variation rate above which no FFC occurs even if the flavor instability exists. By analyzing several representative matter profiles based on an 18 $M_{\odot}$ SN model, we show that spatially inhomogeneous $\lambda$ can suppress the occurrence of FFC associated with shallow ELN zero crossings in most of the SN's radial region, especially during the accretion phase. Our finding highlights the need to consider the impact of matter inhomogeneity in the development of improved SN models that aim to include the effect of neutrino flavor conversions.

 - **Abstract**
 The detectors of the JWST Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) Medium Resolution Spectrometer (MRS) form low-finesse resonating cavities that cause periodic count rate modulations (fringes) with peak amplitudes of up to 15% for sources external to MIRI. To detect weak features on a strong continuum and reliably measure line fluxes and line-flux ratios, fringe correction is crucial. This paper describes the first of two steps implemented in the JWST Science Calibration Pipeline, which is the division by a static fringe flat that removes the bulk of the fringes for extended sources. Fringe flats were derived by fitting a numerical model to observations of spatially extended sources. The model includes fringes that originate from two resonating cavities in the detector substrate (a third fringe component that originates from the dichroic filters is not included). The model, numerical implementation, and resulting fringe flats are described, and the efficiency of the calibration was evaluated for sources of various spatial extents on the detector. Flight fringe flats are obtained from observations of the planetary nebula NGC 7027. The two fringe components are well recovered and fitted by the model. The derived parameters are used to build a fringe flat for each MRS spectral band, except for 1A and 1B due to the low signal-to-noise ratio of NGC 7027 in these bands. When applied to extended sources, fringe amplitudes are reduced to the sub-percent level on individual spaxels. For point sources, they are reduced to amplitudes of 1 to 5% considering individual spaxels and a single dither position, and decrease to the 1 to 2% level after two-dimensional residual fringe correction. The fringe flats derived from this work are the reference files currently in use by the JWST Science Calibration Pipeline. They provide an efficient calibration for extended sources, and are less efficient for point sources.

 - **Abstract**
 I examine the morphology of the core-collapse supernova (CCSN) remnant (SNR) G0.9+0.1 and reveal a point-symmetrical morphology that implies shaping by three or more pairs of jets, as expected in the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM). The large northwest protrusion, the ear (or lobe), has two bright rims. I compare this ear with its rims to an ear with three rims of a jet-shaped planetary nebula and jets from an active galactic nucleus that shaped several rims on one side. Based on this similarity, I argue that two jets or more shaped the northwest ear of SNR G0.9+0.1 and its two rims. I identified the bright region south of the main shell of SNR G0.9+0.1 as a jet-shaped blowout formed by a jet that broke out from the main SNR shell. I base this on the similarity of the blowout of SNR G0.9+0.1 with that of SNR G309.2-00.6, argued in the past to be shaped by jets. I identify four symmetry axes along different directions that compose the point-symmetric morphology of SNR G0.9+0.1. I show that the morphological features of holes, granular texture, and random filaments exist in CCSNe and planetary nebulae and are unlikely to result from some unique processes in CCSNe. These structures result from similar instabilities in the JJEM and the neutrino-driven explosion mechanism and, unlike a point-symmetric morphology, cannot determine the explosion mechanism. Identifying SNR G0.9+0.1 as a new point-symmetric CCSN strengthens the JJEM as the primary explosion mechanism of CCSNe.

 - **Abstract**
 The isotopic composition of meteorites linked to S-complex asteroids has been used to suggest that these asteroids originated in the terrestrial planet's region, i.e., within 1.5 au, and later got implanted into the main asteroid belt (MAB). Dynamical models of planet formation support this view. Yet, it remains to be demonstrated whether the currently observed size-frequency distribution (SFD) of S-complex bodies in the MAB can be reproduced via this implantation process. Here we studied the evolution of the SFD of planetesimals during the accretion of terrestrial planets with the code LIPAD self-consistently accounting for growth and fragmentation of planetesimals. In our simulations we vary the initial surface density of planetesimals, the gaseous disk lifetime, and the power slope of the initial planetesimals' SFD. We compared the final SFDs of leftover planetesimals in the terrestrial planet region with the SFD of observed S-complex MAB objects (D $>$ 100km). We found that the SFDs of our planetesimal populations and that of S-complex MAB objects show very similar cumulative power index (i.e., q $\approx$ 3.15 in N($>$D)$~\propto$ D$^{-q}$) for slopes in the diameter range 100 km $<$ D $<$ 400 km by the end of our simulations. Our results support the hypothesis of S-complex MAB implantation from the terrestrial planet forming region, assuming implantation is size-independent, and implies that implantation efficiency is smaller than $\mathcal{O}$(10$^{\rm -2}$--10$^{\rm -4}$) to avoid over-implantation of (4) Vesta-sized objects or larger.

 2MASS J04381486+2611399 (or J0438) is one of the few young brown dwarfs (BD) with a highly inclined ($i\!\sim\!70^\circ$) disk. Here we report results from JWST-MIRI MRS, HST-ACS and ALMA Band 7 observations. Despite its late spectral type (M7.25), the spectrum of J0438 resembles those of inner disks around earlier-type stars (K1-M5, T Tauri stars), with a volatile reservoir lacking hydrocarbons (except for acetylene, C$_2$H$_2$) and dominated by water. Other identified species are H$_2$, CO$_2$, HCN, [Ar$^{+}$], and [Ne$^{+}$]. The dominance of water over hydrocarbons is driven by multiple factors such as disk dynamics, young disk age, low accretion rate and possible inner disk clearing. J0438 appears highly dynamic, showing a seesaw-like variability and extended emission in H$_2 \,\,\, S$(1), $S$(3), $S$(5), [Ne$^{+}$] and CO ($J=3-2$). Interestingly, the CO emission reaches up to 400 au from the brown dwarf, suggesting ongoing infalling/outflowing activity impacting the disk chemistry. These observations underscore the combined power of JWST, HST and ALMA in characterizing the chemical diversity and dynamics of brown dwarf disks.

 - **Abstract**
 Infrared observations of the inner disks around very low-mass stars (VLMS, $<$0.3$\,M_{\odot}$) have revealed a carbon-rich gas composition in the terrestrial planet-forming regions. Contrary to the typically water-rich T Tauri disk spectra, only two disks around VLMS have been observed to be water-rich among more than ten VLMS disks observed so far with JWST/MIRI. In this letter, we systematically search for the presence of water and other oxygen-bearing molecules in the JWST/MIRI spectra of ten VLMS disks from the MIRI mid-INfrared Disk Survey (MINDS). In addition to the two previously reported detections of water emission in this VLMS sample, we detect water emission in the spectra of three other sources and tentatively in one source, and we provide strong evidence for water emission in the remaining disks in the MINDS sample, most of which have bright emission from carbon-bearing molecules. We show that the $\rm C_2H_2$ emission is much stronger than that of water for sources with low luminosities, and the hydrocarbons outshine the water emission in such conditions. We propose that the appearance of water-rich vs. hydrocarbon-rich spectra is related to the location of the water reservoir in the disk relative to the main hydrocarbon reservoir. Our findings indicate that the terrestrial planet forming regions in VLMS disks have high carbon-to-oxygen ratios (C/O$>$1), but can still harbor ample water similar to those in the T Tauri disks.

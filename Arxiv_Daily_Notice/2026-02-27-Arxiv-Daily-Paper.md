- **Abstract**
 This study provides a detailed examination of the structural, astrophysical, kinematic, and dynamical properties of the open clusters COIN-Gaia 24, Czernik 24, FSR 0893, and UBC 74, which are located in the direction opposite to the Galactic center. Astrometric, photometric, and spectroscopic data from the Gaia Data Release 3 catalog were used to ensure a precise characterization of cluster members and their physical properties. Membership determination was performed using the UPMASK algorithm applied to a five-dimensional parameter space, yielding 116, 179, 238, and 387 likely members for each cluster, respectively. Structural parameters were derived by fitting King profiles to the radial density distributions of high-probability members. Astrophysical parameters were estimated through Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo isochrone fitting based on PARSEC evolutionary models, complemented by spectral energy distribution analysis using ARIADNE. The resulting extinctions, distances, metallicities, and ages indicate that these are moderately reddened, intermediate-age clusters located between 1 and 3.5 kpc from the Sun. Mean radial velocities combined with Galactic orbital integrations computed with galpy show that all four clusters follow nearly circular, low-eccentricity orbits typical of thin-disc populations. All four OCs have dynamical relaxation times of 22-98 Myr. However, their ages exceed these times by several factors, particularly in Czernik 24, indicating that they are dynamically evolved systems, even though the calculated T_E values represent lower limits. The results confirm that these OCs serve as reliable tracers of the chemical and dynamical evolution of the Galactic thin disc.

- **Abstract**
 The evolutionary classification of molecular clumps, crucial for understanding star formation, is commonly based on human-assigned categories derived from infrared (IR) emission and well-established morphological criteria. However, due to ambiguous signatures, distance uncertainties or heavily obscured IR emission, a significant fraction of sources often remains unclassified. This work demonstrates the capability of machine learning (ML) as a complementary, data-driven approach to automate the identification and classification of these clumps using data from the MALT90 survey, complemented by Spitzer IR photometry. We applied unsupervised clustering with HDBSCAN on molecular line intensities, revealing distinct groupings that correspond to evolutionary stages. Using only five molecular lines (HCO$^+$, HNC, N$_2$H$^+$, HCN, C$_2$H), we identified stable clusters of protostars and regions without active star formation, driven primarily by C$_2$H and N$_2$H$^+$ emission. Incorporating H$^{13}$CO$^+$ gave rise to a distinct UV-dominant cluster, tracing more evolved regions. Infrared properties appeared as non-significant features implying that envelopes of clumps with different masses are similar in their global infrared characteristics. We then employed supervised learning to classify clumps with previously uncertain categories and provided classifications for 522 objects, predominantly as regions without active star formation. Our results show that ML techniques can effectively uncover intrinsic evolutionary structures in complex astrochemical data and assign categories to uncertain sources, providing a powerful, data-driven complement to traditional methods.

- **Abstract**
 We present a major update to the open-source atmospheric modeling package \texttt{PICASO}, designed for simulating the thermal structure and spectra of hydrogen-rich atmospheres of brown dwarfs and exoplanets. This release, \texttt{PICASO 4.0}, expands upon the existing radiative-convective equilibrium model framework by incorporating several new capabilities. Key additions include the integration of \texttt{Virga} for self-consistent cloud modeling, new flexible treatments for rainout and cold trapping of volatile species, and support for photochemistry. We also introduce a parameterized energy injection scheme to simulate additional external or internal heating processes. These features are motivated by lessons from recent JWST observations that reveal the prevalence of non-equilibrium chemistry and clouds. We benchmark the new functionalities against previously published results in the literature, including the Sonora Diamondback grid, energy injected atmospheres, patchy cloud models, and other photochemical models of WASP-39b. \texttt{PICASO} continues to be actively developed as an open-source package aimed at enabling reproducible, community-driven atmospheric modeling of all substellar objects.

- **Abstract**
 The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission has facilitated studies of asteroseismology, eclipsing binaries, and transits in many stars. However, the brightest stars saturate TESS, yet they are the most amenable to photon-hungry high-resolution studies and have long observational histories. In this work, we adapted the halo photometry used in $K$2 to extract light curves from the unsaturated halo pixels of the star's point spread function. We used this method to extract light curves for 98 of the brightest stars observed by TESS in Sectors 1-93. These bright stars include 15 red giants, five $\delta$ Scuti variables, eight stochastic low-frequency variables, eight eclipsing binaries, and 46 other variables. We measured $\nu_{\rm max}$ for 13 red giants using pyMON and $\Delta\nu$ for one of them, $\beta$ Gem (Pollux). For five of them, this represents the first time that oscillations were detected. We derived their stellar masses using the measured $\nu_{\rm max}$ and previous interferometric and radiometric angular diameters. We also discovered $\delta$ Scuti and $\gamma$ Doradus variability in $\alpha$ Cep, possible asteroseismic binary signatures in $\epsilon$ Car, and a new eclipsing binary, $\gamma$ And. Furthermore, we identified 18 stars in our sample that will be observed by the future PLAnetary Transits and Oscillations of stars (PLATO) mission, and 69 stars that have Stellar Observations Network Group (SONG) observations, including some simultaneous with TESS. The light curves are publicly available on the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes.

- **Abstract**
 Li-rich giants serve as valuable tracers of stellar evolution and surface enrichment processes, for which a statistically large and homogeneous sample is crucial. Using the massive low-resolution ($R \sim 1800$) spectroscopic dataset from the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) survey, we systematically search for Li-rich giants by determining their stellar lithium abundances through template matching of the Li I 6708 Å absorption line with a grid of synthetic spectra generated from ATLAS9 model atmospheres. The derived abundances are validated against previous high-resolution studies, showing good consistency with a mean absolute error of about 0.15 dex. Therefore, we adopt a threshold of $A(\rm{Li}) > 1.65$ dex to select Li-rich candidates, followed by visual inspection to ensure the reliability of each detection. Eventually, more than 20,000 Li-rich giants are identified, corresponding to approximately 2.5% of all giants in LAMOST DR9. We also investigate the occurrence rate of Li-rich giants in different evolutionary stages. This work presents a large and homogeneous catalog of Li-rich giants derived from the LAMOST low-resolution survey, which provides a reliable and valuable dataset for future studies of stellar evolution and lithium enrichment in evolved stars.

- **Abstract**
 Mid-infrared spectra of planet-forming discs commonly show prominent silicate emission, whose spectral shape is sensitive to the disc temperature distribution as well as its mineralogical composition. We report new James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations of the discs around Sz 96 and IP Tau and find that their silicate emission significantly changes in the 20 years since they were observed with the Spitzer Space Telescope (SST). Significant differences between the SST and JWST spectra are found for both sources, with flux variations of 10--15\% in Sz~96 and 30--35\% in IP Tau. Sz 96 dimmed at $\le$ 18~$\mathrm{\mu m}$ and did not change significantly at longer wavelengths, whereas IP Tau became brighter across the entire wavelength range, with a particularly strong enhancement around 10~$\mathrm{\mu m}$ in the JWST data compared to the SST data. We propose that this large degree of variability is explained by structural changes in the inner regions of the discs. Specifically, we also find that crystalline silicates exhibit lower temperatures than amorphous silicates in the JWST data of both sources. This result supports the idea that crystalline grains, formed through high-temperature annealing in the inner disc regions, have been transported outward, leading to their presence in cooler regions of the disc. While similar behavior had been reported in previous SST-based studies, the much higher spectral resolution of JWST enables clearer identification of the crystalline features.

- **Abstract**
 To address the challenge of estimating redshifts when only single-band images are available, this study introduces a deep learning model named ViT-MDNz. Leveraging robust statistical priors learned from large-scale data concerning the correlation between redshift and morphology, the model can directly estimate redshifts and their associated uncertainties from single-band galaxy images. It integrates a Vision Transformer (ViT) to extract deep morphological features and a Mixture Density Network (MDN) to predict the full redshift probability density function. Trained and evaluated on approximately 300,000 single-band images from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys (DESI-LS), the model achieves a normalized median absolute deviation $\sigma_{\rm NMAD} = 0.034$ and an outlier fraction $f_{\rm out} = 2.6\%$ in the $r$-band for redshifts up to $z \lesssim 1$. Evaluations using probability integral transform (PIT) and continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) confirm that the predicted probability density functions are well calibrated and closely match the true distribution. These results demonstrate that competitive redshift estimates can be obtained using morphological features alone, and that incorporating color information further enhances the accuracy and robustness of the estimation. Therefore, ViT-MDNz provides a practical approach for redshift estimation of galaxy samples with limited photometric band coverage, contributing to improved completeness and usability of redshift catalogs for future large-scale surveys such as DESI and LSST.

- **Abstract**
 It is important to detect and study circumstellar disks around late-M and brown dwarfs of nearby young associations to understand how these very low-mass objects form and how rocky planets form around them. The detection of new very low-mass members of nearby young associations will also significantly improve our current understanding of young associations. We searched for new young very low-mass members with circumstellar disks in a sample of 3928 candidates. We constructed spectral energy distributions of all candidates using observational photometric data from DENIS, 2MASS, and WISE and trigonometric parallaxes from Gaia to detect infrared excess emission that indicates the presence of circumstellar disks. We then followed up spectroscopic observations of candidates to search for lithium to confirm their youth. The H_alpha emission line was used to detect accretion. We detected 23 among the 3928 candidates with circumstellar disks: Ten objects are new, and 13 were previously reported in the literature. Our mass estimates also indicate that 21 are brown dwarf candidates and 2 are very low-mass stars. DENIS J0534552-104808 has a Gaia distance of 238 pc and might be the first brown dwarf candidate member of a foreground population in front of the Orion D cloud. This foreground population is probably associated with the supergiant kappa Ori. Based on our spectroscopic observations, we detected lithium in 11 candidates. We also identified seven accretors and one potential accretor. The intense long-lived accretion detected in DENIS-P J0500245-333042, a 20 Myr old brown dwarf candidate may be additional evidence to favor the formation of rocky planets around very low-mass objects.

- **Abstract**
 Transiting extrasolar planets are extraordinarily valuable for understanding the characteristics and formation of planets, because they are the only exoplanets whose physical and orbital properties can be measured to high precision. Thousands are now known, and it is important to maintain a database of them for use by the scientific community. TEPCat performs this task: it is a critical compilation of the physical and observable properties of the known transiting planetary systems. This work introduces the motivation for TEPCat, its scope, contents, and implementation. Example plots of interesting quantities are constructed. The classification of planets and of the eclipse features in their light curves is discussed. TEPCat is maintained and freely available online at this https URL

- **Abstract**
 The legacy Hitomi telescope has delivered the precise measurements of the chemical abundances in the Perseus Cluster, covering the Si-group (Si, S, Ar, Ca) and Fe-group elements (Cr, Mn, Ni). In Paper I (Leung et al., ApJ 2025), we examined the role of convection parameters and presented new core-collapse supernova (CCSN) explosion models at solar metallicity, which fit the observed abundance pattern. In this article, we extend our calculation for the stellar evolutionary models and CCSN models of the initial mass $15 - 60M_{\odot}$ and the metallicity $Z = 0 - Z_{\odot}$. The detailed pre- and post-explosion chemical profiles are calculated with a large post-processing network to capture the production of $\alpha$-chain elements (e.g., Si, S, Ar), odd-number elements (e.g., P, K, Cl), and iron-group elements (e.g., Mn, Ni). We study the role of CCSNe in the production of these elements. We compare the galactic chemical evolution model based on the nucleosynthesis yield of the new massive stars and other yield tables from the literature. For each supernova yield, we perform parameter surveys and search for configurations that produce the best-fit model and best-rate model using the Perseus Cluster as the reference. From the survey, we study how individual chemical elements affect the contributions of massive stars and Type Ia supernovae in the cosmic chemical enrichment

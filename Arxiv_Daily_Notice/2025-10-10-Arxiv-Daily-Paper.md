 - **Abstract**
 Terraforming Mars is an age old science fiction concept now worth revisiting through the lens of modern science and technology. This document serves as a summary of contemporary ideas about Mars terraforming, prepared for attendees of the 2025 Green Mars Workshop. It presents one illustrative story of how Mars might be transformed into a habitable world. The story is told in reverse, beginning with possible planetary endpoints and tracing backward to the steps required to reach them. Along the way, it highlights alternative approaches, critical unknowns and research priorities, and the near term applications and benefits of terraforming research for planetary science, climate engineering, and sustainable technologies on Earth.

 - **Abstract**
 How do habitable environments arise and evolve within the context of their planetary systems? This is one fundamental question, and it can be addressed partly by identifying how planets in habitable zones obtain water. Historically, astronomers considered that water was delivered to the Earth via dynamical shake-up by Jupiter, which took place during the formation and post-formation eras (e.g., $\lesssim 100$ Myr). This hypothesis has recently been challenged by a more dynamic view of planet formation; planet-forming materials move in protoplanetary disks via various physical processes such as pebble drift and planetary migration. \textit{Habitable Worlds Observatory} (HWO) will open a new window to address this important, but difficult question by discovering and characterizing Earth-like exoplanets around G-type stars. In this article, we consider two possible working hypotheses: (1) the abundance of water on planets in habitable zones has \textit{any} correlation with the presence of outer planets; and (2) the abundance of water on planets in habitable zones has \textit{no} correlation with the presence of outer planets. We discuss what physical parameters need to be measured to differentiate these two hypotheses and what observational capabilities are desired for HWO to reliably constrain these physical parameters.

          Magma ocean interactions can explain JWST observations of the sub-Neptune TOI-270 d

 - **Abstract**
 Sub-Neptunes with substantial atmospheres may possess magma oceans in contact with the overlying gas, with chemical interactions between the atmosphere and magma playing an important role in shaping atmospheric composition. Early JWST observations have found high abundances of carbon- and oxygen-bearing molecules in a number of sub-Neptune atmospheres, which may result from processes including accretion of icy material at formation or magma-atmosphere interactions. Previous work examining the effects of magma-atmosphere interactions on sub-Neptunes has mostly been limited to studying conditions at the atmosphere-mantle boundary, without considering implications for the upper atmosphere which is probed by spectroscopic observations. In this work, we present a modeling architecture to determine observable signatures of magma-atmosphere interactions. We combine an equilibrium chemistry code which models reactions between the core, mantle and atmosphere with a radiative-convective model that determines the composition and structure of the observable upper atmosphere. We examine how different conditions at the atmosphere-mantle boundary and different core and mantle compositions impact the upper atmospheric composition. We compare our models to JWST NIRISS+NIRSpec observations of the sub-Neptune TOI-270 d, finding that our models can provide a good fit to the observed transmission spectrum with little fine-tuning. This suggests that magma-atmosphere interactions may be sufficient to explain high abundances of molecules such as H$_2$O, CH$_4$ and CO$_2$ in sub-Neptune atmospheres, without additional accretion of icy material from the protoplanetary disk. Although other processes could lead to similar compositions, our work highlights the need to consider magma-atmosphere interactions when interpreting the observed atmospheric composition of a sub-Neptune.

          Control variates from Eulerian and Lagrangian perturbation theory: Application to the bispectrum

 - **Abstract**
 Control variates have seen recent interest as a powerful technique to reduce the variance of summary statistics measured from costly cosmological $N$-body simulations. Of particular interest are the class of control variates which are analytically calculable, such as the recently introduced 'Zeldovich control variates' for the power spectrum of matter and biased tracers. In this work we present the construction of perturbative control variates in Eulerian and Lagrangian perturbation theory, and adopt the matter bispectrum as a case study. Eulerian control variates are analytically tractable for all $n$-point functions, but we show that their correlation with the $N$-body $n$-point function decays at a rate proportional to the sum-of-squared wavenumbers, hampering their utility. We show that the Zeldovich approximation, while possessing an analytically calculable bispectrum, is less correlated at low-$k$ than its Eulerian counterpart. We introduce an alternative -- the 'shifted control variate' -- which can be constructed to have the correct tree-level $n$-point function, is Zeldovich-resummed, and in principle has an analytically tractable bispectrum. We find that applying this shifted control variate to the $z=0.5$ matter bispectrum is equivalent to averaging over $10^4$ simulations for the lowest-$k$ triangles considered. With a single $V=1({\rm Gpc}/h)^3$ $N$-body simulation, for a binning scheme with $N\approx 1400$ triangles from $k_{\rm min} = 0.04 h {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ to $k_{\rm \max} = 0.47 h {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$, we obtain sub-2% precision for every triangle configuration measured. This work enables the development of accurate bispectrum emulators -- a probe of cosmology well-suited to simulation-based modeling -- and lays the theoretical groundwork to extend control variates for the entire $n$-point hierarchy.

          Thin H$_2$-dominated Atmospheres as Signposts of Magmatic Outgassing on Tidally-Heated Terrestrial Exoplanets

 - **Abstract**
 H$_2$-dominated terrestrial exoplanets are highly accessible to atmospheric characterization via transmission spectroscopy, but such atmospheres are generally thought to be unstable to escape. Here, we propose that close-in, eccentric terrestrial exoplanets can sustain H$_2$-dominated atmospheres due to intense tidally-driven volcanic degassing. We develop an interior-atmosphere framework to assess whether volcanic outgassing can sustain \ch{H2}-dominated atmospheres over geologic timescales ($\geq$1 Gyr). We incorporate interior redox state, tidal heating, volatile inventory, and planetary parameters to compute outgassing fluxes and confront them with energy-limited hydrodynamic escape. We demonstrate that to sustain an H$_2$-dominated atmosphere, a terrestrial exoplanet must have a water-rich basal magma ocean and reduced melts, in addition to high eccentricity. We additionally demonstrate that detection of a specifically thin H$_2$-dominated atmosphere is a sign of current magmatic outgassing. We delineate an "outgassing zone" (OZ) most favorable to the existence of such planets, and identify the most observationally compelling targets. We propose combining precise mass-radius-eccentricity measurements with JWST constraints on atmospheric mean molecular mass $\mu$ to search for thin H$_2$-dominated atmospheres. Inversely, we argue that robust atmospheric non-detections on OZ exoplanets can constrain the planetary interior, including melt redox state, mantle melt fraction and volatile inventory, and tidal heat flux.

 - **Abstract**
 Compact symmetric objects (CSOs) are thought to be short-lived radio sources with two lobes of emission that are separated by less than a kpc in projection. However, studies of such systems at high redshift is challenging due to the limited resolution of present-day telescopes, and can be biased to the most luminous objects. Here we report imaging of a gravitationally lensed CSO at a redshift of 2.059 using very long baseline interferometry at 1.7 GHz. The data are imaged using Bayesian forward modelling deconvolution, which reveals a spectacularly extended and thin gravitational arc, and several resolved features within the lensed images. The surface brightness of the lensing-corrected source shows two mini-lobes separated by 642 pc in projection, with evidence of multiple hotspots that have brightness temperatures of 10^8.6 to 10^9.2 K, and a total luminosity density of 10^26.3 W / Hz. By combining the well-resolved radio source morphology with previous multi-wavelength studies, we conclude that this object is likely a CSO of type 2, and that the properties are consistent with the bow-shock model for compact radio sources. Our analysis highlights the importance of combining high quality data sets with sophisticated imaging and modelling algorithms for studying the high redshift Universe.

          Study of HI Turbulence in the SMC Using Multi-point Structure Functions

 - **Abstract**
 Turbulence in the interstellar medium (ISM) plays an important role in many physical processes, including forming stars and shaping complex ISM structures. In this work, we investigate the HI turbulent properties of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) to reveal what physical mechanisms drive the turbulence and at what scales. Using the high-resolution HI data of the Galactic ASKAP (GASKAP) survey and multi-point structure functions (SF), we perform a statistical analysis of HI turbulence in 34 subregions of the SMC. Two-point SFs tend to show a linear trend, and their slope values are relatively uniform across the SMC, suggesting that large-scale structures exist and are dominant in the two-point SFs. On the other hand, seven-point SF enables us to probe small-scale turbulence by removing large-scale fluctuations, which is difficult to achieve with the two-point SFs. In the seven-point SFs, we find break features at scales of 34-84 pc, with a median scale of $\sim$50 pc. This result indicates the presence of small-scale turbulent fluctuations in the SMC and quantifies its scale. In addition, we find strong correlations between slope values of the seven-point SFs and the stellar feedback-related quantities (e.g., H$\alpha$ intensities, the number of young stellar objects, and the number of HI shells), suggesting that stellar feedback may affect the small-scale turbulent properties of the HI gas in the SMC. Lastly, estimated sonic Mach numbers across the SMC are subsonic, which is consistent with the fact that the HI gas of the SMC primarily consists of the warm neutral medium.

 - **Abstract**
 Neutrinos are produced during stellar evolution by means of thermal and thermonuclear processes. We model the cumulative neutrino flux expected at Earth from all stars in the Milky Way: the Galactic stellar neutrino flux (GS$\nu$F). We account for the star formation history of our Galaxy and reconstruct the spatial distribution of Galactic stars by means of a random sampling procedure based on Gaia Data Release 2. We use the stellar evolution code $\texttt{MESA}$ to compute the neutrino emission for a suite of stellar models with solar metallicity and zero-age-main-sequence mass between $0.08M_\odot$ and $100\ M_\odot$, from their pre-main sequence phase to their final fates. We then reconstruct the evolution of the neutrino spectral energy distribution for each stellar model in our suite. The GS$\nu$F lies between $\mathcal{O}(1)$ keV and $\mathcal{O}(10)$ MeV, with thermal (thermonuclear) processes responsible for shaping neutrino emission at energies smaller (larger) than $0.1$ MeV. Stars with mass larger than $\mathcal{O}(1\ M_\odot)$, located in the thin disk of the Galaxy, provide the largest contribution to the GS$\nu$F. Moreover, most of the GS$\nu$F originates from stars distant from Earth about $5-10$ kpc, implying that a large fraction of stellar neutrinos can reach us from the Galactic Center. Solar neutrinos and the diffuse supernova neutrino background have energies comparable to those of the GS$\nu$F, challenging the detection of the latter. However, directional information of solar neutrino and GS$\nu$F events, together with the annual modulation of the solar neutrino flux, could facilitate the GS$\nu$F detection; this will kick off a new era for low-energy neutrino astronomy, also providing a novel probe to discover New Physics.

          Is Liller 1 a building block of the Galactic bulge? - Evidence with APOGEE

 - **Abstract**
 Liller 1 is a stellar system orbiting within the inner 0.8kpc of the Galactic centre, characterised by a wide spread in age and metallicity, indicating a high mass. Liller 1 has been proposed to be a major contributor to the stellar mass of the Galactic bulge, yet its origin is subject to debate. We employ Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV (SDSS-IV) data from the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) to test scenarios proposed to explain the nature of Liller 1. Using a random sampling technique, we contrast the chemical compositions of Liller 1 stellar members with those of the bulge, inner disc, outer disk and solar neighbourhood. The chemistry of Liller 1 deviates from that of the bulge population at the 2-3$\sigma$ level for $\alpha$-elements Mg, Si, and Ca. We conclude that the progenitor of Liller 1 was not a major contributor of stellar mass to the bulge. Furthermore, we find the abundance pattern of Liller 1 to deviate at the 2$\sigma$ level from that of inner disk stars, ruling out the cluster rejuvenation scenario. Finally, we find that Liller 1 is chemically distinct from solar and outer disc populations, suggesting that the progenitor of Liller 1 is unlikely to be an in-situ massive clump formed at high redshift, from disc gravitational instabilities, that migrated inwards and coalesced with others into the bulge. Finally, we suggest that Liller 1 is a minor contributor to the stellar mass of the inner Galaxy, possibly of extragalactic origin.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of density variations in stellar streams are a promising probe of low-mass dark matter substructure in the Milky Way. However, survey systematics such as variations in seeing and sky brightness can also induce artificial fluctuations in the observed densities of known stellar streams. These variations arise because survey conditions affect both object detection and star-galaxy misclassification rates. To mitigate these effects, we use Balrog synthetic source injections in the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Y3 data to calculate detection rate variations and classification rates as functions of survey properties. We show that these rates are nearly separable with respect to survey properties and can be estimated with sufficient statistics from the synthetic catalogs. Applying these corrections reduces the standard deviation of relative detection rates across the DES footprint by a factor of five, and our corrections significantly change the inferred linear density of the Phoenix stream when including faint objects. Additionally, for artificial streams with DES like survey properties we are able to recover density power spectra with reduced bias. We also find that uncorrected power-spectrum results for LSST-like data can be around five times more biased, highlighting the need for such corrections in future ground based surveys.

          Bar pattern speed modulation across LMC stellar populations

 - **Abstract**
 The bar pattern speed of the LMC has been measured using Gaia data, suggesting the presence of a slow pattern, perhaps not rotating at all. Numerical simulations of interacting LMC-SMC systems were able to reproduce a bar stoppage. Here, we report on the first measurement of the bar pattern speed of the LMC as a function of the evolutionary phase of its stellar populations. Astrometric and photometric data of 11 million LMC stars from Gaia DR3 were used to build five evolutionary phases, from less to more evolved stars. The Dehnen method, a new procedure to derive bar pattern speeds from kinematics of particles in N-body simulations, is applied to the LMC stellar populations. We observe a modulation of the bar pattern speed with the evolutionary phase, meaning that different LMC stellar populations exhibit different pattern speeds, ranging from -0.9 to 6.6 km/s/kpc. Moreover, less evolved stars have a lower pattern speed while the bar of more evolved phases tends to rotate faster. The LMC bar is thus extremely slow, ruling out the presence of bar corotation within the disc, in agreement with a previous claim, but this time observed with various stellar populations. It is the first time that a pattern speed is measured separately for different stellar populations in any galaxy. The LMC pattern speed cannot be simply resumed to a singular value, but instead is an overlay of different patterns depending on the evolutionary phase of the stars. Future Gaia releases will be crucial to investigate more deeply the relations of the pattern speed with important astrophysical parameters of stars, like their age and metallicity, which will be helpful to constrain the chemo-dynamical evolution of the LMC bar.

          Good things always come in 3s: trimodality in the binary black-hole chirp-mass distribution supports bimodal black-hole formation

 - **Abstract**
 The latest GWTC-4 release from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) collaboration nearly doubles the known population of double compact object mergers and reveals a new trimodal structure in the chirp-mass distribution of merging binary black holes (BBHs) below 30 Msun. Recent detailed stellar evolution models show that features in the pre-collapse cores of massive stars produce a bimodal black hole (BH) mass distribution, which naturally extends to a trimodal BBH chirp-mass distribution. Both distributions depend only weakly on metallicity, implying universal structural features which can be tested with LVK observations. Using a new compact-remnant mass prescription derived from these models, we perform rapid population synthesis simulations to test the robustness of the predicted chirp-mass structure against uncertainties in binary evolution and cosmic star formation history, and compare these results with the current observational data. The trimodal chirp-mass distribution emerges as a robust outcome of the new remnant-mass model, persisting across variations in binary and cosmic physics. In contrast, traditional BH formation models lacking a bimodal BH mass spectrum fail to reproduce the observed trimodality. The updated models also predict lower BBH merger rates by a factor of a few, in closer agreement with LVK constraints. Intriguingly, the central chirp-mass peak, dominated by unequal-mass BBHs, originates from a previously underappreciated formation pathway in which strong luminous blue variable winds suppress binary interaction before the first BH forms. If isolated binary evolution dominates BBH formation below 30 Msun, the relative heights of the three chirp-mass peaks offer powerful observational constraints on core collapse, BH formation, binary evolution, and cosmic star formation. These universal structural features may also serve as standard sirens for precision cosmology.

          Composition of planetary debris around the white dwarf GD 362

 - **Abstract**
 White dwarf stars with high abundances of heavy elements in their atmospheres and infrared excesses are believed to be accreting planetary material. GD 362 is one of the most heavily polluted white dwarfs and has an exceptionally strong mid-infrared excess, reprocessing 2.4% of the star's light into the mid-infrared. We present a high signal-to-noise, medium-resolution spectrum of GD 362 obtained with JWST, covering 0.6 to 17 microns, along with photometry out to 25.5 microns. The mid-infrared spectrum is dominated by an exceptionally strong 9 to 11 micron silicate feature, which can be explained by a combination of olivine and pyroxene silicate minerals. Grains such as carbon, hotter than silicates, are required to explain the near-infrared emission. The silicates and carbon reside in a disk from 140 to 1400 stellar radii, and the disk scale height is greater than half the stellar radius. The elemental abundances of the solid material, relative to Si, are within a factor of 2 of meteoritic (CI chondrites) for C, O, Mg, Al, and Fe, with Al elevated and O slightly depleted. A similar pattern is observed for the abundances of accreted material in the stellar photosphere. Hydrogen is an exception, because no significant H-bearing minerals or water were detected in the disk, despite a large H abundance in the photosphere.

 - **Abstract**
 X-ray binary accretion disk winds can carry away a significant fraction of the originally infalling matter and hence strongly affect the accretion flow and the long-term evolution of the binary system. However, accurate measurements of their mass outflow rates are challenging due to uncertainties in our understanding of the 3D wind structure. Most studies employ absorption line spectroscopy that only gives us a single sightline through the wind streamlines. Hercules X-1 is a peculiar X-ray binary which allows us to avoid this issue, as its warped, precessing accretion disk naturally presents a range of sightlines through the vertical structure of its disk wind. Here we present the first results from a large, coordinated campaign on Her X-1 led by the new XRISM observatory and supported by XMM-Newton, NuSTAR and Chandra. We perform a time-resolved analysis and constrain the properties of the wind vertical structure. Thanks to the precision spectroscopy of XRISM/Resolve, we directly detect the Her X-1 orbital motion in the evolution of the outflow velocity. After correcting for this effect, we observe an increase in velocity from 250 km/s to 600 km/s as the wind rises to greater heights above the disk. The wind column density decreases with height, as expected, but its ionization parameter only evolves weakly, and is consistent with freezing out as the wind expands away. Additionally, we detect a new orbital dependence of the wind properties, revealing a likely second wind component that appears only briefly after the eclipse of Her X-1 by the secondary star.

          Classification for 969 double-mode RR Lyrae stars from Zwicky Transient Facility

 - **Abstract**
 RR Lyrae (RRL) variable stars are cornerstone distance indicators. In particular, double-mode RR Lyrae (RRd) stars enable period--luminosity relations (PLRs) that are less sensitive to metallicity, reducing systematic biases in distance measurements. However, their utility has been limited by a global sample of only $\sim$3,000 objects. We develop an automated RRd-screening pipeline and apply it to a cross-matched sample between the Gaia DR3 RRL catalog and ZTF DR22 time-series photometry. The workflow combines Lomb--Scargle period searches, iterative pre-whitening, period-ratio constraints that suppress $\sim$1-day sampling aliases, and amplitude-based quality cuts, enabling large-scale RRd star screening. We produce two ZTF-based catalogs: (i) 39,322 reliable single-mode RRL (40.5\% of the cross-matched set) and (ii) 969 RRd stars. Among the RRd stars, 614 objects are newly identified, substantially enlarging this previously scarce sample; the catalog achieves an estimated completeness of 47.7\%. The PLR derived from the newly discovered RRd stars agrees with the LMC-based relation, though with larger uncertainties. Incorporating these stars will help tighten the RRd PLR and improve distance measurements. Looking ahead, systematic RRd searches with upcoming surveys such as the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) and the China Space Station Telescope (CSST) should further extend high-accuracy distances across the Local Group and strengthen their cosmological applications.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive photometric and spectroscopic analysis of the Algol-type binary \textit{Gaia} DR3 1892576067672499328. We identified the system as a spectroscopic binary based on medium-resolution LAMOST spectra. Combined with \textit{TESS} photometry, we determine an orbital period of \( P = 2.47757 (1) \) days, a low mass ratio of \( q = 0.098 \pm 0.002 \), and an orbital inclination of \( i = 46.934^{+2.613}_{-1.11} \) degrees. The orbit is consistent with being circular (\( e = 0 \)). The binary comprises a \( M_1 = 1.817 ^{ +0.106}_{-0.202} \,M_\odot \), \( R_1 = 1.265^{+0.121}_{-0.160}\,R_\odot \) A-type primary and a Roche-lobe-filling secondary of \( M_2 = 0.179 ^{ +0.011}_{-0.020} \,M_\odot \), \( R_2 = 1.994 ^{ +0.041}_{-0.077} \,R_\odot \). The double-peak H$\alpha$ emission line indicates the possible existence of a Keplerian accretion disc. We established a simple standard accretion disc model and modeled the geometric and dynamical properties of the accretion disc. The obtained outer disc radius $R_{\mathrm{out}} \approx 3.36 \pm 0.43\,R_\odot$ is consistent with the values inferred from the emission velocity of H$\alpha$. Systemic velocity variations observed over time suggest the possible presence of a tertiary companion, with a minimum mass of $M_3 > 0.369 \pm 0.024 \,M_\odot$. Given the low mass ratio, the secondary may evolve into a proto-helium white dwarf, forming an \text{EL CVn}-type system in the future.

 - **Abstract**
 X-ray emission is generally believed to be one of the major heating sources for the optical modulation in redback pulsar binaries as we have seen similar phenomena in many low mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs). While, e.g., MeV/GeV gamma-rays from the neutron stars are also possible heating sources, X-ray observations are currently much more sensitive, and therefore, joint optical--X-ray data are observationally unique on the irradiation mechanism investigation. Using 18 X-ray/B-band simultaneous XMM-Newton observations (717 ks in total) of the redback system PSR J1023+0038 taken during the LMXB state, we find a general trend that the amplitude of the B-band orbital modulation was lower when the observed X-ray flux was higher. Depending on the analysis method adopted, the statistical significance of the anti-correlation can be from 1.7sigma to 3.1sigma. We also extended the analysis to the GeV gamma-ray band using the Fermi-LAT data, but the result is insignificant to claim any relations. Moreover, another X-ray/optical correlation regarding the low modes of the system was found in some of the \textit{XMM-Newton} observations, and the astrophysical reason behind is currently unclear yet. These anti-correlations likely suggest that the irradiation is generally stronger when the X-ray flux is in a fainter state, indicating that there is a more dominant irradiation source than the X-ray emission.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational lensing is one of the most powerful probes of dark matter, yet creating high-fidelity lensed images at scale remains a bottleneck. Existing tools rely on ray-tracing or forward-modeling pipelines that, while precise, are prohibitively slow. We introduce FlowLensing, a Diffusion Transformer-based compact and efficient flow-matching model for strong gravitational lensing simulation. FlowLensing operates in both discrete and continuous regimes, handling classes such as different dark matter models as well as continuous model parameters ensuring physical consistency. By enabling scalable simulations, our model can advance dark matter studies, specifically for probing dark matter substructure in cosmological surveys. We find that our model achieves a speedup of over 200$\times$ compared to classical simulators for intensive dark matter models, with high fidelity and low inference latency. FlowLensing enables rapid, scalable, and physically consistent image synthesis, offering a practical alternative to traditional forward-modeling pipelines.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we construct foreground-marginalised versions of the SPT-3G D1 and SPTpol cosmic microwave background (CMB) B-mode polarisation likelihoods. The compression is performed using the CMB-lite framework and we use the resulting data sets to constrain anisotropic cosmic birefringence, parametrised by the amplitude of a scale-invariant anisotropic birefringence spectrum, $A_{\rm CB}$. Using the new SPT-3G data we report a $95\%$ upper limit on $A_{\rm CB}$ of $ 1.2\times 10^{-4}$, which tightens to $0.53\times 10^{-4}$ when imposing a prior on the amplitude of gravitational lensing based on CMB lensing reconstruction analyses. These are the tightest constraints on anisotropic birefringence from BB power spectrum measurements to-date, demonstrating the constraining power of the South Pole Telescope.

          From gas to ice giants: A unified mechanism for equatorial jets

 - **Abstract**
 The equatorial jets dominating the dynamics of the Jovian planets exhibit two distinct types of zonal flows: strongly eastward in the gas giants (superrotation) and strongly westward in the ice giants (subrotation). Existing theories propose different mechanisms for these patterns, but no single mechanism has successfully explained both. However, the planetary parameters of the four Solar System giant planets suggest that a fundamentally different mechanism is unlikely. In this study, we show that convection-driven columnar structures can account for both eastward and westward equatorial jets, framing the phenomenon as a bifurcation. Consequently, both superrotation and subrotation emerge as stable branches of the same mechanistic solution. Our analysis of these solutions uncovers similarities in the properties of equatorial waves and the leading-order momentum balance. This study suggests that the fundamental dynamics governing equatorial jet formation may be more broadly applicable across the Jovian planets than previously believed, offering a unified explanation for their two distinct zonal wind patterns.

 - **Abstract**
 Methanol is a seed species of complex organic molecules that is of fundamental importance in astrochemistry. Although various isotopologues of CH$_3$OH have been detected in the interstellar medium (ISM), CH$_{3}$$^{17}$OH is only tentatively detected in Sgr~B2. To confirm the presence of CH$_{3}$$^{17}$OH in the ISM and to investigate its abundance, we search for its emission lines in the Orion~KL region. We have obtained image cubes covering the frequency ranges 236.40~GHz-236.65~GHz and 231.68~GHz-231.88~GHz using ALMA archival data observed toward the Orion~KL region. The column densities of CH$_3$$^{17}$OH and CH$_3$$^{18}$OH are estimated under the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium condition with fixed excitation temperatures at the two CH$_3$$^{18}$OH peaks, MeOH1 and MeOH2,. We have identified six emission lines of CH$_{3}$$^{17}$OH in MeOH1 and MeOH2 and confirmed that the line profiles and spatial distributions are consistent with those of CH$_3$$^{18}$OH. The abundance ratios of CH$_3$$^{18}$OH/CH$_3$$^{17}$OH are evaluated to be $\sim 3.4-3.5$ and are similar to the canonical value of $^{18}$O/$^{17}$O $\sim 3-4$ derived from CO observations in the Orion~KL region. We have compared the results with the previous study of CH$_3$OH and evaluated CH$_3$$^{16}$OH/CH$_3$$^{17}$OH ratios to be $\sim 2300-2500$ at a resolution of $\sim 4$~arcsec. The ratios are close to the $^{16}$O/$^{17}$O ratio in the local ISM. This result indicates that the CH$_3$OH isotopologues can serve as new tracers of oxygen isotope ratios in star-forming regions because the opacity of CH$_3$OH can be evaluated using transition lines spanning a wide range of line intensities. Moreover, this method enables us to study the star-formation history of our Galaxy with the aid of the Galactic chemical evolution models.

 - **Abstract**
 On 29 March 2006, a total solar eclipse was observed in the Manavgat district of Antalya, Turkey. During the event, the solar corona was observed using an 8-inch mirrored telescope. White-light polarization observations were carried out at three distinct angles using a polarizing filter placed in front of the camera system. To calibrate the intensity of the roll film, photographs of the eclipse and the solar disk were taken with a traditional 35mm manual camera. Using the solar disk images obtained during the eclipse, an intensity calibration curve for the roll film was created. This curve was then used to calculate various physical properties of the solar corona, including intensity, degree of polarization, electron density, and mean temperature. The results of these calculations were compared with the corona models developed by \cite{VDH1950} and \cite{SK1970}, as well as with findings from other researchers. Except for the degree of polarization, the measured physical parameters closely match the values given in the literature.

 - **Abstract**
 Weak-line quasars (WLQs) are a subset of type 1 quasars with remarkably weak high-ionization broad emission lines but normal optical/UV continua. Using 371,091 quasars from SDSS DR16, we define WLQs by analyzing outliers in three relations: the L1350-CIV blueshift, the Baldwin effect, and the logL2500-alpha_ox. We find two CIV EW thresholds: $8.9\pm0.2$Å and $19.3\pm0.3$Å. WLQs (EW(CIV)<$8.9\pm0.2$Å) have enhanced CIV blueshifts, deviate from the Baldwin effect, and include many X-ray weak objects (nearly half). Normal quasars (EW(CIV)>$19.3\pm0.3$Å) show typical properties, while bridge quasars (intermediate EW) are transitional. WLQs show a positive correlation between line attenuation and ionization energy: high-ionization lines (e.g., HeII, CIV) are suppressed by ~3-4{\sigma} compared to low-ionization lines (e.g., MgII, OI). This supports the shielding gas model, where a thick inner accretion disk obscures high-energy photons, suppressing high-ionization lines, while low-ionization lines are less affected. We suggest that WLQs and normal quasars correspond to slim and thin disk regimes, respectively, with bridge quasars as a transitional phase. This work provides a unified criterion for WLQs and highlights the role of accretion-driven shielding gas in their spectral features.

 - **Abstract**
 Radiative feedback from massive stars plays a central role in the evolution of molecular clouds and the interstellar medium. This paper presents a multi-wavelength analysis of the bright-rimmed cloud, BRC 44, which is located at the periphery of the Hii region Sh2-145 and is excited by the massive stars in the region. We use a combination of archival and newly obtained infrared data, along with new optical observations, to provide a census of young stellar objects (YSOs) in the region and to estimate stellar parameters such as age, mass etc. The spatial distribution of YSOs visible in the optical wavelength suggests that they are distributed in separate clumps compared to the embedded YSOs and are relatively older. Near-Infrared (NIR) spectroscopy of four YSOs in this region using the TANSPEC mounted on the 3.6m Devasthal Optical Telescope (DOT) confirms their youth. From Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) fitting, most of the embedded YSO candidates are in their early stage of evolution, with the majority of them in their Class II and some in Class I stage. The relative proper motions of the YSOs with respect to the ionizing source are indicative of the rocket effect in the BRC. The 12CO, 13CO, and C18O observations with the Purple Mountain Observatory are used to trace the distribution of molecular gas in the region. A comparison of the cold molecular gas distribution with simple analytical model calculations shows that the cloud is in the compression stage, and massive stars may be influencing the formation of young embedded stars in the BRC region due to radiative feedback.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational wave detectors are observing an increasing number of binary black hole (BBH) mergers, revealing a bimodal mass distribution of BBHs, which hints at diverse formation histories for these systems. Using the rapid binary population synthesis code MOBSE, we simulate a series of population synthesis models that include chemically homogeneous evolution (CHE). By considering metallicity-specific star formation and selection effects, we compare the intrinsic merger rates and detection rates of each model with observations. We find that the observed peaks in the mass distribution of merging BBHs at the low-mass end (10\msun) and the high-mass end (35\msun) are contributed by the common envelope channel or stable mass transfer channel (depending on the stability criteria for mass transfer) and the CHE channel, respectively, in our model. The merger rates and detection rates predicted by our model exhibit significant sensitivity to the choice of physical parameters. Different models predict merger rates ranging from 15.4 to $96.7\,\rm{Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}}$ at redshift $z$ = 0.2, and detection rates ranging from 22.2 to 148.3$\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$ under the assumption of a detectable redshift range of $z \le$ 1.0.

          How Internal Structure Shapes the Metallicity of Giant Exoplanets

 - **Abstract**
 The composition and internal structure of gas giant exoplanets encode key information about their formation and subsequent evolution. We investigate how different interior structure assumptions affect the inferred bulk metallicity and its correlation with planetary mass. For a sample of 44 giant exoplanets (0.12-5.98 MJ), we compute evolutionary models with CEPAM and retrieve their bulk metallicities under three structural hypotheses: Core+Envelope (CE), Dilute Core (DC), and Fully Mixed (FM). Across all structures, we recover a significant positive correlation between total heavy-element mass (M_Z) and planetary mass (M), and a negative correlation between metallicity (Z) and M (also for Z/Z_star vs. M). DC structures yield metallicities comparable to CE models, regardless of the assumed gradient extent. Increasing atmospheric metallicity raises the inferred bulk metallicity, as enhanced opacities slow planetary cooling. Non-adiabatic DC models can further increase the retrieved metallicity by up to 35%. Sensitivity analyses show that the mass-metallicity anti-correlation is primarily driven by low-mass, metal-rich planets, while massive planets exhibit unexpectedly high metallicities. Improved constraints on convective mixing, combined with upcoming precise measurements of planetary masses, radii, and atmospheric compositions from missions such as PLATO and Ariel, will enable more robust inferences of interior structures and formation pathways for gas giant planets.

 In this work, we present the program MOLLId (MOLecular Line Identification) for automated molecular lines approximation with gaussian profile. Molecular identification was performed using multi-level comparison of the lines' center frequencies and rest frequencies from the spectroscopic database. The program was tested using identification of the molecular lines in observational spectra of young stellar objects RCW 120 YSO S1 and RCW 120 YSO S2, located near the border of the RCW 120 PDR. In the spectra of the RCW 120 YSO S1 source, 100 lines of 41 molecules were identified over the level of 4-6 sigma. In the spectra of the RCW 120 YSO S2 source, 407 lines of 79 molecules were identified over the level 3-5 sigma. Using Intel Core i7-12700K CPU, identification time is equal to 6 and 8 minutes per spectral range for the YSOs S1 and S2, respectively. From the analysis of CH3OH, CH3CN, CH3CCH molecules identified in RCW 120 YSO S2 we found a two-component structure and estimated the physical parameters in the LTE approximation for each of the components.

 - **Abstract**
 We present and describe a new version of the spot oscillation and planet code, SOAPv4. Our aim is to demonstrate its capabilities in modeling stellar activity in the context of RV measurements and its effects on transmission spectra. To do this, we employed solar observations alongside synthetic spectra and compared the resulting simulations. We used SOAPv4 to simulate photospheric active regions and planetary transits for a Sun-like star hosting a hot Jupiter. By varying the input spectra, we investigated their impact on the resulting absorption spectra and compared the corresponding simulations. We then assessed how stellar activity deforms these absorption profiles. Finally, we explored the chromatic signatures of stellar activity across different wavelength ranges and discussed how such effects have been employed in the literature to confirm planet detections in radial-velocity measurements. We present the latest updates to SOAP, a tool developed to simulate active regions on the stellar disk while accounting for wavelength-dependent contrast. This functionality enables a detailed study of chromatic effects on radial-velocity measurements. In addition, SOAPv4 models planet-occulted line distortions and quantifies the influence of active regions on absorption spectra. Our simulations indicate that granulation can introduce line distortions that mimic planetary absorption features, potentially leading to misinterpretations of atmospheric dynamics. Furthermore, comparisons with ESPRESSO observations suggest that models incorporating non-local thermodynamic equilibrium effects provide an improved match to the absorption spectra of HD 209458 b, although they do not fully reproduce all observed distortions.

 - **Abstract**
 We present high-contrast direct spectroscopy of the low-mass, cool exoplanet 51 Eridani b (2-4 M$_\textrm{Jup}$, $\sim$750 K) using JWST / NIRSpec in a fixed-slit configuration (F290LP / G395H, $3-5\,\mu$m, R$\sim$2,700). A cross correlation analysis between the continuum-subtracted data and atmospheric forward models indicates a detection of molecular signals of planetary origin at $4.8\sigma$ at the expected position and velocity of the planet. The detection of the planetary signal is driven primarily by molecular features from methane and carbon monoxide, providing the first direct confirmation of these two molecules coexisting in chemical disequilibrium in the atmosphere of 51 Eridani b. A new comprehensive atmospheric model analysis shows consistency between the ground-based IFU spectroscopy and the NIRSpec data, with the best-fit model parameters: $T_\mathrm{eff}$ = 800$^{+21.5}_{-55.5}$ K, $\log g$ = 3.75$^{+0.09}_{-0.37}$, $[\mathrm{M}/\mathrm{H}]$ = 0.7$^{+0.07}_{-0.21}$, $\textrm{C}/\textrm{O}$ = 0.458$^{+0.08}_{-0.09}$, $\log K_\mathrm{zz}$ = 3$^{+0.47}_{-0.73}$, $R_\mathrm{P}$ = 1.36$^{+0.07}_{-0.03}$ $R_\mathrm{Jup}$, $f_\mathrm{hole}$ = 0.3$^{+0.10}_{-0.07}$, and the NIRSpec errorbar inflation parameter: $\hat{e}$ = 1.74$^{+0.02}_{-0.03}$. We conclude with a discussion on the lessons learned between the fixed slit and IFU-based high contrast spectroscopic methods from our observing program, including some possibilities to improve the analysis method.

 - **Abstract**
 Observational data play a pivotal role in identifying cosmological models that are both theoretically consistent and empirically viable. In this work, we investigate whether the standard $\Lambda$CDM model exhibits significant departure with current late time datasets, including Cosmic Chronometers, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations from DESI DR2, and various Type Ia supernova compilations (Pantheon$^+$, DES-SN5Y, Union3). We analyze several dynamical dark energy models, including $\omega$CDM, o$\omega$CDM, $\omega_0\omega_a$CDM, Logarithmic, Exponential, JBP, BA, and GEDE. While CC + DESI DR2 data show mild deviations from $\Lambda$CDM ($\lesssim 2\sigma$), adding supernova samples (DES-SN5Y or Union3) increases deviations, with BA, JBP, and Logarithmic models reaching $3-3.5\sigma$, and CC + DESI DR2 + DES-SN5Y producing the largest deviations. We find consistent evidence for $\omega_0 > -1$ and $\omega_a < 0$ in all dark energy models, indicating that the cosmological constant faces a potential crisis and that dynamical dark energy models could provide a possible solution, characterized by a Quintom-B type scenario. The $\Lambda$CDM model has long served as the cornerstone of modern cosmology, successfully shaping our understanding of the Universe from its earliest epochs to the present day. However, in light of DESI DR2 and other recent measurements, emerging cracks in this paradigm suggest that a complete understanding of the cosmos may require moving beyond the cosmological constant and exploring new physics governing the dark sector.

 We present Effelsberg 100-m telescope observations of the hyperactive repeating fast radio burst source FRB 20240110A, discovered by CHIME/FRB in January 2024. Using the Ultra BroadBand (UBB) receiver, spanning 1.3-6.0 GHz, we detected over 700 unique bursts across four observing epochs. A comprehensive analysis of their temporal and spectral properties reveals four distinct spectro-temporal morphologies, including simple, complex and frequency-drifting structures. No bursts were detected across the full UBB band, confirming the band-limited emission typical of repeating FRBs. We find modest frequency evolution in burst widths but constant fractional bandwidths, and strong variability in burst rates that may be influenced by scintillation. The waiting-time distributions indicate predominantly independent burst events, with occasional clustering suggesting a characteristic emission timescale of $\sim$10 ms. Additionally, this study presents a multi-frequency analysis of waiting-time distributions, offering new insights into the complex frequency drifts commonly observed in repeating FRBs. These broadband observations provide a detailed view of the frequency-dependent burst behavior of FRB 20240110A and offer insights into the variability and temporal structure of repeating FRB emission.

 - **Abstract**
 Classical Cepheids (CCs) in Galactic open clusters (OCs) provide essential observational constraints for calibrating the period-age relation (PAR) and the period-Wesenheit relation (PWR) of CCs. However, distant and long-period OC Cepheids remain limited, while the confirmed samples still require more precise determinations of their physical properties, such as ages and extinctions. In this work, we present a comprehensive census of OC Cepheids based on an extensive sample of distant OCs from Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3). By combining astrometric and photometric membership analyses, we identified 110 CCs associated with 102 OCs, of which 41 CCs across 37 OCs were classified as OC Cepheids, while the remaining cases were considered candidate or rejected associations. Our results are consistent with previous studies, while 4 of the 41 OC Cepheids are newly reported here. Using updated cluster parameters derived from manual isochrone fitting, we primarily refined the PAR to log Age = (-0.595 $\pm$ 0.044) log P + (8.430 $\pm$ 0.042) and recalibrated the PWR to WG = (-3.615 $\pm$ 0.083) log P + (-2.379 $\pm$ 0.096). This study expands the sample of confirmed and candidate OC Cepheids. The newly longest-period confirmed OC Cepheid is BM Per (CWNU 3123) with log P = 1.36, and two newly discovered OC Cepheid candidates have distances exceeding 6 kpc. Moreover, the PAR and PWR are improved by incorporating refined OC ages and updated parallaxes, respectively.

 - **Abstract**
 In the present work, we study a subclass of Horndeski gravity characterized by a non-minimal derivative coupling between a scalar field and the Einstein tensor, as a possible alternative to alleviate the observational tension associated with estimates of the Hubble constant $H_{0}$. Two scenarios within a flat FRW spacetime were considered. In the first case, the scalar field mimics cold dark matter, whereas in the second case, it acts as dark energy. We derive the dynamical equations and perform a statistical analysis using observational data of $H(z)$, obtaining constraints for the cosmological parameters. The results indicate that the model can effectively fit the cosmic expansion rate at late epochs, providing values of $H_{0}$ that are more compatible with local measurements. These results suggest that the non-minimal coupling sector in the Horndeski context constitutes a viable and promising approach to alleviate the $H_{0}$ tension and investigate scenarios beyond the standard cosmological model.

 - **Abstract**
 The Luminous Fast Blue Optical Transient (LFBOT) AT 2018cow is the prototype of its class with an extensive set of multi-wavelength observations. Despite a rich data set there is, still, no consensus about the physical nature and origin of this event. AT 2018cow remained UV bright 2-4 years after the explosion, which points at an additional energy injection source, most likely from an accretion disk. We present additional late time UV data obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope, to show there is no significant fading in the optical since the last epoch and only marginal fading in the UV. The new UV data points match the predictions of previously published accretion disk models, where the disk is assumed to form from the tidal disruption of a low mass star by an intermediate mass black hole. This consistency provides evidence that AT 2018cow could indeed be a tidal disruption event. The marginal decay is in contrast with the predictions of light curves produced by interacting supernovae. The difference between expectations for disc emission and interacting supernovae will further increase with time, making data at even later times a route to robustly rule out interaction between supernova ejecta and circumstellar material.

 - **Abstract**
 The radioactive decay of unstable nuclei created in the rapid neutron capture process release a large amount of $\gamma$-rays. When the ejecta is optically thick, these $\gamma$-rays may contribute to an associated kilonova. Once transparent, prominent spectral features will be directly observable in current and future $\gamma$-ray detectors. In this work, we study and compare the $\gamma$-ray spectra of a limited, weak, strong, and extended $r$-process across a broad timescale, identifying the nuclei which significantly contribute. We discuss these findings in the context of observability, noting that there are several practical challenges to connecting observed signatures to specific nuclei. However, if these challenges can be overcome, direct observation of $\gamma$-rays from $r$-process sites can provide insight into the fundamental physics underpinning the $r$-process.

 We construct a neural network to perform regression on the local dark-matter density field given line-of-sight peculiar velocities of dark-matter halos, biased tracers of the dark matter field. Our architecture combines a convolutional U-Net with a point-cloud DeepSets. This combination enables efficient use of small-scale information and improves reconstruction quality relative to a U-Net-only approach. Specifically, our hybrid network recovers both clustering amplitudes and phases better than the U-Net on small scales.

 - **Abstract**
 Super-thermal gas giant planets or their progenitor cores are known to open deep gaps in protoplanetary disks, which stop large, drifting dust particles on their way to the inner disk. The possible separation of the disk into distinct reservoirs and the resulting dust depletion interior to the gap have important implications for planetesimal formation and the chemical and isotopic composition of the inner regions of protoplanetary disks. Dust fragmentation, however, maintains a reservoir of small grains which can traverse the gap. Dust evolution models are thus instrumental for studies of a gap's filtration efficiency. We present 2D multifluid hydrodynamic simulations of planet-disk systems with dust coagulation and fragmentation. For the first time, we evolve a series of 2D simulation with dust coagulation over 45000 planetary orbits and track the dust's size evolution and origin by using the TriPoD dust coagulation method. We investigate the effects of different planetary masses, fragmentation velocities, and viscosities on the inner disk's dust mass budget and composition, and highlight the advantages of multi-dimensional simulations over 1D models. Filtering can only be efficient for high planetary masses, high fragmentation velocities, and low diffusivities. Clear compositional distinctions between the inner and outer disk could not have been maintained by Jupiter's core if the fragmentation velocity was low, even if $\alpha \lesssim 5 \times 10^{-4}$. Significant "contamination" of the inner disk by outer-disk dust occurs in much less than $2 \times 10^5$ yr in this case and even for more massive objects. This either places tight constraints on the physical conditions in the Solar nebula or mandates consideration of alternative explanations for the NC-CC dichotomy. Astrophysical constraints on the parameters could discriminate between these possibilities.

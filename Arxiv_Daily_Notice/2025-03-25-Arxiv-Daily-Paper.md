 - **Abstract**
 Accurate identification of solar radio bursts (SRBs) is essential for advancing research in solar physics and predicting space weather. However, the majority of current studies mainly concentrate on detecting whether SRBs are present or absent, often focusing on only one particular type of burst. Moreover, the neural network models used for SRB detection are typically complex, involving a large number of parameters, which results in slower processing speeds. This study establishes a dataset encompassing Type II, Type III, Type IIIs, Type IV, and Type V SRBs collected from e-CALLISTO, including 8,752 SRB spectrum images and achieving annotations for 10,822 SRBs. We propose a multi-category SRB detection model based on task-aligned one-stage object detection (TOOD). TOOD can solve the problem of inconsistent predictions in classification and localization tasks, and it improves the detection recall rate. This model aligns classification and localization tasks and optimizes the neck network by incorporating a channel attention mechanism. This model achieves higher recall and accuracy with fewer parameters. This model can accurately detect five types of SBRs. The experimental results show that the model achieved an accuracy of 79.9\% (AP50) and a recall rate of 95.1\% on the SBRs dataset. A higher recall rate than other models means fewer SRBs are missed in automatic detection. The model we propose has the potential to make a substantial impact on solar physics research and space weather studies. Additionally, the findings in this paper could provide valuable insights for processing other small-sample astronomical this http URL source code and data is available at this https URL.

 - **Abstract**
 The abundance and distribution of sulfur-bearing molecules in protoplanetary disks directly influences the composition and potential habitability of nascent planets in addition to providing powerful probes of the physical gas conditions in the disks themselves. Here, we present new and archival ALMA and SMA observations of CS and H$_2$CS, and their C$^{34}$S and H$_2$C$^{34}$S isotopologues, at high-angular resolution (${\approx}$0."2-0."4; 20-40 au) in the HD 163296 disk, which reveal a central cavity and multi-ringed emission structure. These observations comprise the most comprehensive, multi-line CS data in a planet-forming disk to date, spanning a wide range of excitation conditions from E$_{\rm{u}}$=7.1 K to 129.3 K, and include new detections of C$^{34}$S, H$_2$CS, and H$_2$C$^{34}$S in this system. Using these data, we derive spatially-resolved rotational temperature and column density profiles for all species. We find a column density ratio N(H$_2$CS)/N(CS) $\approx$ 0.5, which is comparable to that of the similar MWC 480 disk and suggests that organic sulfur compounds may constitute a large fraction of the volatile sulfur reservoir in disks around Herbig stars generally. We derive $^{32}$S/$^{34}$S ratios of ${\approx}$5 (CS/C$^{34}$S) and ${\approx}$2 (H$_2$CS/H$_2$C$^{34}$S) based on disk-averaged and spatially-resolved analyses. Both values are consistent across these two pairs of optically-thin molecules and are well-below the expected ISM ratio of ${\approx}$22, suggesting significant sulfur fractionation. We also constrain the CS emitting layer ($z/r\lesssim 0.1$) using the vertical separations of the disk surfaces in the channel maps and based on the known 2D gas structure of the HD 163296 disk combined with our excitation analysis.

          Limits on the atmospheric metallicity and aerosols of the sub-Neptune GJ 3090 b from high-resolution CRIRES+ spectroscopy

 - **Abstract**
 The sub-Neptune planets have no solar system analogues, and their low bulk densities suggest thick atmospheres containing degenerate quantities of volatiles and H/He, surrounding cores of unknown sizes. Measurements of their atmospheric composition can help break these degeneracies, but many previous studies at low spectral resolution have largely been hindered by clouds or hazes, returning muted spectra. Here, we present the first comprehensive study of a short-period sub-Neptune using ground-based, high-resolution spectroscopy, which is sensitive to the cores of spectral lines that can extend above potential high altitude aerosol layers. We observe four CRIRES+ $\textit{K}$-band transits of the warm sub-Neptune GJ 3090 b (T$_{\text{eq}}$ = 693$\pm$18 K) which orbits an M2V host star. Despite the high quality data and sensitivity to CH$_4$, H$_2$O, NH$_3$, and H$_2$S, we detect no molecular species. Injection-recovery tests are consistent with two degenerate scenarios. First, GJ 3090 b may host a highly metal-enriched atmosphere with $>\,$150 Z$_{\odot}$ and mean molecular weight $>\,$7.1 g mol$^{-1}$, representing a volatile dominated envelope with a H/He mass fraction $x_{\text{H/He}} < 33\%$, and an unconstrained aerosol layer. Second, the data are consistent with a high altitude cloud or haze layer at pressures $<\,$3.3$\times$10$^{-5}~$bar, for any metallicity. GJ 3090 b joins the growing evidence to suggest that high metallicity atmospheres and high altitude aerosol layers are common within the warm (500$~<T_{\text{eq}}<~$800 K) sub-Neptune population. We discuss the observational challenges posed by the M-dwarf host star, and suggest observing strategies for transmission spectroscopy of challenging targets around M-dwarfs for existing and ELT instrumentation.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first study dedicated to measuring the timescales for black hole accretion and jet launch in a quasar at the edge of Reionization, PSO J352.4034-15.3373 at z = 5.832 $\pm$ 0.001. Previous work presented evidence of the strong radio synchrotron emission from the jet affecting the host galaxy dust-dominated continuum emission at $\nu_{\rm rest}=683$ GHz ($\nu_{\rm obs}=100$ GHz), implying a break in the synchrotron spectrum. In this work, we present quasi-simultaneous observations at 1.5\, GHz - 42\,GHz with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA), and derive a frequency break at $\nu^{\rm break}_{\rm rest} = 196.46$ GHz ($\nu^{\rm break}_{\rm obs} = 28.76$ GHz). Modeling these observations, we calculate the jet spectral aging from the cooling of electrons to be $t_{\mathrm{spec}}\sim 580$ yr. From this measurement, we approximate the dynamical age $t_{\mathrm{dyn}}$ to be $\sim2,000$ yr, implying a recent jet ejection. We compare the jet timescale to the quasar's lifetime ($t_{\mathrm{Q}}$) that indicates the duration of the latest black hole accretion event and is derived from the proximity zone size in the rest-UV/optical spectrum. However, a ghostly Damped Ly$\alpha$ (DLA) system affects this measurement yielding an upper limit of $t_{\mathrm{Q}} \lesssim 10^4$ yr, consistent with the jet lifetime and indicative of a young quasar. This suggests that the triggering of a UV-bright quasar phase may occur within comparable timescales as the launch of a relativistic radio jet. Therefore, we may be witnessing an early stage of black hole and jet interactions in a quasar during the first gigayear of the universe.

          Unravelling the dynamics of cosmic vortices: Probing a Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in the jet of 3C 84

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the creation of relativistic jets originating from active galactic nuclei, require a thorough understanding of the accompanying plasma instabilities. Our high sensitivity, high resolution, global very long baseline interferometry observations of the jet in the radio galaxy 3C 84 enable us to study its inner morphology, which resembles a thread-like pattern. We find that this pattern can be described by a Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, consisting of four instability modes. Our model favours a jet described by a Mach number of $M_\textrm{j} = 5.0\pm1.7$ and a sound speed of $\alpha_\textrm{j} = 0.14\pm0.06$. With it, we are able to describe the internal structure of 3C 84 and to tentatively connect the origin of the instability to accretion disc activity.

 - **Abstract**
 Pyramid wavefront sensors (PWFSs) are the preferred choice for current and future extreme adaptive optics (XAO) systems. Almost all instruments use the PWFS in its modulated form to mitigate its limited linearity range. However, this modulation comes at the cost of a reduction in sensitivity, a blindness to petal-piston modes, and a limit to the sensor's ability to operate at high speeds. Therefore, there is strong interest to use the PWFS without modulation, which can be enabled with nonlinear reconstructors. Here, we present the first on-sky demonstration of XAO with an unmodulated PWFS using a nonlinear reconstructor based on convolutional neural networks. We discuss the real-time implementation on the Magellan Adaptive Optics eXtreme (MagAO-X) instrument using the optimized TensorRT framework and show that inference is fast enough to run the control loop at >2 kHz frequencies. Our on-sky results demonstrate a successful closed-loop operation using a model calibrated with internal source data that delivers stable and robust correction under varying conditions. Performance analysis reveals that our smart PWFS achieves nearly the same Strehl ratio as the highly optimized modulated PWFS under favorable conditions on bright stars. Notably, we observe an improvement in performance on a fainter star under the influence of strong winds. These findings confirm the feasibility of using the PWFS in its unmodulated form and highlight its potential for next-generation instruments. Future efforts will focus on achieving even higher control loop frequencies (>3 kHz), optimizing the calibration procedures, and testing its performance on fainter stars, where more gain is expected for the unmodulated PWFS compared to its modulated counterpart.

 - **Abstract**
 Over the past decades, observational evidence of circumstellar disks around massive protostars has been steadily accumulating. However, there have also been cases of non-detections in high-mass star-forming regions, leaving the role and prevalence of disks around massive protostars still uncertain. We used high-resolution (0.2") NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA) observations to study the 1.3 mm continuum and molecular line emission of five massive dense cores in the Cygnus-X cloud complex. Four cores host 2000-au-scale rotating structures previously identified as disk candidates in lower-resolution SMA observations, while the remaining core with no evidence for a disk serves as a comparison. With a resolution of 300 au, the 1.3 mm continuum emission reveals varying levels of fragmentation in our sample, with fragment radii ranging from 150 to 800 AU. In this work, we confirm the existence of two small, stable disks in Keplerian-like rotation at scales of 500 au out of four previously identified disk candidates from the SMA observations at coarser resolution. The lack of evidence for Keplerian disks in other disk candidates identified from the SMA data suggests that rotational signatures observed at 2000 au scales do not necessarily imply the presence of Keplerian disks at smaller scales. Therefore, higher-resolution and higher-sensitivity observations are essential to definitively identify Keplerian disks on smaller scales.

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce NEIDSpecMatch, a tool developed to extract stellar parameters from spectra obtained with the NEID spectrograph. NEIDSpecMatch is based on SpecMatch-Emp and HPFSpecMatch, which estimate stellar parameters by comparing the observed spectrum to well-characterized library spectra. This approach has proven effective for M dwarfs. Utilizing a library of 78 stellar spectra covering effective temperatures from $3000-6000$ K, NEIDSpecMatch derives key parameters, including effective temperature, metallicity, surface gravity, and projected rotational velocity. Cross-validation shows median uncertainties of $\sigma_{T_{\mathrm{eff}}} = 115\,\mathrm{K}$, $\sigma_{[\mathrm{Fe/H}]} = 0.143$, and $\sigma_{\log g} = 0.073$ across 49 orders. We showcase its application by fitting the spectrum of an M-dwarf and discuss its utility across a wide range of spectra observed with NEID. NEIDSpecMatch is pip-installable.

          Testing the bloated star hypothesis in the massive young stellar object IRAS 19520+2759 through optical and infrared variability

 - **Abstract**
 Using optical time series with Telescopi Joan Oró (TJO), Gaia, TESS, and NEOWISE archival data, we performed a variability study on the candidate bloated massive young stellar object (MYSO) IRAS 19520+2759. This is the first time that a bloated star candidate has been tested for the theoretically predicted periodic variability. The source is found to be variable at optical and mid-infrared wavelengths and classified as a long-period variable MYSO. The observed TJO data gives a period of the source of $\sim$ 270$\pm$40 days (in the Rc band) and $\sim$ 270$\pm$50 days (in the Ic band), which is very close to the value predicted by the theoretical Period-Luminosity relation for a bloated young star of $\sim 10^5 L\odot$. Additionally, a large period of $\sim$ 460$\pm$80 days (in the G band) and $\sim$ 440$\pm$70 (in the Rp band) is also visible in the Gaia light curve. The physical parameters of the source, such as mass, radius, and accretion rate, based on the theoretical predictions for the spherical accretion case and corresponding to a period of 270--460 days, are $\sim 24$--28$\,M\odot$, $\sim 650$--900$\,R\odot$ and $\sim (6$--$9)\times10^{-3}\,M\odot yr^{-1}$. However, these numbers are very sensitive to the effective temperatures assumed in the models. Additionally, these values strongly depend on the geometry of accretion and could significantly decrease for the case of a MYSO accreting through a disc. The observed periodic variability, the observed colour trend, and the nature of the variability are found to be consistent with the pulsational model for a bloated MYSO.

 - **Abstract**
 The mass window of ultralight axion dark matter motivated by suppressing the growth of structure on subgalactic scales, $m\sim 10^{-22}\,\mathrm{eV}$, is now severely constrained by various observation data (e.g. Lyman-$\alpha$ forest). As an attempt to reopen this mass window, we investigate an alternative ultralight dark matter candidate, the complex scalar field dark matter (SFDM). We derive the relativistic hydrodynamics of the complex SFDM in the framework of cosmological perturbation theory. Our formalism contains two novel ingredients uniquely associated with the complex SFDM model: the Eckart frame defined by the conserved Noether current, and the stiff gauge condition, $c_s^2\equiv (\delta P/\delta\rho)|_s=1$. In the Eckart frame, the complex SFDM is effectively an imperfect fluid with a dissipative energy flux, distinguishing itself from axion dark matter. The energy flux can affect the growth of density fluctuations dynamically. Meanwhile, we apply the stiff gauge condition to find new constitutive equations for the complex SFDM. We revisit the homogeneous evolution of the complex SFDM and present illustrative early-stage solutions for perturbations of the complex SFDM in a simplified setting. We demonstrate the effects of varying the model parameters on the evolution of the perturbation variables.

 - **Abstract**
 Following a recent detection of TeV radiation by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) and the High-Altitude Water Cherenkov Observatory (HAWC), coincident with the direction of the microquasar V4641 Sgr, we search for possible GeV emission from this source. We explored the morphology and temporal features of the source as well as two nearby unassociated point sources which could be a part of extended structure of V4641 Sgr, and compared results with corresponding X-ray and TeV emissions. The 95% confidence level upper limits for the flux from the source, assuming both point and extended source models were 5.38$\times$ 10$^{-13}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ and 1.12$\times$ 10$^{-12}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, respectively. Additionally, no correlation between gamma-ray light curve and X-ray outbursts was observed.

 - **Abstract**
 We conducted an analysis of the continuum during the onset and initial decline phases of the 2023 outburst in transient neutron star low-mass X-ray binary Aql X$-$1 using broadband observations from the \textit{Insight-Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope (Insight-HXMT)} instrument. To determine the most appropriate model for the continuum of this outburst, we employed three models to explore the evolution of the spectral component. These observations revealed that the source transitions from the hard state to the soft state. The disk-corona and sphere-corona models both adequately described the spectra of the hard state, while the double blackbody model became preferable after the hard X-ray emission ($>$25 keV) disappeared during the state transition. In the soft state, the total emission is dominated by changes in the disk and other blackbody components. The combination of the sphere-corona model and the double blackbody model is the most suitable model for this outburst. The results suggest that as the source transitioned into the soft state, the emission from the boundary layer was enhanced, and a hot spot occurred. Notably, we identified two type-I X-ray bursts, one of which exhibited a significant hard X-ray deficit (significance $\sim$ 4.82 $\sigma$), which indicates that \textit{Insight-HXMT} has the capability to capture the evolution of the corona in a single burst.

          Investigation of X-ray emission from the unidentified TeV gamma-ray source HESS J1832-085 with Suzaku

 - **Abstract**
 Observations conducted with H.E.S.S. at high energies have led to the discovery of numerous gamma-ray sources in the Galactic plane at TeV energies. One of these sources, HESS J1832-085, has been suggested to be a pulsar wind nebula (PWN); however, its nature is not yet fully understood. In this work, we analyze Suzaku data to investigate the X-ray spectral properties of HESS J1832-085. We found that the X-ray spectra are highly absorbed and well-represented by a power-law model with a photon index of $\Gamma \sim 1.5$, and an unabsorbed X-ray flux of $F_{\rm X} \sim 0.3 \times 10^{-11}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ in the 2-10 keV energy band. The gamma-ray flux is approximately 66 times higher than the X-ray flux. Based on our X-ray analysis, we discuss the origin of the source HESS J1832-085. We propose that the PWN scenario is possible, although several issues still need to be resolved.

 - **Abstract**
 Historically, various methods have been employed to understand the origin of the elements, including observations of elemental abundances which have been compared to Galactic Chemical Evolution (GCE) models. It is also well known that 1D Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) measurements fail to accurately capture elemental abundances. Non-LTE (NLTE) effects may play a significant role, and neglecting them leads to erroneous implications in galaxy modelling. In this paper, we calculate 3D NLTE abundances of seven key iron-peak and neutron-capture elements (Mn, Co, Ni, Sr, Y, Ba, Eu) based on carefully assembled 1D LTE literature measurements, and investigate their impact within the context of the OMEGA+ GCE model. Our findings reveal that 3D NLTE abundances are significantly higher for iron-peak elements at [Fe/H]< -3, with (for the first time ever) [Ni/Fe] and (confirming previous studies) [Co/Fe] on average reaching 0.6-0.8 dex, and [Mn/Fe] reaching -0.1 dex, which current 1D core-collapse supernova (CCSN) models cannot explain. We also observe a slightly higher production of neutron-capture elements at low metallicities, with 3D NLTE abundances of Eu being higher by +0.2 dex at [Fe/H]= -3. 3D effects are most significant for iron-peak elements in the very metal-poor regime, with average differences between 3D NLTE and 1D NLTE {reaching} up to 0.15 dex. Thus, ignoring 3D NLTE effects introduces significant biases, so including {them} should be considered whenever possible.

 - **Abstract**
 Weak lensing galaxy surveys are currently undergoing a dramatic revolution as the dawn of the Stage-IV surveys are upon us. Hence, ensuring that our analysis methods are as accurate and precise as the raw data is of upmost importance. This motivated the development of a new implementation of the quadratic maximum likelihood power spectrum estimation technique, the application of the theoretical uncertainties approach to mitigate baryonic feedback biases, and to re-evaluating the criterion from which binary scale cuts are derived when aiming to eliminate baryonic biases. These techniques maximise the available information from weak lensing observations while minimising potential systematic biases, and shows how this PhD thesis contributes to the advancement of weak lensing cosmology.

          Observer motion and boosting effects on the cosmic background monopole spectrum, solutions and perspectives

 - **Abstract**
 The peculiar motion of an observer relative to an ideal reference frame at rest with respect to the cosmic background produces boosting effects which modify and transfer at higher multipoles the frequency spectrum of the isotropic background. To mitigate the computational effort needed for accurate theoretical predictions, analytical solutions of a linear system able to evaluate the spherical harmonic expansion coefficients for (analytical or semi-analytical) background representations have been presented, and extended to generic tabulated functions potentially affected by numerical uncertainties. Owing to the dipole spectrum frequency dependence and to precise inter-frequency calibrations, it will be possible to constrain (or even detect) the tiny imprints in the background spectrum from a variety of cosmological and astrophysical processes.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a detailed analysis of the low-mass detached eclipsing binary system BB Persei, which contains two K-type stars in a circular orbit with a short period of 0.4856 d. We used light curves from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, which observed BB Per in five sectors, to determine its photometric properties and a precise orbital ephemeris. The solution of the TESS light curve in Phoebe results in a detached configuration, where the temperature of the primary component was fixed to $T_1 = 5~300$ K according to Lamost, which gives us $T_2 = 5~050 \pm 50$ K for the secondary. The spectral type of the primary component was derived as K0 and the photometric mass ratio was estimated $q = 0.90$. Slow period changes on the current O-C diagram spanning the past 25 years indicate the presence of a third body orbiting the eclipsing pair with an orbital period of about 22 years. The companion could be a red dwarf of spectral type M6 - M7 with a minimal mass of about 0.1 M$_{\odot}$. The characteristics and temporal variation of the dark region on the surface of the secondary component were estimated.

 - **Abstract**
 Given that secular perturbations in a binary system not only excite high orbital eccentricities but also alter the planetary orbital inclination, the classical Keplerian orbital model is no longer applicable for orbital retrieval. The combination of a dynamical model and observational data is essential for characterizing the configuration and planetary mass in close binaries. We calculate the theoretical radial velocity (RV) signal in the N-body framework and observe a drift in the RV semi-amplitude, which leads to a reduction in the $m$sin$i$ detection threshold by 20 $M_{\oplus}$, with $\sim$ 100% detection probability in the $m_1$sin$i_1$-$a_1$ parameter space. High-precision RV data with an accuracy of 1 m/s can detect such dynamical effects. For four close-in binaries-GJ 86, GJ 3021, HD 196885, and HD 41004, the deviation between the minimum mass derived from the Keplerian and N-body models is found to be $> 0.2 ~ M_{\mathrm{Jup}}$. High-precision astrometric data are also necessary to resolve the 3D orbits and true masses exoplanets. We generate astrometric simulation data with accuracies corresponding to Gaia (57.8 $\mu$as) and the Closeby Habitable Exoplanet Survey (CHES) (1 $\mu$as), respectively. Joint orbit fitting is performed for RV + Gaia and RV + CHES synergy methods. Compared with the fitting results from the astrometry-only model, the synergy models more effectively constrain the range of orbital inclinations. Using simulation data, we derive precise uncertainties for the true planetary mass, which are critical for determining the evolution of planets around binary stars and multi-planet systems.

          An Energy-Angular Momentum Phase Function for Rubble Pile Asteroids

 - **Abstract**
 This work analyzes the energetics of asteroid rubble piles in order to understand what asteroid morphologies should naturally arise from their formation and evolution process. In doing this, a phase diagram is developed that maps out the range of final minimum energy states that a collapsing gravitational aggregate can achieve as a function of total angular momentum and mass distribution. This is developed assuming properties associated with rubble pile asteroids, and can provide insight into the formation and subsequent evolution of contact binaries and orbital binaries in the solar system as an outcome of catastrophic disruptions. The system angular momentum is used as an independent parameter, combined with resulting minimum energy configurations as a simple function of mass morphology of the final system. The configuration of systems with an energy boosted above the minimum energy state are also considered. This paper considers an ideal case, but outlines general results that can be continued for more precise models of distributed granular media modeled using continuum models or using discrete element models.

 - **Abstract**
 The search for exoplanets is an active field in astronomy, with direct imaging as one of the most challenging methods due to faint exoplanet signals buried within stronger residual starlight. Successful detection requires advanced image processing to separate the exoplanet signal from this nuisance component. This paper presents a novel statistical model that captures nuisance fluctuations using a multi-scale approach, leveraging problem symmetries and a joint spectral channel representation grounded in physical principles. Our model integrates into an interpretable, end-to-end learnable framework for simultaneous exoplanet detection and flux estimation. The proposed algorithm is evaluated against the state of the art using datasets from the SPHERE instrument operating at the Very Large Telescope (VLT). It significantly improves the precision-recall trade-off, notably on challenging datasets that are otherwise unusable by astronomers. The proposed approach is computationally efficient, robust to varying data quality, and well suited for large-scale observational surveys.

          Tidal Amplitudes in the Magellanic Cloud Population of Heartbeat Stars

 - **Abstract**
 Heartbeat (HB) stars exhibit pulses in their light curves once per orbit due to ellipsoidal distortions from strong tides at periapse. We analyze the population of HB stars in the Magellanic Clouds captured by the OGLE survey, and provide broadband spectral energy distribution fitting to estimate physical properties of the HB stars. The HB stars span a wide range of luminosities, radii, and effective temperatures. However, we find that they cluster near loci of strong tidal influence at periapse, indicating that in nearly all cases, strong tides are indeed responsible for their photometric variability. HB stars tend to populate regions away from the main sequence, where stellar evolution is particularly rapid. We examine the distribution of tidal amplitudes, and show that these can be interpreted through a simplified model of radius growth through stellar evolution and orbital circularization through linear tidal dissipation. When we compare rates of tidal dissipation, we find differences between the modeled modified tidal quality factor among hot ($T_{\rm eff}>6250$~K), $Q_\ast' \gtrsim 10^7$, and cool ($T_{\rm eff}<6250$~K), $Q_\ast'\sim 10^5$, stars, which is qualitatively consistent with models of efficient tidal dissipation in the convective envelopes of cool stars. We find that this model can reproduce the observed observed locations and amplitudes of HB stars in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. The hot stars, in particular, extend to amplitudes near, but not beyond, the threshold for nonlinear tidal wave breaking on stellar surfaces, suggesting a physical saturation of tidal amplitudes at this threshold.

 - **Abstract**
 Individually identified binary systems of very massive stars define fixed points on possible evolutionary pathways that begin with extreme star formation and end in either coalescence of compact remnants or complete disruption as pair-production supernovae. The LMC star Melnick 39 in the Tarantula Nebula is revealed to be an eccentric ($e = 0.618\pm0.014$) binary system of reasonably long period from time-series analysis of Chandra T-ReX X-ray observations. Its X-ray luminosity scales with the inverse of the binary separation, as expected for colliding-wind binaries in the adiabatic regime. The inclusion of optical time-series spectroscopy from the VLT FLAMES Tarantula Survey and archival HST spectroscopy confirms Melnick 39 as a double-lined O2.5If/WN6+O3V-III spectroscopic binary with orbital period near 648 days. We obtain a mass ratio of $q = 0.76 \pm 0.06$, and minimum dynamical masses of $105\pm11$ and $80\pm11$ $M_{solar}$ for the O2.5If/WN6 and O3V-III components, plus photometric evidence for an orbital inclination near 90 degrees. Disentangled spectroscopy allows the physical and wind properties of the primary to be determined, including $T_{\ast}$ = 44 kK, $\log L/L_{solar}$ = 6.2, $\log \dot{M}/M_{solar}$ yr$^{-1}$ = $-5.0$. Its dynamical mass agrees closely with $109 M_{solar}$ obtained from the mass-luminosity relation of very massive stars.

 - **Abstract**
 The strong gravitational field of a black hole bends light, forming multi-level images, yet extracting precise spacetime information from them remains challenging. In this study, we investigate how gravitational lensing leaves unique and detectable signatures in black hole movies using autocorrelation analysis. By examining the two-dimensional autocorrelation of a movie depicting a hotspot orbiting a Kerr black hole, as viewed by a near-axis observer, we identify a persistent secondary peak structure induced by gravitational lensing. Notably, these secondary peaks converge to a fixed point in the time-lag domain, largely independent of the hotspot's orbital radius. This key property suggests that combining future black hole flare observations with advanced autocorrelation analysis could effectively disentangle lensing effects from orbital dynamics, enabling direct measurement of black hole parameters. Our findings establish autocorrelation as a powerful tool for probing spacetime geometry, offering new insights into gravitational physics through time-resolved black hole images.

 - **Abstract**
 Dark matter heating in planets has been proposed as a potential probe for dark matter detection. Assuming near-equilibrium, we find that dark matter energy input raises planetary temperature and accelerates rotation. The energy distribution depends on planetary properties and external input, suggesting that previous studies have overestimated its heating effect. When dark matter density is high, planetary rotation stabilizes earlier and is primarily governed by dark matter. For Earth, our model predicts a 0.015 K temperature increase and a $10^{-8}$ rad/s angular velocity increase over 100 years.

          Celestial sunflowers -- Survival of rings around small planetary bodies under solar radiation pressure

 - **Abstract**
 Context: Rings around giant planets are a common feature of the solar system. Even though solar radiation pressure is known to destabilize rings by exciting the orbital eccentricity of its particles, the Centaur Chariklo (and possibly Chiron), the dwarf planet Haumea, and trans-Neptunian object Quaoar also host rings of solid material. Aims: We explore the dynamical evolution of rings around spherical Chariklo and Haumea analogs, assuming different particle sizes and tilt angles with respect to the planetary orbital plane of the ring. Methods: The ring dynamics were studied using a GPU-based N-body integrator with an 8th-order Hermite scheme for several thousand years, corresponding to 10 solar orbits. The simulations took into account the gravitational effects of the planet and the Sun, radiation pressure, and the shadow cast by the planet. Results: Two families of rings have been identified depending on the ring tilt angle. Slightly tilted rings (<=40 deg) are unstable under a critical particle size. Highly tilted rings (>=50 deg), however, show instability only for a range of particle sizes that spans 1-10 times the critical size. The planetary shadow reduces the critical size by a factor of five and extends the instability region to 0.1-10 times this newly identified critical size. Conclusions: The stabilization of highly inclined rings occurs because the plane of the ring is forced to be perpendicular to the Solar radiation. As a result, the plane of the ring rotates as the planetary bodies revolves: always facing the sun, like a celestial sunflower. Rings which are closely aligned to the orbital plane of the host planet, such as Haumea and Quaoar, presumably consist of particles with a size at least 1-4 um. However, particles in the rings which are highly tilted, like that around Chariklo and Chiron, should consist of particles <=2.5-15 um or >=60-300 um.

 - **Abstract**
 We address the chemical link between Terzan 5 (hereafter Ter5) and the Bulge, as probed by the observed distributions of [$\alpha$/Fe] abundance ratios with varying [Fe/H] and by suitable statistical tests to evaluate their significance. We also present a comprehensive review of the kinematic and evolutionary properties of Ter5, based on all the available observational signatures and the scenarios proposed so far in the literature for the formation and evolution of Ter5, based on these observational facts and the recent modeling of its star formation and chemical enrichment history. This analysis confirms the complex nature of this massive stellar system, with robust evidences of a bulge in-situ formation and of a subsequent evolution that cannot be simply explained by a single merging/accretion event of two globulars or a globular and a giant molecular cloud, as proposed in the literature, but it requires a more complex star formation likely accompanied by some self-enrichment.

 - **Abstract**
 A novel model of systematic errors for the regression of Poisson data is applied to hypothesis testing of nested model components with the introduction of a generalization of the $\Delta C$ statistic that applies in the presence of systematic errors. This paper shows that the null-hypothesis parent distribution of this $\Delta C_{sys}$ statistic can be obtained either through a simple numerical procedure, or in a closed form by making certain simplifying assumptions. It is found that the effects of systematic errors on the test statistic can be significant, and therefore the inclusion of sources of systematic errors is crucial for the assessment of the significance of nested model component in practical applications. The methods proposed in this paper provide a simple and accurate means of including systematic errors for hypothesis testing of nested model components in a variety of applications.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an updated reconstruction of the dark energy equation of state, $w(a)$, using the newly released DESI DR2 Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data in combination with Pantheon+ and DES5Y Type Ia supernovae measurements, respectively. Building on our previous analysis in arXiv:2503.08658, which employed a nonparametric flexknot reconstruction approach, we examine whether the evidence for dynamical dark energy persists with the improved precision of the DESI DR2 dataset. We find that while the overall qualitative structure of $w(a)$ remains consistent with our earlier findings, the statistical support for dynamical dark energy is reduced when considering DESI DR2 data alone, particularly for more complex flexknot models with higher numbers of knots. However, the evidence for simpler dynamical models, such as $w$CDM and CPL (which correspond to $n=1$ and $n=2$ knots respectively), increases relative to $\Lambda$CDM with DESI DR2 alone, consistent with previous DESI analyses. When combined with Pantheon+ data, the conclusions remain broadly consistent with our earlier work, but the inclusion of DES5Y supernovae data leads to an increase of preference for flexknot models with more than two knots, placing $w$CDM and CPL on par with $\Lambda$CDM.

          Abundances of refractory ions in Beta Pictoris exocomets

 - **Abstract**
 Beta Pic is a young, A5V star, known for harbouring a large number of exocomets, which frequently transit the star and produce absorption signatures. The physical and chemical properties of these exocomets can be probed by the recently introduced curve of growth approach, which enables column densities measurements in exocomets using observations in numerous spectral lines. Using this approach, we present a new study of archival spectra of Beta Pic obtained with the HST, the HARPS spectrograph, and at the Mont John University Observatory, aimed at constraining the abundance of refractory ions in Beta Pic exocomets. 29 individual objects are studied, all observed in FeII lines (used as a reference ion) and at least one other species (Ni II, Ca II, Cr II...). We find that the refractory composition of exocomets is overall stable, especially for singly ionised species, and consistent with solar abundances. This validates the use of the curve of growth approach to study exocometary composition. We also show that some ions, such as Ca II, are significantly depleted compared to solar abundances, allowing us to constrain the ionisation state in Beta Pic exocomets. We find that most refractory elements (Mg, Ni, Fe...) are split in similar fractions between their first and second ionisation states, with the exception of Ca, mostly ionized twice. A strong correlation between the Al III/Fe II ratio and radial velocity is also found, showing that the most redshifted exocomets tend to be more ionised. These results open the way for further modelling, in order to better understand the physical processes that influence the composition and shape of exocometary tails.

          On the road to the radius valley: distinguishing between gas dwarfs and water worlds with young transiting exoplanets

 - **Abstract**
 The detection of young transiting exoplanets represents a new frontier in our understanding of planet formation and evolution. For the population of observed close-in sub-Neptunes, two proposed formation pathways can reproduce their observed masses and radii at $\sim$Gyr ages: the "gas dwarf" hypothesis and the "water world" hypothesis. We show that a sub-Neptune's size at early ages $\lesssim 100$ Myrs is strongly dependent on the bulk mean molecular weight within its envelope. As a result, gas dwarfs and water worlds should diverge in size at early ages since the mean molecular weight of gas dwarf envelopes is predicted to be smaller than that of water worlds. We construct population models under both scenarios that reproduce Kepler demographics in the age range $\sim1-10$ Gyrs. We find tentative evidence that the gas dwarf model is more consistent with the small population of young exoplanets $< 40$ Myrs from TESS. We show that planet radius is relatively insensitive to planet mass for young, puffy sub-Neptunes, meaning that well-characterised masses are not necessarily required to exploit the effects of mean molecular weight at the population level. We confirm the predicted difference in planet size between the models is also true under mixed-envelope scenarios, in which envelopes consist of mixtures of hydrogen and steam. We highlight that transit surveys of young exoplanets should target the youngest observable stellar clusters to exploit the effects of mean molecular weight.

 - **Abstract**
 This work concerns a detailed review of data analysis methods used for remotely sensed images of large areas of the Earth and of other solid astronomical objects. In detail, it focuses on the problem of inferring the materials that cover the surfaces captured by hyper-spectral images and estimating their abundances and spatial distributions within the region. The most successful and relevant hyper-spectral unmixing methods are reported as well as compared, as an addition to analysing the most recent methodologies. The most important public data-sets in this setting, which are vastly used in the testing and validation of the former, are also systematically explored. Finally, open problems are spotlighted and concrete recommendations for future research are provided.

 - **Abstract**
 We demonstrate a novel setup for hybrid particle-in-cell simulations designed to isolate the physics of the shock precursor over long time periods for significantly lower computational cost than previous methods. This is achieved using a "faux-shock" or shock-like boundary condition on one edge of our simulation domain such that particles that interact with the boundary either pass through it or are reflected off of it with a change in momentum that mimics scattering in the downstream. We show that our faux-shock setup reproduces the same fluid quantities and phase spaces as traditional shock simulations, including those which could otherwise only be done in 3D, with higher particle resolution and for reduced computational cost. While the method involves an assumed boundary condition, it nonetheless captures the essential physics of interest, establishing it as a reliable and efficient tool for future self-consistent studies of instabilities driven by cosmic rays in a shock upstream medium.

          Accretion from a shock-inflated companion: double-peaked supernova lightcurve with periodic modulations

 - **Abstract**
 We study the observational signatures from the interactions between a newly born neutron star and a companion star that is impacted by the supernova ejecta. We focus on the cases with bound post-explosion orbits, where the neutron star may periodically gravitationally capture gas from the companion. We find that neutron star accretion must occur if the pre-supernova binary separation is less than about 20 Rsun. This is because the stellar radius expands beyond this radius before the shock-inflated envelope undergoes Kelvin-Helmholtz contraction back to the main sequence. We then consider the internal shocks formed between adjacent episodes of disk wind. The shocks efficiently convert the wind kinetic energy into radiation (due to inverse-Compton cooling), which heats up the supernova ejecta located at much larger radii. The extra heating powers bright optical emission that is periodically modulated on the orbital timescale. The shocks also accelerate non-thermal particles which produce gamma-ray and neutrino emission from 100 MeV to 10 PeV via hardronic pp collisions. The high-energy photons leak out of the supernova ejecta after a delay of several months to one year. Photo-ionization of the slowest parts of the disk wind produces hydrogen recombination lines. We then use the model to explain the puzzling Type Ic supernova SN2022jli which shows a double-peaked optical lightcurve along with many peculiar properties, including delayed onset and rapid shutoff of the second peak, periodic modulations, delayed GeV emission, and narrow Balmer lines. Under this model, SN2022jli had a close-by companion at a pre-supernova binary separation of 10 to 20 Rsun, likely due to an earlier phase of common-envelope evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are singular outbursts of high-energy radiation with durations typically lasting from milliseconds to minutes and, in extreme cases, a few hours. They are attributed to the catastrophic outcomes of stellar-scale events and, as such, are not expected to recur. Here, we present observations of an exceptional GRB\,250702BDE which triggered the {\em Fermi} gamma-ray burst monitor on three occasions over several hours, and which was detected in soft X-rays by the \textit{Einstein Probe} a day before the $\gamma$-ray triggers (EP250702a). We present the discovery of an extremely red infrared counterpart of the event with the VLT, as well as radio observations from MeerKAT. Hubble Space Telescope observations pinpoint the source to a non-nuclear location in a host galaxy with complex morphology, implying GRB 250702BDE is an extragalactic event. The multi-wavelength counterpart is well described with standard afterglow models at a relatively low redshift $z \sim 0.2$, but the prompt emission does not readily fit within the expectations for either collapsar or merger-driven GRBs. Indeed, a striking feature of the multiple prompt outbursts is that the third occurs at an integer multiple of the interval between the first two. Although not conclusive, this could be indicative of periodicity in the progenitor system. We discuss several possible scenarios to explain the exceptional properties of the burst, which suggest that either a very unusual collapsar or the tidal disruption of a white dwarf by an intermediate-mass black hole are plausible explanations for this unprecedented GRB.

 - **Abstract**
 We present AstroWISP: a collection of image processing tools for source extraction, background determination, point spread function/pixel response function fitting, and aperture photometry. AstroWISP is particularly well-suited for working with detectors featuring a Bayer mask (an array of microfilters applied to each detector pixel to allow color photography), such as consumer DSLR cameras. Such detectors pose significant challenges for existing tools while offering a much cheaper alternative to specialized devices. As a result, consumer DSLR cameras with Bayer masks are often underutilized for precision photometry. \astrowisp{} addresses this limitation in an effort to democratize precision photometry and support broader community participation in research. We demonstrate that our tools produce high-precision photometry from such images, enabling the use of such devices for detecting exoplanet transits. We package our tools for all major operating systems to ensure accessibility for amateur astronomers.

          Modeling the Reverberation Response of the Broad Line Region in Active Galactic Nuclei II: Incorporating Photoionization Models

 - **Abstract**
 The broad emission lines (BELs) emitted by Active Galactic Nuclei respond to variations in the ionizing continuum emission from the accretion disk surrounding the central supermassive black hole (SMBH). This reverberation response provides insights into the structure and dynamics of the Broad Line Region (BLR). In Rosborough et al., 2024, we introduced a new forward-modeling tool, the Broad Emission Line MApping Code (BELMAC), which simulates the velocity-resolved reverberation response of the BLR to an input light curve. In this work, we describe a new version of BELMAC, which uses photoionization models to calculate the cloud luminosities for selected BELs. We investigated the reverberation responses of H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, MgII$\lambda$2800 and CIV$\lambda$1550 for models representing a disk-like BLR with Keplerian rotation, radiatively driven outflows, and inflows. The line responses generally provide a good indication of the respective luminosity-weighted radii. However, there are situations when the BLR exhibits a negative response to the driving continuum, causing overestimates of the luminosity-weighted radius. The virial mass derived from the models can differ dramatically from the actual SMBH mass, depending mainly on the disk inclination and velocity field. In single zone models, the BELs exhibit similar responses and profile shapes; two-zone models, such as a Keplerian disk and a biconical outflow, can reproduce observed differences between high- and low-ionization lines. Radial flows produce asymmetric line profile shapes due to both anisotropic cloud emission and electron scattering in an inter-cloud medium. These competing attenuation effects complicate the interpretation of profile asymmetries.

          The impact of stellar rotations and binaries on the shape of upper main sequence near turn off in open cluster NGC\,6067

 - **Abstract**
 We present the analysis of the extended Main Sequence Turn-Off (eMSTO) in the open cluster NGC\,6067. We derive the projected rotational velocity, \textit{v}sin\textit{i}, of the stars belonging to the eMSTO region of the main sequence (MS) utilizing \textit{Gaia}-ESO spectra. Our results reveal a positive correlation between \textit{v}sin\textit{i} and the color of eMSTO stars, where fast-rotating stars predominantly occupy the red part of the MS while slow-rotating ones prefer a bluer side of the MS. The gravity-darkening effect might be a reason for this correlation. We find that most of the close binaries present in the eMSTO population would be slow-rotating due to the tidal-locking phenomenon. We identify four double-lined spectroscopic binaries (SB2) featuring slow-rotating companions, further supporting this tidal-locking hypothesis. However, the spatial distribution and the cumulative radial distribution indicate a higher concentration of red eMSTO stars in the cluster's central region than their bluer counterparts. This suggests that tidal locking is less likely to be the cause of the observed spread in rotation rates among eMSTO stars. Instead, we propose that star-disk interactions during the pre-main-sequence phase might have played a crucial role in spreading the rotation rates of stars, leading to the eMSTO phenomenon in NGC\,6067.

          Multi-Wavelength Dust Characterization of the HL Tau Disk and Implications for Planet Formation

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive analysis of the HL Tau dust disk by modeling its intensity profiles across six wavelengths (0.45 to 7.9 mm) with a resolution of 0.05 arcsec ($\sim7$ au). Using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach, we constrain key dust properties including temperature, surface density, maximum grain size, composition, filling factor, and size distribution. The full fitting, with all parameters free, shows a preference for organics-rich dust with a low filling factor in the outer region ($r \gtrsim 40$ au), where the spectral index is $\sim3.7$, but amorphous-carbon-rich dust also reasonably reproduces the observed intensity profiles. Considering the scattering polarization observed at 0.87 mm, compact, amorphous-carbon-rich dust is unlikely, and moderately porous dust is favored. Beyond 40 au, the maximum dust size is likely $\sim100~{\rm \mu m}$ if dust is compact or amorphous-carbon rich. However, if the dust is moderately porous and organics-rich, both the predicted dust surface density and dust size can be sufficiently large for the pebble accretion rate to reach $\sim10M_{\oplus}~{\rm Myr^{-1}}$ in most regions, suggesting that pebble accretion could be a key mechanism for forming planets in the disk. In contrast, if the dust is amorphous-carbon-rich, forming a giant planet core via pebble accretion is unlikely due to the combined effects of low dust surface density and small dust size required to match the observed emission, suggesting other mechanisms, such as disk fragmentation due to gravitational instability, may be responsible for planet formation in the HL Tau disk.

          A new long period radio transient: Discovery of pulses repeating every 1.16 hours from ASKAP J175534.9-252749.1

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of several new pulses from the source ASKAP J175534.9-252749.1 (J1755-2527), originally identified from a single 2-min long pulse, confirming it as a long period transient (LPT) with a period of ~1.16 hours. The pulses are significantly scattered, consistent with Galactic electron density models. Two of the new pulses also had measurable polarisation, but unlike the originally detected pulse, the polarisation angle does not behave as expected from the rotating vector model. We interpret historical non-detections of J1755-2527 as an intrinsic intermittency that occurs on month-long timescales, and discuss possible causes. We conjecture that, like some other LPTs with periods >~ 1 hour, J1755-2527 may host a white dwarf in a binary orbit, but note that its period is marginally shorter than the canonical orbital period minimum of cataclysmic variables. Our work highlights the importance of additional observations in establishing the nature of unusual radio-emitting objects.

 - **Abstract**
 Carbon-rich Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars are significant contributors of carbonaceous dust to the galactic environment, however the mechanisms and conditions for formation and subsequent evolution of dust around these stars remain open questions. Here we present JWST observations of the WR+WR colliding-wind binary Apep which reveal an intricate series of nested concentric dust shells that are abundant in detailed substructure. The striking regularity in these substructures between successive shells suggests an exactly repeating formation mechanism combined with a highly stable outflow that maintains a consistent morphology even after reaching 0.6 pc (assuming a distance of 2.4 kpc) into the interstellar medium. The concentric dust shells show subtle deviations from spherical outflow, which could reflect orbital modulation along the eccentric binary orbit or some mild degree of non-sphericity in the stellar wind. Tracking the evolution of dust across the multi-tiered structure, we measure the dust temperature evolution that can broadly be described with an amorphous carbon composition in radiative thermal equilibrium with the central stars. The temperature profile and orbital period place new distance constraints that support Apep being at a greater distance than previously estimated, reducing the line-of-sight and sky-plane wind speed discrepancy previously thought to characterise the system.

          ALMA-IMF XIX: C18O (J=2-1): Measurements of turbulence in 15 massive protoclusters

 - **Abstract**
 ALMA-IMF is a large program of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) that aims to determine the origin of the core mass function (CMF) of 15 massive Galactic protoclusters (~ 1.0-25.0 x 10^3 solar mass within ~ 2.5 x 2.5 pc^2 ) located towards the Galactic plane. In addition, the objective of the program is to obtain a thorough understanding of their physical and kinematic properties. Here we study the turbulence in these protoclusters with C18O (2-1) emission line using the sonic Mach number analysis (M_s ) and the size-linewidth relation. The probability distribution functions (PDFs) for M_s show a similar pattern, exhibiting no clear trend associated with evolutionary stage, peaking in the range between 4 and 7, and then extending to ~ 25. Such values of M_s indicate that the turbulence in the density regime traced by the C18O line inside the protoclusters is supersonic in nature. In addition, we compare the non-thermal velocity dispersions (sigma_nth, C18O) obtained from the C18O(2-1) line with the non-thermal line widths (sigma_nth, DCN ) of the cores obtained from the DCN (3-2) line. We observe that, on average, the non-thermal linewidth in cores is half that of the gas surrounding them. This suggests that turbulence diminishes at smaller scales or dissipates at the periphery of the cores. Furthermore, we examine the size-linewidth relation for the structures we extracted from the position-position-velocity C18O(2-1) line emission cube with dendrogram algorithm. The power-law index (p) obtained from the size-linewidth relation is between 0.41 and 0.64, steeper than the Kolmogorov law of turbulence, as expected for compressible media. In conclusion, this work is one of the first to carry out such a statistical study of turbulence for embedded massive protoclusters.

 - **Abstract**
 Human activities degrade the Earth environment at an unprecedented scale and pace, threatening Earth-system stability, resilience and life-support functions. We can of course deny the facts, get angry about them, try to bargain, or fall into deep depression. Or we may overcome these stages of grief and move towards accepting that human activities need to change, including our own ones. The purpose of this paper is to support astronomers in this transition, by providing insights into the origins of environmental impacts in astronomical research and proposing changes that would make the field sustainable. The paper focuses on the environmental impacts of research infrastructures, since these are the dominant sources of greenhouse gas emissions in astronomy, acknowledging that impact reductions in other areas, for example professional air travelling, need also to be achieved.

 - **Abstract**
 Atmospheric muons produced in cosmic-ray air showers are classified as conventional muons from pion and kaon decays and prompt muons from heavy hadron decays. Conventional muons dominate at lower energies, and the prompt component becomes dominant at PeV energies and above. Precisely measuring the atmospheric muon flux from a few GeV to several PeV is valuable for advancing our understanding of cosmic-ray interactions and testing hadronic interaction models. Low-energy muons that stop within the IceCube in-ice array provide valuable information about the energy spectrum of muons from a few hundred GeV up to 10 TeV. Machine learning techniques are employed to enhance event reconstruction and selection to provide insights into the conventional and prompt components. This contribution presents the unfolding of the energy spectrum of stopping muons in IceCube as well as the unfolding of high-energy muons to probe the prompt component.

          The ALMA Survey of 70 $μ$m Dark High-mass Clumps in Early Stages (ASHES). XII. Unanchored Forked Stream in the Propogating Path of a Protostellar Outflow

 - **Abstract**
 Outflows are key indicators of ongoing star formation. We report the discovery of an unanchored forked stream within the propagating path of an extremely young protostellar outflow in the 70 $\mu$m-dark clump G34.74-0.12, based on ALMA 1.3 mm observations with an angular resolution of 1''.6 (~ 5000 au). This outflow originate from a 9.7 $M_{\odot}$ core, exhibits a fork-shaped stream structure in its red-shifted lobe, which is traced by CO (2-1), SiO (5-4), and H$_2$CO (3$_{0,3}$-2$_{0,2}$). It has a momentum of 13 $M_{\odot}$ km s$^{-1}$, an energy of 107 $M_{\odot}$ km$^{2}$ s$^{-2}$, and a dynamical timescale of ~10$^{4}$ yr. Significantly, the enhanced relative abundances of SiO, H$_2$CO, and CH$_3$OH with respect to CO, along with the increased temperature at the forked point, indicate a collisional origin. The forked point does not coincide with any dust continuum core > 0.1 $M_{\odot}$. Moreover, CO (2-1) emission also traces three other outflows in this region, characterized by their masses (0.40, 0.02 and 0.15 $M_{\odot}$) and momenta (5.2, 0.2, 1.8 $M_{\odot}$ km s$^{-1}$), as part of the ALMA Survey of 70 $\mu$m dark High-mass clumps in Early Stages (ASHES) project. All the newly discovered morphological and kinematic features associated with these extremely young protostellar outflows (with timescales of 10$^3$ - 10$^4$ years) suggest that the initial stages of star formation are more complicated than previously understood.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Molecular hydrogen and its cation H+2 are among the first species formed in the early Universe, and play a key role in the thermal and chemical evolution of the primordial gas. In molecular clouds, H+2 ions formed through ionization of H2 by particles react rapidly with H2 to form H+3 , triggering the formation of almost all detected interstellar molecules. Aims. We present a new set of cross sections and rate coefficients for state-to-state ro-vibrational transitions of the H+2 and HD+ ions, induced by low-energy electron collisions. Study includes the major electron-impact processes relevant for low-metallicity astrochemistry: inelastic and superelastic scattering, and dissociative recombination. Methods. The electron-induced processes involving H+2 and HD+ are treated using the multichannel quantum defect theory. Results. The newly calculated thermal rate coefficients show significant differences compared to those used in previous studies. When introduced into astrochemical models, particularly for shock-induced chemistry in metal-free gas, the updated dissociative recombination rates produce substantial changes in the predicted molecular abundances. Conclusions. These data provide updated and improved input for the modeling of hydrogen-rich plasmas in environments

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive analysis of 32 type II supernovae (SNe II) with plateau phase photometry and late phase ($nebular$) spectroscopy available, aiming to bridge the gap between the surface and core of their red supergiant (RSG) progenitors. Using \texttt{MESA}\,+\texttt{STELLA}, we compute an extensive grid of SN II light curve models originating from RSG with effective temperatures $T_{\rm eff}$ around 3650\,K and hydrogen-rich envelopes artificially stripped to varying degrees. These models are then used to derive the hydrogen-rich envelope masses $M_{\rm Henv}$ for SNe II from their plateau phase light curves. Nebular spectroscopy further constrains the progenitor RSG's luminosity log\,$L_{\rm prog}$, and is employed to remove the degeneracies in light curve modeling. The comparison between log\,$L_{\rm prog}$-$M_{\rm Henv}$ reveals that $M_{\rm Henv}$ spans a broad range at the same log\,$L_{\rm prog}$, and almost all SNe II have lower $M_{\rm Henv}$ than the prediction of the default stellar wind models. We explore alternative wind prescriptions, binary evolution models, and the possibility of more compact RSG progenitors. Although binary interaction offers a compelling explanation for the non-monotonicity and large scatter in the log\,$L_{\rm prog}$-$M_{\rm Henv}$ relation, the high occurrence rate of partially-stripped RSGs cannot be accounted for by stable binary mass transfer alone without fine-tuned orbital parameters. This highlights that, despite being the most commonly observed class of core-collapse SNe, SNe II likely originate from a variety of mass-loss histories and evolutionary pathways that are more diverse and complex than typically assumed in standard stellar evolution models.

          Investigating FRB 20240114A with FAST: Morphological Classification and Drifting Rate Measurements in a Burst-Cluster Framework

 - **Abstract**
 This study investigates the morphological classification and drifting rate measurement of the repeating fast radio burst (FRB) source FRB20240114A using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST). Detected on January 14, 2024, FRB20240114A showed an exceptionally high burst rate. During a continuous 15,780-second monitoring session on March 12, 2024, 3,203 bursts (2,109 burst-clusters) were detected. We refine the definitions of sub-bursts, bursts, and burst-clusters. Using an average dispersion measure (DM) of 529.2 pc cm$^{-3}$, burst-clusters were classified into Downward Drifting, Upward Drifting, No Drifting, No Evidence for Drifting, Not-Clear, and Complex categories. Notably, 233 (23.82%) of the 978 drifting burst-clusters showed upward drifting. Excluding 142 upward drifting single-component clusters, the remaining 91 upward drifting double- or multiple-components clusters account for 10.89% of the drifting sample. Further restricting to those with consecutive time intervals, only 9 upward drifting bursts remain. An inverse correlation is found between drifting rate and sub-burst effective width. Upward drifting single-component clusters tend to have smaller effective widths, bandwidths, and fluxes than downward drifting ones. For these upward drifting clusters, drifting rate increases with peak frequency. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test reveals longer consecutive intervals in upward drifting clusters compared to downward ones, suggesting differing underlying mechanisms.

 - **Abstract**
 The dawning of the Space Age marked the start of an ongoing relationship between the professional astronomical community and both state and non-state actors that launch and operate spacecraft in near-Earth orbital space. While the Cold War heated up in the late 1950s, military uses of outer space quickly came into conflict with the priorities of astronomers then building ever-bigger ground-based telescopes and envisioning the first generation of space telescopes. As the threat of global thermonuclear war loomed, the United States carried out Project West Ford, which tested an 'artificial ionosphere' for microwave radio propagation by placing several hundred million tiny copper dipoles into a belt orbiting the Earth. While the test was ultimately successful, it ignited a firestorm of concern and criticism among astronomers and ultimately influenced the framing of the United Nations Outer Space Treaty. Here we examine the history of Project West Ford as it prompted astronomers to react, comparing it with the ongoing problem of the potential impact of large satellite constellations on astronomical research.

 - **Abstract**
 Searching for signs of life is a primary goal of the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO). However, merely detecting oxygen, methane, or other widely discussed biosignatures is insufficient evidence for a biosphere. In parallel with biosignature detection, exoplanet life detection additionally requires characterization of the broader physicochemical context to evaluate planetary habitability and the plausibility that life could produce a particular biosignature in a given environment. Life detection further requires that we can confidently rule out photochemical or geological phenomena that can mimic life (i.e. "false positives"). Evaluating false positive scenarios may require different observatory specifications than biosignature detection surveys. Here, we explore the coronagraph requirements for assessing habitability and ruling out known false positive (and false negative) scenarios for oxygen and methane, the two most widely discussed biosignatures for Earth-like exoplanets. We find that broad wavelength coverage ranging from the near UV (0.26 $\mu$m) and extending into the near infrared (1.7 $\mu$m), is necessary for contextualizing biosignatures with HWO. The short wavelength cutoff is driven by the need to identify Proterozoic-like biospheres via O$_3$, whereas the long wavelength cutoff is driven by the need to contextualize O$_2$ and CH$_4$ biosignatures via constraints on C-bearing atmospheric species. The ability to obtain spectra with signal-to-noise ratios of 20-40 across this 0.26-1.7 $\mu$m range (assuming R=7 UV, R=140 VIS, and R=70 NIR) is also required. Without sufficiently broad wavelength coverage, we risk being unprepared to interpret biosignature detections and may ultimately be ill-equipped to confirm the detection of an Earth-like biosphere, which is a driving motivation of HWO..

 - **Abstract**
 The increasing field of view of radio telescopes and improved data processing capabilities have led to a surge in the detection of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). The discovery rate of FRBs is already a few per day and is expected to increase rapidly with new surveys coming online. The growing number of events necessitates prioritized follow-up due to limited multi-wavelength resources, requiring rapid and automated classification. In this study, we introduce Frabjous, a deep learning framework for an automated morphology classifier with an aim towards enabling the prompt follow-up of anomalous and intriguing FRBs, and a comprehensive statistical analysis of FRB morphologies. Deep learning models require a large training set of each FRB archetype, however, publicly available data lacks sufficient samples for most FRB types. In this paper, we build a simulation framework for generating realistic examples of FRBs and train a network based on a combination of simulated and real data, starting with the CHIME/FRB catalog. Applying our framework to the first CHIME/FRB catalog, we achieve an overall classification accuracy of approximately 55%, well over a random multiclass classification rate of 20 % with five balanced classes during training. While this falls short of desirable performance, we critically discuss the limitations of our approach and propose potential avenues for improvement. Future work should explore strategies to augment training datasets and broaden the scope of FRB morphological studies, aiming for more accurate and reliable classification results.

          A deep Search for Ethylene Glycol and Glycolonitrile in the V883 Ori Protoplanetary Disk

 - **Abstract**
 Ethylene glycol ($\mathrm{(CH_2OH)_2}$, hereafter EG) and Glycolonitrile ($\mathrm{HOCH_2CN}$, hereafter GN) are considered molecular precursors of nucleic acids. EG is a sugar alcohol and the reduced form of Glycolaldehyde ($\mathrm{CH_2(OH)CHO}$, hereafter GA). GN is considered a key precursor of adenine formation (nucleotide) and can be a precursor of glycine (amino acid). Detections of such prebiotic molecules in the interstellar medium are increasingly common. How much of this complexity endures to the planet formation stage, and thus is already present when planets form, remains largely unknown. Here we report Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) observations in which we tentatively detect EG and GN in the protoplanetary disk around the outbursting protostar V883 Ori. The observed EG emission is best reproduced by a column density of $\mathrm{3.63^{+0.11}_{-0.12} \times 10^{16} \; cm^{-2}}$ and a temperature of at least 300 K. The observed GN emission is best reproduced by a column density of $\mathrm{3.37^{+0.09}_{-0.09} \times 10^{16} \; cm^{-2}}$ and a temperature of $88^{+1.2}_{-1.2}$ K. Comparing the abundance of EG and GN relative to methanol in V883 Ori with other objects, V883 Ori falls between hot cores and comets in terms of increasing complexity. This suggests that the build up of prebiotic molecules continues past the hot core phase into the epoch of planet formation. Nascent planets in such environments may inherit essential building blocks for life, enhancing their potential habitability. Further observations of this protoplanetary disk at higher spectral resolution are required to resolve blended lines and to confirm these tentative detection.

 - **Abstract**
 Despite growing efforts to find the sources of high energy neutrinos measured by IceCube, the bulk of the neutrinos remain with unknown origins. We aim to constrain the emissivity of cosmic high-energy neutrinos from extragalactic sources through their correlation with the large-scale structure. We use cross-correlations between the IceCube 10-year dataset and tomographic maps of the galaxy overdensity to place constraints on the bias-weighted high-energy neutrino emissivity out to redshift $z\sim3$. We test two different models to describe the evolution of neutrino emissivity with redshift, a power law model $\propto (1+z)^a$, and a model tracking the star formation history, assuming a simple power law model for the energy injection spectrum. We also consider a non-parametric reconstruction of the astrophysical neutrino emissivity as a function of redshift. We do not find any significant correlation, with our strongest results corresponding to a $1.9 \sigma$ deviation with respect to a model with zero signal. We use our measurements to place upper bounds on the bias-weighted astrophysical high-energy neutrino emission rate as a function of redshift for different source models. This analysis provides a new probe to test extragalactic neutrino source models. With future neutrino and galaxy datasets we expect the constraining and detection power of this type of analysis analysis to increase.

 - **Abstract**
 While astrophysical observations imply that 85% of the matter content is unaccounted for, the nature of this dark matter (DM) component remains unknown. Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) - DM particles that interact at or below the weak interaction scale - could naturally explain this missing matter. These interactions with the Standard Model (SM) allow them to be gravitationally captured in celestial bodies like the Sun. Trapped DM in the solar core could subsequently annihilate, producing stable SM particles, of which only neutrinos can escape the Sun's dense interior. Therefore, an excess of neutrinos originating from the direction of the Sun would serve as evidence of DM. The IceCube Upgrade, a dense infill of the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, will lower the energy threshold and improve sensitivity in the range from 1 to 500 GeV, thereby enhancing IceCube's ability to detect GeV-scale DM. In this contribution, I present projections of the IceCube Upgrade's sensitivity to the DM-proton scattering cross section for DM masses between 3 GeV and 500 GeV. These sensitivities position IceCube as the most sensitive indirect detection experiment for DM in the mass range from 3 GeV to 10 TeV.

 Aims. Particles ejected from the lunar surface via hypervelocity impacts form a torus between the Earth and the Moon. According to our previous study (Yang et al., A\&A, 659, A120), among them about $2.3\times10^{-4}\,\mathrm{kg/s}$ particles impact the Earth after long-term orbital evolution. We mainly focus on these Earth impactors, analyze their orbital element distribution, and estimate their influence on Earth-based observations. Methods. In previous work we simulated the long-term orbital evolution of particles ejected from the lunar surface, and obtained their steady-state spatial distribution in the Earth-Moon system. In this work, we analyze the simulation results about the Earth impactors, including the fraction of impactors with different initial parameters among all impactors, the orbital element distribution, and the projection of particles onto several Earth-based observatories. Results. Particles ejected from the lunar surface are more likely to impact the Earth within a certain range of initial parameters. Most of these lunar-ejected impactors ($\sim70\%$) reach the Earth within one year, while most of the small ones ($87.2\%$ of $0.2\,\mathrm{\mu m}$ particles and $64.6\%$ of $0.5\,\mathrm{\mu m}$ particles) reach the Earth within one week. A large proportion of lunar-ejected Earth impactors can be distinguished from interplanetary dust particles according to the differences in their orbital distributions. Besides, lunar-ejected particles may exhibit distinct configurations and orientations from the perspectives of different Earth-based observatories.

 We present an in-depth photometric and spectroscopic study of the contact binary KIC 7766185. Spectroscopic observations were conducted on the Mayall 4-m telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory and used to extract radial velocities. Using the radial velocity measurements, Kepler photometry, and Gaia multi-color photometry, binary analysis was performed in PHOEBE to determine orbital and stellar parameters. The results classify KIC 7766185 as an A-type W UMa system and reveal one of the largest and most massive secondary stars in the sample of well studied W UMa systems. The two stars are in a shallow contact state, with a small fillout factor of $0.029\pm0.002$. Along with the binary analysis, we conduct a period study that reveals evidence for a cyclic variation in the eclipse timings.

 - **Abstract**
 The search for habitable, Earth-like exoplanets faces major observational challenges due to their small size and faint signals. M-dwarf stars offer a promising avenue to detect and study smaller planets, especially sub-Neptunes-among the most common exoplanet types. K2-18 b, a temperate sub-Neptune in an M-dwarf habitable zone, has been observed with HST and JWST, revealing an H2-rich atmosphere with CH4 and possible CO2. Conflicting interpretations highlight the importance of non-equilibrium chemistry, which is critical for constraining atmospheric parameters like metallicity, C/O ratio, and vertical mixing (Kzz). This study explores the parameter space of metallicity, C/O ratio, and Kzz for K2-18 b using the non-equilibrium chemistry model FRECKLL and JWST data. We generated spectra from a 3D grid of models and compared them to observations to refine atmospheric constraints. A fixed pressure-temperature profile was used to capture first-order chemical trends, acknowledging some uncertainties. Our best-fit model favors high metallicity (266^{+291}_{-104} at 2 sigma) and high C/O ratio (C/O > 2.1 at 2 sigma). CH4 is robustly detected (log10[CH4] = -0.3^{+0.1}_{-1.7} at 1 mbar), while CO2 remains uncertain due to spectral noise. Kzz has no clear impact on the fit and remains unconstrained. Non-equilibrium models outperform flat spectra at > 4 sigma confidence, confirming atmospheric features. Minor species, such as H2O and NH3, may be present but are likely masked by dominant absorbers. Our results highlight the limits of constant-abundance retrievals. The atmosphere has a high C/O ratio suggesting possible aerosol formation. Better constraints require higher-precision data. Future JWST NIRSpec G395H and ELT/ANDES observations will be critical for probing habitability and refining models.

 - **Abstract**
 It is projected that more than 100,000 communication satellites will be deployed in Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) over the next decade. These LEO satellites (LEOsats) will be captured frequently by the survey camera onboard the China Space Station Telescope (CSST), contaminating sources in the images. As such, it is necessary to assess the impact of LEOsats on CSST survey observations. We use the images taken by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) in its F814W band to simulate $i$-band images for the CSST. The simulation results indicate that LEOsats at higher altitudes cause more contamination than those at lower altitudes. If 100,000 LEOsats are deployed at altitudes between 550 km and 1200 km with a 53-degree orbital inclination, the fraction of contaminated sources in a 150-s exposure image would remain below 0.50%. For slitless spectroscopic images, the contaminated area is expected to be below 1.50%. After removing the LEOsat trails, the residual photon noise contributes to relative photometric errors that exceed one-tenth of the total error budget in approximately 0.10% of all sources. Our investigation shows that even though LEOsats are unavoidable in CSST observations, they only have a minor impact on samples extracted from the CSST survey.

 - **Abstract**
 Detecting continuous gravitational waves (CWs) is challenging due to their weak amplitude and high computational demands, especially with poorly constrained source parameters. Stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) searches using cross-correlation techniques can identify unresolved astrophysical sources, including CWs, at lower computational cost, albeit with reduced sensitivity. This motivates a hybrid approach where SGWB algorithms act as a first-pass filter to identify CW candidates for follow-up with dedicated CW pipelines. We evaluated the discovery potential of the SGWB analysis tool PyStoch for detecting CWs, using simulated signals from spinning down NSs. We then applied the method to data from the third LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing run (O3), covering the (20-1726) Hz frequency band, and targeting four supernova remnants: Vela Jr., G347.3-0.5, Cassiopeia A, and the NS associated with the 1987A supernova remnant. If necessary, significant candidates are followed up using the 5-vector Resampling and Band-Sampled Data Frequency-Hough techniques. However, since no interesting candidates were identified in the real O3 analysis, we set 95\% confidence-level upper limits on the CW strain amplitude $h_0$. The most stringent limit was obtained for Cassiopeia A, and is $h_0 = 1.13 \times 10^{-25}$ at $201.57$ Hz with a frequency resolution of $1/32$ Hz. As for the other targets, the best upper limits have been set with the same frequency resolution, and correspond to $h_0 = 1.20 \times 10^{-25} $ at $202.16$ Hz for G347.3-0.5, $1.20 \times 10^{-25}$ at $217.81$ Hz for Vela Jr., and $1.47 \times 10^{-25}$ at $186.41$ Hz for the NS in the 1987A supernova remnant.

 - **Abstract**
 The discovery of fast and variable coherent signals in a handful of ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) testifies to the presence of super-Eddington accreting neutron stars, and drastically changed the understanding of the ULX class. Our capability of discovering pulsations in ULXs is limited, among others, by poor statistics. However, catalogues and archives of high-energy missions contain information which can be used to identify new candidate pulsating ULXs (PULXs). The goal of this research is to single out candidate PULXs among those ULXs which have not shown pulsations due to an unfavourable combination of factors. We applied an AI approach to an updated database of ULXs detected by XMM-Newton. We first used an unsupervised clustering algorithm to sort out sources with similar characteristics into two clusters. Then, the sample of known PULX observations has been used to set the separation threshold between the two clusters and to identify the one containing the new candidate PULXs. We found that only a few criteria are needed to assign the membership of an observation to one of the two clusters. The cluster of new candidate PULXs counts 85 unique sources for 355 observations, with $\sim$85% of these new candidates having multiple observations. A preliminary timing analysis found no new pulsations for these candidates. This work presents a sample of new candidate PULXs observed by XMM-Newton, the properties of which are similar (in a multi-dimensional phase space) to those of the known PULXs, despite the absence of pulsations in their light curves. While this result is a clear example of the predictive power of AI-based methods, it also highlights the need for high-statistics observational data to reveal coherent signals from the sources in this sample and thus validate the robustness of the approach.

 - **Abstract**
 A subclass of intermediate mass variables Delta Scuti stars, known as High-amplitude Delta Scuti (HADS) stars, exhibits pronounced radial pulsations with high amplitudes. The ground-based and space-based observations of the HADS star EH Lib are used to help making asteroseismological analysis of this pulsating star. Following the reduction of the light curves, the frequency analysis reveals the fundamental frequency as $f_0=11.3105$ c day$^{-1}$ and two more significant frequencies $f_1$ and $f_2$, in addition to the harmonics of $f_0$ and a linear combination. The period change rate is determined as $(1/P_0)(dP_0/dt)=(5.4\pm0.5)\times10^{-9}$ yr$^{-1}$ derived from an O-C diagram, which is constructed from 342 times of maximum light spanning over 70 years. Using these observational constraints, along with the metallicity reported in the literature, we construct theoretical models using the stellar evolution code MESA and calculate the theoretical frequencies of the eigen modes using the oscillation code GYRE. The appropriate models are selected by matching both $f_0$ and $(1/P_0)(dP_0/dt)$ within their respective uncertainties. The results indicate that the observed period change of EH Lib can be attributed to stellar evolutionary effects. The stellar parameters of EH Lib are derived as: the mass of $1.715\pm0.065$ M$_{\odot}$, the luminosity of log $(L/L_{\odot})=1.38\pm0.06$, and the age of $(1.14\pm0.13)\times10^{9}$ years. EH Lib is classified as a single-mode HADS star, locating currently in the Hertzsprung gap, with a helium core and a hydrogen-burning shell. This work expands the asteroseismological sample of HADS stars and establishes a foundation for future investigations into their commonalities and specific properties, thereby advancing our understanding of these variables.

 With the same general purposes as Part I of this monograph, we analyze here major events in the history of the Earth, such as the formation of the Earth itself, the origin of life, the great glaciations and the mass extinctions of species, and we also analyze the astronomical context in which they occurred. We argue that the Sun was captured around 500-700 Myr ago by a supercloud, of which the Orion arm and Gould's belt are currently part, and that this event marked the history of the Earth. With this fact, we associate a massive capture of comets by the Sun, the great glaciations of the Cryogenic period, the emergence of complex life in the Cambrian and the recurrent mass extinctions of species.

 We analyze in a systematic way the implications for the classes of hilltop and hilltop-squared inflation of the recent DR6 observations by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope collaboration. We find that the reported shift in the spectral index leads to parameter ranges for these models that are significantly reduced when compared to the results obtained from the {\sc Planck} observations. We mainly focus on the more dramatic implications for the hilltop-squared class, but along the way we also highlight the milder impact on the class of hilltop models.

 - **Abstract**
 Open clusters serve as important tools for accurately studying the chemical evolution of the Milky Way. By combining precise chemical data from high-resolution spectra with information on their distances and ages, we can effectively uncover the processes that have shaped our Galaxy. This study aims to derive NLTE atmospheric parameters and chemical abundances for approximately one hundred giant stars across 33 open clusters with near-solar metallicity. The clusters span a wide range of ages, enabling an assessment of the presence and extent of any age-related abundance gradients. In the Stellar Population Astrophysics (SPA) project, we acquired new high-resolution spectra of open clusters using the HARPS-N echelle spectrograph at the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo. We chemically characterized nine open clusters for the first time and reanalyzed previously studied SPA clusters, resulting in a consistent and homogeneous sample. We determined NLTE atmospheric parameters using the equivalent width method and derived NLTE chemical abundances through spectral synthesis for various elements, including alpha elements (Mg, Si, and Ti), light odd-Z elements (Na, Al), iron-peak elements (Mn, Co, and Ni), and neutron-capture elements (Sr, Y, and Eu). Our findings are compared with the existing literature, revealing good agreement. We examine the trends of [X/Fe] versus age, confirming previous observations and the enrichment patterns predicted by nucleosynthesis processes. Positive correlations with age are present for Mg, Si, Ti, Al, Mn, Co, Ni, and Sr, while Na and Y and Eu show a negative trend. This study emphasizes the significance of NLTE corrections and reinforces the utility of open clusters as tracers of Galactic chemical evolution. Furthermore, we provide a benchmark sample of NLTE abundances for upcoming open cluster surveys within large-scale projects such as 4MOST and WEAVE.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an optimised multipole algorithm for computing the three-point correlation function (3PCF), tailored for application to large-scale cosmological datasets. The algorithm builds on a $in\, situ$ interpretation of correlation functions, wherein spatial displacements are implemented via translation window functions. In Fourier space, these translations correspond to plane waves, whose decomposition into spherical harmonics naturally leads to a multipole expansion framework for the 3PCF. To accelerate computation, we incorporate density field reconstruction within the framework of multiresolution analysis, enabling efficient summation using either grid-based or particle-based schemes. In addition to the shared computational cost of reconstructing the multipole-decomposed density fields - scaling as $\mathcal{O}(L^2_{\text{trun}} N_g \log N_g)$ (where $N_g$ is the number of grids and $L_{\text{trun}}$ is the truncation order of the multipole expansion) - the final summation step achieves a complexity of $\mathcal{O}(D^6_{\text{sup}} N_g)$ for the grid-based approach and $\mathcal{O}(D^3_{\text{sup}} N_p)$ for the particle-based scheme (where $D_{\text{sup}}$ is the support of the basis function and $N_p$ is the number of particles). The proposed $in\, situ$ multipole algorithm is fully GPU-accelerated and implemented in the open-source $Hermes$ toolkit for cosmic statistics. This development enables fast, scalable higher-order clustering analyses for large-volume datasets from current and upcoming cosmological surveys such as Euclid, DESI, LSST, and CSST.

 Extending the investigation of the presumed primordial comet as part of continuing work on a new model of the Kreutz sungrazer system, I confront a previously derived set of orbital elements with Aristotle's remarks in his Meteorologica to test their compatibility and determine the comet's perihelion time. The two translations of the treatise into English that I am familiar with differ at one point substantially from each other. Unambiguously, the year and season of the comet's appearance was early 372 BC (or -371). From Aristotle's constraint on the comet's setting relative to sunset, I infer that the probable date of perihelion passage was January 20, a date also consistent with the vague remark on frosty weather. On the day that Aristotle claims the comet was not seen, its head may have been hidden behind the Sun's disk or in contact with it. The observation that the `comet receded as far as Orion's belt, where it dissolved' is being satisfied by the tested orbit if the perihelion was reached between January 20 and February 10. Aristotle's third statement, which describes the tail as a streak 60 degrees in length, suggests a plasma feature stretching in space over 0.8 AU. The dust tail was developing more gradually and it was all that could be seen from the comet when it was approaching Orion's belt in early April. The comet was seen over a period of more than 10 weeks. The results of this study strengthen the notion that Aristotle's comet indeed was the gigantic progenitor of Kreutz sungrazers.

 - **Abstract**
 Despite the ever-increasing number of known exoplanets, no uncontested detections have been made of their satellites, known as exomoons. The quest to find exomoons is at the forefront of exoplanetary sciences. Certain space-born instruments are thought to be suitable for this purpose. We show the progress made with the CHaracterizing ExOPlanets Satellite (CHEOPS) in this field using the HD 95338 planetary system. We present a novel methodology as an important step in the quest to find exomoons. We utilize ground-based spectroscopic data in combination with Gaia observations to obtain precise stellar parameters. These are then used as input in the analysis of the planetary transits observed by CHEOPS and the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). In addition, we search for the signs of satellites primarily in the form of additional transits in the Hill sphere of the eccentric Neptune-sized planet HD 95338b in a sequential approach based on four CHEOPS visits. We also briefly explore the transit timing variations of the planet. We present refined stellar and planetary parameters, narrowing down the uncertainty on the planet-to-star radius ratio by a factor of $10$. We also pin down the ephemeris of HD 95338b. Using injection/retrieval tests, we show that a $5 \sigma$ detection of an exomoon would be possible at $R_{\rm Moon} = 0.8$~$R_\oplus$ with the methodology presented here. We exclude the transit of an exomoon in the system with $R_{\rm Moon} \approx 0.6$~$R_\oplus$ at the $1\sigma$ level. The algorithm used for finding the transit-like event can be used as a baseline for other similar targets, observed by CHEOPS or other missions.

          Prospects of detecting rotational flatness of exoplanets from space-based photometry

 - **Abstract**
 In the era of photometry with space-based telescopes, such as CHEOPS (CHaracterizing ExOPlanets Satellite), JWST (James Webb Space Telescope), PLATO (PLAnetary Transits and Oscillations of stars), and ARIEL (Atmospheric Remote-sensing Infrared Exoplanet Large-survey), the road has opened for detecting subtle distortions in exoplanet transit light curves -- resulting from their non-spherical shape. We investigate the prospects of retrieval of rotational flatness (oblateness) of exoplanets at various noise levels. We present a novel method for calculating the transit light curves based on the Gauss-Legendre quadrature. We compare it in the non-rotating limit to the available analytical models. We conduct injection-and-retrieval tests to assess the precision and accuracy of the retrievable oblateness values. We find that the light curve calculation technique is about $25$\% faster than a well-known analytical counterpart, while still being precise enough. We show that a $3 \sigma$ oblateness detection is possible for a planet orbiting bright enough stars, by exploiting a precise estimate on the stellar density obtained e.g. from asteroseismology. We also show that for noise levels $\geq 256$ ppm (expressed as point-to-point scatter with a $60$~s exposure time) detection of planetary oblateness is not reliable.

 - **Abstract**
 The evolution of the supermassive Black Hole (BH) population across cosmic times remains a central unresolved issue in modern astrophysics, due to the many noticeable uncertainties in the involved physical processes. Here we tackle the problem via a semi-empirical approach with minimal assumptions and data-driven inputs. This is firmly grounded on a continuity plus Smoluchowski equation framework that allows to unitarily describe the two primary modes of BH growth: gas accretion and binary mergers. Key quantities related to the latter processes are incorporated through educated parameterizations, and then constrained in a Bayesian setup from joint observational estimates of the local BH mass function, of the large-scale BH clustering, and of the nano-Hz stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background measured from Pulsar Timimg Array (PTA) experiments. We find that the BH accretion-related parameters are strongly dependent on the local BH mass function determination: higher normalizations and flatter high-mass slopes in the latter imply lower radiative efficiencies and mean Eddington ratios with a stronger redshift evolution. Additionally, the binary BH merger rate is estimated to be a fraction $\lesssim 10^{-1}$ of the galaxy merger rate derived from galaxy pairs counts by JWST, and constrained not to exceed the latter at $\gtrsim 2\sigma$. Relatedly, we highlight hints of a possible tension between current constraints on BH demographics and the interpretation of the nano-Hz GW background as predominantly caused by binary BH mergers. Specifically, we bound the latter's contribution to $\lesssim 30-50\%$ at $\sim 3\sigma$, suggesting that either systematics in the datasets considered here have been underestimated so far, or that additional astrophysical/cosmological sources are needed to explain the residual part of the signal measured by PTA experiments.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The origin and nature of spiral arms remain unclear. Star forming regions and young stars are generally strongly associated to the spiral structure, but there are few quantitative predictions from simulations about the involvement of stars of different ages. Aims. We aim to quantify the interplay between spiral arms and different populations. Methods. We use a hydrodynamical simulation of an isolated disc galaxy displaying a dynamic multi-armed spiral structure. Inspired by cosmological structure metrics, we develop a new method, the local dimension, that robustly delineates arms across populations and through space and time. Results. We find that all stars, including those as old as 11Gyr, support the arms. The spiral strength decreases with stellar age up to 2Gyr-old stars and remains nearly constant for older stars. However, the scaling between arm strength and age (or velocity dispersion) depends on the strength of the global spiral structure at each time. Almost all stars formed in arms remain within them for no more than 140-180Myr, whereas old stars leave arms about three times faster. Even if the youngest populations dominate in the production of the spiral torques at early times, all populations contribute equally at later times. Conclusions. Our results highlight the power of the local dimension for studying complex spiral structures and show that all stellar populations in the disc partake in the arms. Since in our model we see spiral arms in populations with velocity dispersions up to 90km/s, which are comparable to those of the Milky Way, we predict that old Galactic populations could also exhibit spiral structure.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the detection and characterization of ultrafast outflows (UFOs) in the X-ray spectra of the tidal disruption event (TDE) AT2020afhd, based on observations from NICER, Swift, and XMM. Prominent blueshifted absorption features were detected exclusively during the intermediate phase of the event, occurring between days 172 and 212 within the first 300 days post-discovery. During this period, the UFO appeared no earlier than day 74, strengthened between days 172 and 194, and disappeared after day 215. This marks the first time that the full evolutionary sequence of X-ray outflows has been observed in a TDE. Moreover, the outflows exhibited a dramatic deceleration from ~0.19c to ~0.0097c over a span of approximately 10 days. Photoionization spectral analysis reveals an inverse correlation between outflow velocity and ionization parameter, in contradiction to the predictions from radiation pressure-driven wind. Eventually, we propose that the delayed onset of the outflows may result from an increase in the wind opening angle and/or metal enrichment, particularly iron and oxygen, during the disk formation phase.

 - **Abstract**
 Surveys for exoplanets indicate that the occurrence rate of gas giant planets orbiting late-type stars in orbits with periods shorter than 1000 days is lower than in the case of Sun-like stars. This is in agreement with planet formation models based on the core or pebble accretion paradigm. The CARMENES exoplanet survey has been conducting radial-velocity observations of several targets that show long-period trends or modulations that are consistent with the presence of giant planets at large orbital separations. We present an analysis of five such systems that were monitored with the CARMENES spectrograph, as well as with the IRD spectrograph. In addition, we used archival data to improve the orbital parameters of the planetary systems. We improve the parameters of three previously known planets orbiting the M dwarfs GJ 317, GJ 463, and GJ 3512. We also determine the orbital parameters and minimum mass of the planet GJ 3512 c, for which only lower limits had been given previously. Furthermore, we present the discovery of two new giant planets orbiting the stars GJ 9733 and GJ 508.2, although for the second one only lower limits to the orbital properties can be determined. The new planet discoveries add to the short list of known giant planets orbiting M-dwarf stars with subsolar metallicity at long orbital periods above 2000 days. These results reveal that giant planets appear to form more frequently in wide orbits than in close-in orbits around low-mass and lower metallicity stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Inflation with an inflection point potential is a popular model for producing primordial black holes. The potential near the inflection point is approximately flat, with a local maximum next to a local minimum, prone to eternal inflation. We show that a sufficient condition for eternal inflation is $\lambda_1 \leq 3$, where $\lambda_1$ is the index of the `exponential tail,' the lowest eigenvalue of the Fokker--Planck equation over a bounded region. We write $\lambda_1$ in terms of the model parameters for linear and quadratic regions. Wide quadratic regions inflate eternally if the second slow-roll parameter $\eta_V \geq -6$. We test example models from the literature and show this condition is satisfied; we argue eternal inflation is difficult to avoid in inflection point PBH models. Eternally inflating regions correspond to type II perturbations and form baby universes, hidden behind black hole horizons. These baby universes are inhomogeneous on large scales and dominate the multiverse's total volume. We argue that, if volume weighting is used, eternal inflation makes inflection point primordial black hole models incompatible with large-scale structure observations.

 - **Abstract**
 As part of Saudi Arabia Vision 2030 and under the guidance of the Royal Commission for AlUla (RCU), efforts are underway to establish AlUla Manara as the Kingdom first major astronomical observatory. This study presents a preliminary assessment of the site based on ECMWF ERA5 reanalysis data to evaluate its suitability for hosting a 4m-class optical-IR telescope. AlUla Manara is located on a remote plateau 74 km north of the historical town of AlUla and was recently designated as an International Dark Sky Park. The analysis focuses on key astro-meteorological parameters such as seeing, temperature regimes, wind patterns, cloud cover and precipitable water vapor (PWV). Results show a median nighttime seeing of 1.5 arcsec, a median cold season PWV of 3.2 mm, and over 79% of nighttime hours with clear sky conditions. Wind regimes are generally mild, posing no constraints on infrastructure. The analysis includes three further sites in the Kingdom, namely Volcanic Top, Ward Mountain, and Dubba Mountain. These sites exhibit better turbulence conditions, but are located outside RCU jurisdiction. Nevertheless, AlUla Manara remains a competitive candidate thanks to its alignment with broader regional development goals. To validate these preliminary results, a dedicated Astronomical Site Monitor has been deployed on site to support the design and operational planning of the observatory.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the cosmological matter creation scenario, an alternative approach to both dark energy and modified gravity theories, after the recent DESI DR2-BAO release. We consider that the total matter sector consists of three independently evolving components, namely, radiation, baryons, and dark matter, with the latter being governed by an adiabatic matter creation process that leads to a modified continuity equation. Due to the violation of the standard conservation law, a creation pressure appears, and under a proper choice of dark-matter particle creation rate one can obtain the present accelerating phase as well as the past thermal history of the Universe. We study two specific matter creation rates. By applying the dynamical-system analysis we show that both Model I and Model II can mimic a $\Lambda$CDM-like behavior. Furthermore, we perform a detailed observational confrontation using a series of latest observational datasets including Cosmic Chronometers (CC), Supernovae Type Ia (SNIa) (Pantheon+, DESY5 and Union3 samples) and DESI Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) (DR1 and DR2 samples). In both Model I and Model II we find evidence of matter creation at many standard deviations. Finally, applying the AIC and BIC information criteria we find that Model I is statistically equivalent with $\Lambda$CDM scenario, while Model II shows a mixed picture, namely for most datasets $\Lambda$CDM scenario is favoured, however when DESI data are included matter creation Model II is favoured over $\Lambda$CDM paradigm.

 - **Abstract**
 In recent years, with an increasing number of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) discovered soon after their explosions, a non-negligible fraction of SNe Ia with early-excess emissions (EExSNe Ia) have been confirmed. In this letter, we present a total of \textbf{67} early-phase normal SNe Ia from published papers and ongoing transient survey projects to systematically investigate their photometric behaviors from very early time. We found that EExSNe Ia in our sample have longer rise and brighter peak luminosities compared to those of non-EExSNe Ia. Moreover, EExSNe Ia commonly have ``red-bump" features in the early $B-V$ color while non-EExSNe Ia show blueward evolution from the very beginning. Here, we propose that the thin-helium double-detonation scenario can phenomenologically explain the photometric diversities of normal SNe Ia considering different white dwarf-He-shell mass combinations and the viewing-angle effect, implying a unified explosion mechanism of normal-type SNe Ia. To further testify the possible common origin of normal SNe Ia, systematical studies of multiband photometric and spectral properties of early-phase SNe Ia through the new generation wide-field time-domain survey facilities and global real-time follow-up networks are highly demanded.

 The ASTRI Mini-Array is an international collaboration led by the Italian National Institute for Astrophysics. The project aims to construct and operate an array of nine Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes to study gamma-ray sources at very high energy (TeV) and perform stellar intensity interferometry observations. We describe the updated Online Observation Quality System (OOQS) software architecture. The OOQS is one of the subsystems of the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system. It aims to execute real-time data quality checks on the data acquired by the Cherenkov cameras and intensity interferometry instruments and provide feedback to both SCADA and the Operator about abnormal conditions detected. The data quality results are stored in the Quality Archive for further investigation and sent to the Operator Human Machine Interface (HMI) through Kafka.

 - **Abstract**
 Downward Terrestrial Gamma-ray Flashes (TGFs) are sub-millisecond bursts of MeV gamma rays produced in thunderclouds. According to the Relativistic Runaway Electron Avalanche model, gamma rays are produced, via bremsstrahlung, from electron cascades activated by a relativistic "seed" electron. It is not clear what mechanism is responsible for the acceleration of electrons to relativistic energies in electric discharges. To better understand the acceleration sites and the TGF production mechanisms, it is critically important to identify the TGF source position and geometry in the atmosphere and to study the gamma emission characteristics. The Surface Detector of the Pierre Auger Observatory, with its 1600 water-Cherenkov detectors very sensitive to high-energy photons and with a very fine time-sampling, is a valuable instrument to study downward TGFs. The possibility to analyze the radiation emission in detail led to the observation of the first TGFs with an asymmetric azimuthal structure, suggesting a complex source different from the initially hypothesized downward beam. We report on these observations and the new perspectives which may open with the incorporation of new instruments at the Auger site to study lightning development alongside gamma emission, and the increasingly detailed data provided by satellites and global lightning networks.

          Examining the Gap in the Chirp Mass Distribution of Binary Black Holes

 - **Abstract**
 The mass distribution of binary black holes inferred from gravitational wave measurements is expected to shed light on their formation scenarios. An emerging structure in the mass distribution indicates the presence of multiple peaks around chirp masses of $8M_\odot$, $14M_\odot$, and $27M_\odot$. In particular, there is a lack of observations between chirp masses of 10 and 12 $M_\odot$. In this letter, we report that observations significantly favour the model supporting suppression of the rate in a narrow chirp mass range compared to the model that doesn't include suppression at a confidence greater than 99.5\%. Using another test, which measures the deviation between the inferred chirp mass distributions from the two models, we conservatively estimate a 95\% confidence in the presence of a feature. A lack of confidence has been reported in the presence of a gap around a comparable location in the component mass distribution. The differing conclusions are due to a unique correlation between the primary~(heavier of the two masses) and the secondary~(lighter of the two masses) masses of binary black holes. This correlation results in increased clustering of measured chirp masses around specific values.

          Simulating Partial Sky Cosmic Microwave Background Maps with 3D Fast Fourier Transforms

 - **Abstract**
 Simulated maps of the microwave background (CMB) radiation are generally created using one of two methods: all-sky simulations use the spherical harmonic transform, while maps covering small areas approximate the sky as flat, allowing the use of fast Fourier transforms (FFTs). Current and near-future experiments, particularly ones like CMB S4, will cover areas too large for the flat-sky approximation but significantly less than the full sky. In this regime, it can be more efficient to simulate maps in a 3-D box using FFTs, and then sample onto the observed part of the celestial sphere. We present a method for performing such simulations and show that it can be more efficient than full-sky simulations. We develop the method for scalar maps, but we expect it to be applicable to higher-spin (e.g., polarization) simulations as well.

          Saturn's G ring: insights from the dynamical evolution of dust particles from the G-ring arc

 - **Abstract**
 To explore the formation and properties of Saturn's G ring, we study the dynamics of micron-sized dust particles originating from the arc of debris near the inner edge of the ring. The dynamical evolution of particles due to various perturbation forces and the plasma sputtering that erodes the particles is simulated by a well-tested numerical code. Based on the simulation results, the normal $I/F$ of the G ring observed by the Cassini spacecraft can be explained by dust particles originating from the arc. Other properties of the G ring are also estimated, including the steady-state size distribution and the number density of ring particles, the geometric optical depth, the apparent edge-on thickness, the age and the remaining lifetime of the G ring. We find that the particle size distribution of the G ring follows a power law with an exponent of 2.8, and dust particles in the size range of $[5, 10]\,{\mu}$m are dominant within the ring. The average number density of particles of the G ring in the radial direction is about $10^{-3}$-$10^{-2}\,\mathrm{m}^{-3}$. The peak value of the edge-on geometric optical depth of the G ring is about $3.9\times10^{-2}$. The maximum apparent edge-on thickness of the G ring with the geometric optical depth larger than $1\times10^{-8}$ is approximately $9,000\,\mathrm{km}$. The age of the G ring is estimated to be $10^{6}$-$10^{7}\,\mathrm{years}$, and the remaining lifetime of the ring is on the order of $10^{4}\,\mathrm{years}$.

 - **Abstract**
 The Iron Stars XX Oph and AS 325, both binaries consisting of a Be + late K,M II star present remarkable optical spectra. Low velocity, dense winds from the late type star collide with high velocity, optically thin material expelled from the hot Be star producing a plethora of emission lines and complex P Cygni absorption profiles. The members of the American Association of Variable Star Observers have faithfully observed XX Oph for 85 years and AS 325 for 32 years. This long term photometric monitoring has revealed AS 325 to be an eclipsing system while XX Oph shows a complex light curve behavior. We present archival and recent photometry, new high-resolution optical imaging, and new high-resolution optical spectroscopy of the two stars. The orbital period of AS 325 is refined as 512.943 days and the stellar components are Be+K2.5 II. XX Oph is shown to be non-eclipsing and consists of Be+M6II stars.

We calculate minimum $\Delta V$ single-impulse direct transfer trajectories to 3I/ATLAS both from Earth and from Mars. We consider launch dates spanning January 2025 through March 2026 to explore obtainable and hypothetical mission scenarios. Post-discovery Earth departures require a challenging $\Delta V\gtrsim24$ km s$^{-1}$ to fly by 3I/ATLAS. By contrast, Mars departures from July 2025 - September 2025 require $\Delta V\sim5$ km s$^{-1}$ to achieve an early October flyby -- which is more feasible with existing propulsion capabilities. We discuss how existing spacecraft could be used to observe 3I/ATLAS and how spacecraft at other locations in the Solar System could be repurposed to visit future interstellar objects on short notice.

 - **Abstract**
 We revisit the theoretical modeling and simulation of a Gaussian stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) signal in a pulsar timing array (PTA). We show that the correlation between Fourier components of pulsar timing residuals can be expressed using transfer functions; that are indicative of characteristic temporal correlations in a SGWB signal observed in a finite time window. These transfer functions, when convolved with the SGWB power spectrum and spatial correlation (Hellings \& Downs curve), describe the variances and correlations of the pulsar timing residuals' Fourier coefficients. The convolutions are the exact frequency- and Fourier-domain representations of the time-domain covariance function. We derive explicit forms for the transfer functions for unpolarized and circularly polarized SGWB signals. We validate our results by comparing Gaussian theoretical expectation values with standard simulations based on point sources and our own covariance-matrix-based approach. The unified frequency- and Fourier-domain formalism provides a robust foundation for future PTA precision analyses and highlights the importance of temporal correlations in interpreting GW signals.

 - **Abstract**
 The case of Ross 176 is a late K-type star that hosts a promising water-world candidate planet. The star has a radius of $R_*$=0.569$\pm$0.020$R_{\odot}$ and a mass of $M_{\star}$ = 0.577 $\pm$ 0.024 $M_{\odot}$. We constrained the planetary mass using spectroscopic data from CARMENES, an instrument that has already played a major role in confirming the planetary nature of the transit signal detected by TESS. We used Gaussian Processes (GP) to improve the analysis because the host star has a relatively strong activity that affects the radial velocity dataset. In addition, we applied a GP to the TESS light curves to reduce the correlated noise in the detrended dataset. The stellar activity indicators show a strong signal that is related to the stellar rotation period of $\sim$ 32 days. This stellar activity signal was also confirmed on the TESS light curves. Ross 176b is an inner hot transiting planet with a low-eccentricity orbit of $e = 0.25 \pm 0.04$, an orbital period of $P \sim 5$ days, and an equilibrium temperature of $T_{eq}\sim 682K$. With a radius of $R_p = 1.84\pm0.08R_{\oplus}$ (4% precision), a mass of $M_p = 4.57^{+0.89}_{-0.93} M_{\oplus}$ (20% precision), and a mean density of $\rho_p = 4.03^{+0.49}_{-0.81} g cm^{-3}$, the composition of Ross 176b might be consistent with a water-world scenario. Moreover, Ross 176b is a promising target for atmospheric characterization, which might lead to more information on the existence, formation and composition of water worlds. This detection increases the sample of planets orbiting K-type stars. This sample is valuable for investigating the valley of planets with small radii around this type of star. This study also shows that the dual detection of space- and ground-based telescopes is efficient for confirm new planets.

 - **Abstract**
 A fraction of the Ultra Luminous X-ray (ULX) sources are known to be accreting neutron stars as they show coherent X-ray pulsations with pulse periods ranging from ~1-30 seconds. While initially thought to host intermediate-mass black holes, ULXs have since been recognized as a diverse class of objects, including ULX pulsars. These pulsars require models specifically tailored to account for their unique accretion physics, distinct from those used for Galactic black hole binaries. The X-ray spectra of all Galactic accreting X-ray pulsars (including sources in the Magellanic Clouds) are dominated by a high energy cut-off power-law and some of the sources show a soft excess, some emission lines, cyclotron absorption features, etc. In this work, we undertake a comprehensive analysis of the broadband X-ray spectra of five ULX pulsars using simultaneous XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observations and show that their X-ray spectra can be effectively described by spectral models, similar to those used for the local accretion-powered X-ray pulsars. A soft excess is detected in all the sources which is also consistent with the local X-ray pulsars that have low absorption column density. We have marginal detection or low upper limit on the presence of the iron K-alpha emission line from these sources, which is a key difference of the ULX pulsars with the local accreting X-ray pulsars. We discuss the implication of this on the nature of the binary companion and the accretion mechanism in the ULX pulsars.

 - **Abstract**
 The detection of the Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background (SGWB) is one of the most challenging tasks for both current and next-generation detectors. Successfully distinguishing the SGWB from instrumental noise and environmental effects requires accurate and flexible analysis tools capable of detecting the signal and determining its origin. In this paper, we introduce a unified framework and a user-friendly tool for SGWB characterization: \texttt{GWBird} (Gravitational Wave Background Inventory of Response functions for Detectors). This code enables the computation of overlap reduction functions (ORFs), power-law integrated sensitivity curves (PLS), angular response functions, and angular PLS (APLS). It supports the full range of gravitational wave polarization modes (tensor, scalar, and vector), allowing for the characterization of both isotropic and anisotropic SGWB components for all the polarizations. Additionally, the code includes functions for circular polarization characterization, which is particularly relevant for probing parity-violating signals. The framework integrates analyses for ground-based, space-based, and Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) detectors, offering a versatile framework for SGWB analysis. The \texttt{GWBird} code is publicly available at:~\github{this https URL}

 - **Abstract**
 In our previous work, we identified $\sim100,000$ metal-poor stars ([Fe/H] $<$ -1.0) from the LAMOST Survey. This work estimates their chemical abundances and explores the origin and evolution of the Galactic metal-poor disc. Our chemo-dynamical analysis reveals four main populations within the metal-poor disc: (1) a primordial disc older than 12 Gyr with [Fe/H] $>$ -1.5; (2) debris stars from the progenitor galaxy of Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE), but now residing in the Galactic disc; (3) the metal-poor tail of the metal-rich, high-$\alpha$ disc formed 10-12 Gyr ago, with metallicity lower limit extending to -2.0; (4) the metal-poor tail of the metal-rich, low-$\alpha$ disc younger than 8 Gyr, reaching a lower metallicity limit of -1.8. These results reveal the presence of a primordial disc and show that both high-$\alpha$ and low-$\alpha$ discs reach lower metallicities than previously thought. Analysis of merger debris reveals that Wukong, with extremely low metallicity, likely originate from merger events distinct from GSE. Additionally, three new substructures are identified: ShangGu-1, characterized by unusual [Fe/H]-eccentricity correlations; ShangGu-2, possibly heated disc stars; and ShangGu-3, which can be divided into four subgroups based on differing orbital directions, with two aligning with the previously known Nyx and Nyx-2.

 - **Abstract**
 Astrotourism has emerged as a powerful cross sectoral tool to promote science education, sustainable economic development, and cultural exchange. Recognising its potential, the International Astronomical Union's Office of Astronomy for Development (IAU OAD) has developed a suite of openly accessible resources to support individuals and institutions interested in implementing astrotourism initiatives globally. These resources also encourage individuals and existing businesses to broaden their offerings to include activities that use the night sky as a backdrop, such as food experiences, wellness practices, and cultural exploration. This paper offers a comprehensive summary of these resources, available on the OAD's Astrotourism Portal, and situates them within the broader context of astronomy for development work. The paper is targeted at educators, policymakers, tourism operators, grassroots organisers, and entrepreneurs, providing guidance on how they can foster inclusive, locally grounded, and sustainable astrotourism efforts, particularly in underresourced or emerging contexts.

 - **Abstract**
 We have developed a software pipeline, AutoWISP, for extracting high-precision photometry from citizen scientists' observations made with consumer-grade color digital cameras (digital single-lens reflex, or DSLR, cameras), based on our previously developed tool, AstroWISP. The new pipeline is designed to convert these observations, including color images, into high-precision light curves of stars. We outline the individual steps of the pipeline and present a case study using a Sony-alpha 7R II DSLR camera, demonstrating sub-percent photometric precision, and highlighting the benefits of three-color photometry of stars. Project PANOPTES will adopt this photometric pipeline and, we hope, be used by citizen scientists worldwide. Our aim is for AutoWISP to pave the way for potentially transformative contributions from citizen scientists with access to observing equipment.

          SDSO1 is a Ghost Planetary Nebula Bow Shock in Front of M31

 - **Abstract**
 We present new, deep narrow band imagery and discuss the nature of SDSO1, the large [O III]-emitting nebula centered 1.5 degrees SE of M31. We find strong evidence to support the hypothesis that SDSO1 is unrelated to M31 and is instead a bow shock driven by a faded, giant (D = 20 pc), 400 kyr-old, ghost planetary nebula (GPN) expelled by the symbiotic WD binary star EG Andromedae. Because EG And lags the rotation of the Milky Way, its hypersonic velocity of 107 km/s drives a shock into the local interstellar medium. SDSO1 also sports a 45-pc long turbulent tail that crosses M31. We establish the shock-powered GPN phase as a new phase of PN evolution, and identify seven more candidate GPNe by their large size and shock-tail morphology. This includes several giant halos of younger planetary nebulae, possibly expelled by now degenerate binary companions. The interaction of an old, fast-moving GPN with the ISM generates a shock that remains visible long after the photoionized PN shell has faded below the limit of detectability. The SDSO1 GPN has reached a phase in its evolution where its outward expansion has been slowed considerably by the work it has done on the interstellar medium. Once the GPN outflow expends the rest of its kinetic energy, it will be stripped from EG And and mix into the surrounding ISM.

 - **Abstract**
 Aerosols is an old topic in the young field of exoplanet atmospheres. Understanding what they are, how they form, and where they go has long provided a fertile playground for theorists. For observers, however, aerosols have been a multi-decade migraine, as their chronic presence hides atmospheric features. For hot Jupiters, the large day-night temperature contrast drives inhomogeneous thermal structures and aerosol distribution, leading to different limb properties probed by transit spectra. We present JWST NIRISS/SOSS spectra of morning and evening limbs for nine gas giants with equilibrium temperatures of ~800-1700 K. By measuring feature size of the 1.4 $\mu$m water band for both limbs, we found three planets (WASP-39 b, WASP-94 Ab, and WASP-17 b) show prominent ($>$5$\sigma$) limb-limb atmospheric opacity difference with muted morning and clear evening limbs. The heavily muted water features on morning limbs indicate high-altitude (0.1 to 0.01 mbar) aerosols. To simultaneously have clear evening limbs requires processes with timescales ($\sim$day) comparable to advection to remove these lofted grains, and we found that both downwelling flow and dayside cloud evaporation could be plausible mechanisms. We hypothesize an empirical boundary--termed the "asymmetry horizon"--in temperature-gravity space that marks the transition where inhomogeneous aerosol coverage begins to emerge. Heterogeneous aerosol coverage is common among hot Jupiters. If unrecognized, limb averaging suppresses spectral features, mimicking high-mean-molecular-weight atmospheres, inflating inferred metallicity by up to 2 dex, and underestimating limb temperatures by as much as half. Finally, we introduce the Limb Spectroscopy Metric (LSM) to predict limb spectral feature size based on planet parameters.

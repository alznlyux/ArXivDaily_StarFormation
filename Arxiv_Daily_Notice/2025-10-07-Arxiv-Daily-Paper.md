          Threading the Magellanic Needle: Hypervelocity Stars Trace the Past Location of the LMC

 - **Abstract**
 Recent discoveries have shown that a population of hypervelocity stars (HVSs) originate from the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). We use three such HVSs as dynamical tracers to constrain the past orbit of the LMC. Since each star was ejected at a finite time in the past, it must intersect the past position of the LMC's central black hole at its ejection time. We model the LMC's orbit under the influence of dynamical friction and extended mass distributions for both the LMC and the Milky Way, generating a large ensemble of orbital realizations. By evaluating which orbits intersect the back-integrated HVS trajectories, we compute posterior distributions over the LMC's orbital history. This approach provides significantly tighter constraints on the past motion of the LMC than previously possible. We find two previously published orbital models that are consistent with these new constraints: a first-passage trajectory from a self-consistent hydrodynamic simulation, and a second-passage trajectory from a collisionless N-body simulation. In parallel, we infer the present-day ejection site of the HVSs -- likely tracing the LMC's dynamical center and supermassive black hole -- independent of conventional methods.

          The LMC Corona as Evidence for a First Passage

 - **Abstract**
 We use constrained idealized simulations of the LMC/Milky Way interaction to determine if the size of the LMC's gaseous halo (Corona) can be used to distinguish between first and second passage models $-$ an orbital trajectory for the LMC in which it has just recently approached the Milky Way for the first time (first passage), or one in which it has had a previous pericenter (second passage). Using live circumgalactic gas particles combined with analytic dark matter potentials evolved to follow previously published orbital trajectories, we find that the first passage model is able to reproduce the observed velocity profile and column density profile of the present day LMC Corona. On the other hand, in a second passage scenario the longer interaction time leads to the velocities and column densities around the LMC at the present day being too low. Based on this observed velocity profile, recent works have found that the LMC's Corona has been truncated to 17$-$20 kpc, and we find truncation radii of $15.3\pm 0.9$ kpc and $7.6\pm 2.0$ kpc for the first and second passage models, respectively. Thus, based on the gas properties of the LMC's CGM at the present day, a second passage trajectory is disfavored.

          Faint supernovae and hyper-runaway white-dwarfs from single He-detonation in double HeCO-white-dwarf mergers

 - **Abstract**
 We present three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of mergers between low-mass hybrid HeCO white dwarfs (WDs), offering new insights into the diversity of thermonuclear transients. Unlike previously studied mergers involving higher-mass HeCO WDs and CO WDs, where helium detonation often triggers core ignition, our simulations reveal incomplete helium shell detonations in comparable-mass, lower-mass WD pairs. The result is a faint, rapidly evolving transient driven by the ejection of intermediate-mass elements and radioactive isotopes such as $^{48}$Cr and $^{52}$Fe, without significant $^{56}$Ni production. These transients may be detectable in upcoming wide-field surveys and could account for a subset of faint thermonuclear supernovae. Long-term evolution of the merger remnant shows that high-velocity PG-1159-type stars might be formed through this scenario, similar to normal CO-CO white dwarf mergers. This work expands our understanding of white dwarf mergers and their implications for nucleosynthesis and stellar evolution.

          The impact of internal versus external perturbations on close-in exoplanet architectures

 - **Abstract**
 Young planetary systems are subjected to different dynamical effects that can influence their orbital structure over time. In systems with more than one planet, other planets can internally influence each other, e.g. via planet-planet scattering. External perturbing effects also need to be taken into account, as stars do not form by themselves but together with other stars in young star-forming regions. This birth environment can externally affect young multi-planet systems, e.g. via fly-bys. Previous work has shown that the absence/presence and location of an outer giant planet around a close-in planet system do not change how these inner planets react to a single fly-by with another star. We further explore this by comparing the effects of these external perturbations on four close-in sub-Neptune planets to those caused by a situation where only the distant giant is perturbed by the same kind of encounter. Our results indicate that the close-in planet systems have a "preferred" end state after 500 Myr, which is reached regardless of how it was perturbed. In addition, the mass of the giant appears not to impact the reaction of the inner planet system in the scenario of an external perturbation in our tested set-ups, i.e. either a single 1 or 5 M_Jup giant placed at 2.5, 5, 10 or 20 au. However, the mass affects the subsequent evolution of the inner planets if only internal perturbations by the giant are considered. The reduction in mass leads to an absence of collisions during the 500 Myr.

          Updated Radio Sigma-D Relation and Distances to the Shell-Like Galactic Supernova Remnants -- IV

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new selected sample of 69 Galactic supernova remnants (SNRs) for calibration of radio $\Sigma-D$ relation at 1 GHz. Calibrators with the most reliable distances were selected through an extensive literature search. The calibration is performed using kernel smoothing of the selected sample of calibrators in $\Sigma-D$ plane and an orthogonal offsets fitting procedure. We use the obtained calibration to derive the distances to 164 Galactic SNRs and 27 new detected SNRs/SNR candidates with none or poor distance estimates. The analysis given in this paper confirms the expected predictions from our previous papers that the kernel smoothing method is more reliable for SNR distance calibration than the orthogonal offset fitting method, except for the distance determinations of the very low brightness SNRs.

          Spectral Mixture Modeling with Laboratory Near-Infrared Data I: Insights into Compositional Analysis of Europa

 - **Abstract**
 Europa's surface composition and physical characteristics are commonly constrained using spectral deconvolution through linear mixture (LM) modeling and radiative transfer-based (RT) intimate mixture modeling. Here, I compared the results of these two spectral modeling- LM versus RT- against laboratory spectra of water (H$_{2}$O) ice and sulfuric acid octahydrate (SAO; H$_{2}$SO$_{4}$$\cdot$8H$_{2}$O) mixtures measured at near-infrared wavelengths ($\sim$1.2-2.5 $\mu$m) with grain sizes of 90-106 $\mu$m (Hayes and Li, 2025). The modeled abundances indicate that the RT more closely reproduces the laboratory abundances, with deviations within $\pm$5% for both H$_{2}$O ice and H$_{2}$SO$_{4}$$\cdot$8H$_{2}$O with $\sim$100 $\mu$m grains. In contrast, the LM shows slightly larger discrepancies, typically ranging from $\pm$5-15% from the true abundances. Interestingly, both LM and RT tend to consistently overestimate the abundance of H$_{2}$SO$_{4}$$\cdot$8H$_{2}$O and underestimate H$_{2}$O ice across all mixtures. Nonetheless, when H$_{2}$SO$_{4}$$\cdot$8H$_{2}$O either dominates (>80% as observed on Europa's trailing hemisphere; Carlson et al. 2005) or is present only in trace amounts ($\sim$10% on areas in Europa's leading hemisphere; Dalton III et al. 2013; Ligier et al. 2016), both the LM and RT render acceptable results within $\pm$10% uncertainty. Thus, spectral modeling using the RT is preferred for constraining the surface composition across Europa, although the LM remains viable in specific compositional regimes.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observational evidence of axially symmetric anisotropies in the local cosmic expansion rate motivates an investigation of whether they can be accounted for within the Lemaître-Tolman-Bondi (LTB) framework with an off-center observer. Within this setting, we compute the exact relativistic luminosity distance via the Sachs equation and compare it with the approximate expression obtained from the covariant cosmographic approach (including Hubble, deceleration, jerk and curvature parameters). This comparison allows us to identify the regimes in which the covariant cosmographic method remains reliable. In addition, we compare the LTB relativistic distance for small inhomogeneities with the corresponding result derived from linear perturbation theory (LPT) in the standard cosmological model. This analysis establishes a precise correspondence between the LTB and LPT approaches, offering a consistent dictionary for the interpretation of the observed anisotropies of the large-scale gravitational field. This analysis will be instrumental in interpreting expansion-rate anisotropies, facilitating investigations of the local Universe beyond the FLRW framework with a fully non-perturbative metric approach.

          Effect of a Fine-Scale Layered Structure of the Atmosphere on Infrasound Signals from Fragmenting Meteoroids

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the influence of a fine-scale (FS) layered structure in the atmosphere on the propagation of infrasound signals generated by fragmenting meteoroids. Using a pseudo-differential parabolic equation (PPE) approach, we model broadband acoustic signals from point sources at altitudes of 35-100 km. The presence of FS fluctuations in the stratosphere (37-45 km) and the lower thermosphere (100-120 km) modifies ray trajectories, causing multiple arrivals and prolonged signal durations at ground stations. In particular, meteoroids fragmenting at 80-100 km can produce two distinct thermospheric arrivals beyond 150km range, while meteoroids descending to 50 km or below yield weak, long-lived arrivals within the acoustic shadow zone via antiguiding propagation and diffraction. Comparison with observed infrasound data confirms that FS-layered inhomogeneities can account for multi-arrival "N-waves," broadening potential interpretations of meteoroid signals. The results also apply to other atmospheric-entry objects, such as sample return capsules, emphasizing how FS structure impacts shock wave propagation. Our findings advance understanding of wavefield evolution in a layered atmosphere and have broad relevance for global infrasound monitoring of diverse phenomena (e.g., re-entry capsules, rocket launches, and large-scale explosions).

 - **Abstract**
 Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) is the next-generation ground-based gamma-ray observatory operating in the energy range from 20 GeV up to 300 TeV, with two sites in La Palma (Spain) and Paranal (Chile). It will consist of telescopes of three sizes, covering different parts of the large energy range. We report on the performance of Large-Sized Telescope prototype (LST-1) in the detection and characterization of extragalactic gamma-ray sources, with a focus on the reconstructed gamma-ray spectra and variability of classical bright BL Lacertae objects, which were observed during the early commissioning phase of the instrument. LST-1 data from known bright gamma-ray blazars - Markarian 421, Markarian 501, 1ES 1959+650, 1ES 0647+250, and PG 1553+113 - were collected between July 10, 2020, and May 23, 2022, covering a zenith angle range of 4 deg to 57 deg. The reconstructed light curves were analyzed using a Bayesian block algorithm to distinguish the different activity phases of each blazar. Simultaneous Fermi-LAT data were utilized to reconstruct the broadband $\gamma$-ray spectra for the sources during each activity phase. High-level reconstructed data in a format compatible with gammapy are provided together with measured light curves and spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for several bright blazars and an interpretation of the observed variability in long and short timescales. Simulations of historical flares are generated to evaluate the sensitivity of LST-1. This work represents the first milestone in monitoring bright BL Lacertae objects with a CTAO telescope.

          Revisiting Gaussian Process Reconstruction for Cosmological Inference: The Generalised GP (Gen GP) Framework

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate uncertainties in the estimation of the Hubble constant ($H_0$) arising from Gaussian Process (GP) reconstruction, demonstrating that the choice of kernel introduces systematic variations comparable to those arising from different cosmological models. To address this limitation, we introduce the Generalized Gaussian Process (Gen GP) framework, in which the Matérn smoothness parameter $\nu$ is treated as a free parameter, allowing for data-driven kernel optimization. Using the cosmic chronometer Hubble data, we find that while standard GP with $\Lambda$CDM mean function exhibits noticeable reconstruction differences between optimized and marginalized approaches, particularly at $z > 1$, Gen GP maintains methodological consistency. In Gen GP, slight increases in $\chi^2$ per degree of freedom relative to standard GP, for both the zero-mean and $\Lambda$CDM prior mean cases, reflect added flexibility rather than performance degradation. Our results emphasize that robust cosmological inference requires treating kernel parameters as free variables and implementing full Bayesian marginalization to avoid artificial precision from fixed hyperparameters. As machine learning becomes central to cosmological discovery, the Gen GP framework provides a principled approach to model-independent inference that properly accounts for methodological uncertainties while maintaining necessary flexibility for reliable parameter estimation.

          Formation and growth of intermediate-mass black holes in dense star clusters: Lessons from N-body and MOCCA Monte Carlo Simulations

 - **Abstract**
 Dense star clusters are promising nurseries for the formation and growth of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs; $\sim 10^2-10^5\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$), with increasing observational evidence pointing to their presence in massive star clusters and stripped dwarf-galaxy nuclei. During the early evolution of compact clusters, massive stars can rapidly segregate to the center, where frequent collisions may trigger the runaway growth of a very massive star (VMS). This object can subsequently collapse to form an IMBH or merge with a stellar-mass black hole. We carried out direct $N$-body and Monte Carlo simulations of star clusters with initial core densities between $10^6$ to $4\times 10^8\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}\,\mathrm{pc}^{-3}$ and total masses of $5.9\times 10^5$ and $1.3\times 10^6\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. These models show that IMBHs of $10^3-10^4\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ can form within $\leq 5$ Myr through the runaway collision channel. At later times, the IMBHs continue to grow through mergers with black holes, stars, and compact remnants, providing predictions testable with future gravitational-wave and transient surveys.

          Beyond CPL: Evidence for dynamical dark energy in three-parameter models
 - **Authors:** Sonej Alam, Md. Wali Hossain
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/
 - **Abstract**
 We introduce three-parameter extensions of the two-parameter minimal Akhtar-Hossain (mAH) parametrization, termed modified minimal AH (MmAH1,2), which provide greater flexibility in the dynamics of dark energy. These models are compared with $\Lambda$CDM, $w$CDM, mAH, CPL, and three-parameter CPL (CPL-$w_{\rm b}$) using a joint data set of the CMB compressed likelihood, DESI DR2, Pantheon$+$ supernovae, $H(z)$ measurements, and redshift-space distortions. While the common cosmological parameters remain stable across models, CPL and the MmAH1,2 yield modest improvements in fit, with $\Delta\chi^2\simeq -6$ to $-7$ and corresponding $\Delta{\rm AIC}\simeq -1$ to $-2$ relative to $\Lambda$CDM, suggesting a mild preference for dynamical dark energy. Statistical consistency with $\Lambda$CDM is quantified via the Mahalanobis distance in one, two, and three dimensional parameter subspaces. In 1D, the strongest deviation occurs for MmAH1 ($2.5\sigma$), followed by CPL ($2.3\sigma$). In 2D, CPL-$w_{\rm b}$ shows the highest discrepancy ($2.3\sigma$), while other models remain at the $1.7$-$2.1\sigma$ level. In 3D, CPL-$w_{\rm b}$ continues to exhibit the largest tension ($\sim2\sigma$), though this arises in the presence of very strong correlations, particularly between $w_{\rm a}$ and $w_{\rm b}$, whereas the MmAH extensions display slightly weaker but still non-negligible discrepancies ($1.4$-$1.8\sigma$). Overall, these results indicate consistent evidence for departures from $\Lambda$CDM.

 - **Abstract**
 The atmospheres of low-temperature brown dwarfs and gas giant planets are expected to contain the phosphine molecule, PH$_3$ However, previous observations have shown much lower abundances of this molecule than predicted by atmospheric chemistry models. We report JWST spectroscopic observations of phosphine in the atmosphere of the brown dwarf Wolf 1130C. Multiple absorption lines due to phosphine are detected around 4.3 ${\mu}$m, from which we calculate a phosphine abundance of 0.100$\pm$0.009 parts per million. This abundance is consistent with disequilibrium atmospheric chemistry models that reproduce the phosphine abundances in Jupiter and Saturn, and is much higher than abundances previously reported for other brown dwarfs or exoplanets.

 As a continuation of DRAGON-II, we present the DRAGON-III project, which focuses on the simulations of million-body globular clusters and nuclear clusters over 10 Gyr. We report on its preliminary results on globular clusters. The first 100 Myr of the simulations have produced 41 pulsars, 191 X-ray binaries, 17 gravitational wave sources, and one black hole-black hole merger due to the loss of orbital energy in the form of gravitational wave emission. The inclusion of initial soft binaries brings surprisingly interesting results, including one IMBH in a binary black hole, and compact object binaries resembling the Gaia-BH1 and the wide black hole-giant binary reported in Wang et al. (2024, Nat. Astro.).

          Methanol emission tracing ice chemistry and dust evolution in the TW Hya protoplanetary disk

 - **Abstract**
 Methanol (CH$_{3}$OH) ice is abundant in space and is a key feedstock for seeding chemical complexity in interstellar and circumstellar environments. Despite its ubiquity, gas-phase methanol has only been detected in one disk around a Solar-type star to date, TW Hya. Here we present new high sensitivity (~1 mJy/beam) observations of TW Hya with ALMA that detect four individual transitions of gas-phase methanol spanning upper level energies from 17 to 38 K. We confirm the presence of gas-phase methanol in the luke-warm molecular layer of the disk ($35.9^{+25.9}_{-10.6}$ K) and with a disk-integrated column density of $1.8^{+1.3}_{-0.5}\times 10^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$. A radially-resolved analysis suggests that the gas-phase methanol is centrally compact, peaking within the spatial extent of the mm-sized dust grains ($\lesssim 80$ au). Static gas-grain chemical disk models confirm photodesorption as an important mechanism releasing methanol into the gas phase, with the column density further boosted by the inclusion of grain-surface chemistry, reactive desorption, and an increase in dust-grain surface area assuming fractal grains. However, no model can fully reproduce the observed column density nor the radial distribution, and we suggest that the inclusion of dynamic processes such as vertical mixing and radial drift would be required to do so. Our results demonstrate that the abundance and distribution of the precursors for complex chemistry in the planet-forming regions around Solar-type stars is ultimately controlled by the interplay of grain surface chemistry coupled with the evolution of dust in their disks.

          Crosschecking Cosmic Distances from DESI BAO and DES SNe Points to Systematics

 - **Abstract**
 We perform a consistency check of DESI DR2 BAO constraints ($D_M/r_d, D_H/r_d)$ by reconstructing the same quantities from DES supernovae (SNe) in bins with the same effective redshift $z_{\textrm{eff}}$. We find that the ratio of $D_M/r_d$ values are consistent with a horizontal, thus confirming that the distance duality relation holds up to calibration. However, the $D_H/r_d$ ratio shows a decreasing trend with $z_{\textrm{eff}}$ at $2.3 \sigma$ to $2.5 \sigma$ that cannot be explained by physics. We demonstrate that the result does not depend on the choice of cosmological model, but the radius of the sound horizon $r_d$ has a much greater influence. Studying ratios of $D_H/r_d$ is a stronger test than the distance duality relation, and the rejection of a horizontal confirms systematics in either DESI BAO or DES SNe. Claims of new physics based on combined data still have rudimentary hurdles to clear.

          Is CPL dark energy a mirage?

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) raise doubts about the standard cosmological model, $\Lambda$CDM, suggesting a preference for an inherently dynamical dark energy component. The Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parameterization -- a widely used two-parameter model for the dark energy equation of state -- displays marked early-time phantom behavior and a recent crossing of the phantom divide. These features suggest the convenience to check observationally the robustness of such evolution. To address this, we design two alternative families of two-parameter dark energy parameterizations which remain close to the original CPL but aim to soften its phantom character. Specifically, these models reproduce CPL-like behavior at low redshift but mitigate early phantom behavior through the use of smooth sigmoid transitions, yielding a more gradual evolution. By combining recent DESI data with constraints from the cosmic microwave background and Type Ia supernovae, we assess the viability of these models. Our analysis shows that CPL remains a strong and competitive parameterization, with the proposed alternatives only marginally favored or disfavored. We conclude that current observational data lack the statistical precision to decisively distinguish between CPL and similarly constructed parameterizations across the redshift range probed by late-time observables.

          Limiting the Yukawa Gravity through the Black Hole Shadows of Sgr A* and M87*

 - **Abstract**
 Recently, the \textit{EHT} collaboration unveiled the shadow images of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) M87* and Sgr A*, with angular radii of $42\pm3$\,$\mu$as and $48.7\pm7.0$\,$\mu$as, respectively. These observations are consistent with the shadow of a Kerr black hole in general relativity (GR). Observations of the shadow of SMBHs can be used to test modified gravity theories, including Yukawa gravity, in extremely strong fields. In this paper, we illustrate the shadows of Yukawa black holes, showing that their sizes are significantly influenced by the Yukawa parameters $\lambda$ and $\kappa$. Using the EHT observations of M87* and Sgr A*, we obtain constraints on the Yukawa parameters. For Sgr A*, Keck and VLTI provide different priors on its gravitational radius. The Sgr A* shadow yields $\kappa=-0.04^{+0.09}_{-0.10}$ for $\lambda>1$\,AU with the Keck prior, while $\kappa=-0.08^{+0.09}_{-0.06}$ with the VLTI prior. As $\lambda$ decreases, the constraints weaken, reaching $-0.37<\kappa <0.17$ (Keck prior) and $-0.47<\kappa<0.04$ (VLTI prior) at $\lambda=0.1$\,AU. For M87*, with a mass significantly larger than Sgr A*, this system can only put constraints on $\kappa$ at larger $\lambda$. For $\lambda>1.5\times10^4$\,AU, the \textit{EHT} observation of M87* yields $\kappa=-0.01^{+0.17}_{-0.17}$. No significant deviation from GR is detected in our analysis. Additionally, we explore potential constraints using the next-generation VLBI, like \textit{ngEHT} and the Black Hole Explorer (BHEX), which promise the detection of the second ring of photons. The improved angular resolution and the measurements of the second ring could substantially refine constraints on the Yukawa parameters, enhancing our ability to test deviations from GR in the strong-field regime.

 - **Abstract**
 CTA 1 is a shell-type supernova remnant (SNR) with a central pulsar wind nebula (PWN), visible at very-high-energy (VHE) from 50 GeV to 100 TeV from a moderately extended emission region. While general consensus concludes the VHE emission originates from relativistic leptons accelerated by the PWN and undergoing inverse Compton scattering, questions remain about electron escape and propagation, as well as the evolutionary stage of this particular PWN. CTA 1 is on the cusp of middle age (~13 kyr) and spatially resolvable at energies visible to imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs), such as the Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System (VERITAS) (PSF < 0.1 deg). Therefore, this remnant is an excellent candidate to study lepton propagation and escape between different PWN evolutionary stages. Since the initial VERITAS publication on CTA 1 in 2013, VERITAS has performed new observations, adding to a total exposure of about 120 hours. We have analyzed the entire VERITAS CTA 1 dataset to date and report results.

 - **Abstract**
 We have identified more than a hundred close triply eclipsing hierarchical triple star systems from data taken with the space telescope TESS. Many of them have outer periods less than or, close to 100 days, hence, we call them `ultracompact hierarchical triples'. These systems are noteworthy in that we can potentially determine their dynamical and astrophysical parameters with a high precision, in many cases even without radial velocity data. In the present paper we report the comprehensive study of ten new ultracompact triply eclipsing triple star systems, located in the northern ecliptic hemisphere, taken from this larger sample: TICs 198581208, 265274458, 283846096, 337993842, 351404069, 378270875, 403792414, 403916758, 405789362, 461500036. Most of the data for this study come from TESS observations, but we obtained supplemental ground-based photometric measurements for two of the systems. The eclipse timing variation curves extracted from the TESS and the ground-based follow up data, the photometric light curves, and the spectral energy distribution are combined in a complex photodynamical analysis to yield the stellar and orbital parameters of all ten systems. The outer periods are in the range of 46.8-101.4 days. We found third-body forced, rapid apsidal motion in four systems. Moreover, TIC 403916758 was found to be a double twin triple (i.e. both the inner and the outer mass ratios are close to unity). All of the systems are substantially flat, with mutual inclination angles of $<5^o$. Finally, we have taken the results for the ten systems in the present paper, and combined them with the system parameters for more than 30 other compact triples that we have reported on in previous work, in order to examine some of the global properties of these systems on a statistical basis.

 These notes review theoretical models of massive black hole formation, growth and observables. They start with a brief summary of basic properties of massive black hole properties. The current view on massive black holes and active galactic nuclei at high redshift is then summarized, highlighting the JWST ``revolution'' and the questions raised by the recent observations. The notes then touch on massive black hole formation and growth mechanisms, emphasizing the processes at play at early cosmic times. Then techniques for modeling the cosmic massive black hole evolution, are reviewed with an emphasis on cosmological simulations, before approaching how observables are derived from models. They conclude with a section reflecting on the main questions on the JWST-discovered population in light of the material presented in the earlier sections.

 - **Abstract**
 Low-frequency radio data improve the sensitivity of pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) to propagation effects such as dispersion measure (DM) variations, enabling better noise characterization essential for detecting the stochastic gravitational wave background (GWB). We combined LOFAR (100-200 MHz) and NenuFAR (30-90 MHz) observations with the recent European and Indian PTA release (DR2new+) into a new dataset, DR2low, spanning ~11 years for 12 pulsars. DR2low allows updated noise models, increasing PTA sensitivity to the GWB. Using Libstempo and Enterprise, we applied standard noise models including red noise (RN) and time-variable DM (DMv) as power laws, and performed Bayesian model selection over RN, DMv, and an additional chromatic noise term (CN4). Compared to DR2new+, DR2low improves DM constraints and separates DM and RN contributions. We found that the RN is required in the final model for 10 out of 12 pulsars, compared to only 5 in the DR2new+ dataset. The improved sensitivity to plasma effects provided by DR2low also favors the identification of significant CN4 in eight pulsars, while none showed such evidence in DR2new+. The analysis also reveals unmodelled solar wind effects, particularly near solar conjunction, with residual delays absorbed into the DM component, highlighting the importance of accurately modelling the solar wind in PTA datasets.

 The exponential growth of data in Astrophysics and Cosmology demands scalable computational tools and intuitive interfaces for analysis and visualization. In this work, we present an innovative integration of the VisIVO scientific visualization framework with the InterActive Computing (IAC) service at Cineca, enabling interactive, high-performance visual workflows directly within HPC environments. Through seamless integration into Jupyter-based science gateways, users can now access GPU-enabled compute nodes to perform complex 3D visualizations using VisIVO via custom Python wrappers and preconfigured interactive notebooks. We demonstrate how this infrastructure simplifies access to advanced HPC resources, enhances reproducibility, and accelerates exploratory workflows in astronomical research. Our approach has been validated through a set of representative use cases involving large-scale simulations from the GADGET code, highlighting the effectiveness of this system in visualizing the large-scale structure of the Universe. This work exemplifies how science gateways can bridge domain-specific tools and advanced infrastructures, fostering user-centric, scalable, and reproducible research environments.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Edge-on disks offer a unique opportunity to directly examine their vertical structure, providing valuable insights into planet formation processes. We investigate the dust properties, as well as the CO and HCO$^+$ gas properties, in the edge-on disk surrounding the T Tauri star 2MASS J04202144+281349 (SSTTau042021). Aims. We estimate the radial and vertical temperature and density profile for the gas and the dust. Methods. We use ALMA archival data of CO isotopologues and continuum emission at 2, 1.3 and 0.9 mm together with new NOEMA HCO$^+$ 3-2 observations. We retrieve the gas and dust disk properties using the tomographic method and the \textsc{DiskFit} model. Results. The vertical CO emission appears very extended, partly tracing the H$_2$ wind observed by JWST. C$^{18}$O, $^{13}$CO and HCO$^+$ emission characterize the bulk of the molecular layer. The dust and gas have a mid-plane temperatures of $\sim 7-11$ K. The temperature of the molecular layer (derived from $^{13}$CO and HCO$^+$) is on the order of 16 K. HCO$^+$ 3-2 being thermalized, we derive a lower limit for the H$_2$ volume density of $\sim 3 \times 10^6$ cm$^{-3}$ at radius 100-200 au between 1 and 2 scale heights. The atmosphere temperature of the CO gas is of the order $\sim$ 31 K at a radius of 100 au. We directly observe CO and HCO$^+$ gas onto the mid-plane beyond the dust outer radius ($\ge 300$ au). The (gas+dust) disk mass estimated up to a radius of 300 au is on the order of $4.6 \times 10^{-2} \mathrm{M}_\odot$. Conclusions. Thanks to the favorable disk inclination, we present the first quantitative evidence for vertical molecular stratification with direct observation of CO and HCO$^+$ gas along the mid-plane. We estimate the temperature profile with temperature of 7-11 K near the mid-plane, and 15-20 K in the dense part of the molecular layer up to $\sim$ 35 K above.

 - **Abstract**
 Extra radiation injection after neutrino decoupling in the early Universe contributes to the effective number of neutrino species that can be constrained by the cosmic microwave background (CMB). However, any effective neutrino number itself cannot uniquely determine the underlying source. We argue that the degeneracy can be relaxed by CMB spectral distortions, which are caused by energy exchange between the extra radiation and photons. We consider neutrinogenic CMB spectral distortions, where extra energy is released in the form of neutrinos but still creates the CMB spectral distortions via electroweak interactions. The synergy between the effective neutrino number and CMB spectral distortions provides a complementary probe of hidden sectors that dominantly couple to neutrinos, opening up parameter space that can be targeted by joint CMB anisotropy and spectral distortion experiments.

          Stochastic instantons and the tail of the inflationary density perturbation

 - **Abstract**
 In the "stochastic $\delta N$ formalism", the statistics of the inflationary density perturbation are obtained from the first passage distribution of a stochastic process. We develop a general framework in which to evaluate the rare tail of this distribution, based on an instanton approximation to a path integral representation for the transition probability. We relate our formalism to the Schwinger-Keldysh path integral, by integrating out short wavelength degrees of freedom to produce an influence functional. This provides a principled way to extend the calculation beyond the slow-roll limit, and to models with multiple fields. We argue that our framework has a number of advantages in comparison with existing methods. In particular, it reliably captures the tail behaviour in cases where existing techniques do not apply, including cases where the noise amplitude has strong time dependence. We demonstrate the method by computing the tail probability in a number of scenarios, including a beyond-slow-roll analysis of a linear potential, ultra-slow-roll, and constant-roll inflation. We find close agreement with results already reported in the literature. Finally, we discuss a scenario with exponentially decaying noise amplitude. This is a model for the stochastic evolution of a fixed comoving volume of spacetime on superhorizon scales. In this case we show that the tail reverts to a Gaussian weight.

 - **Abstract**
 Context: Astronomical imaging aims to maximize signal capture while minimizing noise. Enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio directly on detectors is difficult and expensive, leading to extensive research in advanced post-processing techniques. Aims: Removing background noise from images is a valuable pre-processing step catalog-building tasks. We introduce BGRem, a machine learning (ML) based tool to remove background noise from astronomical images. Methods: BGRem uses a diffusion-based model with an attention U-Net as backbone, trained on simulated images for optical and gamma ({\gamma})-ray data from the MeerLICHT and Fermi-LAT telescopes. In a supervised manner, BGRem learns to denoise astronomical images over several diffusion steps. Results: BGRem performance was compared with a widely used tool for cataloging astronomical sources, SourceExtractor (SExtractor). It was shown that the amount of true positive sources using SExtractor increased by about 7% for MeerLICHT data when BGRem was used as a pre-processing step. We also show the generalizability of BGRem by testing it with optical images from different telescopes and also on simulated {\gamma}-ray data representative of the Fermi-LAT telescope. We show that in both cases, BGRem improves the source detection efficiency. Conclusions: BGRem can improve the accuracy in source detection of traditional pixel-based methods by removing complex background noise. Using zero-shot approach, BGRem can generalize well to a wide range of optical images. The successful application of BGRem to simulated {\gamma}-ray images, alongside optical data, demonstrates its adaptability to distinct noise characteristics and observational domains. This cross-wavelength performance highlights its potential as a general-purpose background removal framework for multi-wavelength astronomical surveys.

 Aims. We have determined Sr abundance in a sample of 31 red giant branch stars located in the Galactic globular cluster 47 Tuc with the aim to identify potential differences in the Sr abundance between first population (1P, Na-poor) and second population (2P, Na-rich) stars. Methods. We derived the Na and Sr abundances from the archival spectra obtained with the UVES spectrograph. To do this, we used 1D ATLAS9 model atmospheres and a 1D local thermodynamic equilibrium spectral synthesis method. Particular attention was paid to assessing the potential impact of CN line blending on the obtained Sr abundances. Furthermore, we evaluated the potential influence of convection on the Sr line formation by using 3D hydrodynamical model atmospheres computed with the CO5BOLD code. Results. Our results suggest a weak correlation between the abundances of Sr and Na. Together with a similar correlation between the abundances of Zr and Na determined in our previous study, our analysis of Sr suggests that polluters that have enriched 2P stars with light elements may have produced some s-process elements as well. The mean Sr abundance determined in 31 red giant branch stars of 47~Tuc is $\langle {\rm [Sr/Fe]} \rangle = 0.18\pm0.08$ (the error denotes the standard deviation due to the star-to-star abundance scatter). This value is within the range of the Sr abundance variation that is observed in Galactic field stars of similar metallicity. The mean [Sr/Zr] abundance ratio in our sample stars suggests that the two s-process elements could have been synthesized by either low-mass asymptotic giant branch stars ($M=1-4 {\rm M}_{\odot}$) or massive ($M=10-20 {\rm M}_{\odot}$) fast-rotating ($v_{\rm rot}=200-300$ km/s) stars.

 - **Abstract**
 The infall of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) into the Milky Way (MW) has displaced the MW's centre of mass, manifesting as an observed reflex motion in the velocities of outer halo stars. We use a Simulation Based Inference framework to constrain properties of the MW, LMC and the induced reflex motion using the dynamics of outer MW halo stars. Specifically, we use the mean radial and tangential velocities of outer halo stars calculated in a set of distance and on-sky bins. We train neural networks to estimate parameter posterior distributions using a set of $128,000$ rigid MW--LMC simulations conditioned upon velocity data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and the combined H3+SEGUE+MagE outer halo surveys. We constrain the reflex motion velocity and the enclosed MW and LMC masses within $50 \, \rm kpc$ using the DESI or H3+SEGUE+MagE dataset while varying the survey sky coverage and depth. We find the most precise constraints by using the radial and tangential velocity data from the H3+SEGUE+MagE survey and on-sky quadrant sky coverages. We report a reflex motion velocity, the speed at which the MW lurches towards the LMC, of $v_{\rm{travel}} = 26.4^{+5.5}_{-4.4} \, \rm km \, \rm s^{-1}$, while simultaneously finding an enclosed LMC mass of $M_{\rm LMC}(< 50 \, \rm kpc) = 9.2^{+1.9}_{-2.3} \times 10^{10}\, \rm M_{\odot}$ and enclosed MW mass of $M_{\rm MW}(< 50 \, \rm kpc) = 4.4^{+0.7}_{-0.7} \times 10^{11}\, \rm M_{\odot}$. Our results suggest that the LMC's total mass is at least $\approx 10-15 \%$ of that of the MW. This inference framework is flexible such that it can provide rapid and reliable constraints when applied to any future survey measuring the velocities of outer halo stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Massive stars exhibit a perplexing mismatch between their inferred masses from different observational techniques, posing a significant challenge to our understanding of stellar evolution and structure. This discrepancy is believed to be caused by the underestimation of the convective core masses. The efficiency of such measurement is usually impaired by a lot of processes at work in the interior of the stars such as convective core overshooting and interior rotation. By integrating the precision of asteroseismology which provides insights into the internal structure and dynamics of stars, with the detailed observational constraints offered by eclipsing binary systems, this study aims to precisely characterize a sample of massive stars in eclipsing binaries to infer their properties and evolutionary state. In this paper, the sample, observed photometrically with TESS and spectroscopically with SALT HRS, CHIRON, HERMES and a spectrograph at Skalnate Pleso Observatory between 2021 and 2024, are analyzed. The orbital elements as well as the basic stellar parameters of the targets in the sample are fitted to derive the geometry of their orbits as well as their absolute parameters. The asteroseismic properties of the targets are also obtained, which unravel their core dynamics and profiles. This is a precursor work that provides detailed characterization of the targets in the sample for future theoretical modeling.

 - **Abstract**
 When debris from a star that experienced a tidal disruption events (TDE) after passing too close to a massive black hole returns to pericenter on the second passage, it is compressed, leading to the formation of nozzle shocks (in the orbital plane) and pancake shocks (perpendicular to the orbital plane). Resolving these shocks is a long-standing problem in the hydrodynamic simulations of parabolic TDEs. Excessive numerical energy dissipation or heating unrealistically expands the stream. In this Letter, we apply adaptive particle refinement to our 3D general relativistic smoothed particle simulations to locally increase the resolution near the pericenter. We achieve resolutions equivalent to $6.55\times10^{11}$ particles, allowing us to converge on the true energy dissipation. We conclude that only $4\times10^{-5}$ of the orbital energy is dissipated in nozzle shocks for a Sun-like star tidally disrupted by a $10^6$ solar-mass black hole, therefore the nozzle shocks are unlikely to be important in the evolution of TDEs.

 - **Abstract**
 LTT-9779 b is an ultra-hot Neptune (Rp ~ 4.7 Re, Mp ~ 29 Me) orbiting its Sun-like host star in just 19 hours, placing it deep within the "hot Neptune desert," where Neptunian planets are seldom found. We present new JWST NIRSpec G395H phase-curve observations that probe its atmospheric composition in unprecedented detail. At near-infrared wavelengths, which penetrate the high-altitude clouds inferred from previous NIRISS/SOSS spectra, thermal emission reveals a carbon-rich atmosphere with opacity dominated by carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2). Both species are detected at all orbital phases, with retrieved mixing ratios of 10^-1 for CO and 10^-4 for CO2, indicating a globally well-mixed reservoir of carbon-bearing gases. We also moderately detect water vapor (H2O) and tentatively detect sulfur dioxide (SO2), providing insight into its chemistry and possible photochemical production under intense stellar irradiation. From these detections we infer a carbon-to-oxygen ratio near unity (C/O ~ 1) and a metallicity exceeding 500X Solar, consistent with equilibrium chemistry predictions for high-temperature atmospheres. This enrichment raises the mean molecular weight, reducing atmospheric escape, and likely helps LTT-9779 b retain a substantial atmosphere despite extreme irradiation. Our findings show that LTT-9779 b survives where few planets can, maintaining a carbon-rich atmosphere in a region where hot Neptune-class worlds are expected to evaporate. This makes LTT-9779 b a valuable laboratory for studying atmospheric escape and chemical processes under extreme conditions, offering new insight into the survival of planets in the hot Neptune desert.

 - **Abstract**
 The observational properties of core-collapse supernovae (CC-SNe) are shaped by the envelopes of their progenitors. In massive binary systems, mass-transfer alters the pre-SN structures compared to single stars, leading to a diversity in SN explosions. Aims. We compute the distribution of CC-SN properties based on comprehensive detailed grids of single and binary stellar evolution models. We conduct a grid-based population synthesis to produce a synthetic population of CC-SNe, and compare it to observed SN samples. We also apply various explodability and merger criteria to our models. In line with earlier results, we identify interacting SN progenitors as those stars that undergo CC during or shortly after a Roche-lobe overflow phase. With an interacting binary fraction of 68%, our models predict two-thirds of all CC-SNe to be of Type IIP/L, and 1/3 of Type Ibc, in agreement with recent volume-limited SN surveys. We find that 76% of the Type Ibc SN progenitors took part in a previous binary mass transfer (mostly as mass donor), but also 63% of the Type IIP/L SN progenitors (mostly as mass gainers), yielding a much broader envelope mass distribution than expected from single stars. We find that mass-transfer induced interacting SNe make up ~5% of all CC-SNe, which is close to the observed fractions of Type IIn and Type Ibn SNe. When assuming a disk or toroidal CSM geometry for Type IIn SNe, our models predict a bimodal distribution of the radiated energies, similar to that deduced from observations. While we find the effect of binary evolution on the relative number of Type Ibc and Type IIP/L SNe to be moderate, it leads to lower average ejecta masses in Type Ibc and Type IIb SNe, and can lead to higher pre-SN masses in Type IIP/L SNe than single stars. Binary models are also able to reproduce the number and properties of interacting SNe.

 - **Abstract**
 This is the second paper in the HOWLS (higher-order weak lensing statistics) series exploring the usage of non-Gaussian statistics for cosmology inference within \textit{Euclid}. With respect to our first paper, we develop a full tomographic analysis based on realistic photometric redshifts which allows us to derive Fisher forecasts in the ($\sigma_8$, $w_0$) plane for a \textit{Euclid}-like data release 1 (DR1) setup. We find that the 5 higher-order statistics (HOSs) that satisfy the Gaussian likelihood assumption of the Fisher formalism (1-point probability distribution function, $\ell$1-norm, peak counts, Minkowski functionals, and Betti numbers) each outperform the shear 2-point correlation functions by a factor $2.5$ on the $w_0$ forecasts, with only marginal improvement when used in combination with 2-point estimators, suggesting that every HOS is able to retrieve both the non-Gaussian and Gaussian information of the matter density field. The similar performance of the different estimators\inlinecomment{, with a slight preference for Minkowski functionals and 1-point probability distribution function,} is explained by a homogeneous use of multi-scale and tomographic information, optimized to lower computational costs. These results hold for the $3$ mass mapping techniques of the \textit{Euclid} pipeline: aperture mass, Kaiser--Squires, and Kaiser--Squires plus, and are unaffected by the application of realistic star masks. Finally, we explore the use of HOSs with the Bernardeau--Nishimichi--Taruya (BNT) nulling scheme approach, finding promising results towards applying physical scale cuts to HOSs.

 - **Abstract**
 The high-frequency resolution of the four-year $\textit{Kepler}$ time series allows detailed study of seismic modes in luminous giants. Seismic observables help infer interior structures via comparisons with stellar models. We aim to investigate differences between H-shell (Red-Giant Branch; RGB) and He-burning (red clump and Asymptotic-Giant Branch; AGB) stars in the He-II ionisation zone and the sensitivity of seismic parameters to input physics in stellar models. We used a grid of stellar models with masses $0.8-2.5M_\odot$ and metallicities $-1.0-0.25$dex, including mass loss, overshooting, thermohaline mixing, and rotation-induced mixing. P-mode frequencies were inferred by suppressing g-modes in the core. The main factors affecting seismic observables are stellar mass and metallicity. The He-II glitch amplitude in the local large frequency separation $\Delta\nu$ correlates with the He-II ionisation zone density, explaining observed differences between RGB and clump/AGB stars. That amplitude exceeds 10% of $\Delta\nu$ in high-luminosity giants, making the asymptotic expansion less accurate when $\Delta\nu \le 0.5\,\mu$Hz. Mass loss on the RGB and rotation-induced mixing from the main sequence to the early-AGB produce phase differences in the He-II glitch modulation signature between RGB and clump/AGB stars. Efficient RGB mass loss (for $M \le 1.5\,M_\odot$) and mixing processes (for $M \ge 1.5\,M_\odot$) leave detectable signatures in p-mode frequencies, enabling classification of red giants.

 - **Abstract**
 Dark Matter remains a great mystery in modern physics. Among various candidates, the weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) scenario stands out and is under extensive study. The detection of the hypothetical gamma-ray emission from WIMP annihilation could act as a direct probe of electroweak-scale interactions, complementing DM collider searches and other direct DM detection techniques. At very high energies (VHE), WIMP self-annihilation is expected to produce gamma rays together with other Standard Model particles. The galactic center (GC), due to its relative proximity to the Earth and its high expected DM density, is a prime target for monoenergetic line searches. IACTs have placed strong constraints on the DM properties at the GC, with the MAGIC providing the most stringent limits from 20 TeV to 100 TeV, exploiting large zenith angle (LZA) observations. However, the limited field of view (FoV) of the MAGIC telescopes (< 3.5° ) prevented a detailed study of the extended region around the GC in which an enhanced DM density is expected. The LST-1 of the CTAO, located at the Roque de Los Muchachos Observatory (La Palma, Spain), close to the MAGIC site, has been observing the GC since 2021. With its wide FoV of 4.5°, LST-1 could contribute significantly to the WIMPs search at the GC. The observations are performed at LZA (ZA > 58°), which, while required due to the source's low altitude, also optimizes the detection of gamma rays up to 100 TeV and beyond. We present a study of the systematic uncertainties in WIMP line emission searches with LST-1. Our work examines the instrument response functions for LZA observations, background rejection in monoscopic mode, and includes updated results from simulations, highlighting new methods for spectral line searches.

 - **Abstract**
 Planets and their host stars form from the same cloud of gas and dust, so we assume that their chemical compositions are linked. However, a clear correlation between rocky planet interior properties and host star chemistry remains elusive for planets around FGK dwarfs, and non-existent for planets around M dwarfs because cool stars frequently lack detailed chemical information. Here, we investigate the relationship between small (R$_{P}$ $\leq$ 1.8 R$_{\oplus}$) planet densities and host star elemental abundances. We use the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-V/Milky Way Mapper and an accompanying data-driven framework to obtain abundances for FGK and M dwarf hosts of 22 rocky planets. We find that planet densities exhibit a strong, inverse relationship to [Mg/Fe] abundances of FGK hosts (p = 0.001). This correlation becomes more significant with the addition of M dwarf hosts (p = 0.0005). If we assume that rocky planets have terrestrial-like compositions, this suggests that low [Mg/Fe] environments form planets with larger Fe-rich cores and thus higher densities. The thick disk planets in our sample help anchor this trend, illustrating the importance of sampling exoplanet properties across a range of host star populations. This finding highlights the connection between Galactic chemical evolution and rocky planet formation, and indicates that Earth-like planet compositions may vary significantly across different regions of the Galaxy.

 S$H_0$ES 2016-2022 $HVI$ data for classical Cepheids in the keystone galaxy NGC4258 yield doubly discordant Wesenheit Leavitt functions:~$\Delta W_{0,H-VI} = -0.13\pm0^{m}.02$ ($-0^{m}.17$ unweighted) and that is paired with a previously noted $\Delta W_{0,I-VI}\simeq-0^{m}.3$, which in concert with complimentary evidence suggest the 2016 S$H_0$ES NGC4258-anchored $H_0 \pm \sigma_{H_0}$ warrants scrutiny (i.e., $\sigma_{H_0}/{H_0}\gtrsim 6$\%). Cepheid distance uncertainties are further exacerbated by extinction law ambiguities endemic to such Leavitt relations (e.g., NGC4258), particularly for comparatively obscured variables (e.g., $\Delta d \gtrsim 4$\%, reddened Cepheid subsamples in the Milky Way, M31, NGC2442, NGC4424, NGC5643, NGC7250). Lastly, during the analysis it was identified that the 2022 S$H_0$ES database relays incorrect SMC Cepheid photometry.

 - **Abstract**
 The localization of X-ray counterparts to gravitational wave events requires a telescope with accurate localization capability in a field of view comparable to the region constrained by the gravitational wave detectors. In the context of a small, dedicated, mission, we investigate which optical design could satisfy this capability. We compare the possible optical designs that have been proposed for X-rays: the Lobster Eye design (both in the Angel and Schmidt variant) - inspired by the eyes of crustaceans - consisting of many small capillaries where grazing incidence reflection occurs, the Kirkpatrick-Baez design, where double reflection occurs on two orthogonal parabolic mirrors, and the standard Wolter-I design. We find that the first two designs, compared to the latter, can achieve a significantly larger field of view, and have a good localization capability if the focal length is longer than existing Lobster Eye designs. The Kirkpatrick-Baez design presents the best angular resolution, but the best overall field of view is obtained with a Lobster system: we present a small optical module able to achieve an effective area $>$100 cm$^2$ at 1 keV in a field of view of 10 deg$^2$.

 - **Abstract**
 While task-specific demonstrations show early success in applying large language models (LLMs) to automate some astronomical research tasks, they only provide incomplete views of all necessary capabilities in solving astronomy problems, calling for more thorough understanding of LLMs' strengths and limitations. So far, existing benchmarks and evaluations focus on simple question-answering that primarily tests astronomical knowledge and fails to evaluate the complex reasoning required for real-world research in the discipline. Here, we address this gap by systematically benchmarking five state-of-the-art LLMs on the International Olympiad on Astronomy and Astrophysics (IOAA) exams, which are designed to examine deep conceptual understanding, multi-step derivations, and multimodal analysis. With average scores of 85.6% and 84.2%, Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT-5 (the two top-performing models) not only achieve gold medal level performance but also rank in the top two among ~200-300 participants in all four IOAA theory exams evaluated (2022-2025). In comparison, results on the data analysis exams show more divergence. GPT-5 still excels in the exams with an 88.5% average score, ranking top 10 among the participants in the four most recent IOAAs, while other models' performances drop to 48-76%. Furthermore, our in-depth error analysis underscores conceptual reasoning, geometric reasoning, and spatial visualization (52-79% accuracy) as consistent weaknesses among all LLMs. Hence, although LLMs approach peak human performance in theory exams, critical gaps must be addressed before they can serve as autonomous research agents in astronomy.

 - **Abstract**
 If the Universe has non-trivial spatial topology, observables depend on both the parameters of the spatial manifold and the position and orientation of the observer. In infinite Euclidean space, most cosmological observables arise from the amplitudes of Fourier modes of primordial scalar curvature perturbations. Topological boundary conditions replace the full set of Fourier modes with specific linear combinations of selected Fourier modes as the eigenmodes of the scalar Laplacian. In this paper we consider the non-orientable Euclidean topologies \E{7}--\E{10}, \E{13}--\E{15}, and \E{17}, encompassing the full range of manifold parameters and observer positions, generalizing previous treatments. Under the assumption that the amplitudes of primordial scalar curvature eigenmodes are independent random variables, for each topology we obtain the correlation matrices of Fourier-mode amplitudes (of scalar fields linearly related to the scalar curvature) and the correlation matrices of spherical-harmonic coefficients of such fields sampled on a sphere, such as the temperature of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). We evaluate the detectability of these correlations given the cosmic variance of the CMB sky. We find that in manifolds where the distance to our nearest clone is less than about $1.2$ times the diameter of the last scattering surface of the CMB, we expect a correlation signal that is larger than cosmic variance noise in the CMB. Our limited selection of manifold parameters are exemplary of interesting behaviors, but not necessarily representative. Future searches for topology will require a thorough exploration of the parameter space to determine what values of the parameters predict statistical correlations that are convincingly attributable to topology.[Abridged]

 We announce V. 2025-08-08 of the Chroma+ suite of stellar atmosphere and spectrum modelling codes for fast, approximate, effectively platform-independent stellar spectrum synthesis, written in a number of free well-supported programming languages. The Chroma+ suite now computes the emergent surface intensity and flux distributions and the hydrostatic pressure structure assuming a spherical atmosphere rather than local flatness by implementing the analytic formal solution of the 1D spherical radiative transfer equation of Chapman (1966} based on an integration factor. We present our adaptation and discretization of the solution and demonstrate the resulting impact of our sphericity treatment on a number of computed observables, including exo-planet transit light-curves. All codes are available from the OpenStars www site: this http URL.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the impact of warm dark matter (WDM) particle mass on galaxy properties using 1,024 state-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamical simulations from the DREAMS project. We begin by using a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) coupled with a normalizing flow to explore global statistical descriptors of galaxy populations, such as the mean, standard deviation, and histograms of 14 galaxy properties. We find that subhalo gas mass is the most informative feature for constraining the WDM mass, achieving a determination coefficient of R^2 = 0.9. We employ symbolic regression to extract simple, interpretable relations with the WDM particle mass. Finally, we adopt a more localized approach by selecting individual dark matter halos and using a Graph Neural Network (GNN) with a normalizing flow to infer the WDM mass, incorporating subhalo properties as node features and global simulation statistics as graph-level features. The GNN approach yields only a residual improvement over MLP models based solely on global features, indicating that most of the predictive power resides in the global descriptors, with only marginal gains from halo-level information.

 - **Abstract**
 Anomalous Microwave Emission (AME) is a diffuse microwave component thought to arise from spinning dust grains, yet remains poorly understood. We analyze AME in 144 Galactic clouds by combining low-frequency maps from S-PASS (2.3 GHz), C-BASS (4.76 GHz), and QUIJOTE (10-20 GHz) with 21 ancillary maps. Using aperture photometry and parametric SED fitting via MCMC methods without informative priors, we measure AME emissivity, peak frequency, and spectral width. We achieve peak frequency constraints nearly three times tighter than previous work and identify 83 new AME sources. AME spectra are generally broader than predicted by spinning dust models for a single phase of the interstellar medium, suggesting either multiple spinning dust components along the line of sight or incomplete representation of the grain size distribution in current models. However, the narrowest observed widths match theoretical predictions, supporting the spinning dust hypothesis. The AME amplitude correlates most strongly with the thermal dust peak flux and radiance, showing $\sim30$% scatter and sublinear scaling, which suggests reduced AME efficiency in regions with brighter thermal dust emission. AME peak frequency increases with thermal dust temperature in a trend current theoretical models do not reproduce, indicating that spinning dust models must incorporate dust evolution and radiative transfer in a self-consistent framework where environmental parameters and grain properties are interdependent. PAH tracers correlate with AME emissivity, supporting a physical link to small dust grains. Finally, a log-Gaussian function provides a good empirical description of the AME spectrum across the sample, given current data quality and frequency coverage.

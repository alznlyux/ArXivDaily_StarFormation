- **Abstract**
 We present a comparative analysis of supernova remnant Cassiopeia A based on two deep, narrow-band images covering the [Fe II] 1.644um + [Si I] 1.645um lines obtained in 2013 and 2020 with the same instruments on the UKIRT 3.8m telescope. The identical setup and observing procedure allow for direct, accurate measurements of morphological and kinematic changes over a seven-year baseline. We identified 263 compact knots in the 2020 image and, through comparison with the 2013 catalog of Koo et al. 2018 (arXiv:1809.07935), classified them into quasi-stationary circumstellar knots and fast-moving knots (FMKs) of supernova ejecta. The FMKs show significant flux fluctuations, and many of those detected in 2013 are absent in the 2020 image. Proper-motion measurements derived from cross-correlation analysis indicate that most FMKs follow nearly ballistic expansion, whereas some, particularly those just beyond the eastern Fe-rich, X-ray emitting ejecta region, exhibit noticeable deceleration. The proper motions of the main ejecta shell were also measured and modeled as a uniformly expanding shell with a systemic motion, which reproduces the observed geometric and kinematic asymmetries of the remnant.

- **Abstract**
 We present ALMA [\ion{C}{1}]~$^3P_1$--$^3P_0$ imaging of the central $6.6\times4.2~\mathrm{pc}^2$ region of the Galaxy encompassing the circumnuclear disk (CND). The data reveal low-density ($n_\mathrm{H_2}\sim10^3~$cm$^{-3}$) molecular gas with inward motion, widespread both inside and outside the CND. The normalized [\ion{C}{1}] to CS~7--6 intensity difference decreases inwardly from $R=4$~pc to 1.7~pc and azimuthally along the CND's rotation, likely tracing paths of low-density gas inflow. By projecting spaxels into orbital coordinates assuming a velocity field model, we identify four kinematic features: a pair of spiral outer streamers toward the CND, inner streamers extending to 0.5~pc from Sgr~A$^*$, an outer disk at $ R\sim3$--6~pc, and the rotating ring at $R=2$~pc. $P$--$P$--$V$ correlation between the inner streamers and H42$\alpha$ indicates gas supply to the mini-spiral through the western arc (WA) and northern arm (NA). The total inflowing mass is $1.5\times10^4~M_\odot$, 1.7 times the mass of the rotating ring. The identified flows can be organized into two main pathways connecting the CND exterior and interior: ``WA flow'' feeding the mini-spiral WA via the CND, and ``NA flow'' bypassing the purely rotating orbit. The inflow rate along the former is approximately constant (0.1--0.16~$M_\odot~\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$), implying a CND dwelling time comparable to its orbital period and supporting the CND's transient nature. We also identify two [\ion{C}{1}]-bright clumps (CBCs) lacking dense-gas counterparts near the contact point between the northern outer streamer and the CND. Apparently intact against tidal disruption despite subcritical densities, the CBCs may represent a chemically young phase shortly after formation in colliding flows.

- **Abstract**
 With four giant planets ($m\sim5-10~M_{\rm Jup}$, $T_\rm{eff}\sim900-1200$ K) orbiting between 15-70 au, HR 8799 provides an unparalleled testbed for studying giant planet formation and probing compositional trends across the protoplanetary disk. We present new JWST/NIRSpec IFU observations ($2.85-5.3~\mu$m, $R\approx2700$) that now include the spectrum of HR 8799 b, and higher S/N spectra for HR 8799 c, d, and e compared to that in Ruffio & Xuan et al. 2026. We detect CO, CH$_4$, H$_2$O, H$_2$S, CO$_2$, and for planet b, NH$_3$. We combine the NIRSpec spectra with $1-5 \mu$m photometry to perform atmospheric retrievals that account for disequilibrium chemistry and clouds, and allow C/H, O/H, N/H, and S/H to scale independently. While the four planets are similarly enriched in carbon and oxygen, with C/H and O/H between $3-5\times$ stellar, we observe a tentative trend of increasing S/H - a tracer of refractory solids - from $2-5 \times$ stellar with increasing orbital distance. From HR 8799 b's NH$_3$ abundance, we estimate $\rm N/H=21.2^{+16.2}_{-8.8}\times$ stellar, suggesting the outer planet accreted significant amounts of N-rich gas. Overall, the elemental abundance patterns we observe are consistent with a picture where planet b formed between the CO snowline and the more-distant N$_2$ snowline, while the inner planets accreted $3 \times$ stellar CO-enriched disk gas within the CO snowline. The excess volatile mass from pebble drift and evaporation implies an integrated pebble flux of $750 \pm 200~M_{\oplus}$. The increase in the planets' S/H with orbital distance implies more solid accretion further out, which is quantitatively compatible with expectations from both pebble and planetesimal accretion ($2 \times$ Minimum Mass Solar Nebula) paradigms.

- **Abstract**
 We present a spectral line analysis of the hot molecular core G10.47+0.03 (hereafter, G10). Our aim is to determine molecular abundances and excitation conditions across a wide spectral range inaccessible to ground-based observatories. We utilize archival data from the Herschel Space Observatory, obtained with the Heterodyne Instrument for the Far-Infrared (HIFI). We report here the detection of high-excitation CO, 13CO, and C18O, H2O isotopologues, HCO+, HCN, HNC, CS, C34S, SO, SO2, H2CS, and CH3OH. CO, p-H2O, CS, and HCN show similar velocity profiles with a narrow, blueshifted component, which may be linked to the outer outflow layer. Redshifted wings may indicate inner outflow activity. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo framework is employed to infer column densities and temperatures accurately. We also performed spectral energy distribution fitting to constrain the global physical parameters of G10, providing essential context for interpreting the molecular emission. The MCMC analysis revealed two excitation temperature components: a warm component (30-65 K) and a hot component (90-250 K). The higher temperatures indicate dense, hot gas typical of massive hot cores. The lower temperatures correspond to the warm, less dense envelope around the core. Transitions of H2O, high-excitation CO, and HCN indicate outflowing gas and high-density shocked regions. These findings highlight G10's complex dynamical environment.

- **Abstract**
 In the interstellar medium, formic acid (HCOOH) plays a significant role in the synthesis of the simplest amino acid, glycine (NH$_{2}$CH$_{2}$COOH). The presence of HCOOH suggests that oxygen-bearing molecules may be directly involved in the chemical and physical evolution of star formation regions, particularly in hot molecular cores. This paper presents the first detection of the rotational emission lines of the $trans$-conformer of HCOOH toward the hot molecular core G358.93$-$0.03 MM1, located in the massive star formation region G358.93$-$0.03. This study employed high-resolution observations from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in Band 7. The column density and excitation temperature of $t$-HCOOH are determined as $(8.13\pm0.72)\times10^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$ and $120\pm15$ K, respectively. The fractional abundance of $t$-HCOOH relative to H$_{2}$ is $(2.62\pm 0.29)\times 10^{-9}$. The column density ratios of $t$-HCOOH/CH$_{3}$OH and $t$-HCOOH/H$_{2}$CO are $(1.56 \pm 0.12)\times 10^{-2}$ and $(1.16 \pm 0.12)$, respectively. We computed a three-phase warm-up chemical model of HCOOH using the gas-grain chemical code UCLCHEM. We found that the observed and modelled abundances of HCOOH are almost identical, within a factor of 0.89. Based on chemical modelling, we showed that HCOOH may be formed through the reaction between HCO and OH on the grain surface, which is further released in the gas-phase.

- **Abstract**
 We present 120s cadence TESS observations of three superoutbursts of the SU UMa-type dwarf nova VW Hydri. Two events (SO2 in Sectors 87+88 and SO3 in Sector 93) exhibit a pronounced, temporally pronounced precursor-dip followed by a rapid rise into the main superoutburst plateau. This morphology, previously seen in Kepler light curves of V1504 Cyg and V344 Lyr, is a key prediction of the thermal-tidal instability (TTI) model when a normal (precursor) outburst expands the disk only marginally beyond the 3:1 resonance radius, allowing the tidal instability to grow slowly and produce a deep dip approaching quiescence before rapid amplification drives the main superoutburst. A sliding-window time-frequency analysis reveals superhump power already during the decline and near minimum light, with a smooth period evolution across the dip and stabilization after the system returns to the hot state, consistent with the growth and saturation of disk eccentricity at the 3:1 resonance. From the stabilized Stage A superhump periods, we infer a representative mass ratio $q = 0.131 \pm 0.002$. Combined with either a typical SU UMa white-dwarf mass prior or the semi-empirical donor sequence at an orbital period of 107~min, the implied component masses are $M_1 \simeq 0.6$--$1.0\,M_\odot$ and $M_2 \simeq 0.08$--$0.14\,M_\odot$, ruling out a brown-dwarf donor and establishing VW~Hyi as a benchmark system for testing tidal-instability models in low-$q$ dwarf novae.

- **Abstract**
 The electron density of the solar corona is a fundamental parameter in many areas of solar physics. Traditionally, routine estimates of coronal density have relied exclusively on white-light observations. However, these density estimates, obtained by inverting the white-light data, require simplifying assumptions, which may affect the robustness of the measurements. Hence, to improve the reliability of coronal density measurements, it is highly desirable to explore other complementary methods. In this study, we estimate the coronal electron densities in the middle corona, between approximately $1.7-3.5R_\odot$, using low-frequency radio observations from the recently commissioned Long Wavelength Array at the Owens Valley Radio Observatory (OVRO-LWA). The results demonstrate consistency with those derived from white-light coronagraph data and predictions from theoretical models. We also derive a density model valid between 1.7--3.5 $r_\odot$ and is given by $\rho (r')=1.27r'^{-2}+29.02r'^{-4}+71.18r'^{-6}$, where $r'=r/R_\odot$, and $r$ is the heliocentric distance. OVRO-LWA is a solar-dedicated radio interferometer that provides science-ready images with low latency, making it well-suited for generating regular and independent estimates of coronal densities to complement existing white-light techniques.

- **Abstract**
 Dust emission at submillimeter wavelengths can be used to reliably trace the basic properties of molecular clouds. Early results from a recent Submillimeter Array (SMA) survey of the Andromeda Galaxy (M31) include the first detections of resolved dust continuum emission from individual giant molecular clouds (GMCs) in an external spiral galaxy. This paper updates on the now-complete SMA survey of 80 Herschel-identified giant molecular associations (GMAs) in M31. The SMA survey simultaneously probes dust continuum emission at 230 GHz and the $J = 2 \rightarrow 1$ transitions of the CO isotopologues, $^{12}\rm CO$, $^{13}\rm CO$, and $\rm C^{18}O$ at a spatial resolution of $\lesssim 15~\mathrm{pc}$. Dust continuum emission was detected in 71 cloud cores, of which 26 were resolved. This more than doubles the size of the previous sample. By comparing dust and CO observations with identical astrometry, we directly measure the dust mass to-light ratios, $\rm \alpha^{\prime}_{^{12}CO}$, and $\rm \alpha^{\prime}_{^{13}CO}$. We derive $<\alpha^{\prime}_{\rm ^{12}\rm CO}>~=~0.070~\pm~0.031~M_{\odot}\,(\rm K~km~s^{-1}~pc^{2})^{-1}$ and $<\alpha^{\prime}_{\rm ^{13}\rm CO}>~=~0.37~\pm~0.20~M_{\odot}\,(\rm K~km~s^{-1}~pc^{2})^{-1}$ for the increased sample, which are in agreement with previously reported values. From virial analysis, we find that 80% of the GMC regions traced by resolved dust emission are bound and close to virial equilibrium. Finally, we update our analysis on the metallicity dependence of $\rm \alpha^{\prime}_{\rm CO}$ by combining SMA observations with existing MMT/Hectospec optical spectroscopy toward H II regions. We find no trend in $\rm \alpha^{\prime}_{\rm CO}$ with metallicity, supporting the previous findings.

- **Abstract**
 We present an in-depth analysis of the eclipsing binary DD CrB, composed of a B-type subdwarf primary and an M-type main-sequence secondary, with the main goal of investigating its eclipse timing variations (ETVs). Our new multi-color photometric observations, radial velocity measurements, and precise eclipse timings from TESS allow us to constrain the system parameters. The Romer delay between primary and secondary minima yields a mass ratio of $q = 0.299 \pm 0.009$, enabling robust simultaneous modeling of the light and radial velocity curves with {\sc phoebe} 2.17. By fixing the albedo of the secondary to its maximum physically plausible value (A$_2 = 1.0$), despite the degeneracy between albedo, surface temperature, and radius, we obtained a satisfactory fit, resulting in a significantly lower temperature ($T_2 \sim 2360$ K) and a radius ($R_2 \sim 0.16$ R$_\odot$) in agreement with literature values. Using the total mass of the components and the orbital size derived from this modeling, we interpret the ETVs and find them best explained by a Jupiter-mass tertiary companion on a $\sim13$-year orbit in all competing models, while the eccentric (e $\sim0.46$) models perform better in terms of fit statistics.

- **Abstract**
 The circumnuclear star-forming ring of the barred spiral galaxy NGC 1097 provides a unique laboratory to study star formation under extreme conditions. This work aims to derive the physical properties of the circumnuclear star-forming regions (CNSFRs) using MUSE integral field spectroscopy observations. A total of 24 individual ionised HII are identified and analysed within its ring, which spans from $\sim$385 pc to $\sim$1.3 kpc. Despite the complex nuclear activity, all HII regions are found to be purely photoionised. Directly derived abundances reveal supersolar metallicities, with the highest one exceeding five times the solar value (12+log(S/H) = 7.875 $\pm$ 0.353, T$_e$([SIII]) = 3912 $\pm$ 567 K), and representing the highest abundance reported to date. In this high-metallicity regime, we find a break in the ionisation parameter-[SII]/[SIII] relation, which can be explained by changes in the ionisation structure and line emissivities, as confirmed by photoionisation models that successfully reproduce the observed emission-line ratios. Our results also indicate that the local gas supply regulates the star formation activity within the ring, with the young stars ionising 8 % of the total gas in the ring. Furthermore, our findings support a propagating starburst scenario, originating in the galaxy nucleus and extending towards the ends of the bar and into the circumnuclear ring through bar-driven shocks, this being consistent with the results of previous multi-wavelength studies. Finally, we likely detect optical signatures associated with one of the two known jets in this galaxy. This finding, together with the radio core emission previously found at sub-parsec scales, reflects the presence of feedback processes operating even on small galactic disc scales.

- **Abstract**
 Mixing by hydrodynamical instabilities plays a key role in cloud-wind interactions, causing cloud destruction in the adiabatic limit and facilitating cloud survival with efficient radiative cooling. However, the rate of mixing in numerical simulations is sensitive to the smallest resolved scale, and the relationship between resolution and cloud evolution is under-explored. Using a set of cloud-crushing simulations, we investigate the effects of numerical resolution on cloud survival and acceleration. Modeling both adiabatic and radiative cases, in a subsonic and supersonic wind, we find that cloud survival and velocity does depend on the numerical resolution, however, no single resolution requirement can be applied to all scenarios. In the radiative subsonic case, we find that mass growth and acceleration appear converged at only 4 cells per cloud radius. Conversely, in the supersonic regime, we see a clear dependence of cloud destruction and velocity on resolution that is not converged even at 48 cells per cloud radius, implying that accurately capturing cloud destruction may require higher resolution than capturing growth. We also present a simple model illustrating how ram pressure accelerates cool clouds at early times before mixing kicks in as an acceleration mechanism.

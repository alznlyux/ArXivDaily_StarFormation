 - **Abstract**
 This white paper is a summary of the Uranus Flagship Workshop that took place 21 to 23 May 2024 at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. Co-led by Goddard and Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab conveners, we had a broad, international, Science Organizing Committee, and a largely early career Local Organizing Committee from APL and GSFC. From prior workshops, it was apparent that the community was wildly enthusiastic about starting a mission, but lacked focus on what was possible or where to begin. Thus, the purpose of our workshop was to discuss practical aspects of the next planetary flagship and how we can employ new paradigms to better enable robust outer planet exploration. To enable this goal, we introduced the community to the best practices and lessons learned from previous missions and NASA-commissioned studies, and discussed the challenges involved with a mission so far from the Earth/Sun. The underlying workshop purpose was to steward the community towards a more practical mission design approach that will enable the development of this mission, as well as future missions, on a shorter cadence by setting expectations and having difficult discussions early in development. Because of the time scales involved in this mission, special effort was made towards early career inclusion and participation.

 - **Abstract**
 The presence of massive black holes (BHs) exceeding $10^9\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$ already at redshift $z > 6$ challenges standard models of BH growth. Super-Eddington (SE) accretion has emerged as a promising mechanism to solve this issue, yet its impact on early BH evolution in tailored numerical experiments remains largely unexplored. In this work, we investigate the growth of BH seeds embedded in a gas-rich, metal-poor protogalaxy at $z \sim 15$, using a suite of high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations that implement a slim-disc-based SE accretion model. We explore a broad parameter space varying the initial BH mass, feedback efficiency, and spin. We find that SE accretion enables rapid growth in all cases, allowing BHs to accrete up to $10^5\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$ within a few $10^3$-$10^4$ years, independent of seed properties. Feedback regulates this process, both by depleting central gas and altering BH dynamics via star formation-driven potential fluctuations, yet even the strongest feedback regimes permit significantly greater growth than the Eddington-limited case. Growth stalls after less than $\sim$1 Myr due to local gas exhaustion, as no large-scale inflows are present in the adopted numerical setup. Our results show that SE accretion naturally leads to BHs that are over-massive relative to their host galaxy stellar content, consistent with JWST observations. We conclude that short, low-duty-cycle SE episodes represent a viable pathway for assembling the most massive BHs observed at early cosmic times, even starting from light seeds.

          Fates of Rotating Supergiants from Stellar Mergers and the Landscape of Transients upon Core-collapse

 - **Abstract**
 We present a grid of rotating supergiant models from post-main sequence binary merger products, constructed by the MESA stellar evolution code. We focus on the evolution of these stars until core-collapse, in addition to their rotation, which could influence their mass loss and explosion phenomenology. We find that (i) as in previous studies, larger mass gain by merger favors the production of blue supergiants (BSGs) over red supergiants, and (ii) merger products that end as BSGs at core collapse have rotating outer envelopes, with lower-mass BSGs having faster envelope rotation due to less wind mass loss. We model the expected transients from these BSGs upon core-collapse, considering cases where the neutrino-driven explosion is successful and unsuccessful. The successful explosions result in supernovae (SNe) with long-rising light curves of morphology similar to SN 1987A. Failed explosions of these BSGs result in envelope fallback of $\sim (0.1$- several) $~M_\odot$ over $10^3$-$10^5$ seconds that power strong ($10^{51}$-$10^{53}$ erg) accretion-driven outflows in winds and possibly jets, with relativistic jets (if formed) generally capable of breaking out of the BSG envelope. Our modeling points to these merger-origin BSGs as viable progenitors for SN 1987A-like SNe, ultra-long gamma-ray bursts, and some of the fast luminous transients found in high-cadence optical surveys.

          Detection of a white dwarf orbiting a Carbon-Oxygen depleted blue straggler in 47 Tucanae

 - **Abstract**
 We have employed deep far-UV observations secured with the Solar Blind Channel of the Advanced Camera for Surveys onboard the Hubble Space Telescope to search for hot companions to five blue stragglers stars (BSSs) showing significant surface depletion of carbon (C) and oxygen (O), in the Galactic globular cluster 47 Tucanae. Such a chemical pattern has been interpreted as the chemical signature of the mass transfer formation process for the observed blue stragglers. The mass transfer origin is also expected to leave a "photometric signature" in the form of a UV-excess, as the stripped core of the donor star should be observable as a white dwarf (WD) companion orbiting the newborn BSS. We found strong evidence for the presence of a hot (T > 20000 K) WD companion to one of the investigated BSS, indicating that it likely formed through mass transfer less than 12 Myr ago. This is the first simultaneous evidence of the chemical and the photometric signatures of the mass-transfer formation channel. The lack of evidence for a hot companion to the other investigated blue stragglers is consistent with the expectation that the photometric signature (as well as the chemical one) is a transient phenomenon.

          Cosmic Variance in Anisotropy Searches at Pulsar Timing Arrays

 - **Abstract**
 Recent pulsar timing array (PTA) analyses show evidence for a gravitational wave background (GWB) with angular correlations consistent with the Hellings-Downs curve. Anisotropies are a key discriminator of the origin of this GWB, as they are expected to be at 1--20\% for astrophysical sources, but suppressed for cosmological GWBs. However, contrary to gravitational wave detectors at higher frequencies, PTAs only take a few independent measurements of a GWB and consequently are highly sensitive to cosmic variance, which induces apparent anisotropies in individual realizations of an isotropic GWB. We demonstrate explicitly that statistical inference nevertheless remains robust, i.e., measurements are consistent with the underlying assumption of isotropy. This confirms that searches for anisotropies will be able to robustly discriminate astrophysical from cosmological GWBs. En route, we demonstrate that the maximum multipole constrained by a PTA dataset scales linearly with the number of pulsars $\ell_{\rm max} \sim N_p$.

          Laboratory testing and characterization of a hybrid fast/slow readout mode for the H2RG detectors in SCALES

 - **Abstract**
 The upcoming SCALES (Slicer Combined with Array of Lenslets for Exoplanet Spectroscopy) instrument for W.M. Keck Observatory will enable new imaging and low-/mid-resolution coronagraphic integral field spectroscopic observations over the wavelength range from 2-5 microns. At the heart of the instrument are two HgCdTe Teledyne Imaging H2RG detectors, designed for a 100kHz pixel clock rate (slow mode) with a fixed 4-channel readout. However, in ground-based operation at these wavelengths, the resulting minimum frame readout time will result in the infrared background saturating the detector. To enable high quality observations without saturation from the bright infrared sky background, we operate the detectors using a custom cable for buffered readout via the Teledyne Imaging SIDECAR ASIC followed by an AstroBlank/Markury Scientific MACIE controller card controlled by custom firmware. This combination allows the detector to be read out at faster pixel clock rates. This, in combination with the slow-mode H2RG, is what we characterize as hybrid fast-slow readout, enabling readout up to 18 times faster than would be possible in slow mode alone. In the UCLA Infrared Lab, we have performed room-temperature and cold tests with the H2RG detectors. We test and optimize full-frame data acquisition with pixel clock rates from 0.2-1.8 MHz. In these proceedings, we present a summary of the controller software used to operate the H2RG-ASIC-MACIE system. We present the methodology of, and preliminary results from, the UCLA tests of cryogenic operation of both H2RG detectors. We also outline the next steps in verification of detector performance, as well as integration with the SCALES instrument.

 - **Abstract**
 Motivated by the recent baryon acoustic oscillation measurements of DESI DR2 collaboration, this works presents an extended analysis of a cosmological model based on holographic dark energy within the framework of Unimodular Gravity. We probe the model with an extensive set of observations: cosmic chronometers, Pantheon Plus$+$SH0ES Type Ia supernovae, DESI DR2 BAO distances, quasar X-ray/UV fluxes (two independent calibrations), and Planck 2018 CMB data. The results are analyzed to assess the modelś ability to alleviate the Hubble tension and, in comparison with the standard $\Lambda$CDM framework, to determine which of the two scenarios is preferred according to Bayesian evidence. We conclude that the present implementation of holographic dark energy in Unimodular Gravity, while theoretically appealing, does not alleviate the Hubble tension and is not statistically preferred by Bayesian criteria when compared with the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Nevertheless, in neither case does the preference become very strong or conclusive against it.

          The Impact of Spectroscopic Redshift Errors on Cosmological Measurements

 - **Abstract**
 Spectroscopic redshift errors, including redshift uncertainty and catastrophic failures, can bias cosmological measurements from galaxy redshift surveys at sub-percent level. We investigate their impact on full-shape clustering analysis using contaminated mock catalogs. We find that redshift uncertainty introduces a damping effect on the power spectrum. This damping is scale-dependent and absorbed by counterterms in the clustering model, keeping parameter biases below $5\%$ for the DESI survey. Catastrophic failures reduce the power spectrum amplitude by an approximately constant factor scaling with contamination rate $f_c$. While this effect is negligible for the DESI ELG populations ($f_c=1\%$), the slitless-like errors, combining redshift uncertainty with $f_c=5\%$ catastrophics, introduce significant biases in cosmological constraints. For this case, shifts from $6\%$ to $16\%$ ($\sim2.2\sigma$ level) arise in estimating the fractional growth rate $df\equiv f/f^{\rm{fid}}$ and the log primordial amplitude $\ln(10^{10} A_{s})$. Applying a correction factor $(1-f_c)^2$ on the galaxy power spectrum mitigates the bias but weakens the parameter constraints due to new degeneracies. Alternatively, fixing $f_c$ to its expected value during fitting successfully restores the unbiased posterior without loss in constraint. Our results indicate that for space-based slitless surveys such as \textit{Euclid}, an accurate estimation of $f_c$ and its incorporation into the clustering model are essential to get unbiased cosmological constraints. Extending to evolving dark energy and massive neutrino cosmologies, we find that redshift errors do not bias the dark energy properties parametrized by $w_0$ and $w_a$, but lead to slightly weaker constraints on $\sum m_\nu$.

 - **Abstract**
 The initial mass and metallicity of stars both have a strong impact on their fate. Stellar axial rotation also has a strong impact on the structure and evolution of massive stars. In this study, we exploit the large grid of GENEC models, covering initial masses from 9 to 500 $M_{\odot}$ and metallicities ranging from $Z=10^{-5}$ (nearly zero) to 0.02 (supersolar), to determine the impact of rotation on their fate across cosmic times. Using the carbon-oxygen core mass and envelope composition as indicators of their fate, we predict stellar remnants, supernova engines, and spectroscopic supernova types for both rotating and non-rotating stars. We derive rates of the different supernova and remnant types considering two initial mass functions to help solve puzzles such as the absence of observed pair-instability supernovae. We find that rotation significantly alters the remnant type and supernova engine, with rotating stars favouring black hole formation at lower initial masses than their non-rotating counterparts. Additionally, we confirm the expected strong metallicity dependence of the fates with a maximum black hole mass predicted to be below 50 $M_{\odot}$ at SMC or higher metallicities. A pair-instability mass gap is predicted between about 90 and 150 $M_{\odot}$, with the most massive black holes below the gap found at the lowest metallicities. Considering the fate of massive single stars has far-reaching consequences across many different fields within astrophysics, and understanding the impact of rotation and metallicity will improve our understanding of how massive stars end their lives, and their impact on the universe.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent advances in CMOS technology have potential to significantly increase the performance, at low-cost, of an astronomical space telescope. Arrays of sensors in space missions are typically contiguous and act as a monolithic detector. A non-contiguous array, with gaps between individual commercial CMOS detectors, offers potential cost and schedule benefits but poses a unique challenge for stray/scattered light mitigation due to complexities in the optomechanics. For example, if the array of detectors is being fed a large field of view, then each detector will have a different angle of incidence. Any individual bandpass filters need to be held perpendicular to the incoming beam so as not to create variances of central wavelength transmission from detector to detector. It naturally follows that the optical design can force filter ghosts to fall between detectors. When dealing with well-focused, high-intensity beams, first and second order stray light path analyses must be conducted to determine scattered light from glints off of individual optics/opto-mechanics or detector specific vane structures. More mechanical structures are necessary for imaging with non-contiguous arrays, all of which have potential to increase scattered light. This proceeding will document various stray light mitigation strategies for a non-contiguous array of sensors in a space telescope.

          One-Loop Nonlinear Matter Power Spectrum from Unified Lagrangian Perturbation Theory: Fast Computation and Comparison with Emulators

 - **Abstract**
 We present a fast and accurate formulation for computing the nonlinear matter power spectrum at one-loop order based on Unified Lagrangian Perturbation Theory (ULPT). ULPT decomposes the density field into the Jacobian deviation, capturing intrinsic nonlinear growth, and the displacement-mapping factor, accounting for large-scale distortions due to bulk flows. This structural separation leads to a natural division of the power spectrum into a source term and a displacement-mapping factor, ensuring infrared (IR) safety by construction. We implement an efficient numerical algorithm using FFTLog and FAST-PT, achieving approximately 2-second evaluations on a standard laptop. The results are validated against simulation-based emulators, including the Dark Emulator and Euclid Emulator 2. Across 100 sampled cosmologies, ULPT agrees with emulator predictions at the 2--3\% level up to \( k \simeq 0.4\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1} \) for \( z \geq 0.5 \), without any nuisance parameters. Similar agreement is found in configuration space, where the two-point correlation function remains accurate down to \( r \simeq 10\,h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc} \). Compared to standard perturbation theory, which fails at small scales due to series expansion of the displacement factor, ULPT maintains convergence by preserving its full exponential form. We also clarify the mechanism of BAO damping: exponential suppression by displacement and peak sharpening by nonlinear growth. The combination accurately reproduces BAO features seen in simulations. ULPT thus offers a robust, IR-safe, and computationally efficient framework for modeling large-scale structure in galaxy surveys. The numerical implementation developed in this work is publicly released as the open-source Python package \texttt{ulptkit} (this https URL).

          On the internal structure of stellar streams

 - **Abstract**
 We develop a new method for simulating stellar streams generated by globular clusters using angle-action coordinates. This method reproduces the variable mass-loss and variable frequency of the stripped stars caused by the changing tidal forces acting on the cluster as it moves along an eccentric orbit. The model incorporates realistic distributions for the stripping angle and frequency of the stream stars both along and perpendicular to the stream. The stream is simulated by generating random samples of stripped stars and integrating them forward in time in angle-frequency space. Once the free parameters are calibrated, this method can be used to simulate the internal structure of stellar streams more quickly than N-body simulations, while achieving a similar level of accuracy. We use this model to study the surface density of the stellar stream produced by the globular cluster M68 (NGC 4590). We select $291$ stars from the Gaia-DR3 catalogue along the observable section that are likely to be members of the stream. We find that the width of the stream is too large to be explained by stars stripped from the cluster alone. We simulate the stream using the present method and include the Gaia selection function and observational errors, and the process of separating the stream stars from the foreground. By comparing these results with the observed data, we estimate the age of the stream, or equivalently the cluster accretion time, to be $3.04_{-0.29}^{+5.63}$ Gyr, and the mass-loss of the cluster to be $0.496 \pm 0.030$ M$_{\odot}$ Myr$^{-1}$ arm$^{-1}$.

          Discovery of 17 New GeV Blazar Candidates through Spatial Cross-Matching between Roma-BZCAT and 4FGL-Xiang-DR2

 - **Abstract**
 Using 16 years of Fermi-LAT data and resources from the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database (NED), we constructed two high-precision catalogs: the updated 4FGL-Xiang-DR2 (DR2) and a supplementary version of the fifth edition of Roma-BZCAT (5BZCAT\_err), both featuring refined positional uncertainties. We performed a spatial cross-identification between the two catalogs and developed a systematic three-step analytical pipeline: (1) efficient retrieval of positional uncertainties and multi-wavelength fluxes from 5BZCAT\_err, (2) calculation of spatial association probabilities with DR2, and (3) statistical modeling of multi-band fluxes, using the Box--Cox transformation and a truncated normal distribution. Through this process, we identified 17 new blazar candidates. Fermi-LAT analysis reveals that, except for J1043.7+5323, which exhibits significant flux variability above 100 MeV, the remaining sources display stable fluxes, without apparent spatial extension or spectral curvature. Multi-wavelength flux modeling shows that 15 of the 17 sources fall within the 2$\sigma$ confidence interval of the distribution model, demonstrating strong statistical consistency with known blazar samples. As Fermi-LAT data continues to accumulate, the remaining two sources are expected to converge toward the high-confidence region, providing further support for the common-source hypothesis.

          Possible Coronal Geometry in the Hard and Soft State of Black Hole X-ray Binaries from MONK Simulations

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the coronal geometry in different states of black hole X-ray binaries is important for more accurate modeling of the system. However, it is difficult to distinguish different geometries by fitting the observed Comptonization spectra. In this work, we use the Monte Carlo ray-tracing code MONK to simulate the spectra for three widely proposed coronal geometries: sandwich, spherical, and lamppost, varying their optical depth and size (height). By fitting the simulated NuSTAR observations with the simplcut*kerrbb model, we infer the possible parameter space for the hard state and soft state of different coronal geometries. The influence of the disk inclination angle and black hole spin is discussed. We find that for the lamppost model the disk emission is always dominant, making it incompatible in the hard state. While the sandwich and spherical models can produce similar spectra in both the hard and soft states, the simulated IXPE polarimetric spectra show the potential to break this degeneracy.

          TOI-1438: A rare system with two short-period sub-Neptunes and a tentative long-period Jupiter-like planet orbiting a K0V star

 - **Abstract**
 We present the detection and characterisation of the TOI-1438 multi-planet system discovered by TESS. We collected a series of follow-up observations including high-spectral resolution observations with HARPS-N over a period of five years. Our modelling shows that the K0V star hosts two transiting sub-Neptunes with Rb = 3.04 +/- 0.19 RE, Rc = 2.75 +/- 0.14 RE, Mb = 9.4 +/- 1.8 ME, and Mc = 10.6 +/- 2.1 ME. The orbital periods of planets b and c are 5.1 and 9.4 days, respectively, corresponding to instellations of 145 +/- 10 and 65 +/- 4 FE. The bulk densities are 1.8 +/- 0.5 and 2.9 +/- 0.7 g cm-3, respectively, suggesting a volatile-rich interior composition. We computed a set of planet interior structure models. Planet b presents a high-metallicity envelope that can accommodate up to 2.5 % in H/He in mass, while planet c cannot have more than 0.2 % as H/He in mass. For any composition of the core considered (Fe-rock or ice-rock), both planets would require a volatile-rich envelope. In addition to the two planets, the radial velocity (RV) data clearly reveal a third signal, likely coming from a non-transiting planet, with an orbital period of 7.6 +1.6 -2.4 years and a radial velocity semi-amplitude of 35+3-5 m s-1. Our best fit model finds a minimum mass of 2.1 +/- 0.3 MJ and an eccentricity of 0.25+0.08-0.11. However, several RV activity indicators also show strong signals at similar periods, suggesting this signal might (partly) originate from stellar activity. More data over a longer period of time are needed to conclusively determine the nature of this signal. If it is confirmed as a triple-planet system, TOI-1438 would be one of the few detected systems to date characterised by an architecture with two small, short-period planets and one massive, long-period planet, where the inner and outer systems are separated by an orbital period ratio of the order of a few hundred.

 - **Abstract**
 An alternative, new laser link acquisition scheme for the triangular constellation of spacecraft (SCs) in deep space in the detection of gravitational waves is considered. In place of a wide field CCD camera in the initial stage of laser link acquisition adopted in the conventional scheme, an extended Kalman filter based on precision orbit determination is incorporated in the point ahead angle mechanism (PAAM) to steer the laser beam in such a way to narrow the uncertainty cone and at the same time avoids the heating problem generated by the CCD camera.A quadrant photodetector (QPD) based on the Differential Power Sensing (DPS) technique, which offers a higher dynamic range than differential wavefront sensing (DWS), is employed as the readout of the laser beam spot. The conventional two stages (coarse acquisition and fine acquisition) are integrated into a single control loop. The payload structure of the ATP control loop is simplified and numerical simulations, based on a colored measurement noise model that closely mimics the prospective on-orbit conditions, demonstrate that the AEKF significantly reduces the initial uncertainty region by predicting the point ahead angle (PAA) even when the worst case scenario in SC position (navigation) error is considered.

          Refining fundamental constants with white dwarfs: machine learning informed constraints on fine-structure constant and proton-to-electron mass ratio

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the potential variation of two fundamental constants, the fine-structure constant $\alpha$ and the proton-to-electron mass ratio $\mu$, within the framework of modified gravity theories and finite-temperature effects. Utilising high-precision white dwarf observations from the Gaia-DR3 survey, we construct a robust mass--radius relation using a Bayesian-inspired machine learning framework. This empirical relation is rigorously compared with theoretical predictions derived from scalar-tensor gravity models and temperature-dependent equations of state. Our results demonstrate that both underlying gravitational theory and temperature substantially influence the inferred constraints on $\alpha$ and $\mu$. We obtain the strongest constraints as $|\Delta\alpha/\alpha|=2.10^{+32.56}_{-39.26}\times10^{-7}$ and $|\Delta\mu/\mu|=1.61^{+37.16}_{-34.67}\times10^{-7}$ for modified gravity parameter $\gamma\simeq -3.69\times10^{13}\,\mathrm{cm}^2$, while for the finite temperature case, these are $|\Delta\alpha/\alpha|=1.60^{+37.31}_{-35.42}\times10^{-7}$ and $|\Delta\mu/\mu|=1.23^{+37.02}_{-35.71}\times10^{-7}$ for $T \simeq 1.1 \times 10^7\rm\, K$. These findings yield tighter constraints than those reported in earlier studies and underscore the critical roles of gravitational and thermal physics in testing the constancy of fundamental parameters.

 - **Abstract**
 The occurrence rate of close-in super-Earths is higher around M-dwarfs compared to stars of higher masses. In this work we aim to understand how the super-Earth population is affected by both the stellar mass, the size of the protoplanetary disc, and viscous heating. We utilise a standard protoplanetary disc model with both irradiated and viscous heating together with a pebble accretion model to simulate the formation and migration of planets. We find that if the disc is heated purely through stellar irradiation, inwards migration of super-Earths is very efficient, resulting in the close-in super-Earth fraction increasing with increasing stellar mass. In contrast, when viscous heating is included, planets can undergo outwards migration, delaying migration to the inner edge of the protoplanetary disc, which causes a fraction of super-Earth planets to grow to become giant planets instead. This results in a significant reduction of inner super-Earths around high-mass stars and an increase in the number of giant planets, both of which mirror observed features of the planet population around high-mass stars. This effect is most pronounced when the protoplanetary disc is large, since such discs evolve over a longer time-scale. We also test a model when we inject protoplanets at a fixed time early on in the disc lifetime. In this case, the fraction of close-in super-Earths decreases with increasing stellar mass in both the irradiated case and viscous case, since longer disc lifetimes around high-mass stars allows for planets to grow into giants instead of super-Earths for most injection locations.

 - **Abstract**
 The Cygnus region is a vast star-forming complex harbouring a population of powerful objects, including massive star clusters and associations, Wolf-Rayet stars, pulsars, and supernova remnants. The multi-wavelength picture is far from understood, in particular the recent LHAASO detection of multi-degree scale diffuse gamma-ray emission up to PeV energies. We aim to model the broadband gamma-ray data, discriminating plausible scenarios amongst all candidate accelerators. We consider in particular relic hadronic emission from a supernova remnant expanding in a low-density environment and inverse Compton emission from stellar-wind termination shocks in the Cygnus OB2 stellar association. We first estimate the maximum particle energy from a 3D hydrodynamical simulation of the supernova remnant scenario. The transport equation is then solved numerically to determine the radial distribution of non-thermal protons and electrons. In order to compute synthetic gamma-ray spectra and emission maps, we develop a 3D model of the gas distribution. This includes, firstly, a HI component with a low-density superbubble around Cygnus OB2 and, secondly, molecular clouds lying at the edge of the superbubble and in the foreground. We find that a powerful, ~50 kyr-old supernova remnant can account for both the morphology and spectrum from 10 TeV-PeV. At PeV energies, the microquasar Cygnus X-3 and diffuse Galactic cosmic rays might also contribute to the flux. Below about 10 TeV, hadronic models are incompatible with the expected existence of a superbubble centred on Cygnus OB2. Instead, the spectrum is well fitted with inverse Compton emission from electrons accelerated at stellar-wind termination shocks in Cygnus OB2 in line with existing multi-wavelength limits.

 - **Abstract**
 KASCADE-Grande was dedicated to measuring the energy spectrum and mass composition of cosmic rays in the energy range of 10 PeV to 1 EeV. We observed a knee-like structure in the heavy mass component at around 100 PeV and an ankle-like structure in the light component. In this contribution, we present updated energy spectra based on shower size measurements, using the post-LHC hadronic models QGSJet-II-04, EPOS-LHC, and SIBYLL 2.3d, including accounting for shower-to-shower fluctuations. In addition, the newly released EPOS-LHC-R model is tested for the first time with KASCADE-Grande. We will compare and discuss the results obtained using the different hadronic interaction models.

 - **Abstract**
 The CoRoT (Convection, Rotation, and planetary Transits) mission still holds a large trove of high-quality, underused light curves with excellent signal-to-noise and continuous coverage. This paper, the first in a series, identifies and classifies variable stars in CoRoT fields whose variability has not been analyzed in the main repositories. We combine simulations and real data to test a moving-average scheme that mitigates instrumental jumps and enhances the recovery of short-period signals (<1 day) in roughly 20-day time series. For classification, we adopt a supervised selection built on features extracted from folded light curves using the double period, and we construct template-based models that also act as a new classifier for well-sampled light curves. We report 9,272 variables, of which 6,249 are not listed in SIMBAD or VSX. Our preliminary classes include 309 Beta Cephei, 3,105 Delta Scuti, 599 Algol-type eclipsing binaries, 844 Beta Lyrae eclipsing binaries, 497 W Ursae Majoris eclipsing binaries, 1,443 Gamma Doradus, 63 RR Lyrae, and 32 T Tauri stars. The resulting catalog inserts CoRoT variables into widely used astronomical repositories. Comparing sources in the inner and outer Milky Way, we find significant differences in the occurrence of several classes, consistent with metallicity and age gradients. The ability to recover sub-day periods also points to automated strategies for detecting longer-period variability, which we will develop in subsequent papers of this series.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic rays around the so-called knee in the spectrum at around PeV primary energy are generally galactic in origin. Observations on the form of their energy spectrum and their mass composition are fundamental tools to understand the origin, acceleration and propagation mechanism of high-energy cosmic rays. In addition, it is required to find signatures to clarify the transition from galactic to extragalactic sources, which are believed to be responsible for the highest-energy cosmic rays above EeV. This brief review focuses on recent experimental results around the knee of the all-particle energy spectrum and composition in the energy range of the knee up to EeV energies.

          New line-driven wind mass-loss rates for OB stars with metallicities down to $0.01\,Z_\odot$

 - **Abstract**
 We provide new line-driven wind models for OB stars with metallicities down to $0.01\,Z_\odot$. The models were calculated with our global wind code METUJE, which solves the hydrodynamical equations from nearly hydrostatic photosphere to supersonically expanding stellar wind together with the equations of statistical equilibrium and the radiative transfer equation. The models predict the basic wind parameters, namely, the wind mass-loss rates and terminal velocities just from the stellar parameters. In general, the wind mass-loss rates decrease with decreasing metallicity and this relationship steepens for very low metallicities, $Z\lesssim0.1\,Z_\odot$. Down to metallicities corresponding to the Magellanic Clouds and even lower, the predicted mass-loss rates reasonably agree with observational estimates. However, the theoretical and observational mass-loss rates for very low metallicities exhibit significant scatter. We show that the scatter of observational values can be caused by inefficient shock cooling in the stellar wind, which leaves a considerable fraction of the wind at too high temperatures with waning observational signatures. The scatter of theoretical predictions is caused by a low number of lines that effectively accelerate the wind at very low metallicities.

 - **Abstract**
 Identifying Earth-like planets outside out solar system is a leading research goal in astronomy, but determining if candidate planets have atmospheres, and more importantly if they can retain atmospheres, is still out of reach. In this paper, we present our study on the impact of enhanced EUV flux on the stability and escape of the upper atmosphere of an Earth-like exoplanet using the Global Ionosphere and Thermosphere Model (GITM). We also investigate the differences between one- and three-dimensional solutions. We use a baseline case of EUV flux experienced at the Earth, and multiplying this flux by a constant factor going up to 50. Our results show a clear evidence of an inflated and elevated ionosphere due to enhanced EUV flux, and they provide a detailed picture of how different heating and cooling rates, as well as the conductivity are changing at each EUV flux level. Our results also demonstrate that one-dimensional solutions are limited in their ability to capture a global atmosphere that are not uniform. We find that a threshold EUV flux level for a stable atmosphere occurs around a factor of 10 times the baseline level, where EUV fluxes above this level indicate a rapidly escaping atmosphere. This threshold EUV flux translates to about 0.3AU for a planet orbiting the Sun. Thus, our findings indicate that an Earth-like exoplanet orbiting its host star in a close-in orbit is likely to lose its atmosphere quickly.

 - **Abstract**
 Studying young, high-mass stellar objects is challenging for testing models of massive star formation due to their great distances, often kiloparsecs away. This requires extremely high-angular resolution to resolve features like accretion discs around massive protostars. Consequently, while powerful, collimated outflows are evident in massive protostars, the compact accretion discs anticipated at their centres are still proving difficult to pinpoint. This study presents ALMA continuum and molecular line observations at 1.3 mm of the massive protostar W75N(B)-VLA3. The observations achieve an angular resolution of $\sim$0.12$^{\prime\prime}$ ($\sim$156 au). Dense gas tracers reveal a circumstellar disc of $\sim$450 au in radius surrounding VLA3, with an orientation perpendicular to its associated thermal radio jet. From the millimetre continuum, a total mass of $\approx$0.43-1.74 $M_\odot$ is estimated for the disc. The disc's velocity profile is consistent with Keplerian rotation around a protostar of $\approx$16 $M_\odot$. This adds VLA3 to the small number of massive disc-protostar-jet systems documented in the literature with a centrifugally supported disc with a radius less than 500 au. Additionally, we detected H30$\alpha$ recombination line emission towards the radio jet powered by VLA3. Despite limitations in the spatial and spectral resolution, our data reveal a very broad line, indicative of high-velocity motions, as well as a tentative velocity gradient in the jet's direction, thus favouring the H30$\alpha$ emission to originate from the radio jet. Should this interpretation be confirmed with new observations, W75N(B)-VLA3 could represent the first protostellar radio jet for which a thermal radio recombination line has been detected.

          Alfven wave propagation from the photosphere to the corona: temporal evolution against stationary results

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations have confirmed that a significant fraction of the coronal Alfvenic wave spectrum originates in the photosphere. These waves travel from the photosphere to the corona, overcoming the barriers of reflection and dissipation posed by the chromosphere. Previous studies have theoretically calculated the chromospheric reflection, transmission, and absorption coefficients for pure Alfven waves under the assumption of stationary propagation. Here, we relax that assumption and investigate the time-dependent propagation of Alfven waves driven at the photosphere. Using an idealized chromospheric background model, we compare the coefficients obtained from time-dependent simulations with those derived under the stationary approximation. Additionally, we examine the impact of the spatial resolution in the numerical simulations. Considering a spatial resolution of 250 m, we find that the time-dependent transmission coefficient converges to the stationary value across the entire frequency range after only a few chromospheric Alfven crossing times, while the reflectivity displays a good convergence for frequencies lower than 30 mHz. The absorption coefficient also converges for wave frequencies above 1 mHz, for which chromospheric dissipation is significant. In contrast, at lower frequencies, wave energy dissipation is weak and the time-dependent simulations typically overestimate the absorption. Inadequate spatial resolution artificially enhances the chromospheric reflectivity, reduces wave transmission to the corona, and poorly describes the wave energy absorption. Overall, the differences between the stationary and time-dependent approaches are only minor and gradually decrease as spatial resolution and simulation time increase, which reinforces the validity of the stationary approximation.

 - **Abstract**
 In high-energy and astroparticle physics, event generators play an essential role, even in the simplest data analyses. As analysis techniques become more sophisticated, e.g. based on deep neural networks, their correct description of the observed event characteristics becomes even more important. Physical processes occurring in hadronic collisions are simulated within a Monte Carlo framework. A major challenge is the modeling of hadron dynamics at low momentum transfer, which includes the initial and final phases of every hadronic collision. Phenomenological models inspired by Quantum Chromodynamics used for these phases cannot guarantee completeness or correctness over the full phase space. These models usually include parameters which must be tuned to suitable experimental data. Until now, event generators have primarily been developed and tuned based on data from high-energy physics experiments at accelerators. However, in many cases they have been found to not satisfactorily describe data from astroparticle experiments, which provide sensitivity especially to hadrons produced nearly parallel to the collision axis and cover center-of-mass energies up to several hundred TeV, well beyond those reached at colliders so far. In this report, we address the complementarity of these two sets of data and present a road map for exploiting, for the first time, their complementarity by enabling a unified tuning of event generators with accelerator-based and astroparticle data.

 - **Abstract**
 With its third data release (DR3), Gaia begins unveiling dormant candidate compact object (CO) binaries with luminous companion (LC) as predicted by several past theoretical studies. To date, 3 black hole (BH), 21 neutron star (NS), and ~3200 white dwarf (WD) candidates have been identified with LCs in detached orbits using astrometry. We adopt an observationally motivated sampling scheme for the star formation history of the Milky Way, and initial zero-age main-sequence binary properties, incorporate all relevant binary interaction processes during evolution to obtain a realistic present-day intrinsic population of CO--LC binaries. We apply Gaia's selection criteria to identify the CO--LC binaries detectable using the observational cuts applicable for DR3 as well as its end-of-mission (EOM). We find that under the DR3 selection cuts, our detectable population includes no BH--LCs, approximately 10-40 NS--LCs, and around ~4300 WD--LCs. In contrast, by EOM, the expected numbers increase to 30-300 BH--LCs, 1500-5000 NS--LCs, and ~10^5-10^6 WD--LC binaries, primarily because of the significantly longer baseline of observation.

 - **Abstract**
 Lyman-$\alpha$ damping wings towards quasars are a highly sensitive probe of the neutral hydrogen (HI) content in the foreground intergalactic medium (IGM), not only constraining the global timing of reionization but also the \textit{local} ionization topology near the quasar. Near-optimal extraction of this information is possible with the help of two recently introduced reionization model-independent summary statistics of the HI distribution in the IGM \textit{before} the quasar started shining, complemented with the quasar's lifetime encoding the effect of its ionizing radiation as a third parameter. We introduce a fully Bayesian JAX-based Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) inference framework that allows us to jointly reconstruct the quasar's unknown continuum and constrain these local damping wing statistics. We put forward a probabilistic framework that allows us to tie these local constraints to any specific reionization model and obtain model-dependent constraints on the global timing of reionization. We demonstrate that we are able to constrain the (Lorentzian-weighted) HI column density in front of the quasar to a precision of $0.69_{-0.30}^{+0.06}\,\mathrm{dex}$ and its original distance to the first neutral patch before the quasar started shining to $31.4_{-28.1}^{+10.7}\,\mathrm{cMpc}$ (if a noticeable damping wing is present in the spectrum), extracting hitherto unused local information from the IGM damping wing imprint. Once tied to a specific reionization model, we find that the statistical fidelity of our constraints on the global IGM neutral fraction and the lifetime of the quasar improves, while retaining the same precision as achieved by pipelines that infer these parameters directly.

 - **Abstract**
 Thus far, Lyman-$\alpha$ damping wings towards quasars have been used to probe the \textit{global} ionization state of the foreground intergalactic medium (IGM). A new parameterization has demonstrated that the damping wing signature also carries \textit{local} information about the distribution of neutral hydrogen (HI) in front of the quasar before it started shining. Leveraging a recently introduced Bayesian \texttt{JAX}-based Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) inference framework, we derive constraints on the Lorentzian-weighted HI column density $N_\mathrm{HI}^\mathrm{DW}$, the quasar's distance $r_\mathrm{patch}$ to the first neutral patch and its lifetime $t_\mathrm{Q}$ based on JWST/NIRSpec spectra of the two $z \sim 7.5$ quasars J1007+2115 and J1342+0928. After folding in model-dependent topology information, we find that J1007+2115 (and J1342+0928) is most likely to reside in a $\langle x_\mathrm{HI} \rangle = 0.32_{-0.20}^{+0.22}$ ($0.58_{-0.23}^{+0.23}$) neutral IGM while shining for a remarkably short lifetime of $\log_{10} t_\mathrm{Q} /\mathrm{yr} = 4.14_{-0.18}^{+0.74}$ (an intermediate lifetime of $5.64_{-0.43}^{+0.25}$) along a sightline with $\log_{10} N_\mathrm{HI}^\mathrm{DW} /\mathrm{cm}^{-2} = 19.70_{-0.86}^{+0.35}$ ($20.24_{-0.22}^{+0.25}$) and $r_\mathrm{patch} = 28.9_{-14.4}^{+54.0} \,\mathrm{cMpc}$ ($10.9_{-5.9}^{+5.6} \,\mathrm{cMpc}$). In light of the potential presence of local absorbers in the foreground of J1342+0928 as has been recently suggested, we also demonstrate how the Lorentzian-weighted column density $N_\mathrm{HI}^\mathrm{DW}$ provides a natural means for quantifying their contribution to the observed damping wing signal.

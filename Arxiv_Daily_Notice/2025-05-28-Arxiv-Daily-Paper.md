          A Cosmic Ray Acceleration Mechanism Based on Background Flow Velocity Inhomogeneities Yielding Power-Law Spectra

 - **Abstract**
 In this article, momentum transport generated by the combined effects of pitch-angle diffusion and Background Flow Velocity Inhomogeneities (BFVIs) is proposed to obtain a cosmic rays acceleration mechanism, starting from the well-known focusing equation describing particle diffusion and acceleration. The inhomogeneities of background flow velocity is ubiquitous in astrophysical environment. The isotropic distribution function equation of charged energetic particles is derived, and its solution is obtained, demonstrating the form of momentum power laws of cosmic rays. In addition, if it is assumed that cosmic rays penetrate compressible plasma waves or turbulence, for quasi-steady states, the spectral index $\delta$ of the momentum power law spectrum of cosmic rays is found to be in the range $[-5, -3]$, which includes the observed power law indices of galactic cosmic rays. The results obtained in this article demonstrate that the mechanism proposed in this article, along with shock acceleration, may also contribute to the acceleration of galactic cosmic rays. Furthermore, when momentum convection effect and higher-order momentum derivative terms are considered, the indices of power laws should be smaller than $-5$. This may explain the power laws of solar energetic particle events.

 - **Abstract**
 The Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) will be a ground-based Cherenkov telescope performing wide-sky surveys, ideal for anisotropy studies such as cross-correlations with tracers of the cosmic large-scale structure. Cross-correlations can shed light on high-energy $\gamma$-ray sources and potentially reveal exotic signals from particle dark matter. In this work, we investigate CTAO sensitivity to cross-correlation signals between $\gamma$-ray emission and galaxy distributions. We find that by using dense, low-redshift catalogs like 2MASS, and for integration times around 50 hours, this technique achieves sensitivities to both annihilating and decaying dark matter signals that are competitive with those from dwarf galaxy and cluster analyses.

          gallifrey: JAX-based Gaussian process structure learning for astronomical time series

 - **Abstract**
 Gaussian processes (GPs) have become a common tool in astronomy for analysing time series data, particularly in exoplanet science and stellar astrophysics. However, choosing the appropriate covariance structure for a GP model remains a challenge in many situations, limiting model flexibility and performance. This work provides an introduction to recent advances in GP structure learning methods, which enable the automated discovery of optimal GP kernels directly from the data, with the aim of making these methods more accessible to the astronomical community. We present gallifrey, a JAX-based Python package that implements a sequential Monte Carlo algorithm for Bayesian kernel structure learning. This approach defines a prior distribution over kernel structures and hyperparameters, and efficiently samples the GP posterior distribution using a novel involutive Markov chain Monte Carlo procedure. We applied gallifrey to common astronomical time series tasks, including stellar variability modelling, exoplanet transit modelling, and transmission spectroscopy. We show that this methodology can accurately interpolate and extrapolate stellar variability, recover transit parameters with robust uncertainties, and derive transmission spectra by effectively separating the background from the transit signal. When compared with traditional fixed-kernel approaches, we show that structure learning has advantages in terms of accuracy and uncertainty estimation. Structure learning can enhance the performance of GP regression for astronomical time series modelling. We discuss a road map for algorithmic improvements in terms of scalability to larger datasets, so that the methods presented here can be applied to future stellar and exoplanet missions such as PLATO.

          Cosmological impact of $ν$DM interactions enhanced in narrow redshift ranges
 - **Authors:** Sebastian Trojanowski, Lei Zu

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/
 - **Abstract**
 The impact of dark matter-neutrino ($\nu$DM) interactions on cosmological perturbations has regained attention, spurred by indications of non-zero couplings from high-multipole cosmic microwave background data, weak lensing, and Lyman-$\alpha$ observations. We demonstrate that a similar observational preference is obtained if $\nu$DM interactions are primarily enhanced during a specific epoch, $z\sim (10^4-10^5)$, leading to $>3\sigma$ preference for a non-zero interaction in the combined Atacama Cosmology Telescope and cosmic shear data. This redshift-limited enhancement circumvents other cosmological and astrophysical bounds and can be achieved within a neutrino portal dark matter framework incorporating resonantly enhanced scattering rates.

          ULULA: An ultra-lightweight 2D hydrodynamics code for teaching and experimentation

 - **Abstract**
 Hydrodynamics is a difficult subject to teach in the classroom because most relevant problems must be solved numerically rather than analytically. While there are numerous public hydrodynamics codes, the complexity of production-level software obscures the underlying physics and can be overwhelming to first-time users. Here we present ULULA, an ultra-lightweight python code to solve hydrodynamics and gravity in 2D. The main goal is for the code to be easy to understand, extend, and experiment with. The simulation framework consists of fewer than 800 active lines of pure python code, but it includes a robust MUSCL-Hancock scheme with exchangeable components such as Riemann solvers, reconstruction schemes, boundary conditions, and equations of state. Numerous well-known hydrodynamics problems are provided and can be run in a few minutes on a laptop. The code is open-source, generously commented, and extensively documented.

          Neutral gas phase distribution from HI morphology: phase separation with scattering spectra and variational autoencoders

 - **Abstract**
 Unraveling the multi-phase structure of the diffuse interstellar medium (ISM) as traced by neutral hydrogen (HI) is essential to understanding the lifecycle of the Milky Way. However, HI phase separation is a challenging and under-constrained problem. The neutral gas phase distribution is often inferred from the spectral line structure of HI emission. In this work, we develop a data-driven phase separation method that extracts HI phase structure solely from the spatial morphology of HI emission intensity structures. We combine scattering spectra (SS) statistics with a Gaussian-mixture variational autoencoder (VAE) model to: 1. derive an interpretable statistical model of different HI phases from their multi-scale morphological structures; 2. use this model to decompose the 2D channel maps of GALFA-HI emission in diffuse high latitude ($|b|>30$\degree) regions over narrow velocity channels ($\Delta v=3$ km/s) into cold neutral medium (CNM), warm neutral medium (WNM), and noise components. We integrate our CNM map over velocity channels to compare it to an existing map produced by a spectrum-based method, and find that the two maps are highly correlated, while ours recovers more spatially coherent structures at small scales. Our work illustrates and quantifies a clear physical connection between the HI morphology and HI phase structure, and unlocks a new avenue for improving future phase separation techniques by making use of both HI spectral and spatial information to decompose HI in 3D position-position-velocity (PPV) space. These results are consistent with a physical picture where processes that drive HI phase transitions also shape the morphology of HI gas, imprinting a sparse, filamentary CNM that forms out of a diffuse, extended WNM.

 - **Abstract**
 Young star clusters can inherit bulk rotation from the molecular clouds from which they have formed. This rotation can affect the long-term evolution of a star cluster and its constituent stellar populations. In this study, we aim to characterize the effects of different degrees of initial rotation on star clusters with primordial binaries. The simulations are performed using NBODY6++GPU. We find that initial rotation strongly affects the early evolution of star clusters. Rapidly rotating clusters show angular momentum transport from the inner parts to the outskirts, resulting in a core collapse. Angular momentum transport is accompanied by a highly elongated bar-like structure morphology. The effects of bulk rotation are reduced on the timescale of two-body relaxation. Rotating and non-rotating clusters experience changes in the direction of angular momentum near the dissolution and early evolution due to the tidal field, respectively. We present synthetic observations of simulated clusters for comparison with future observations in filters of Gaia, CSST, and HST. This work shows the effects of bulk rotation on systems with primordial binaries and could be used for the identification of rotation signatures in observed open clusters.

          Gaseous Dynamical Friction on Hyperbolic Scatterings

 - **Abstract**
 We present a study of equal-mass hyperbolic encounters, embedded in a uniform gaseous medium. Using linear perturbation theory, we calculate the density wakes excited by these perturbers and compute the resulting forces exerted on them by the gas. We compute the changes to orbital energy, orbital angular momentum and apsidal precession across a wide range of eccentrities and pericenter Mach numbers. We identify six distinct classes of hyperbolic orbits, differing through their wake structure and subsequent orbital evolution. We find the gas to always dissipate orbital energy, leading to smaller semi-major axes and higher pericenter Mach numbers. The orbital angular momentum can either increase or decrease, whereas we typically find the orbital eccentricity to be damped, promoting supersonic gas-captures. Additionally, we find that the force exerted by the gas is not strictly frictional -- particularly for asymptotically subsonic trajectories. Therefore, despite the orbit-integrated changes to orbital parameters being similar to those predicted by the \cite{O99} prescription, the time evolution of the density wakes and the instantaneous forces exerted on the perturbers are significantly different.

 - **Abstract**
 The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has started a revolution in exoplanetary science. From studying in exquisite detail the chemical inventories and physical processes in gas giant exoplanets, the structure and chemical diversity of the enigmatic sub-Neptune population to even providing constraints on the atmospheric make-up of rocky exoplanets, the observatory is enabling cutting-edge science that is touching virtually every sub-area in the field. In this review Chapter, we showcase key highlights from exoplanet science being conducted with this state-of-the-art space observatory, which we believe is representative of the transformational science it is producing. One of the key takeaways from these pioneering JWST observations is how they are starting to reshape not only how we think, study and interpret exoplanet observations -- but how they are also reshaping our intuition about our very own Solar System planets.

 - **Abstract**
 In the standard model of terrestrial planet formation, planets are formed through giant impacts of planetary embryos after the dispersal of the protoplanetary gas disc. Traditionally, $N$-body simulations have been used to investigate this process. However, they are computationally too expensive to generate sufficient planetary populations for statistical comparisons with observational data. A previous study introduced a semi-analytical model that incorporates the orbital and accretionary evolution of planets due to giant impacts and gravitational scattering. This model succeeded in reproducing the statistical features of planets in $N$-body simulations near 1 au around solar-mass stars. However, this model is not applicable to close-in regions (around 0.1 au) or low-mass stars because the dynamical evolution of planetary systems depends on the orbital radius and stellar mass. This study presents a new semi-analytical model applicable to close-in orbits around stars of various masses, validated through comparison with $N$-body simulations. The model accurately predicts the final distributions of planetary mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity for the wide ranges of orbital radius, initial planetary mass, and stellar mass, with significantly reduced computation time compared to $N$-body simulations. By integrating this model with other planet-forming processes, a computationally low-cost planetary population synthesis model can be developed.

          Continuous Habitable Zone Metric for Prioritizing Habitable Worlds Observatory Targets

 - **Abstract**
 Future direct imaging space telescopes, such as NASA's Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), will be the first capable of both detecting and characterizing terrestrial exoplanets in the habitable zones (HZ) of nearby Sun-like stars. Since this will require a significant amount of time and resources for even a single system or exoplanet, the likelihood that a system will host detectable life should be considered when prioritizing observations. One method of prioritization is to estimate the likelihood that an exoplanet has remained continuously within the HZ long enough for life to emerge and make a detectable impact on the atmosphere. We utilize a Bayesian method to calculate the likelihood that a given orbital radius around a star is currently in the 2 Gyr continuous habitable zone (CHZ$_2$), the approximate time it took life on Earth to significantly oxygenate the atmosphere. We apply this method to the 164 stars in the NASA Exoplanet Exploration Program Mission Star List (EMSL) for HWO, representing a preliminary sample of Sun-like stars with HZs most accessible to a future direct imaging mission. By considering the CHZ$_2$ likelihood at all orbital radii outside a hypothetical inner working angle for HWO, we define a metric for prioritizing targets according to the accessibility and total extent of the CHZ$_2$. We find that the CHZ$_2$ metric peaks between $3-4$ Gyr for late-F and early-G dwarfs, but tentatively determine that stars earlier than $\sim {F3}$ or hotter than $\sim 6600$ K are unlikely to have a CHZ$_2$ at the time of observation.

 - **Abstract**
 The detection of helium escaping the atmosphere of exoplanets has revolutionized our understanding of atmospheric escape and exoplanetary evolution. Using high-precision spectroscopic observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) NIRISS-SOSS mode, we report the detection of significant helium absorption during the pre-transit phase of WASP-107b (17$\sigma$), as well as in the transit and post-transit phases. This unique continuous helium absorption begins approximately 1.5 hours before the planet's ingress and reveals the presence of an extended thermosphere. The observations show a maximum transit depth of 2.395$\% \pm$ 0.01$\%$ near the helium triplet (36$\sigma$; at NIRISS-SOSS resolution $\sim$ 700). Our ellipsoidal model of the planetary thermosphere matches well the measured light curve suggesting an outflow extending to tens of planetary radii. Furthermore, we confidently detect water absorption (log10 H2O=-2.5 $\pm$ 0.6), superimposed with a short-wavelength slope which we attribute to a prominent signature from unocculted stellar spots (5.2$\sigma$), rather than a small-particle haze slope. We place an upper limit on the abundance of K (log10 K$<$-4.86, or K/H$<$ 75$\times$ stellar) at 2$\sigma$, which is consistent with the O/H super-solar metallicity estimate. This study underscores the transformative potential of JWST for tracing atmospheric and mass-loss processes, while offering a benchmark for future studies targeting helium escape and its implications for planetary evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Using high-precision photometric data from TESS, medium resolution spectroscopic data from LAMOST, and long-term eclipse timings, we provide orbital parameters for two early-type detached eclipsing binary systems: TYC 3740-2072-1 and TYC 2888-780-1, and analyze the orbital period variations and evolutionary status of these two targets. TYC 3740-2072-1, with a spectral type of B1V, consists of a $6.914 M_\odot$ subgiant and a $6.233 M_\odot$ main-sequence component. It is expected to evolve into a semi-detached binary, potentially serving as a progenitor of a Type Ia supernova. TYC 2888-780-1 has a spectral type of A3 and consists of two main-sequence components with masses of $1.682 M_\odot$ and $1.673 M_\odot$, respectively. It is undergoing stable evolution. Through eclipse timing analysis, we find that both targets exhibit apsidal motion effects, with observed AM rates of $\dot{\omega}_{obs} = 0.0412~\text{deg}~\text{cycle}^{-1}$ and $\dot{\omega}_{obs} = 0.0205~\text{deg}~\text{cycle}^{-1}$, respectively. Additionally, TYC 2888-780-1 exhibits orbital period variations, which we attribute to the light travel time effect caused by a third body, the minimum mass of this third body is estimated to be $0.598 M_\odot$.

 - **Abstract**
 The Extreme Universe Space Observatory on a Super Pressure Balloon 2 (EUSO-SPB2) is a pathfinder mission toward a space-based observatory such as the Probe of Extreme Multi-Messenger Astrophysics (POEMMA). The aim of POEMMA is the observation of Ultra High Energy COsmic Rays (UHECRs) in order to elucidate their nature and origins and to discover $\gtrsim$ 20 PeV very high energy neutrinos that originate from transient and steady astrophysical sources. EUSO-SPB2 was launched from Wānaka New Zealand on May 13th, 2023 as a NASA Balloon Program Office test flight. The mission goals included making the first near-space altitude observations of the fluorescence emission from UHECR-induced extensive air showers (EASs) and making the first direct Cherenkov light emission from PeV cosmic rays traversing Earth's atmosphere. In addition, a Target of Opportunity program was developed for selecting and scheduling observations of potential neutrino sources as they passed just below the Earth's limb. Although a leaky balloon forced termination over the Pacific Ocean after 37 hours, data was collected to demonstrate the successful commissioning and operation of the instruments. This paper includes a description of the payload and the key instruments, pre-flight instrument characterizations in the lab and in the desert, flight operations and examples of the data collected. The flight was too short to catch a UHECR event via fluorescence, however about 10 candidate EAS events from cosmic rays were recorded via Cherenkov light.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the discovery of TCP J07222683$+$6220548, a new ultracompact binary system of the AM CVn type. This system was first identified displaying a $\Delta V = 7.6$ mag outburst on 2025-01-20.9416 UTC by the New Milky Way wide-field survey for transients and later independently detected by ASAS-SN and ZTF. The outburst peaked at $V_{\rm max} = 12.45$ and lasted for seven days, followed by a series of rebrightenings. No previous outbursts are found in archival data. Positive superhumps with a period of $0.032546 \pm 0.000084$ d ($46.87 \pm 0.12$ min), barely detectable during the main outburst, became clearly visible during the first rebrightening that lasted from day 18 to day 24 after the initial outburst. No convincing change in the superhump period was detected. Dense time-series photometry follow-up by a pair of 0.5-m INASAN robotic telescopes, together with VSNET and AAVSO observers, was essential for identifying TCP J07222683$+$6220548 as an AM CVn system and triggering confirmation spectroscopy with the 2.5-m CMO SAI telescope. Some outbursting AM CVn systems lacking such detailed follow-up may remain unrecognized among the newly discovered cataclysmic variable candidates.

 - **Abstract**
 RR Lyrae stars (RRLs) are old pulsating variables widely used as metallicity tracers due to the correlation between their metal abundances and light curve morphology. With ESA Gaia DR3 providing light curves for about 270,000 RRLs, there is a pressing need for scalable methods to estimate their metallicities from photometric data. We introduce a unified deep learning framework that estimates metallicities for both fundamental-mode (RRab) and first-overtone (RRc) RRLs using Gaia G-band light curves. This approach extends our previous work on RRab stars to include RRc stars, aiming for high predictive accuracy and broad generalization across both pulsation types. The model is based on a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) neural network optimized for time-series extrinsic regression. Our pipeline includes preprocessing steps such as phase folding, smoothing, and sample weighting, and uses photometric metallicities from the literature as training targets. The architecture is designed to handle morphological differences between RRab and RRc light curves without requiring separate models. On held-out validation sets, our GRU model achieves strong performance: for RRab stars, MAE = 0.0565 dex, RMSE = 0.0765 dex, R^2 = 0.9401; for RRc stars, MAE = 0.0505 dex, RMSE = 0.0720 dex, R^2 = 0.9625. These results show the effectiveness of deep learning for large-scale photometric metallicity estimation and support its application to studies of stellar populations and Galactic structure.

 Transformer networks excel in scientific applications. We explore two scenarios in ultra-high-energy cosmic ray simulations to examine what these network architectures learn. First, we investigate the trained positional encodings in air showers which are azimuthally symmetric. Second, we visualize the attention values assigned to cosmic particles originating from a galaxy catalog. In both cases, the Transformers learn plausible, physically meaningful features.

          Proposal for the optical design of three robust and highly performing FPI systems for the European Solar Telescope

 - **Abstract**
 We describe a proposal for the optical design of three dual Fabry-Perot based narrowband filter systems for for the future European Solar Telescope (EST). These are intended to constitute the core elements of three imaging spectropolarimeters, foreseen to become amongst the most important science instruments for EST. The designs proposed here rely heavily on the heritage of CRISP and CHROMIS, developed for the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope and described in detail in a companion paper (Scharmer et al. 2025, in prep.). The outstanding performance of these systems, and the simplicity of their designs, provide strong support of our proposal to build similar systems for EST. The design concepts involve i) minimising the FPI clear aperture diameter by means of numerical simulations based on constraints on Strehl and spectral resolution set by the EST Science Advisory Group (SAG); ii) a compact telecentric optical design with an optical path length of less than 4.7 m; iii) a straight-through optical system based on lenses and without any folding mirrors; iv) the combination of a high resolution etalon with high reflectivity and a low reflectivity, low resolution etalon, to mitigate the effects of cavity errors (Scharmer 2006, Scharmer et al. 2025); v) flexibility in terms of image scale by simple replacement of the last lens (the camera lens) of the FPI system. We propose to compensate for the focus curve of ESTs Pier Optical Path (POP) by focusing the camera lenses of the FPI systems. s. The proposed systems should offer several advantages over other much more complex systems, including manufacture, alignment, stability, flexibility of changes of image scale, and costs. The underlying design concepts also make the proposed FPI systems robust and highly performing in terms of image quality, overall transmission, and fidelity of the spectral transmission profile.

 Transitional millisecond pulsars (tMSPs) in tight binary systems represent an important evolutionary link between low-mass X-ray binaries and radio millisecond pulsars. To date, only three confirmed tMSPs and a few candidates have been discovered. Most of them are gamma-ray sources. For this reason, searching for multiwavelength counterparts to unassociated Fermi gamma-ray sources can help to find new tMSPs. Here we investigate whether the unassociated gamma-ray source 4FGL J1824.2+1231 belongs to the tMSP family. To find the counterpart to 4FGL J1824.2+1231, we used data from SRG/eROSITA and Swift X-ray catalogues, and from different optical catalogues. We also performed time-series photometric optical observations of the source with the 2.1-m telescope of the Observatorio Astronomico Nacional San Pedro Martir, the 1.5-m telescope of the Maidanak Astronomical Observatory and the 1.5-m Russian-Turkish telescope. In addition, we carried out optical spectroscopic observations with the Russian-Turkish telescope and used archival spectroscopic data obtained with the Gemini-North telescope. Within the position error ellipse of 4FGL J1824.2+1231, we found only one X-ray source which coincides with an optical object. We consider it as a likely multiwavelength counterpart to 4FGL J1824.2+1231. The source shows strong optical variability and significant proper motion. The latter strongly implies that this is a Galactic source. Double-peaked H and He emission lines are detected in its spectrum with a flat continuum, as often observed in accretion disks of compact binary systems. The X-ray spectrum is well fitted by a power law with the photon index 1.7. The derived intrinsic X-ray-to-gamma-ray flux ratio is about 0.2. If the X-ray/optical source is the true counterpart to 4FGL J1824.2+1231, then all its properties suggest that it is a tMSP in the subluminous disk state.

 - **Abstract**
 Simulation-based inference (SBI) enables cosmological parameter estimation when closed-form likelihoods or models are unavailable. However, SBI relies on machine learning for neural compression and density estimation. This requires large training datasets which are prohibitively expensive for high-quality simulations. We overcome this limitation with multifidelity transfer learning, combining less expensive, lower-fidelity simulations with a limited number of high-fidelity simulations. We demonstrate our methodology on dark matter density maps from two separate simulation suites in the hydrodynamical CAMELS Multifield Dataset. Pre-training on dark-matter-only $N$-body simulations reduces the required number of high-fidelity hydrodynamical simulations by a factor between $8$ and $15$, depending on the model complexity, posterior dimensionality, and performance metrics used. By leveraging cheaper simulations, our approach enables performant and accurate inference on high-fidelity models while substantially reducing computational costs.

 - **Abstract**
 Extragalactic foregrounds in cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations are both a source of cosmological and astrophysical information and a nuisance to the CMB. Effective field-level modeling that captures their non-Gaussian statistical distributions is increasingly important for optimal information extraction, particularly given the precise and low-noise observations from current and upcoming experiments. We explore the use of Wavelet Flow (WF) models to tackle the novel task of modeling the field-level probability distributions of multi-component CMB secondaries. Specifically, we jointly train correlated CMB lensing convergence ($\kappa$) and cosmic infrared background (CIB) maps with a WF model and obtain a network that statistically recovers the input to high accuracy -- the trained network generates samples of $\kappa$ and CIB fields whose average power spectra are within a few percent of the inputs across all scales, and whose Minkowski functionals are similarly accurate compared to the inputs. Leveraging the multiscale architecture of these models, we fine-tune both the model parameters and the priors at each scale independently, optimizing performance across different resolutions. These results demonstrate that WF models can accurately simulate correlated components of CMB secondaries, supporting improved analysis of cosmological data. Our code and trained models can be found here (this https URL).

 - **Abstract**
 We set up and perform collision rate simulations between dark matter in the form of asteroid-mass primordial black holes (PBHs) and white dwarf stars. These encounters trigger prompt detonations and could be the key to solving the ignition mystery of type Ia supernovae. Our framework is flexible enough to cover the full range of progenitor white dwarf masses, host galaxy stellar masses, galactocentric radial offsets, and cosmic time. The rate distribution pattern is consistent with exhaustive literature observational determinations for a slightly extended log-normal PBH mass spectrum. Most strikingly, the so far unexplained brightness distribution comes out without finetuning. We find no severe contradictions, except that the inferred PBH mass scale is unpredicted from first principles.

 - **Abstract**
 We conduct a search for stellar-mass binary black hole mergers in gravitational-wave data collected by the LIGO detectors during the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) third observing run (O3). Our search uses a machine learning (ML) based method, Aframe, an alternative to traditional matched filtering search techniques. The O3 observing run has been analyzed by the LVK collaboration, producing GWTC-3, the most recent catalog installment which has been made publicly available in 2021. Various groups outside the LVK have re-analyzed O3 data using both traditional and ML-based approaches. Here, we identify 38 candidates with probability of astrophysical origin ($p_\mathrm{astro}$) greater than 0.5, which were previously reported in GWTC-3. This is comparable to the number of candidates reported by individual matched-filter searches. In addition, we compare Aframe candidates with catalogs from research groups outside of the LVK, identifying three candidates with $p_\mathrm{astro} > 0.5$. No previously un-reported candidates are identified by Aframe. This work demonstrates that Aframe, and ML based searches more generally, are useful companions to matched filtering pipelines.

          Rapid binary mass transfer: Circumbinary outflows and angular momentum losses

 - **Abstract**
 High rates of stable mass transfer likely occur for some binary star systems, but the resulting flow of mass and angular momentum (AM) is unclear. We perform hydrodynamical simulations of a polytropic donor star and a point mass secondary to determine the mass, AM, and velocity of gas that escapes the system, and the dependence on binary parameters such as mass ratio. The simulations use an adiabatic equation of state and do not include any radiative cooling or irradiation of the outflow. Mass transfer is initiated by injecting heat into the stellar envelope, causing it to gradually inflate and overflow its Roche lobe. The transferred mass flows into an accretion disk, but soon begins to escape through the outer Lagrange point (L2), with a lesser amount escaping through the L3 point. This creates an equatorially concentrated circumbinary outflow with an opening angle of 10 to 30 degrees with a wind-like density profile $\rho \propto r^{-2}$. We find that the ratios of the specific AM of the outflowing gas over that of the L2 point are approximately {0.95, 0.9, 0.8, 0.65} for binary mass ratios $q$ (accretor/donor) of {0.25, 0.5, 1, 2}. The asymptotic radial velocity of the outflowing gas, in units of the binary orbital velocity, is approximately 0.1 to 0.2 for the same mass ratios, except for $q=0.25$ where it might be higher. This outflow, if ultimately unbound from the binary, may be a source of circumstellar material that will interact with ejecta from a subsequent supernova or stellar merger.

 - **Abstract**
 Transit timing variation (TTV) is a useful tool for studying the orbital properties of transiting objects. However, few TTV studies have been done on transiting brown dwarfs (BDs) around solar-type stars. Here we study the long-term TTV of a population of close BD companions around solar-type stars using TESS data. We use the measured orbital period change rate to constrain the tidal interaction strength between the host star and the BD companion and put limits on the destruction timescale of these transiting BDs. However, we find no statistically significant evidence of orbital decay or expansion in our sample based on the current data. This may be due to either poor observational data or inherently weak tidal dissipation. We then perform simulations to investigate future observation strategies for detecting orbital decay of transiting BDs, which show NGTS-7A b, TOI-263~b and LP 261-75 b are the most promising targets in the next few years. Our study demonstrates the potential of TTV technique to probe the formation and evolution of close BD companions around solar-type stars.

          PRODIGE - envelope to disk with NOEMA: V. Low 12C/13C ratios for CH3OH and CH3CN in hot corinos

 - **Abstract**
 The 12C/13C isotope ratio has been derived towards numerous cold clouds (20-50 K) and a couple protoplanetary disks and exoplanet atmospheres. However, direct measurements of this ratio in the warm gas (>100 K) around young low-mass protostars remain scarce, but are required to study its evolution during star and planet formation. We derived 12C/13C ratios from the isotopologues of the complex organic molecules (COMs) CH3OH and CH3CN in the warm gas towards seven Class 0/I protostellar systems to improve our understanding of the evolution of the 12C/13C ratios during star and planet formation. We used the data that were taken as part of the PRODIGE large program with the NOEMA at 1mm. The emission of CH3OH and CH3CN is spatially unresolved in the PRODIGE data (300au scale). Derived rotational temperatures exceed 100K, telling us that they trace the gas of the hot corino, where CH3CN probes hotter regions than CH3OH on average (290 K versus 180 K). The column density ratios between the 12C and 13C isotopologues, derived from LTE analysis, range from 4 to 30, thus, are significantly lower than the expected local ISM isotope ratio of about 68. Assuming that CH3CN and CH3OH may inherit the 12C/13C ratio from their precursor species, astrochemical models were conducted for the latter and compared with our observational results. We conclude that an enrichment in 13C in COMs at the earliest protostellar stages is likely inherited from the COMs' precursor species, whose 12C/13C ratios are set during the prestellar stage via isotopic exchange reactions. This also implies that low 12C/13C ratios observed at later evolutionary stages could at least partially be inherited. A final conclusion on 12C/13C ratios in protostellar environments requires improved observations to tackle current observational limitations and additional modelling efforts.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an algorithmic method for efficiently planning a long-term, large-scale multi-object spectroscopy program. The Sloan Digital Sky Survey V (SDSS-V) Focal Plane System performs multi-object spectroscopy using 500 robotic positioners to place fibers feeding optical and infrared spectrographs across a wide field. SDSS-V uses this system to observe targets throughout the year at two observatories in support of the science goals of its Milky Way Mapper and Black Hole Mapper programs. These science goals require observations of objects over time with preferred temporal spacinges (referred to as "cadences"), which can differ from object to object even in the same area of sky. robostrategy is the software we use to construct our planned observations so that they can best achieve the desired goals given the time available as a function of sky brightness and local sidereal time, and to assign fibers to targets during specific observations. We use linear programming techniques to seek optimal allocations of time under the constraints given. We present the methods and example results obtained with this software.

 - **Abstract**
 Kepler-51 is a 500 Myr G dwarf hosting three "super-puffs" and one low-mass non-transiting planet. Kepler-51d, the coolest (T_eq ~ 350 K) transiting planet in this system, is also one of the lowest density super-puffs known to date (rho_p = 0.038 +/- 0.009 g/cm^3). With a planetary mass of Mp = 5.6 +/- 1.2 Earth masses and a radius of Rp = 9.32 +/- 0.18 Earth radii, the observed properties of this planet are not readily explained by most planet formation theories. Hypotheses explaining Kepler-51d's low density range from a substantial H/He envelope comprising more than 30% of its mass, to a high-altitude haze layer, to a tilted ring system. To test these hypotheses, we present the NIRSpec-PRISM 0.6-5.3 micron transmission spectrum of Kepler-51d observed by the James Webb Space Telescope. We find a spectrum best fit by a sloped line covering the entire wavelength range. Based on forward modeling and atmosphere retrievals, Kepler-51d likely possesses a low-metallicity atmosphere with high-altitude hazes of submicron particle sizes spanning pressures of 1-100 microbars. However, the spectrum could also be explained by a tilted ring with an estimated lifetime on the order of ~0.1 Myr. We also investigate the stellar activity of this young Sun-like star, extracting a spot temperature significantly hotter than sunspots and spot covering fractions on the order of 0.1-10%, depending on the assumed spot parameters.

          Classifying the derivatives of light curves for overcontact eclipsing binaries

 - **Abstract**
 Recent studies indicate that the physical properties of eclipsing binaries can be extracted from the derivatives of their light curves. A classification scheme for the derivatives of light curves would be helpful for identifying key characteristics of eclipsing binaries. In this study, we propose a new classification method for the light curves of overcontact eclipsing binaries by using their derivatives. We synthesized 89,670 sample light curves of overcontact binaries and categorized them into five types on the basis of their first to fourth derivatives. For each type, we examined the statistical distributions of four parameters: the mass ratio, orbital inclination, fill-out factor, and eclipse obscuration. Their distributions demonstrated that parameter values exhibit certain trends depending on the classified types. With the proposed classification method, general properties of overcontact binaries can be understood, providing a foundation for further detailed analysis.

          Gravitational waves of quasi-circular, inspiraling black hole binaries in an ultralight vector dark-matter environment

 - **Abstract**
 The gravitational waves emitted by massive black hole binaries can be affected by a variety of environmental effects, which, if detected, could inform astrophysics and cosmology. We here study how gravitational waves emitted by black holes in quasi-circular orbits are affected by the presence of an ultra-light, vector-field, dark-matter environment that is minimally coupled to the binary. This dark-matter environment induces oscillatory gravitational potentials that perturb the orbit of the binary, leaving an imprint in the binary's binding energy, and thus, on the gravitational waves emitted. We here compute the effect of this environment on the gravitational-wave phase using the stationary-phase approximation within the post-Newtonian formalism. We then perform a Fisher analysis to estimate the detectability of this environmental effect with a four-year LISA observation, focusing on vector fields with ultra-light masses in the $(10^{-19}, 10^{-16}) \; \rm{eV}$ range. We conclude that the observation of such gravitational waves with space-borne interferometers, like LISA, could yield a measurement or constraint on local, vector dark-matter environments, provided the dark-matter density is larger than roughly $10^{14} \rm{M}_\odot/{\rm{pc}}^3$.

 - **Abstract**
 In the study of optical transients, parameter inference is the process of extracting physical information, i.e. constraints on the source's characteristics, by comparing the observed lightcurves to the predictions of different models and finding the model and parameter combination that make the closest match. In the developing field of the study of kilonovae (KNe), systematic uncertainties in modelling are still very large, and many models struggle to fit satisfactorily the whole multi-wavelength dataset of the AT2017gfo kilonova, associated to the Binary Neutron Star (BNS) merger GW170817. In a multi-messenger context, we sometime observe tensions between KN-only inference results and constraints from other messengers. In order to discuss the compatibility of KN models with observations and with the information derived from other messengers, we detail the process of Bayesian parameter inference, identifying the many sources of uncertainty embedded in KN analyses. We highlight the systematic error margin hyperparameter $\sigma_{\rm sys}$, which can be exploited as a metric for a model's goodness-of-fit. We then discuss how to assess the performance of parameter inference analyses by quantifying the information gain using the Kullback-Leibler divergence between prior and posterior. Using the example of the Bu2019lm model with the NMMA Bayesian inference framework, we showcase the expected performance that dedicated KN follow-ups with telescope networks could reasonably reach, highlighting the different factors (observational cadence, error margins) that influence such inference performances. We finally apply our KN analysis to the dataset of AT2017gfo to validate our performance predictions and discuss the complementarity of multi-messenger approaches.

          Changing disc compositions via internal photoevaporation II: M dwarf systems

 - **Abstract**
 The chemical evolution of the inner regions of protoplanetary discs is a complex process. Several factors influence it, one being the inward drift and evaporation of volatile-rich pebbles. During the disc's evolution, its inner part is first enriched with evaporating water-ice, resulting in a low C/O ratio. Afterwards, C-rich gas from the outer disc is transported inwards. Consequently, the C/O ratio of the inner disc increases again after 2 Myr. Previously, we studied how internal photoevaporation influences these processes in discs around Sun-like stars. We now extend our study to lower-mass stars, where the time evolution of the disc's C/O ratio is different due to the closer-in position of the evaporation fronts and differences in disc mass, size and structure. Our simulations are carried out with the semi-analytical 1D disc model chemcomp, which includes viscous evolution and heating, pebble growth and drift, pebble evaporation and condensation, as well as a simple chemical partitioning model. We show that internal photoevaporation plays a major role in the evolution of protoplanetary discs: As for Sun-like stars, photoevaporation opens a gap, which stops inward drifting pebbles. In addition, volatile-rich gas from the outer disc is carried away by the photoevaporative winds. Consequently, the C/O ratio in the inner disc remains low, contradicting observations of discs around low-mass stars. Our model implies that young inner discs (< 2 Myr) should be O-rich and C-poor, while older discs (> 2 Myr) should be C-rich. The survival of discs to this age can be attributed to lower photoevaporation rates, which either originate from a large spread of observed X-ray luminosities or from the photoevaporation model used here, which likely overestimates the photoevaporation efficiency. A reduction of the latter brings the calculated elemental abundances into better agreement with observations.

 - **Abstract**
 PSR B1259-63/LS 2883 is a well-studied gamma-ray binary hosting a pulsar in a 3.4-year eccentric orbit around a Be-type star. Its non-thermal emission spans from radio to TeV energies, exhibiting a significant increase near the periastron passage. This paper is dedicated to the analysis of INTEGRAL observations of the system following its last periastron passage in June 2024. We aim to study the spectral evolution of this gamma-ray binary in the soft (0.3-10 keV) and hard (30-300 keV) X-ray energy bands. We performed a joint analysis of the data taken by INTEGRAL/ISGRI in July-August 2024 and quasi-simultaneous Swift/XRT observations. The spectrum of the system in the 0.3-300 keV band is well described by an absorbed power law with a photon index of $\Gamma=1.42\pm 0.03$. We place constraints on potential spectral curvature, limiting the break energy $E_\mathrm{b}>30$ keV for $\Delta\Gamma>0.3$ and cutoff energy $E_\mathrm{cutoff}>150$ keV at 95% confidence level. For one-zone leptonic emission models, these values correspond to electron distribution spectral parameters of $E_\mathrm{b,e}>0.8$ TeV and $E_\mathrm{cutoff,e}>1.7$ TeV, consistent with previous constraints derived by H.E.S.S.

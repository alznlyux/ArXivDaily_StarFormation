 - **Abstract**
 We present A databaSe of millimeTeR ObservatioNs of Asteroids Using acT (ASTRONAUT) hosted on Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS) in the form of a public Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) bucket. This bucket is an Amazon cloud storage database containing flux measurements for a group of asteroids at millimeter (mm) wavelengths. These measurements were collected by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) from 2017 to 2021 in frequency bands centered near 90, 150, and 220 GHz. The ASTRONAUT database contains observation times, normalized flux values, and associated error bars for 170 asteroids above a signal-to-noise ratio of 5 for a single frequency band over the stacked co-added maps. We provide an example in generating light curves with this database. We also present a Jupyter notebook to serve as a reference guide when using the S3 bucket. The container and notebook are publicly available in a GitHub repository.

          KMT-2018-BLG-0029Lb and OGLE-2019-BLG-0960Lb: Mass Measurements for Two Super-Earth Microlensing Planets

 - **Abstract**
 KMT-2018-BLG-0029Lb and OGLE-2019-BLG-0960Lb were the lowest mass-ratio microlensing planets at the time of discovery. For both events, microlensing parallax measurements from the Spitzer Space Telescope implied lens systems that were more distant and massive than those inferred from the ground-based parallax. Here, we report on the detection of excess flux aligned to the event locations using Keck Adaptive Optics imaging, which is consistent with the expected brightness of main-sequence hosts under the ground-based parallax, but inconsistent with that predicted by Spitzer. Based on the excess flux, ground-based parallax, and angular Einstein radius, we determine KMT-2018-BLG-0029Lb to be a $4.2\pm0.5 M_\oplus$ planet orbiting a $0.70\pm0.07 M_\odot$ host at a projected separation of $3.1\pm0.3$ au, and OGLE-2019-BLG-0960Lb to be a $2.0\pm0.2 M_\oplus$ planet orbiting a $0.40\pm0.03 M_\odot$ host at a projected separation of $1.7\pm0.1$ au. We report on additional light-curve models for KMT-2018-BLG-0029 under the generalized inner-outer (offset) degeneracy, which were not reported in the original analysis. We point out inconsistencies in the inner/outer labeling of the degenerate models in the lens and source planes, and advocate for the lens-plane convention, which refers to the planet being closer or further to the host star compared to the image it perturbs. Lastly, we discuss the possibility of breaking this degeneracy via ground concurrent observations with the Roman Space Telescope.

          Transiting Planetary Debris near the Roche Limit of a White Dwarf on a 4.97$\,$hr Orbit -- and its Vanishing

 - **Abstract**
 We present the discovery of deep, irregular, periodic transits towards the white dwarf ZTF$\,$J1944$+$4557 using follow-up time-series photometry and spectroscopy from Palomar, Keck, McDonald, Perkins, and Lowell observatories. We find a predominant period of 4.9704$\,$hr, consistent with an orbit near the Roche limit of the white dwarf, with individual dips over 30$\%$ deep and lasting between 15 and 40 minutes. Similar to the first known white dwarf with transiting debris, WD$\,$1145$+$017, the transit events are well-defined with prominent out-of-transit phases where the white dwarf appears unobscured. Spectroscopy concurrent with transit photometry reveals the average Ca$\,$K equivalent width remains constant in and out of transit. The broadening observed in several absorption features cannot be reproduced by synthetic photospheric models, suggesting the presence of circumstellar gas. Simultaneous $g+r$- and $g+i$-band light curves from the CHIMERA instrument reveal no color dependence to the transit depths, requiring transiting dust grains to have sizes $s \gtrsim0.2\,\mu$m. The transit morphologies appear to be constantly changing at a rate faster than the orbital period. Overall transit activity varies in the system, with transit features completely disappearing during the seven months between our 2023 and 2024 observing seasons and then reappearing in 2025$~$March, still repeating at 4.9704$\,$hr. Our observations of the complete cessation and resumption of transit activity provide a novel laboratory for constraining the evolution of disrupted debris and processes like disk exhaustion and replenishment timescales at white dwarfs.

          Radiation pressure role in accreting massive black hole binaries

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the impact of radiation pressure on the circumbinary discs surrounding accreting massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) at milli-parsec separations, using 3D hyper-Lagrangian resolution hydrodynamic simulations. The circumbinary discs in our simulations evolve under an adiabatic equation of state. The gas temperature is therefore allowed to change through viscous heating, black-body cooling and self-gravity. We take a significant step further by including the contribution of radiation pressure in the simulations. We model binaries with a total mass of $10^6 \, M_{\odot}$, eccentricities $e=0,0.45,0.9$ and mass ratios $q= 0.7, 1$. We find that the radiation pressure significantly alters the vertical and thermal structure of the disc, resulting in a geometrically thinner, therefore colder configuration. This leads to a reduced accretion rate onto the binary and suppresses cavity eccentricity growth and precession in circular equal mass binaries. The binary eccentricity remains approximately constant, while the semi-major axis decreases over time due to net negative torque, regardless of the initial binary orbital parameters.

          VLT/MUSE Detection of the AB Aurigae b Protoplanet with $H _{\rm α}$ Spectroscopy

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze high-contrast, medium-spectral-resolution $H_{\rm \alpha}$ observations of the star AB Aurigae using the Very Large Telescope's Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE). In multiple epochs, MUSE detects the AB Aur b protoplanet discovered from Subaru/SCExAO data in emission at wavelengths slightly blue-shifted from the $H_{\rm \alpha}$ line center (i.e. at 6558.88--6560.13 Å; $\sim$ -100 km s$^{-1}$) and in absorption at redshifted wavelengths (6562.8--6565.1 Å; $\sim$ 75 km s$^{-1}$). AB Aur b's $H_{\rm \alpha}$ spectrum is inconsistent with that of the host star or the average residual disk spectrum and is dissimilar to that of PDS 70 b and c. Instead, the spectrum's shape resembles that of an inverse P Cygni profile seen in some accreting T Tauri stars and interpreted as evidence of infalling cold gas from accretion, although we cannot formally rule out all other nonaccretion origins for AB Aur b's MUSE detection. AB Aurigae hosts only the second protoplanetary system detected in $H_{\rm \alpha}$ thus far and the first with a source showing a spectrum resembling an inverse P Cygni profile. Future modeling and new optical data will be needed to assess how much of AB Aur b's emission source(s) originates from protoplanet accretion reprocessed by the disk, a localized scattered-light feature with a unique $H_{\rm \alpha}$ profile, or another mechanism.

 - **Abstract**
 The AT 2018cow-like fast blue optical transient AT2022tsd showed a large number of few-minute-duration, high-luminosity (~10^43 erg/s) flares. We present an intensive search for such flares from another 18cow-like event, AT2024wpp. We have used the Large Array Survey Telescope (LAST) to observe this transient between 28 and 74 days after the approximate time of zero flux. The target was observed for about 23 hours to a sensitivity that allows one to detect 3x10^42 erg/s flares at S/N>5. No optical flares have been found, suggesting a one-sided 2-sigma confidence upper limit of <0.02 on the flare's duty cycle, and flare rate lower than about 0.11/hr. These limits suggest that not all 18cow-like objects display a high rate of minute-timescale luminous flares. This can be explained either by diversity in the 18cow-like population or by viewing angle effects (e.g., beaming), or rather that the optical depth towards the central emitting region did not fall below unity during the particular search window.

          Non-Thermal Ionization of Kilonova Ejecta: Observable Impacts

 - **Abstract**
 The characteristic rapid rise and decline at optical wavelengths of a kilonova is the product of the low ejecta mass ($\lesssim 0.05 M_\odot$) and high ejecta velocity ($\gtrsim 0.1$c). We show that, even at very early times ($\lesssim 2$ days), regions of ejecta fall below critical density and temperature thresholds at which non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) effects become important. Here, we present an approximate method for calculating the ionization state of the ejecta that accounts for the NLTE impact of high-energy electrons produced in the beta decay of freshly synthesized $r$-process elements. We find that incorporating ionization from high-energy electrons produces an ``inverted" and ``blended" ionization structure, where the most highly ionized species are located in the fastest moving homologous ejecta and multiple ionization states coexist. In radiation transport calculations, the higher degree of ionization reduces line blanketing in optical bands, leading to improved agreement with the light curve properties of AT\,2017gfo such as the duration, decay rates, brightness, and colors. Our quasi-NLTE implementation helps to alleviate tensions in kilonova modeling: for high-velocity ($\sim 0.3c$) ejecta components our models require less mass for a given peak brightness in optical bands, by as much as a factor of 3; our models can explain the presence of observed features associated to Sr II, W III, Se III, and Te III under conditions where LTE models would predict only neutral species; and we naturally predict the coexistence of species like Sr II and Ce III without the need for fine-tuning of the ejecta properties.

 - **Abstract**
 Few spectra of directly-imaged exoplanets have been obtained in the mid-infrared (> 3 $\mu$m). This region is particularly rich in molecular spectral signatures, whose measurements can help recover atmospheric parameters and provide a better understanding of giant planet formation and atmospheric dynamics. In the past years, exoplanet interferometry with the VLTI/GRAVITY instrument has provided medium-resolution spectra of a dozen substellar companions in the near infrared. The 100-meter interferometric baselines allow for the stellar and planetary signals to be efficiently disentangled at close angular separations (< 0.3''). We aim to extend this technique to the mid-infrared using MATISSE, the VLTI's mid-infrared spectro-interferometer. We take advantage of the fringe tracking and off-axis pointing capabilities recently brought by the GRA4MAT upgrade. Using this new mode, we observed the giant planet $\beta$ Pictoris b in L and M bands (2.75-5 $\mu$m) at a spectral resolution of 500. We developed a method to correct chromatic dispersion and non-common paths effects in the fringe phase and modelled the planet astrometry and stellar contamination. We obtained a high-signal-to-noise spectrum of $\beta$ Pictoris b, showing the planet continuum in L (for the first time) and M bands, which contains broad absorption features of H$_2$O and CO. In conjunction with a new GRAVITY spectrum, we modelled it with the ForMoSA nested sampling tool and the Exo-REM grid of atmospheric models, and found a solar carbon-to-oxygen ratio in the planet atmosphere. This study opens the way to the characterization of fainter and closer-in planets with MATISSE, which could complement the JWST at angular separations too close for it to obtain exoplanet spectra. Starting in 2025, the new adaptive optics system brought by the GRAVITY+ upgrade will further extend the detection limits of MATISSE.

          VLT observations of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS II. From quiescence to glow: Dramatic rise of Ni I emission and incipient CN outgassing at large heliocentric distances

 - **Abstract**
 We report VLT spectroscopy of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS (C/2025 N1) from $r_{\rm h}\!\simeq\!4.4$ to $2.85$ au using X-shooter (300-550 nm, $R\!\simeq\!3000$) and UVES (optical, $R\!\simeq\!35k-80k$). The coma is dust-dominated with a fairly constant red optical continuum slope ($\sim$21-22\%/1000Å). At $r_{\rm h}\!\simeq\!3.17$ au we derive $3\sigma$ limits of $Q({\rm OH})<7.76\times10^{23}\ {\rm s^{-1}}$, but find no indications for [O I], C$_2$, C$_3$ or NH$_2$. We report detection of CN emission and also detect numerous Ni I lines while Fe I remains undetected, potentially implying efficiently released gas-phase Ni. From our latest X-shooter measurements conducted on 2025-08-21 ($r_{\rm h} = 2.85$\,au) we measure production rates of $\log~Q(\mathrm{CN}) = 23.61\pm 0.05$ molecules s$^{-1}$ and $\log~Q$(Ni) $= 22.67\pm0.07$ atoms s$^{-1}$, and characterize their evolution as the comet approaches perihelion. We observe a steep heliocentric-distance scaling for the production rates $Q(\mathrm{Ni}) \propto r_h^{-8.43 \pm 0.79}$ and for $Q(\mathrm{CN}) \propto r_h^{-9.38 \pm 1.2}$, and predict a Ni-CO$_{(2)}$ correlation if the Ni I emission is driven by the carbonyl formation channel. Energetic considerations of activation barriers show that this behavior is inconsistent with direct sublimation of canonical metal/sulfide phases and instead favors low-activation-energy release from dust, e.g. photon-stimulated desorption or mild thermolysis of metalated organics or Ni-rich nanophases, possibly including Ni-carbonyl-like complexes. These hypotheses are testable with future coordinated ground-based and space-based monitoring as 3I becomes more active during its continued passage through the solar system.

 - **Abstract**
 Elements heavier than hydrogen and helium, collectively termed metals, were created inside stars and dispersed through space at the final stages of stellar evolution. The relative amounts of different isotopes (variants of the same element with different masses) in stellar atmospheres provide clues about how our galaxy evolved chemically over billions of years. M dwarfs are small, cool, long-lived stars that comprise three-quarters of all stars in our galaxy. Their spectra exhibit rich fingerprints of their composition, making them potential tracers of chemical evolution. We measure rare carbon and oxygen isotopes in 32 nearby M dwarfs spanning a range of metallicities using high-resolution infrared spectroscopy. We find that stars with higher metal content have lower 12C/13C ratios, indicating they formed from material progressively enriched in 13C over time. This pattern is consistent with models where novae eruptions contributed significant amounts of 13C to the interstellar medium over the past few billion years. Our measurements of 16O/18O ratio match theoretical predictions and suggest that metal-rich stars reach 16O/18O ratios significantly lower than the Sun. These results establish M dwarfs as tracers of chemical enrichment throughout cosmic history.

          Rotating Neutron Stars with Dark Matter Halos

 - **Abstract**
 If dark matter (DM) exists in halos around rotating neutron stars (NSs), it will be essential to understand the effects of rotation on the distribution of DM and baryonic matter (BM) in the stars to interpret observations. In this work, we construct rapidly rotating dark matter admixed neutron stars (DANS) with DM halos using the two-fluid approximation, where the BM and DM interact only through gravity. Our goal is to describe rapidly rotating millisecond-period DANS spun up by the accretion of BM from a zero angular momentum state. We extend the Rapidly Rotating Neutron Star (RNS) code to compute axisymmetric configurations in which the BM rotates rigidly while the DM remains torque-free and differentially rotates through the frame-dragging of spacetime. For the first time, we examine in detail local and global definitions of mass in general relativity for two-fluid systems, showing how their differences affect the interpretation of baryonic and dark component masses. We compute energy density and frame-dragging frequency profiles for DANS with three different characteristic DM halos. We demonstrate that rapid BM rotation reduces DM halo sizes if central energy densities are kept constant between non-rotating and rotating models. We also construct sequences of DANS to create mass and radius curves and compare rotating and non-rotating cases. Finally, we quantify deviations in the spacetime metric outside the baryonic surfaces of these sequences of stars caused by the DM halos. We hypothesize that the size of this quantity could indicate whether a DM halo will significantly impact X-ray pulse profile modeling. These results provide a framework for assessing the observational consequences of DM halos around rapidly rotating NSs.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmography is a model-independent phenomenological approach to observational cosmology, relying on Taylor series expansions of physical quantities as a function of the cosmological redshift or other analogous variables. A recent work developed the formalism for a cosmographic analysis of astrophysical and local measurements of the fine-structure constant, $\alpha$, and provided first constraints on the corresponding parameters. Here we update the earlier work, both by including more recent measurements of $\alpha$, and by extending it to other fundamental dimensionless couplings. We find no statistically significant evidence for such variations, and place stringent constraints on the first two terms of all these cosmographic series: the linear coefficient in the $\alpha$ series is constrained to parts per billion level, thanks to recently improved atomic clock constraints, while the other coefficients are constrained to parts per million level. Additionally, we use the same data to place cosmographic constraints on models from a broad class of Grand Unified Theories in which varying fundamental constants occur, and highlight how future data can provide a discriminating cosmographic test between freezing and thawing dark energy models.

          Impacts of axion cooling on the direct detection of supernova axions

 - **Abstract**
 Core-collapse supernovae provide a unique opportunity to probe axions because they can be a copious source of the particles. It has recently been proposed that axion helioscopes can be used for the direct search for supernova axions if a supernova event appears within a few hundred parsecs. However, the event number of supernova axions has been estimated only within the post-process framework. In this study, we perform long-term supernova simulations for a 9.6M_sun star coupled with the axion emission to reevaluate the event number of axions detected by the helioscopes. We find that the additional cooling induced by the axion emission can significantly decrease the temperature in the proto-neutron star. As a result, the axion luminosity and hence the axion event number are reduced, compared with the result obtained through post-processing. Our result indicates that the nonlinear feedback of the axion emission is an essential factor to predict the axion detectability, and underscores the need for systematic simulation studies across various progenitor models.

 - **Abstract**
 Differential heating and radiation on asymmetric asteroids can cause measurable changes in their rotation rates and spin axes, known as the YORP effect. In binary systems, such radiation-driven torques can change the mutual asteroid orbits, termed the binary YORP or BYORP effect. To study how binary asteroid shapes and thermophysical properties affect surface temperatures and BYORP, we developed a new 3D thermophysical model which balances insolation, 1D conduction, visible light reflection, and mutual heating through scattered infrared radiation. Using 3D ray tracing, we include eclipses, shadowing from horizons and topography, and mutual radiation exchange between the primary and secondary asteroids. We perform global modeling of the binary asteroid (175706) 1996 FG3, a Janus mission target. At perihelion, we find that the 1996 FG3 system experiences temperatures between 100 and 475 K. We find that eclipses and thermal inertia can alter secondary surface temperatures by up to 14%, with a mean difference due to radiation from the primary of just over 1%. We also present a model for calculating the BYORP effect using binary thermophysical model results. This model compares well to analytical approximations of the BYORP coefficient B, and suggests that thermal effects like eclipses and thermal inertia can reduce torque in the 1996 FG3 system and alter the BYORP coefficient by up to several percent. For 1996 FG3, eclipses alter B by approximately 7%, resulting in a lower torque on the secondary. Though small, in the absence of tidal effects this would reduce the contraction of the semimajor axis by about 20 meters over 10,000 years. Our findings suggest that thermal effects can alter temperatures and BYORP calculations sufficiently that they should be included when modeling binaries. The relative importance of each effect is predicted to vary with the properties of the studied system.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a study of bright, young $\delta$ Scuti stars near the zero-age main sequence using TESS light curves and Gaia DR3 data. From a sample of 2041 stars with G<7 and $G_{BP}-G_{RP}$ colour in the range 0-0.6, we identified 444 $\delta$ Scuti pulsators. We measured a pulsator fraction of ~70% in the middle of the instability strip, tapering off towards the edges. A period - luminosity diagram reveals a concentration along the fundamental mode and overtone ridges. We addressed sample completeness and identified low-frequency pulsators possibly exhibiting mixed modes. Cross-matching with nearby young associations showed that 63 $\delta$ Scuti stars from our sample are association members.

 - **Abstract**
 Bibliometric methods provide valuable tools for assessing scientific productivity and impact across disciplines, yet their application in astronomy journals remains relatively limited. This study conducts a bibliometric analysis of Japanese astronomy publications before and after the commissioning of the Subaru Telescope, a major national investment in observational infrastructure. Using data from Scopus and SciVal, we examine peer-reviewed journal articles published between 1996 and 2007 by authors affiliated with Japanese institutions, focusing on field-normalized citation indicators such as the Field-Weighted Citation Impact (FWCI) and the share of publications in the top 10% most cited globally. Subaru Telescope-based publications are identified through cross-referencing with official telescope publication lists and are compared against national and global benchmarks. The results show that Subaru Telescope-based publications, while accounting for less than 10% of Japan's total scholarly output in astronomy, consistently achieved FWCI values above 2.0 and a significantly higher proportion of highly cited papers. This indicates that the Subaru Telescope substantially enhanced Japan's research visibility and impact, especially during its early operational years. This study demonstrates the utility of bibliometric evaluation in capturing the academic return of large-scale research facilities and contributes to broader discussions on research infrastructure in astronomy.

 - **Abstract**
 Are the most massive objects in the Universe today the direct descendants of the most massive objects at higher redshift? We address this question by tracing the evolutionary histories of haloes in the MultiDark Planck2 simulation. By following the 100 most massive halos at $z = 0$ across cosmic time, we find that only 40\% of them were among the largest 100 halos at $z = 1$. This suggests that many of today's most massive clusters were not the most dominant structures at earlier times, while some of the most massive objects at high redshift do not remain in the top mass ranks at later epochs. The hierarchical nature of structure formation predicts that, on average, massive haloes grow over time, with their abundance in comoving space decreasing rapidly at higher redshifts. However, individual clusters exhibit diverse evolutionary paths: some undergo early rapid growth, while others experience steady accretion or significant merger-driven mass changes. A key assumption in self-similar models of cluster evolution is that the most massive objects maintain their rank in the mass hierarchy across cosmic time. In this work, we test this assumption by constructing a mass-complete sample of haloes within the $(1 h^{-1}{\rm Gpc})^3$ volume of MultiDark and analysing when clusters enter and exit a high-mass-selected sample. Our results demonstrate that cluster selections must be carefully constructed, as significant numbers of objects can enter and leave the sample over time. These findings have important implications for observational cluster selection and comparisons between simulations and surveys, especially at high redshift.

 - **Abstract**
 (Abridged) Quasar studies with Herschel/SPIRE often report host luminosities ranging from 10^{12} to 10^{14} Lsun, suggestive of star formation rates (SFRs) of up to several thousand Msun/yr. Due to the limited spatial resolution of SPIRE, it is uncertain whether the far-infrared (FIR) emission originates from the quasar itself, nearby sources, or unrelated sources within the SPIRE beam. High-resolution observations at wavelengths close to the SPIRE coverage are needed to pinpoint the true source of the FIR emission. In this work we unambiguously identify the ALMA Band 7 counterparts of a statistical sample of 152 FIR-bright SDSS quasars and estimate the multiplicity rates among these systems. Based on the multiplicities, we assess the importance of mergers as triggers for concomitant accretion onto supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and extreme star formation. In ~60% of cases, the submm emission originates from a single counterpart within the SPIRE beam, centred on the optical coordinates of the quasar. The multiplicity rate increases by a factor of ~2.5 between redshifts 1 and 2.5. The incidence of multiplicities is consistent among broad absorption line (BAL) quasars and non-BAL quasars. The multiplicities observed in a fraction of the sample indicate that, while mergers enhance gas inflow efficiency, there must be viable alternatives for driving synchronous SMBH growth and intense star formation in isolated systems. We report the serendipitous detection of two CO(6-5) and three CO(7-6) transitions out of the eight such transitions expected based on the spectral setup and the redshifts of the objects in the sample. Higher transitions are not detected, indicating that the quasars are not exciting sufficiently the gas in their hosts. Finally, we also detect a potential emission of H2O, HCN (10-9) or a combination of both in the spectrum of a quasar at redshift 1.67.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of an exceptionally short burst recurrence time in the well-known clocked burster GS~1826$-$238, observed with the CubeSat X-ray observatory NinjaSat. The source had remained in a persistent soft spectral state since its hard-to-soft transition in 2015 July until a soft-to-hard transition occurred in 2025 May. On 2025 June 23, NinjaSat began monitoring GS~1826$-$238 in the hard state and continued until the source returned to a steady soft state. During this period, we detected 19 X-ray bursts: 14 during the hard state, 4 in the transitional state, and 1 in the soft state. In the hard state, we identified a new clocked bursting epoch, during which the burst recurrence time remained highly stable and unprecedentedly short among the clocked bursting phases of GS~1826$-$238, with $t_{\rm rec} = 1.603 \pm 0.040$~hr~($1\sigma$ error). Furthermore, this recurrence time deviates significantly by approximately~37\% from the previously established empirical relation $t_{\rm rec} \propto F_{\rm bol}^{-1.05}$, where $F_{\rm bol}$ is the bolometric persistent flux. These results suggest that the ignition conditions for X-ray bursts differed from those in earlier epochs. We explore possible explanations for this discrepancy and propose a scenario in which a smaller fraction of the neutron star surface was involved in fuel accumulation and nuclear burning. This situation leads to a high local accretion rate compared to earlier epochs, which naturally results in the exceptionally short recurrence time, as well as the observed reductions of approximately 38\% in blackbody normalization (proportional to the emitting area) and 29\% in burst fluence.

 - **Abstract**
 Atmospheres of transiting exoplanets can be studied spectroscopically using space-based or ground-based observations. Each has its own strengths and weaknesses, so there are benefits to both approaches. This is especially true for challenging targets such as cooler, smaller exoplanets whose atmospheres likely contain many molecular species and cloud decks. We aim to study the atmosphere of the warm Neptune-like exoplanet WASP-107 b (Teq~740 K). Several molecular species have been detected in this exoplanet in recent space-based JWST studies, and we aim to confirm and expand upon these detections using ground-based VLT, evaluating how well our findings agree with previously retrieved atmospheric parameters. We observe two transits of WASP-107 b with VLT/CRIRES+ and create cross-correlation templates of the target atmosphere based on retrieval results from JWST studies. We create different templates to investigate the impact of varying volume mixing ratios of species and inclusion or exclusion of clouds. Considering this target's observational challenges, we create simulated observations prior to evaluating real data to assess expected detection significances. We report detections of two molecular species, CO (~6 S/N) and H2O (~4.5 S/N). This confirms previous space-based detections and demonstrates, for the first time, the capability of VLT/CRIRES+ to detect species in targets cooler than hot Jupiters using transmission spectroscopy. We show our analysis is sensitive to cloud inclusion, but less so to different volume mixing ratios. Interestingly, our detection deviates from its expected location in our Kp-vsys diagrams, and we speculate on possible reasons for this. We demonstrate that the error budget for relatively cooler exoplanets is severely reduced in comparison to hotter exoplanets, and underline need for further work in context of high-resolution spectroscopy.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of diffuse radio emission within SNR G338.3-0.0 using new MeerKAT observations at 816 MHz and 1.4 GHz. The radio emission spatially overlaps with the X-ray pulsar wind nebula (PWN) powered by PSR J1640-4631 and the GeV/TeV gamma-ray source HESS J1640-465. The morphology of this radio emission is centrally peaked and its extent is well-contained within the SNR shell. A lack of mid- and far-infrared counterparts and the absence of catalogued H II regions argues against a thermal origin, while the morphology and radial profile are suggestive of a PWN origin powered by PSR J1640-4631. Under this assumption, we use a one-zone, time dependant model to reproduce the size and broadband (radio, X-ray, and gamma-rays) spectral energy distribution of the PWN. The modelling and broadband properties of this PWN suggests it is currently interacting with the reverse shock within its host SNR. This evolutionary stage is associated with particles escaping the PWN and entering the ISM, suggesting this object may be an important source of Galactic PeV e+/e-

 - **Abstract**
 In the past decades several thousand exoplanet systems have been discovered around evolved, main-sequence stars, revealing a wide diversity in their architectures. To understand how the planet formation process can lead to vastly different outcomes in system architecture we have to study the starting conditions of planet formation within the disks around young stars. In this study we are presenting high resolution direct imaging observations with VLT/SPHERE of the young ($\sim$5 Myr), nearby ($\sim$133 pc), solar-analog designated as WISPIT 2($=$ TYC~5709-354-1). These observations were taken as part of our survey program that explores the formation and orbital evolution of wide-separation gas giants. WISPIT 2 was observed in four independent epochs using polarized light and total intensity observations. They reveal for the first time an extended (380 au) disk in scattered light with a multi-ringed sub-structure. We directly detect a young proto-planet WISPIT 2b, embedded in a disk gap and show that it is co-moving with its host star. Multiple SPHERE epochs demonstrate that it shows orbital motion consistent with Keplerian motion in the observed disk gap. Our $H$ and $K_s$-band photometric data are consistent with thermal emission from a young planet. By comparison with planet evolutionary models, we find a mass of the planet of $4.9^{+0.9}_{-0.6}$ Jupiter masses. This mass is also consistent with the width of the observed disk gap, retrieved from hydrodynamic models. WISPIT 2b is the first unambiguous planet detection in a multi-ringed disk, making the WISPIT 2 system the ideal laboratory to study planet-disk interaction and subsequent evolution.

          Is ozone a reliable proxy for molecular oxygen? III. The impact of CH$_4$ on the O$_2$-O$_3$ relationship for Earth-like atmospheres

 - **Abstract**
 In the search for life in the Universe, molecular oxygen (O$_2$) combined with a reducing species, such as methane (CH$_4$), is considered a promising disequilibrium biosignature. In cases where it would be difficult or impossible to detect O$_2$ (e.g., mid-IR or low O$_2$ levels), it has been suggested that ozone (O$_3$), the photochemical product of O$_2$, could be used as a proxy for determining the abundance of O$_2$. As the O$_2$-O$_3$ relationship is nonlinear, the goal of this series of papers is to explore how it would change for different host stars and atmospheric compositions and learning how to use O$_3$ to infer O$_2$. We used photochemistry and climate modeling to further explore the O$_2$-O$_3$ relationship by modeling Earth-like planets with the present atmospheric level (PAL) of O$_2$ between 0.01% to 150% along with high and low CH$_4$ abundances of 1000% and 10% PAL, respectively. Methane is of interest not only because it is a biosignature, but also the source of hydrogen atoms for hydrogen oxide (HO$_x$) which destroys O$_3$ through catalytic cycles and acts as a catalyst for the smog mechanism of O$_3$ formation in the lower atmosphere. We find varying CH$_4$ causes changes to the O$_2$-O$_3$ relationship in ways that are highly dependent on both host star and O$_2$ abundance. A striking result for high CH$_4$ models in high O$_2$ atmospheres around hotter hosts is that enough CH$_4$ is efficiently converted into H$_2$O to significantly impact stratospheric temperatures, and therefore the formation/destruction rates of O$_3$. Changes in HO$_x$ also influenced the HO$_x$ catalytic cycle and smog O$_3$, causing variations in harmful UV reaching the surface as well as changes in the 9.6~$\mu$m O$_3$ feature in emission spectra. This demonstrates the need to explore the O$_2$-O$_3$ relationship in order to use O$_3$ as a reliable proxy for O$_2$ in future observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Type IIn supernovae (SNe IIn) are a subclass of core-collapse SNe in which strong interactions occur between the ejecta and dense circumstellar material, creating ideal conditions for the production of high-energy neutrinos. This makes them promising candidate sources of neutrinos. In this work, we conduct an association study between 163 SNe IIn observed by the Zwicky Transient Facility and 138 neutrino alert events detected by the IceCube neutrino observatory. After excluding alerts with poor localization, we find two SNe that are spatiotemporally coincident with neutrino events. IC231027A and IC250421A coincide with the positions of SN2023syz and SN2025cbj, respectively, within their localization uncertainties, and the neutrino arrival times are delayed by 38 days and 61 days relative to the discovery times of the corresponding SNe. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we estimate that the probability of such two coincidences occurring by chance in our sample is $p \sim 0.67\%$, suggesting a high likelihood that they arise from genuine associations, though the result is not yet statistical significant. Furthermore, model calculations show that the expected numbers of neutrino events from these SNe IIn could be consistent with the actual observations. Our study provides possible evidence that interacting SNe may be potential neutrino-emitting sources.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmological measurements have revealed tensions within the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, notably discrepancies in the Hubble constant and $S_8$ parameter. Additionally, recent observations suggested evidence of a possible non-flat spatial curvature and an anomalous CMB lensing amplitude that beyond the $\Lambda$CDM framework. In this study, we explore whether introducing a variation in the electron mass $m_e$, allowing non-zero spatial curvature $\Omega_K$, and a free lensing amplitude $A_{\rm lens}$ can resolve these persistent tensions. Without relying on any local Universe measurements, we obtain $H_0 = 69.61^{+0.60}_{-0.55} \rm \, km \, s^{-1} \, Mpc^{-1}$ and $S_8= 0.808\pm0.012$, with $\Delta m_e / m_e = 0.0109^{+0.0066}_{-0.0062}$ and $A_{\rm lens} = 1.030^{+0.039}_{-0.037}$, both of which exceed the $\Lambda$CDM expectations. We find no indication of spatial curvature deviating from flatness, even when including the Cosmic Chronometers and SNe Ia samples. Our results point to a promising direction for cosmological models to reconcile these discrepancies, although more precise data from future experiments will be necessary to clarify these modifications.

          Quintessential dark energy crossing the phantom divide

 - **Abstract**
 Motivated by recent results from the DESI collaboration, we explore two classes of quintessence models that can give rise to crossing of the dark energy equation of state through the ``phantom divide'' $w=-1$. These are models with Lagrangians that involve higher powers of the kinetic energy $\dot\phi^2$, or where the dark matter (DM) mass is a function of $\phi$. Both have similar features with respect to the reconstructed redshift-dependent $w(z)$: moderate tuning of parameters is required to achieve the desired shape, and it is difficult or impossible for $w(z)$ to continue evolving smoothly as $z$ becomes large. Nevertheless, they give a strong improvement over $\Lambda$CDM in fitting the data. We point out that models of coupled dark matter and dark energy that cross the phantom divide are under pressure from constraints on long-range DM forces. They rule out the simplest renormalizable coupling of scalar DM to quintessence, but leave the fermionic case marginally allowed, while exponentially coupled models are safe from current constraints.

          Tracing Signatures of Modified Gravity in Redshift-Space Galaxy Bispectrum Multipoles: Prospects for Euclid

 - **Abstract**
 We study the galaxy bispectrum multipoles in the Hu-Sawicki $f(R)$ gravity model, where a scalar degree of freedom mediates a fifth force that is screened in high-density environments. The model is specified by $f_{R0}$, the present-day background value of the scalar field, which controls the strength of deviations from General Relativity (GR). Using perturbation theory, we compute the redshift-space galaxy bispectrum with the full scale- and time-dependent second-order kernels, incorporating corrections from the scale-dependent growth rate and nonlinear screening. Expanding the bispectrum in spherical harmonics, we analyze the sensitivity of the multipoles to modified gravity and forecast their detectability in a \textit{Euclid}-like survey. The monopole ($B_0^0$) and quadrupole ($B_2^0$) show the strongest signatures, with relative deviations of $2\%$-$8\%$ at $z=0.7$ and $k_1\simeq0.3\,h\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ for $f_{R0}=10^{-5}$. Higher multipoles provide weaker but complementary signals. Finger-of-God damping and galaxy bias significantly modulate the results, requiring joint modeling of these nuisance parameters. For \textit{Euclid}, we forecast signal-to-noise ratios up to $\sim30$ for the monopole and $\sim15$ for the quadrupole. These results demonstrate that bispectrum multipoles are a powerful probe of gravity, capable of breaking degeneracies with bias and velocity effects and strengthening constraints on deviations from $\Lambda$CDM.

 - **Abstract**
 In interacting dark energy (DE) and dark matter (DM) scenarios, the interaction function typically includes a coupling parameter $\xi$ that quantifies the strength of energy exchange between the dark sectors. While $\xi$ is often assumed to be constant, there is no fundamental reason to exclude a time-dependent coupling, which could provide a more general and realistic description of dark sector dynamics. In this work, we study two widely used interacting models involving pressureless DM and DE, where the coupling parameter is allowed to vary with the scale factor $a$. Specifically, we consider two parametrizations: $\xi(a) = \xi_0 + \xi_a (1-a)$ and $\xi(a) = \xi_0 \left(1 + \frac{1-a}{a^2 + (1-a)^2} \right)$, and constrain them using the latest cosmological observations, including Planck 2018 CMB data, DESI DR2 BAO measurements, and multiple Type Ia supernovae samples. Our results show that one scenario yields evidence for a non-zero interaction at more than 95\% confidence level, while the remaining cases indicate at most mild or inconclusive signs of interaction. These findings highlight the potential of variable coupling models and the importance of continued investigation into the nature of the dark sectors.

 - **Abstract**
 Since its observation in 2019, the first image of a super-massive black hole using Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) with an Earth-scale baseline has generated much scientific and public interest, including the possible extension of the baseline into space to obtain higher image resolution. Operating one or more VLBI nodes in space will require the use of frequency standards that are space qualified, greatly reducing the number of options available. The coherence function C(T) is the metric usually used to determine the viability of a frequency standard. Here we show that C(T) is a useful but not sufficient metric for gauging frequency standard performance in VLBI and instead derive an expression for the clock-limited VLBI visibility S/N. We evaluate this expression for real frequency standards and find only the Ultra-Stable Oscillator (USO) and hydrogen maser to be viable for upcoming high-frequency VLBI with the USO only useful for very limited integration times (30s at 90 GHz, 10s at 230 GHz, 5s at 345 GHz, and not viable at 630 GHz). The maser extends these, but may have prohivitive size for a space mission. We also evaluate emerging frequency standard technologies and find the Optical Local Oscillator portion of optical clocks to be very promising (conservatively >100s at 90 GHz, 60s at 230 GHz, 40s at 345 GHz, and 22s at 630 GHz) when accounting for both performance and potential operation in space.

 - **Abstract**
 Neutral hydrogen (HI) 21-cm Intensity Mapping (IM) holds the potential to map the large-scale structures in the Universe over a wide redshift range $(z \lesssim 5.5)$, measure cosmological parameters, and shed light on the nature of dark energy. In addition, the signal is also sensitive to how the HI is distributed among the dark matter haloes, this being quantified through the HIHM relation, which relates the HI mass to the halo mass. In this work, we investigate whether measurements of the 21-cm power spectrum (PS) and bispectrum (BS) at large scales can be used to estimate the HIHM relation, which quantifies the HI distribution at small scales. As a proof of concept, we consider the simulated 21-cm IM signal at $z=1$. We find that the measured 21-cm PS and BS at large scales $(k \le k_{ul} = 0.32 \, {\rm Mpc}^{-1})$ are well modeled using perturbation theory, with only two free parameters namely $[\Omega_{\rm HI} b_1]$ and $\gamma = b_2/b_1$. Combining the measured 21-cm PS and BS with an independent measurement of $\Omega_{\rm HI} $, we show that it is possible to estimate the three parameters that quantify the HIHM relation. We expect observational estimates of the HIHM relation to shed light on galaxy formation and the evolution of the ISM. Our preliminary analysis ignores redshift space distortion and the system noise in IM observations, which we plan to address in future work.

After reviewing the main characteristics and performance of the currently available options, Micro Shutter Arrays by NASA/Goddard and Digital Micromirror Devices by Texas Instruments, we present our planned first generation/baseline devices with 30 micron x 30 miron pixel size arranged in a 1K x 1K format with tilt angle 15 degrees. Our goal is to bring to maturity a technology capable of delivering arrays of 2K x 2K element of 100 micron x 100 micron, buttable on two sides to achieve even larger formats. In additions to MEMS design, we will develop the associated device packaging and electronic control circuitry leveraging on the extensive expertise gained in the last 30+ years by leading experts from digital imaging industry.

 This paper reports the observations of two coronal shocks from two Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) for the Successive type II Solar radio bursts observed on 02 May 2021 in the frequency range of 80 - 1 MHz with the time interval of ~ 20 minutes between them. Both the bursts show clear band splitting features in the harmonic band. The estimated heights for the source of the first type II burst lies in the range of 2.06 - 2.93 R0 with the average speeds of 601 + or - 76, 700 + or - 91 and 783 + or - 105 km/s for 2 X, 3.5 X and 5 X Saito electron density models, and the heights for the source of the second type II burst lies in the range of 2.24 - 3.83 R0 with the average speeds of 1063 + or - 113, 1287 + or - 145 and 1478 + or - 172 km/s. The successive CMEs are observed by the twin Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory STEREO-A between 11:20 - 12:21 UT in the Extreme Ultra Violet Imager (EUVI) and in the Internally Occulting Refractive Coronagraphs (COR1) FOV, the two coronal shocks are generated by the two successive CMEs observed at (11:30) 11:26 UT and (11:55:00) 11:56 UT according to ST-A (EUVI) COR1 observations and most likely released from the same active region. The average speeds of CMEs at COR1 FOV are about 574 = or - 64 km/s and 595 + or - 82 km/s. The simultaneous observations of the EUV structures and the radio bursts, their coinciding height-time further confirms that the successive CMEs are responsible for the successive shocks and their related radio bursts in the corona. The observed band-splitting in the successive type-II radio bursts provides the compression ratios of 1.26 and 1.45 respectively. Therefore, these observations confirms the presence of shock waves in the corona.

 We analyze binary black hole (BBH) mergers from the latest Gravitational Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC-3) using a flexible, non-parametric framework to infer the underlying black hole mass distribution. Our model employs Gaussian Processes (GPs) with astrophysically motivated priors to represent the mass distribution, assuming both component masses are independently drawn from a common mass function. This approach enables us to capture complex features in the population without relying on rigid parametric forms. Motivated by predictions from binary stellar evolution, we focus on the presence of a mass gap in the range $40-120~ M_\odot$, attributed to the pair-instability supernova (PISN) and pulsational PISN (PPISN) processes. Using our GP-based model, we find for the first time, strong evidence for the onset of this mass gap, locating its lower edge at approximately $45-60 ~M_\odot$. We observe a suppression in the BBH merger rate when comparing the latest constraints against our GP model, by a factor of $10-60$ at $\sim60~M_\odot$, corresponding to the minimum of the mass gap. Additionally, we find evidence of a subpopulation of mergers populating the mass gap around $70 ~M_\odot$, which we argue is due to hierarchical mergers, as well as of a feature in the $40-50~ M_\odot$ range, albeit with low significance, which we attribute to the predicted PPISN build up. We discuss the astrophysical implications of this result in light of GW231123, a recently reported BBH merger with a total mass potentially above the PISN gap, suggesting the need for revised models of massive stellar evolution or alternative formation channels.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate a qualitatively new regime of inflationary models with small and rapid oscillations in the potential--resonant non-Gaussianity. In contrast to the standard scenario, where most of the observable information is encoded in the power spectrum, in this regime the oscillatory signal predominantly appears in higher-order correlation functions with large $n$. This behavior emerges when the oscillation frequency $\omega$ exceeds the naive cutoff of the theory, $4\pi f$. However, as noted by Hook and Rattazzi [2306.12489], the actual cutoff is somewhat higher--though only logarithmically--when the amplitude of the oscillations is small. We identify a phenomenologically relevant window in which $n$-point functions with $3 \lesssim n \lesssim 9$ are potentially observable. In this regime, the signal exhibits 350 - 1000 oscillations per decade in $k$.

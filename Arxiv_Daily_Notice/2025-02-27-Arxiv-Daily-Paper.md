          Effects of limited core rejuvenation on the properties of massive contact binaries

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Massive contact binaries are both stellar merger and gravitational wave progenitors, but their evolution is still uncertain. An open problem in the population synthesis of massive contact binaries is the predicted mass ratio distribution. Current simulations evolve quickly to mass ratios close to unity, which is not supported by the sample of observed systems. It has been shown that modifying the near core mixing properties of massive stars can alter the evolution of contact binaries, but it has not been tested on a whole population. Aims. We implement a prescription of the convective core overshooting based on the molecular gradient. The goal of the implementation is to limit the rejuvenation efficiency of the accretor. We aim to investigate the effects of the reduced rejuvenation on the mass ratio distribution of massive contact binaries. Methods. We calculate a grid of 4896 models with the binary-evolution code MESA with our convective overshoot formulation, and we compare the simulations with the known observations of massive contact binaries. Results. We find that by limiting the core rejuvenation through the convective core overshoot, the predicted mass-ratio distribution shifts significantly to values away from unity. This improves the theoretical predictions of the mass ratios of massive contact binaries. Conclusions. The core rejuvenation of the components in massive contact binaries is a key parameter for their predicted mass ratio distribution. Establishing the rejuvenation efficiency with the contact binary population should therefore be possible. The sample size and uncertainties associated to the characterization of contact binaries however prevents us from doing so, and other methods like asteroseismology can place constraints on the rejuvenation process.

          Seeing the Outer Edge of the Infant Type Ia Supernova 2024epr in the Optical and Near Infrared

 - **Abstract**
 We present optical-to-near infrared (NIR) photometry and spectroscopy of the Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) 2024epr, including NIR spectra observed within two days of first light. The early-time optical spectra show strong, high-velocity Ca and Si features near rarely-observed velocities at $\sim$0.1$c$, and the NIR spectra show a \CI\ "knee." Despite these high-velocity features at early times, SN~2024epr evolves into a normal SN Ia, albeit with stronger peak-light Ca absorption than other SNe Ia with the same light curve shape. Although we infer a normal decline rate, $\Delta m_{15}(B)=1.09\pm0.12$ mag, from the light-curve rise, SN 2024epr is a Branch "cool" object and has red early-time colors ($g-r\approx0.15$ mag at $-10$ days). The high velocities point to a density enhancement in the outer layers of the explosion, but thick-shell He-detonation models do not match the smoothly rising light curve or lack of He in our early-time NIR spectra. No current models (e.g., delayed detonation or thin He shell double detonation) appear to reproduce all of the observed properties. Such constraints are only possible for SN 2024epr from the earliest optical and NIR observations, highlighting their importance for constraining SN Ia models. Finally, we find several other SNe Ia with intermediate mass elements at $\sim$30\,000 km s$^{-1}$ within days after the explosion that evolve into otherwise normal SNe Ia at peak light, suggesting the early-time spectra of SNe Ia may hide a broad diversity of observational characteristics.

 - **Abstract**
 Stars and their associated planets originate from the same cloud of gas and dust, making a star's elemental composition a valuable indicator for indirectly studying planetary compositions. While the connection between a star's iron (Fe) abundance and the presence of giant exoplanets is established (e.g. Gonzalez 1997; Fischer & Valenti 2005), the relationship with small planets remains unclear. The elements Mg, Si, and Fe are important in forming small planets. Employing machine learning algorithms like XGBoost, trained on the abundances (e.g., the Hypatia Catalog, Hinkel et al. 2014) of known exoplanet-hosting stars (NASA Exoplanet Archive), allows us to determine significant "features" (abundances or molar ratios) that may indicate the presence of small planets. We test on three groups of exoplanets: (a) all small, R$_{P}$ $<$ 3.5 $R_{\oplus}$, (b) sub-Neptunes, 2.0 $R_{\oplus}$ $<$ R$_{P}$ $<$ 3.5 $R_{\oplus}$, and (c) super-Earths, 1.0 $R_{\oplus}$ $<$ R$_{P}$ $<$ 2.0 $R_{\oplus}$ -- each subdivided into 7 ensembles to test different combinations of features. We created a list of stars with $\geq90\%$ probability of hosting small planets across all ensembles and experiments ("overlap stars"). We found abundance trends for stars hosting small planets, possibly indicating star-planet chemical interplay during formation. We also found that Na and V are key features regardless of planetary radii. We expect our results to underscore the importance of elements in exoplanet formation and machine learning's role in target selection for future NASA missions: e.g., the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (NGRST), Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) -- all of which are aimed at small planet detection.

          Where do High-Velocity Dark Matter Particles come from in the Milky Way?

 - **Abstract**
 High-velocity particles ( $v>v_\mathrm{esc}$) in the Milky Way are rare but nonetheless important to characterize due to their impact on dark matter (DM) direct detection experiments. We select halos similar in mass to the Milky Way in a large-volume dark matter simulation and measure the incidence of high-velocity particles, finding that an average fraction $\sim 1.3\times 10^{-5}$ of the DM particles have $\Delta v > 600$ km/s within 5-11 kpc of the halo centers. However, some systems have dramatically higher fractions. Milky Way-like systems with high-speed satellites can have high-velocity DM fractions of order $\sim 100\times$ higher than average. The environment also affects high-velocity DM fractions; massive nearby halos ( $>10^{13} M_{\odot}$) can boost high-velocity DM density by $\sim 10\times$, although there is little effect for nearby Andromeda-like systems. We confirm previous predictions from zoom-in simulations that the high-velocity particles in the Milky Way with heliocentric speeds $>700$ km/s primarily originate from the Large Magellanic Cloud, and provide a table of expected high-velocity DM densities at different heliocentric velocity thresholds.

 - **Abstract**
 We systematically perform long-term (millions of Schwarzschild time) axisymmetric viscous hydrodynamics simulations for tori around black holes in general relativity supposing the super Eddington accretion flow. The initial condition for the tori is modeled simply by the Fishbone-Moncrief torus with a constant specific angular momentum $j$ but with a wide variety of $j$. We find that for a given density profile, the fraction of the mass infall onto the black hole is approximately proportional to $j^{-1}$, indicating that only a minor fraction of the matter in the torus formed far from the black hole falls into the black hole while the majority is ejected with the typical average velocity of a few percent of the speed of light. We also find that the mass ejection is driven only outside $\approx 2\,r_\mathrm{ISCO}$ where $r_\mathrm{ISCO}$ is the areal radius of the innermost stable circular orbit around black holes, which depends strongly on the black hole spin. We derive an approximate fitting formula for the spin-dependence on the mass infall fraction as $\propto r_\mathrm{ISCO}^{0.7}$, which suggests that the rapid growth of supermassive black holes proceeded primarily by the accretion of the matter with the angular momentum counter-rotating with the black hole spin.

          Effects of spacetime geometry on neutrino oscillation inside a Core-Collapse Supernova

 - **Abstract**
 Neutrinos are excellent probes of the inner structures of supernovas. However, an understanding of their dynamics remains incomplete, which is crucial for properly interpreting the detector data. The huge matter density inside a core-collapse supernova affects the self-coupling of the neutrinos through a geometrical four-fermion interaction induced by spacetime torsion generated by the fermions themselves. For normal mass hierarchy, the effect is negligible; for inverted mass hierarchy however, we find that the gravitational coupling can significantly alter the flavor dynamics. The possibility of constraining the said interactions through the relative abundance of different flavors of the neutrinos is discussed.

          An Extremely Hot Pulsating Pre-White Dwarf from OGLE

 - **Abstract**
 We show that the blue 18.3-minute variable object discovered in the Galactic disk by the OGLE-III survey and named OGLE-GD-WD-0001 is a pulsating pre-white dwarf of PG 1159 spectral type. With an effective temperature of about 160,000 K it is among the hottest known pulsators being located close to the blue edge of the GW Virginis instability strip. The long-term OGLE observations indicate that the object has a positive period change rate of about $5 \times 10^{-10}$ $s~s^{-1}$ and thus already contracts. There are no traces of a planetary nebula around this star.

          A Pluto-Charon Sonata V. Long-term Stability of the HST State Vector

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze a new set of 275 n-body calculations designed to place limits on the masses of the small circumbinary satellites in the Pluto-Charon system. Together with calculations reported in previous papers, we repeat that a robust upper limit on the total mass of the four satellites is roughly $9.5 \times 10^{19}$ g. For satellite volumes derived from New Horizons, this mass limit implies a robust upper limit on the bulk densities of Nix and Hydra, $\lesssim 1.7$ g cm$^{-3}$, that are comparable to the bulk density of Charon. Additional calculations demonstrate that satellite systems with mass $\lesssim 8.25 \times 10^{19}$ g are robustly stable over the current age of the Sun. The bulk densities of Nix and Hydra in these lower mass systems are clearly smaller than the bulk density of Charon. These new n-body results enable accurate measurements of eccentricity and inclination for Nix, Kerberos, and Hydra that agree well with orbital elements derived from numerical calculations with new HST and New Horizons state vectors. With these new state vectors, Styx has a 37% larger eccentricity and an 85% smaller inclination, which makes it more prone to gravitational perturbations from Nix.

          The arc-shaped radio source at the center of NGC 6334A: Is it a colliding wind region of two young massive stars or the bow shock of a runaway star?

 - **Abstract**
 New multi-wavelength Karl G. Jansky VLA observations of CKR02A, the compact radio source in the center of the compact HII region NGC 6334A, are presented. The observations were carried out in five epochs and included the frequency ranges 8.0 - 12.0 GHz (X-band), 18.0 - 26.0 GHz (K-band), and 29.0 - 37.0 GHz (Ka-band). The source is detected and resolved in all the observed epochs and in all bands. The source shows a clear arc-shaped structure consistent with a bow shock. The analysis of the spectral index maps indicates that its spectral index is $\alpha=-0.68\pm0.17$, suggesting that the emission is non-thermal. Two astronomical objects can explain the emission nature and morphology of the source: a colliding wind region of two massive stars or the bow shock of a massive runaway star. However, no massive stars are reported so far in the center of NGC 6334A, though its presence is also suggested by the free-free radio emission of the C-HII region itself. Using ancillary VLA data, we measured a preliminary proper motion of $19\pm6$ mas yr$^{-1}$, equivalent to a velocity of $120\pm40$ km s$^{-1}$. A detailed discussion of the implications of both scenarios is provided. Finally, a list of compact radio sources in the vicinity of NGC 6334A is given and briefly discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 The "super-puffs" are a population of planets that have masses comparable to that of Neptune but radii similar to Jupiter, leading to extremely low bulk densities ($\rho_p \lesssim 0.2\,\mathrm{g}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$) that are not easily explained by standard core accretion models. Interestingly, several of these super-puffs are found in orbits significantly misaligned with their host stars' spin axes, indicating past dynamical excitation that may be connected to their low densities. Here, we present new Magellan/PFS RV measurements of WASP-193, a late F star hosting one of the least dense transiting planets known to date ($M_p = 0.112^{+0.029}_{-0.034}\,M_J$, $R_p = 1.319^{+0.056}_{-0.048}\,R_J$, $\rho_p = 0.060\pm0.019\,\mathrm{g}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$). We refine the bulk properties of WASP-193 b and use interior structure models to determine that the planet can be explained if it consists of roughly equal amounts of metals and H/He, with a metal fraction of $Z = 0.42$. The planet is likely substantially re-inflated due to its host star's evolution, and expected to be actively undergoing mass loss. We also measure the projected stellar obliquity using the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect, finding that WASP-193 b is on an orbit well-aligned with the stellar equator, with $\lambda = 17^{+17}_{-16}$ degrees. WASP-193 b is the first Jupiter-sized super-puff on a relatively well-aligned orbit, suggesting a diversity of formation pathways for this population of planets.

 - **Abstract**
 Over a hundred gravitational-wave (GW) detections and candidates have been reported from the first three observing runs of the Advanced LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) detectors. Among these, the most intriguing events are binary black hole mergers that result in a 'lite' intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) of ${\sim}10^2~\mathrm{M}_\odot$, such as GW170502 and GW190521. In this study, we investigate 11 GW candidates from LVK's Third Observing Run (April 2019-March 2020) that have a total detector-frame masses in the lite IMBH range. Using the Bayesian inference algorithm \texttt{RIFT}, we systematically analyze these candidates with three state-of-the-art waveform models that incorporate higher harmonics, which are crucial for resolving lite IMBHs in LVK data. For each candidate, we infer the pre-merger and post-merger black hole masses in the source frame, along with black hole spin projections across all three models. Under the assumption that these are binary black hole mergers, our analysis finds that 5 of them have a post-merger lite IMBH with masses ranging from $110\sim 350~\mathrm{M}_\odot$ with over 90\% confidence interval. Additionally, we note that one of their pre-merger black holes is within the pair-instability supernova mass gap ($60-120~\mathrm{M}_\odot$) with more than 90\% confidence interval, and additional two pre-merger black holes above the mass-gap. Furthermore, we report discrepancies among the three waveform models in their mass and spin inferences of lite IMBHs, with at least three GW candidates showing deviations beyond accepted statistical limits. While the astrophysical certainty of these candidates cannot be established, our study provides a foundation to probe the lite IMBH population that emerge within the low-frequency noise spectrum of LVK detectors.

          Evolution of the near-core rotation frequency of 2,497 intermediate-mass stars from their dominant gravito-inertial mode

 - **Abstract**
 We combined Gaia DR3 and TESS photometric light curves to estimate the internal physical properties of 2,497 gravity-mode pulsators. We relied on asteroseismic properties of Kepler $\gamma\,$Dor and SPB stars to derive the near-core rotation frequency, $f_{\rm rot}$, of the Gaia-discovered pulsators from their dominant prograde dipole gravito-inertial pulsation mode. We offer a recipe based on linear regression to deduce $f_{\rm rot}$ from the dominant gravito-inertial mode frequency. It is applicable to prograde dipole modes with an amplitude above 4mmag and occurring in the sub-inertial regime. By applying it to the 2,497 pulsators, we have increased the sample of intermediate-mass dwarfs with such an asteroseismic observable by a factor of 4. We used the estimate of $f_{\rm rot}$ to deduce spin parameters between 2 and 6, while the sample's near-core rotation rates range from 0.7% to 25% of the critical Keplerian rate. We used $f_{\rm rot}$, along with the Gaia effective temperature and luminosity to deduce the (convective core) mass, radius, and evolutionary stage from grid modelling based on rotating stellar models. We derived a decline of $f_{\rm rot}$ with a factor of 2 during the main-sequence evolution for this population of field stars, which covers a mass range from 1.3M$_\odot$ to 7M$_\odot$. We found observational evidence for an increase in the radial order of excited gravity modes as the stars evolve. For 307 pulsators, we derived an upper limit of the radial differential rotation between the convective core boundary and the surface from Gaia's vbroad measurement and found values up to 5.4. Our recipe for the near-core rotation frequency from the dominant gravito-inertial mode detected in the independent Gaia and TESS light curves is easy to use, facilitates applications to large samples, and allows to map their angular momentum and evolutionary stage in the Milky Way.

          Detectability of Solar Rotation Period Across Various Wavelengths

 - **Abstract**
 The light curves of old G-dwarfs obtained in the visible and near-infrared wavelength ranges are highly irregular. This significantly complicates the detectability of the rotation periods of stars similar to the Sun in large photometric surveys, such as Kepler and TESS. In this study, we show that light curves collected in the ultraviolet wavelength range are much more suitable for measuring rotation periods. Motivated by the observation that the Sun's rotational period is clearly discernible in the UV part of the spectrum, we study the wavelength dependence of the rotational period detectability. We employ the Spectral and Total Solar Irradiance Reconstructions model, SATIRE-S, to characterize the detectability of the solar rotation period across various wavelengths using the autocorrelation technique. We find that at wavelengths above 400 nm, the probability of detecting the rotation period of the Sun observed at a random phase of its activity cycle is approximately 20\%. The probability increases to 80\% at wavelengths shorter than 400 nm. These findings underscore the importance of ultraviolet stellar photometry.

          Dark sirens and the impact of redshift precision

 - **Abstract**
 With the growing number of gravitational wave detections, achieving a competitive measurement of $H_0$ with dark sirens is becoming increasingly feasible. The expansion of the Ligo-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration into a four detector network will reduce both the localisation area and the luminosity distance uncertainty associated with each gravitational wave event. It is therefore essential to identify and mitigate other major sources of error that could increase the uncertainty in $H_0$. In this work, we explore three scenarios relevant to the dark siren method in future observing runs. First, we demonstrate that there is a precision gain offered by a catalogue of spectroscopic-like redshifts compared to photometric-like redshifts, with the greatest improvements observed in smaller localisation areas. Second, we show that redshift outliers (as occur in realistic photometric redshift catalogues), do not introduce bias into the measurement of $H_0$. Finally, we find that uniformly sub-sampling spectroscopic-like redshift catalogues increases the uncertainty in $H_0$ as the completeness fraction is decreased; at a completeness of 50% the benefit of spectroscopic redshift precision is outweighed by the degradation from incompleteness. In all three scenarios, we obtain unbiased estimates of $H_0$. We conclude that a competitive measurement of $H_0$ using the dark siren method will require a hybrid catalogue of both photometric and spectroscopic redshifts, at least until highly complete spectroscopic catalogues become available.

 Context. Omega Cen is the largest known globular cluster in the Milky Way. It is also quite a complex object with a large metallicity spread and multiple stellar populations. Despite a number of studies over the past several decades, the series of events that led to the formation of this cluster is still poorly understood. One of its peculiarities is the presence of a metal-rich population which does not show the phenomenon of light-element anti-correlations (C-N, Na-O, Mg-Al), a trait that is considered as characteristic of Galactic Globular Clusters, and is in fact present among more metal-poor Omega Cen stars, leading to speculations that such anomalous population was accreted by the cluster. In this paper, we aim at investigating the kinematics of Omega Cen populations to gain insight on the formation scenario of the cluster. Using the newly released Gaia FPR and DR3 catalogue, we conducted a detailed kinematical analysis of cluster members within Omega Cen. The cluster members were divided into four metallicity populations and their mean proper motion in radial and tangential components were compared with each other. We also performed Gaussian Mixture Model fitting on the metallicity distribution to estimate the number of populations within our sample and an independent analysis of the HST catalogue as confirmation. The mean proper motions (mu_r and mu_t) of the metallicity populations do not show any significant differences. It is also not dependent on the approach chosen to determine the number of metallicity populations. We do find clear signature of rotation in all of the populations (including the metal-rich) with similar velocities.

          The First Chemical Census the Milky Way's Nuclear Star Cluster

 - **Abstract**
 An important step in understanding the formation and evolution of the Nuclear Star Cluster (NSC) is to investigate its chemistry and chemical evolution. Additionally, exploring the relationship of the NSC to the other structures in the Galactic Center and the Milky Way disks is of great interest. Extreme optical extinction has previously prevented optical studies, but near-IR high-resolution spectroscopy is now possible. Here, we present a detailed chemical abundance analysis of 19 elements - more than four times as many as previously published - for 9 stars in the NSC of the Milky Way, observed with the IGRINS spectrometer on the Gemini South telescope. This study provides new, crucial observational evidence to shed light on the origin of the NSC. We demonstrate that it is possible to probe a variety of nucleosynthetic channels, reflecting different chemical evolution timescales. Our findings reveal that the NSC trends for the elements F, Mg, Al, Si, S, K, Ca, Ti, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn, as well as the s-process elements Ba, Ce, Nd, and Yb, generally follow the inner bulge trends within uncertainties. This suggests a likely shared evolutionary history and our results indicate that the NSC population is consistent with the chemical sequence observed in the inner Galaxy (the inner-disk sequence). However, we identify a significant and unexplained difference in the form of higher Na abundances in the NSC compared to the inner-bulge. This is also observed in few Galactic globular clusters, and may suggest a common enrichment process at work in all these systems.

          Erosion of a dense molecular core by a strong outflow from a massive protostar

 - **Abstract**
 We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array Band 3 observations of N$_2$H$^+$ (1-0) and CH$_3$CN (5-4), as well as Band 7 observations of the H$_2$CO molecular line emissions from the protostellar system GGD 27-MM2(E). Through position-velocity diagrams along and across the outflow axis, we study the kinematics and structure of the outflow. We also fit extracted spectra of the CH$_3$CN emission to obtain the physical conditions of the gas. We use the results to discuss the impact of the outflow on its surroundings. We find that N$_2$H$^+$ emission traces a dense molecular cloud surrounding GGD 27-MM2(E). We estimate that the mass of this cloud is $\sim$13.3-26.5 M$_\odot$. The molecular cloud contains an internal cavity aligned with the H$_2$CO-traced molecular outflow. The outflow, also traced by $\mathrm{CH_3 CN}$, shows evidence of a collision with a molecular core (MC), as indicated by the distinctive increases in the distinct physical properties of the gas such as excitation temperature, column density, line width, and velocity. This collision results in an X-shape structure in the northern part of the outflow around the position of the MC, which produces spray-shocked material downstream in the north of MC as observed in position-velocity diagrams both along and across of the outflow axis. The outflow has a mass of 1.7-2.1 M$_\odot$, a momentum of 7.8-10.1 M$_\odot$ km s$^{-1}$, a kinetic energy of 5.0-6.6$\times 10^{44}$ erg, and a mass loss rate of 4.9--6.0$\times10^{-4}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. The molecular outflow from GGD 27-MM2(E) significantly perturbs and erodes its parent cloud, compressing the gas of sources such as MC and ALMA 12.

          That pesky A-term: Efficiently correcting for direction-, time-, and baseline-dependent effects in radio interferometric imaging

 - **Abstract**
 Radio interferometers must grapple with apparent fields of view that distort the true radio sky. These so-called 'A-term' distortions may be direction-, time- and baseline-dependent, and include effects like the primary beam and the ionosphere. Traditionally, properly handling these effects has been computationally expensive and, instead, less accurate, ad-hoc methods have been employed. Image domain gridding (IDG; van der Tol et al., 2018) is a recently developed algorithm that promises to account for these A-terms both accurately and efficiently. Here we describe a new implementation of IDG known as the Parallel Interferometric GPU Imager (Pigi). Pigi is capable of imaging at rates of almost half a billion visibilities per second on modest hardware, making it well suited for the projected data rates of the Square Kilometre Array, and is compatible with both NVIDIA and AMD GPU hardware. Its accuracy is principally limited only by the degree to which A-terms are spatially sampled. Using simulated data from the Murchison Widefield Array, we demonstrate the extraordinary effectiveness of Pigi in correcting for extreme ionospheric effects, and point to future work that would enable these results on real-world data.

 - **Abstract**
 Lightsails are a highly promising spacecraft concept that has attracted interest in recent years due to its potential to travel at near-relativistic speeds. Such speeds, which current conventional crafts cannot reach, offer tantalizing opportunities to probe nearby stellar systems within a human lifetime. Recent advancements in photonics and metamaterials have created novel solutions to challenges in propulsion and stability facing lightsail missions. This review introduces the physical principles underpinning lightsail spacecrafts and discusses how photonics coupled with inverse design substantially enhance lightsail performance compared to plain reflectors. These developments pave the way through a previously inaccessible frontier of space exploration.

 - **Abstract**
 The aromatic molecule benzene is considered the essential building block for larger polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in space. Despite benzene's importance in the formation of PAHs, the formation mechanisms of interstellar benzene are not well understood. A single ion-molecule reaction sequence is considered when modeling the formation of benzene in the interstellar medium, beginning with the protonation of acetylene. Although this process has been used to model the initial steps for formation of PAHs, it has not been experimentally measured. To explore this reaction mechanism, we have carried out the first experimental study of sequential ion-molecule reactions beginning with protonation of acetylene at single-collision conditions. Surprisingly, we find that the reaction sequence does not result in benzene and instead terminates at C6H5+, which is unreactive toward both acetylene and hydrogen. This result disproves the previously proposed mechanism for interstellar benzene formation, critically altering our understanding of interstellar PAH formation.

 - **Abstract**
 This study presents an energy-dependent analysis of seasonal variations in the atmospheric muon neutrino spectrum, using 11.3 years of data from the IceCube Neutrino Observatory. By leveraging a novel spectral unfolding method, we explore the energy range from 125 GeV to 10 TeV for zenith angles between 90° to 110°, corresponding to the Antarctic atmosphere. Our findings reveal that the seasonal variation amplitude decreases with energy reaching ($-4.6 \pm 1.1$)\% during Austral winter and increases ($+3.9 \pm 1.2$)\% during Austral summer relative to the annual average at 10TeV. While the unfolded flux exceeds the model predictions by up to 30\%, the differential measurement of seasonal variations remains unaffected. The measured seasonal variations of the muon neutrino spectrum are consistent with theoretical predictions using the MCEq code and the NRLMSISE-00 atmospheric model.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the first measurement of the orbital period of a long-period colliding-wind binary (CWB) system WR 146, derived by tracing the rotational morphology of its wind-colliding region (WCR) and the relative orientation of the two binary components. This result is based on our imaging observations using the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) and the European Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) Network (EVN), combined with archival data from VLBA, EVN, the Very Large Array (VLA), the enhanced Multi-Element Radio-Linked Interferometer Network (eMERLIN) arrays, and optical images from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). We evaluated two methods for determining the binary's orbital period based on the images of the WCR: (I) fitting the shock cone of the WCR and (II) stacking images using the cross-correlation function. Using these techniques, we find orbital period estimates of 810+120-90 years from method I and 1120+540-270 years from method II, both of which support a long orbital period of approximately 1,000 years. Furthermore, we analyzed archival spectral data of WR 146 to estimate the stellar wind velocities of the binary components, finding no significant orbital phase lag between the binary orientation and the WCR rotation. We also estimate the range of the binary's mass using the currently measured parameters.

 - **Abstract**
 Millisecond pulsars, representing the older neutron star population, are believed to have undergone a prolonged period of dark matter accumulation, resulting in a higher dark matter content. Their extreme rotation makes them unique laboratories for studying rapidly rotating neutron stars admixed with dark matter. In this work, we model uniformly rotating neutron stars with a dark matter component that rotates independently from the baryon matter, allowing for the investigation of both co-rotating and counter-rotating scenarios. We examine the impact of dark matter rotation on the macroscopic properties of neutron stars, including the mass-radius relation, the mass-shedding Keplerian limit, and moments of inertia, for various dark matter particle masses and total fractions, considering both core and halo distributions. Our findings provide a more comprehensive understanding of how dark matter influences the equilibrium properties of rotating neutron stars, offering new insights into the astrophysical implications of self-interacting dark matter.

 - **Abstract**
 HERMES Pathfinder is an in-orbit demonstration consisting of a constellation of six 3U cubesats hosting simple but innovative X-ray/gamma-ray detectors for the monitoring of cosmic high-energy transients. HERMES-PF, funded by ASI and by the EC Horizon 2020 grant, is scheduled for launch in Q1 2025. An identical X-ray/gamma-ray detector is hosted by the Australian 6U cubesat SpIRIT, launched on December 1st 2023. The main objective of HERMES-PF/SpIRIT is to demonstrate that high energy cosmic transients can be detected efficiently by miniatured hardware and localized using triangulation techniques. The HERMES-PF X-ray/gamma-ray detector is made by 60 GAGG:Ce scintillator crystals and 12 2x5 silicon drift detector (SDD) mosaics, used to detect both the cosmic X-rays directly and the optical photons produced by gamma-ray interactions with the scintillator crystals. This design provides a unique broad band spectral coverage from a few keV to a few MeV. Furthermore, the use of fast GAGG:Ce crystals and small SDD cells allows us to reach an exquisite time resolution better than a microsecond. We present a progress report on the missions focusing the discussion on the scientific innovation of the project and on the main lessons learned during the project development including: the importance and the challenges of using distributed architectures to achieve ambitious scientific objectives; the importance of developing critical technologies under science agreements for the realization of high-performing but low-cost payloads; best use of COTS technologies in scientific missions. We finally discuss the prospects of applying these concepts for the creation of an all-sky, all-time monitor to search for the high-energy counterparts of gravitational wave events that Advanced LIGO/Virgo/Kagra will find at the end of this decade and the Einstein Telescope during the 2030s.

 - **Abstract**
 We report observations of stripe-like features in Enceladus' plumes captured simultaneously by Cassini's VIMS-IR and ISS NAC instruments during flyby E17, with similar patterns seen in VIMS-IR data from flyby E13 and E19. These parallel stripes, inclined at approximately 16$^{\circ}$ to the ecliptic and 43$^{\circ}$ to Saturn's ring plane, appear continuous across images when projected in the J2000 frame. A bright stripe, most visible at wavelengths around 5 $\mu$m, acts as the zeroth-order diffraction peak of a reflection grating with an estimated groove spacing of 0.12$-$2.60 mm, while adjacent stripes are attributed to higher-order diffraction peaks. We suggest that this light-dispersing phenomenon originates from an inclined periodic structure within Saturn's E ring. This structure, constrained between Saturn's G-ring and Rhea's orbit, likely consists of fresh ice particles supplied by Enceladus' plumes.

 - **Abstract**
 In the era of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the dramatic improvement in the spectra of exoplanetary atmospheres demands a corresponding leap forward in our ability to analyze them: atmospheric retrievals need to be performed on thousands of spectra, applying to each large ensembles of models (that explore atmospheric chemistry, thermal profiles and cloud models) to identify the best one(s). In this limit, traditional Bayesian inference methods such as nested sampling become prohibitively expensive. We introduce FASTER (Fast Amortized Simulation-based Transiting Exoplanet Retrieval), a neural-network based method for performing atmospheric retrieval and Bayesian model comparison at a fraction of the computational cost of classical techniques. We demonstrate that the marginal posterior distributions of all parameters within a model as well as the posterior probabilities of the models we consider match those computed using nested sampling both on mock spectra, and for the real NIRSpec PRISM spectrum of WASP-39b. The true power of the FASTER framework comes from its amortized nature, which allows the trained networks to perform practically instantaneous Bayesian inference and model comparison over ensembles of spectra -- real or simulated -- at minimal additional computational cost. This offers valuable insight into the expected results of model comparison (e.g., distinguishing cloudy from cloud-free and isothermal from non-isothermal models), as well as their dependence on the underlying parameters, which is computationally unfeasible with nested sampling. This approach will constitute as large a leap in spectral analysis as the original retrieval methods based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo have proven to be.

 - **Abstract**
 Transitional millisecond pulsars (tMSPs) represent a crucial link between the rotation-powered and accretion-powered states of binary pulsars. During their active X-ray state, tMSPs are the only low-mass X-ray binary systems detected up to GeV energies by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT). CXOU J110926.4-650224 is a newly discovered tMSP candidate in an active X-ray state, potentially spatially compatible with a faint gamma-ray source listed in the latest Fermi-LAT point-source catalogue as 4FGL J1110.3-6501. Confirming the association between CXOU J110926.4-650224 and the Fermi source is a key step toward validating its classification as a tMSP. In this study, we analyse Fermi-LAT data collected from August 2008 to June 2023 to achieve a more accurate localisation of the gamma-ray source, characterise its spectral properties, and investigate potential time variability. By thoroughly reconstructing the gamma-ray background around the source using a weighted likelihood model, we obtain a new localisation that aligns with the position of the X-ray source at the 95% confidence level, with a Test Statistic value of $\sim 42$. This establishes a spatial association between the gamma-ray source and CXOU J110926.4-650224. The gamma-ray emission is adequately described by a power-law model with a photon index of $\Gamma = 2.5 \pm 0.1$ and a corresponding flux of $(3.7\pm0.9) \times 10^{-12}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ in the 0.1-300 GeV range.

          A Novel Approach to Identifying Open Star Cluster Members in {\it Gaia} DR3: Integrating MST and GMM Techniques

 - **Abstract**
 We present a novel approach for identifying members of open star clusters using Gaia DR3 data by combining Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) techniques. Our method employs a three-step process: initial filtering based on astrometric parameters, MST analysis for spatial distribution filtering, and GMM for final membership probability determination. We tested this methodology on 12+1 open clusters of varying ages, distances, and richness. The method demonstrates superior performance in distinguishing cluster members from field stars, particularly in regions with overlapping populations, as evidenced by its application to clusters like NGC 7790. By effectively reducing the number of probable field stars through MST analysis before applying GMM, our approach enhances both computational efficiency and membership determination accuracy. The results show strong agreement with previous studies while offering improved precision in member identification. This method provides a robust framework for analyzing the extensive datasets provided by Gaia DR3, addressing the challenges of processing large-scale astronomical data while maintaining high accuracy in cluster membership determination.

 Pulsating variables are prevalent in the classical {\delta} Scuti instability strip of intermediate-age open star clusters. The cluster membership of these stars facilitates a comparative analysis of their evolution in analogous environments. In this study, we integrate ground-based observations, TESS Full Frame Images (FFIs), and Gaia DR3 data to investigate variable stars in the intermediate-age open star cluster NGC 2126. We performed ground-based time-series observations of NGC 2126 to identify variable stars within its vicinity. Next, we determined the membership of these stars using parallax and the proper motions from Gaia DR3 archive. Then, we searched the TESS Full Frame Images (FFIs) for counterparts to the variables identified above and performed their frequency analysis and classification. Finally, we modeled the light curves (LCs) of detected eclipsing binaries (EBs), including V551 Aur, which has a pulsating component. We found 25 members and 85 field variable stars. In TESS FFIs, we found LCs for 11 known variables and a new rotational variable. We determined that the pulsating EB V551 Aur is a member of the cluster. The low- and medium-resolution spectra revealed the line profile variation and the basic parameters for the star, respectively. Simultaneous modeling of the eclipses and the embedded pulsations resulted in improved orbital parameters for the binary system. We also report the determination of orbital parameters for the previously uncharacterized EB system UCAC4 700-043174.

 - **Abstract**
 Parker Solar Probe (PSP) observations revealed that most of the solar wind acceleration occurs very close to the Sun. This acceleration is partly due to the global electric potential originating from the mass disparity between electrons and protons, coupled with the constraints of charge quasi-neutrality and zero-current conditions in the solar wind plasma. However, the exact mechanism that accounts for the remaining acceleration is still not identified. We aim to provide a framework incorporating the electric field-driven component of the acceleration while also introducing an additional acceleration mechanism via velocity-space diffusion of the particles. This will help us determine the extent of extra acceleration, beyond the electric field-driven component, required to fully reproduce the acceleration of the solar wind in theoretical models. We modified an existing kinetic exospheric model to account for the unexplained solar wind acceleration by including velocity-space diffusion. We compared the electric field derived from the sunward deficit of velocity distribution functions observed by PSP between 13.3 and 50 solar radii ($R_s$) with the electric field found self-consistently by the kinetic exospheric model. The effect of velocity-space diffusion is found to reduce the temperature anisotropy and impact the solar wind acceleration while maintaining the electric potential unchanged. Our approach allows for adjusting the diffusion to effectively reduce or increase the solar wind acceleration, providing a way to account for the unexplained acceleration within the kinetic exospheric framework. It is found that, even without diffusion, the model can reproduce the anticorrelation between the electric potential and the solar wind terminal velocity found by PSP. This suggests that the electric potential might still be of major importance in explaining the solar wind acceleration.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar flare events are critical observational samples for astronomical research; however, recorded flare events remain limited. Stellar flare forecasting can provide additional flare event samples to support research efforts. Despite this potential, no specialized models for stellar flare forecasting have been proposed to date. In this paper, we present extensive experimental evidence demonstrating that both stellar physical properties and historical flare records are valuable inputs for flare forecasting tasks. We then introduce FLARE (Forecasting Light-curve-based Astronomical Records via features Ensemble), the first-of-its-kind large model specifically designed for stellar flare forecasting. FLARE integrates stellar physical properties and historical flare records through a novel Soft Prompt Module and Residual Record Fusion Module. Our experiments on the publicly available Kepler light curve dataset demonstrate that FLARE achieves superior performance compared to other methods across all evaluation metrics. Finally, we validate the forecast capability of our model through a comprehensive case study.

 - **Abstract**
 This study proposes a 3D-printed, quad-ridged, dual-pol, flared horn antenna feeder to meet the demands of a modern radio-telescope. The research work presented in this paper involves both the theoretical and the customized / adapted mechanical design of the proposed horn antenna, as well as a description of the 3D-printing and coating process. A novel slotted waveguide approach is followed for perfectly homogeneous coating. Additional mechanical adaptions (i.e. optimized feed section, radome) are employed to provide realistic simulation results. The proposed antenna offers a dual polarization capability and an attractive radiation beam to properly illuminate a 6m mesh dish reflector. A satisfying impedance matching from 1-3 GHz is achieved in both polarizations while maintaining an excellent isolation between the two N-type ports. Reflection coefficient and radiation pattern simulation results are presented, derived from the theoretical and the adapted mechanical design, exhibiting a close agreement.

 - **Abstract**
 The LHAASO collaboration has recently released the spectrum and the angular distribution of the $\gamma$-ray Galactic diffuse emission from 1 TeV to 1 PeV measured with the Kilometer-2 Array (KM2A) and Water Cherenkov Detector Array (WCDA). We show that these data are in remarkably good agreement with a set of models that assume the emission to be produced by the Galactic population of cosmic rays if its spectral shape traces that measured by CALET and DAMPE as well as KASCADE at higher energies. No extra-components besides the CR sea is needed to explain LHAASO results. Accounting for unresolved sources, we consistently reproduce Tibet AS$\gamma$ as well as a wide set of $\gamma$-ray data at lower energy. To do this, we consider two different transport setups: a conventional one and a $\gamma$-optimized spatial-dependent one (a development of the widely adopted KRA$_\gamma$ model). We demonstrate that both setups are compatible with LHAASO results. However, the latter is preferred if one takes into account Fermi-LAT gamma-ray data and neutrino measurements. In fact, we also compute the associated Galactic neutrino diffuse emission finding that the contribution from sources cannot be dominant and showing that spatial-dependent propagation models closely match the ANTARES and IceCube best fits for the Galactic Center Ridge and the Galactic Plane emissions. We argue that our $\gamma$-optimized model should be used as a template for future analyses of upcoming data from the Global Neutrino Network.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a study the initial stages of ice growth on pristine and oxygen-functionalized highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (O-HOPG), combining low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (LT-STM) and machine-learning structural searches. LT-STM images show that oxygen atoms act as nucleation sites for ice growth, and that the size, structure and porosity of the nanometer-sized ice clusters depend strongly on the growth temperature. Machine learning-assisted structural searches and first-principles energy calculations confirm that clusters of water molecules are likely to bind to chemisorbed oxygen atoms through hydrogen bonding. During the early stages of the cluster growth clusters of water molecules are likely to be immobilized by binding to more than one chemisorbed oxygen atom through hydrogen bonding. However, the energy gain by hydrogen bond formation of a molecule, upon incorporation into smaller clusters only bound to a single oxygen atom, is large enough to induce cluster diffusion and favor the growth of larger ice clusters. Our results demonstrate that the mobility of water molecules is significantly lowered in the presence of defects on the surface. The observed lower mobility on defected carbon presented here offers an enhanced understanding of macroscopic anti-icing properties observed for functionalized HOPG under ambient conditions and provides insight into the early stages of ice growth on dust grain surfaces in interstellar space.

 - **Abstract**
 While dust is a key parameter of Mars climate, its behaviour from one year to the next can appear erratic. This variability is notably related to Global Dust Storms (GDS) which occur only certain years with different onset, duration and intensity. The interannual variabilities of the dust cycle may notably explain some characteristics of Recurring Slope Lineae (RSL), slope flows once thought to be caused by liquid water. Long-term monitoring of dust dynamics is thus required to better understand surface-atmosphere dust exchanges on Mars. Here we present a new method to detect atmospheric dust as a function of space and time in the OMEGA Near-InfraRed (NIR) dataset. This dataset covers more than three Martian years; it includes the 2007 GDS which seasonality differs from the preceding (2001) and later (2018) GDS. The method is based on the decrease of the atmospheric optical path caused by dust, that can be measured by OMEGA with the 2 $\mu$m CO$_2$ absorption band. This measure is converted to a 0.9 $\mu$m NIR dust optical depth using notably comparisons with Mars Exploration Rovers measurements. We derive dust optical depth maps and comment on the variability of the dust seasonal cycle before, during and after the 2007 GDS. We also compare OMEGA NIR optical depths to Thermal InfraRed (TIR) ones derived by other studies. We found a NIR/TIR dust extinction optical depth ratio of 1.8 on average, with some variations notably related to dust particle size. Finally, we show in the northern hemisphere that atmospheric dust and RSL activity is correlated. This may indicate that dust lifting or transport mechanisms working at regional scale also participate to local RSL activity.

 - **Abstract**
 Analysing extended emission in photometric observations of star-forming regions requires maps free from compact foreground, embedded, and background sources, which can interfere with various techniques used to characterise the interstellar medium. Within the framework of the NEMESIS project, we apply machine learning techniques to improve our understanding of the star formation timescales, which involves the unbiased analysis of the extended emission in these regions. We present a deep learning-based method for separating the signals of compact sources and extended emission in photometric observations made by the Herschel Space Observatory, facilitating the analysis of extended emission and improving the photometry of compact sources. Central to our approach is a modified U-Net architecture with partial convolutional layers. This method enables effective source removal and background estimation across various flux densities, using a series of partial convolutional layers, batch normalisation, and ReLU activation layers within blocks. Our training process utilised simulated sources injected into Herschel images, with controlled flux densities against known backgrounds. A dynamic, signal-to-noise ratio-based adaptive masking system was implemented to assess how prominently a compact source stands out from the surrounding background. The results demonstrate that our method can significantly improve the photometric accuracy in the presence of highly fluctuating backgrounds. Moreover, the approach can preserve all characteristics of the images, including the noise properties. The presented approach allows users to analyse extended emission without the interference of disturbing point sources or perform more precise photometry of sources located in complex environments. We also provide a Python tool with tutorials and examples to help the community effectively utilise this method.

 - **Abstract**
 OGLE-2002-BLG-360 is an example of a Galactic red nova, the aftermath of a non-compact stellar merger. The dusty nature of the circumstellar environment makes observations of this particular source difficult, meaning the properties of the central star and its surrounding environment are poorly understood. We aim to establish the parameters of the merger remnant, as well as of the dusty environment and its structure. We attempt to establish similarities with other Galactic red novae and try to understand how such an environment has been formed. We use optical, infrared, and sub-millimetre observations to construct the spectral energy distribution (SED) between 2 um and 1.27 mm for an epoch 15-21 years after the red nova eruption. We use various radiative transfer codes to model the SED and retrieve the physical properties of both the central star and the surrounding dust. We show that the SED is best replicated by a spherically symmetric model consisting of an M-type supergiant surrounded by 0.012 Msun of dust concentrated within two spherical shells. The dust extends out to a maximum distance of 9500 AU from the central source, whilst the inner shell extends out to 1000 AU. The dust composition is dominated by iron grains (58%), but also contains olivine silicates (25%) and alumina dust (17%), which are both required to reproduce the profile of the observed 10 um absorption feature. The inner shell likely originates from merger and post-merger ejecta, whilst the outer shell consists of material lost much earlier, before the merger event occurred. Evolution of the SED indicates continued dust formation within the expanding inner shell, which may be analogous to winds of red supergiants. The object is extremely dusty compared to other red nova remnants.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate deviations from $\Lambda$CDM by independently parameterizing modifications in the background evolution and the growth of structures. The background is characterized by two parameters, $A$ and $B$, which reduce to $\Omega_{m0}$ and $2/3$ in the $\Lambda$CDM limit, while deviations in the growth of structures are captured through a new fitting function for $f\sigma_8$ involving the growth index $\gamma$. Using recent observational datasets, we find significant evidence for departures from $\Lambda$CDM, with data suggesting a preference for modifications in the background evolution, likely due to evolving dark energy, rather than modifications to gravity. Additionally, our framework alleviates the $H_0$ tension and addresses the $\sigma_8$ and $S_8$ tensions. We also demonstrate that future high-precision RSD data could unveil correlations between background and perturbation parameters that are currently suppressed by observational uncertainties, offering deeper insights into cosmic evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Studying the redshifted 21-cm signal from the the neutral hydrogen during the Epoch of Reionization and Cosmic Dawn is fundamental for understanding the physics of the early universe. One of the challenges that 21-cm experiments face is the contamination by bright foreground sources, such as Cygnus A, for which accurate spatial and spectral models are needed to minimise the residual contamination after their removal. In this work, we develop a new, high-resolution model of Cygnus A using Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) observations in the $110{-}250$ MHz range, improving upon previous models by incorporating physical spectral information through the forced-spectrum method during multi-frequency deconvolution. This approach addresses the limitations of earlier models by providing a more accurate representation of the complex structure and spectral behaviour of Cygnus A, including the spectral turnover in its brightest hotspots. The impact of this new model on the LOFAR 21-cm signal power spectrum is assessed by comparing it with both simulated and observed North Celestial Pole data sets. Significant improvements are observed in the cylindrical power spectrum along the Cygnus A direction, highlighting the importance of having spectrally accurate models of the brightest foreground sources. However, this improvement is washed out in the spherical power spectrum, where we measure differences of a few hundred mK at $k<0.63\,h\,\text{cMpc}^{-1}$, but not statistically significant. The results suggest that other systematic effects must be mitigated before a substantial impact on 21-cm power spectrum can be achieved.

 - **Abstract**
 Supernovae, the explosive deaths of massive stars, create heavy elements and form black holes and neutron stars. These compact objects often receive a velocity at formation, a "kick" whose physical origin remains debated. We investigate kicks in Be X-ray binaries, containing a neutron star and a rapidly spinning companion. We identify two distinct populations: one with kicks below $10\,\rm{km}\,\rm{s}^{-1}$, much lower than theoretical predictions, and another with kicks around $100\,\rm{km}\,\rm{s}^{-1}$, that shows evidence for being aligned within 5 degrees of the progenitor's rotation axis. The distribution of progenitor masses for the two populations have medians around $2.3\,\rm{M}_\odot$ and $4.9\,\rm{M}_\odot$, corresponding to stars with birth masses of about $10\,\rm{M}_\odot$ and $15\,\rm{M}_\odot$. The second component matches the low-velocity mode observed in isolated pulsars. Combined with the known high-velocity component, which dominates isolated pulsars, this suggests three distinct kick modes. These results reveal previously unrecognized diversity in neutron-star formation.

          A fundamental limit to how close binary systems can get via stable mass transfer shapes the properties of binary black hole mergers

 - **Abstract**
 Mass transfer in binary systems is the key process in the formation of various classes of objects, including merging binary black holes (BBHs) and neutron stars. Orbital evolution during mass transfer depends on how much mass is accreted and how much angular momentum is lost $-$ two of the main uncertainties in binary evolution. Here, we demonstrate that there is a fundamental limit to how close binary systems can get via stable mass transfer (SMT), that is robust against uncertainties in orbital evolution. Based on detailed evolutionary models of interacting systems with a BH accretor and a massive star companion, we show that the post-interaction orbit is always wider than $\sim10R_{\odot}$, even when extreme shrinkage due to L2 outflows is assumed. Systems evolving towards tighter orbits become dynamically unstable and result in stellar mergers. This separation limit has direct implications for the properties of BBH mergers: long delay times ($\gtrsim1 \rm Gyr$), and no high BH spins from the tidal spin-up of helium stars. At high metallicity, the SMT channel may be severely quenched due to Wolf-Rayet winds. The reason for the separation limit lies in the stellar structure, not in binary physics. If the orbit gets too narrow during mass transfer, a dynamical instability is triggered by a rapid expansion of the remaining donor envelope due to its near-flat entropy profile. The closest separations can be achieved from core-He burning ($\sim8-15R_{\odot}$) and Main Sequence donors ($\sim15-30R_{\odot}$), while Hertzsprung Gap donors lead to wider orbits ($\gtrsim30-50R_{\odot}$) and non-merging BBHs. These outcomes and mass transfer stability are determined by the entropy structures, which are governed by internal composition profiles. The formation of compact binaries is thus sensitive to chemical mixing in stars and may relate to the blue-supergiant problem.

          Water ice in the debris disk around HD 181327

 - **Abstract**
 Debris disks are exoplanetary systems that contain planets, minor bodies (i.e., asteroids, Kuiper belt objects, comets, etc.), and micron-sized debris dust. Since water ice is the most common frozen volatile, it plays an essential role in the formation of planets and minor bodies. Although water ice has been commonly found in Kuiper belt objects and comets in the Solar System, no definitive evidence for water ice in debris disks has been obtained to date. Here, we report the discovery of water ice in the HD 181327 disk using the James Webb Space Telescope Near-Infrared Spectrograph. We detect the solid-state broad absorption feature of water ice at 3 $\mu$m and a distinct Fresnel peak feature at 3.1 $\mu$m, a characteristic of large water-ice particles. This implies the presence of a water-ice reservoir in the HD 181327 exoKuiper belt. Gradients of water-ice features at different stellocentric distances reveal a dynamic process of destroying and replenishing water ice in the disk, with estimated water-ice mass fractions ranging from 0.1% at ~85 au to 14% at ~113 au. It is highly plausible that the icy bodies that release water ice in HD 181327 could be the extra-solar counterparts of some of the Kuiper belt objects in our Solar System, supported by their spectral similarity.

 - **Abstract**
 Bright-rimmed, cometary-shaped star-forming globules, associated with HII regions, are remnants of compressed molecular shells exposed to ultraviolet radiation from central OB-type stars. The interplay between dense molecular gas and ionizing radiation, analysed through gas kinematics, provides significant insights into the nature and dynamic evolution of these globules. This study presents the results of a kinematic analysis of the cometary globule, Lynds Bright Nebula (LBN) 437, focusing on the first rotational transition of 12CO and C18O molecular lines observed using the Taeduk Radio Astronomy Observatory (TRAO). The averaged 12CO spectrum shows a slightly skewed profile, suggesting the possibility of a contracting cloud. The molecular gas kinematics reveals signatures of infalling gas in the cometary head of LBN 437, indicating the initial stages of star formation. The mean infall velocity and mass infall rate towards the cometary head of LBN 437 are 0.25 km s^-1 and 5.08 * 10^-1 Msun yr^-1 respectively, which align well with the previous studies on intermediate or high-mass star formation.

 - **Abstract**
 We present JWST NIRCam observations of the emerging young star clusters (eYSCs) detected in the nearby spiral galaxy M83. The NIRcam mosaic encompasses the nuclear starburst, the bar, and the inner spiral arms. The eYSCs, detected in Pa$\alpha$ and Br$\alpha$ maps, have been largely missed in previous optical campaigns of young star clusters (YSCs). We distinguish between eYSCI, if they also have compact 3.3~$\mu$m PAH emission associated to them, and eYSCII, if they only appear as compact Pa$\alpha$ emitters. We find that the variations in the 3.3~$\mu$m PAH feature are consistent with an evolutionary sequence where eYSCI evolve into eYSCII and then optical YSCs. This sequence is clear in the F300M-F335M (tracing the excess in the \PAHlambda\ feature) and the F115W-F187N (tracing the excess in Pa$\alpha$) colors which become increasingly bluer as clusters emerge. The central starburst stands out as the region where the most massive eYSCs are currently forming in the galaxy. We estimate that only about 20~\% of the eYSCs will remain detectable as compact YSCs. Combining eYSCs and YSCs ($\leq$10 Myr) we recover an average clearing timescale of 6~Myr in which clusters transition from embedded to fully exposed. We see evidence of shorter emergence timescales ($\sim$5~Myr) for more massive ($>5\times10^3$ \msun) clusters, while star clusters of $\sim 10^3$ \msun\ about 7~Myr. We estimate that eYSCs remain associated to the \PAHlambda\ emission 3--4~Myr. Larger samples of eYSC and YSC populations will provide stronger statistics to further test environmental and cluster mass dependencies on the emergence timescale.

          The atmospheres of rocky exoplanets III. Using atmospheric spectra to constrain surface rock composition

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The crust composition of rocky exoplanets with a substantial atmosphere can not be observed directly. However, recent developments start to allow the observation and characterisation of their atmospheres. Aims. We aim to establish a link between the observable spectroscopic atmospheric features and the mineralogical crust composition of exoplanets. This allows to constrain the surface composition just by observing transit spectra. Methods. We use a diverse set of total element abundances inspired by various rock compositions, Earth, Venus, and CI chondrite as a basis for our bottom-to-top atmospheric model. We assume thermal and chemical equilibrium between the atmosphere and the planetary surface. Based on the atmospheric models in hydrostatic and chemical equilibrium with the inclusion of element depletion due to cloud formation theoretical transit spectra are calculated. Results. The atmospheric type classification allows constraints on the surface mineralogy especially with respect to sulphur compounds, iron oxides and iron hydroxides, feldspars, silicates and carbon species. Spectral features provide the possibility to differentiate the atmospheric types and thus allow some constraints on the surface composition.

          Light Echoes of Time-resolved Flares and Application to Kepler Data

 - **Abstract**
 Light echoes of stellar flares provide an intriguing option for exploring protoplanetary disks in young stellar systems. Previous work on light echoes of circumstellar disks made use of delta-function flares for modeling. We present a new model that incorporates echoes produced by extended, time-resolved flares. We then test this model on known disk-bearing stars with Kepler K2 data by estimating disk parameters from possible echo signals. We focus on two stars; the first appears to be a good candidate for use of this echo model, which predicts disk parameters that are consistent with known values. The second star turns out to be more problematic as a result of high brightness variability in its post-peak lightcurve. These two cases show both the promise and limitations of light echoes as a tool for exploring protoplanetary disks in the time domain

          On the X-ray Emission From Supernovae, and Implications for the Mass-Loss Rates of their Progenitor Stars

 - **Abstract**
 We summarize the X-ray emission from young SNe. Having accumulated data on most observed X-ray SNe, we display the X-ray lightcurves of young SNe. We also explore the X-ray spectra of various SN types. The X-ray emission from Type Ib/c SNe is non-thermal. It is also likely that the emission from Type IIP SNe with low mass-loss rates (around 10$^{-7} \, Msun \,$ yr$^{-1}$) is non-thermal. As the mass-loss rate increases, thermal emission begins to dominate. Type IIn SNe have the highest X-ray luminosities, and are clearly thermal. We do not find evidence of non-thermal emission from Type IIb SNe. The aggregated data are used to obtain approximate mass-loss rates of the progenitor stars of these SNe. Type IIP's have progenitors with mass-loss rates $< 10^{-5}\, Msun \,$ yr$^{-1}$, while Type IIn progenitors generally have mass-loss rates $> 10^{-3}\, Msun $ yr$^{-1}$. However, we emphasize that the density of the ambient medium is the important parameter, and if it is due to a non-steady outflow solution, it can not be translated into a mass-loss rate.

          Searching for GEMS: Confirmation of TOI-5573b, a Cool, Saturn-like Planet Orbiting An M-dwarf

 - **Abstract**
 We present the confirmation of TOI-5573b, a Saturn-sized exoplanet on an 8.79-day orbit around an early M-dwarf (3790 K, 0.59 R$\odot$, 0.61 M$\odot$, 12.30 J mag). TOI-5573b has a mass of $112^{+18}_{-19}$ M$\oplus$ (0.35$\pm$0.06 M$\mathrm{Jup}$) and a radius of $9.75\pm0.47$ R$\oplus$ (0.87$\pm$0.04 R$\mathrm{Jup}$), resulting in a density of $0.66^{+0.16}_{-0.13}$ g cm$^{-3}$, akin to that of Saturn. The planet was initially discovered by TESS and confirmed using a combination of 11 transits from four TESS sectors (20, 21, 47 and 74), ground-based photometry from the Red Buttes Observatory, and high-precision radial velocity data from the Habitable-zone Planet Finder (HPF) and NEID spectrographs, achieving a 5$\sigma$ precision on the planet's mass. TOI-5573b is one of the coolest Saturn-like exoplanets discovered around an M-dwarf, with an equilibrium temperature of $528\pm10$ K, making it a valuable target for atmospheric characterization. Saturn-like exoplanets around M-dwarfs likely form through core accretion, with increased disk opacity slowing gas accretion and limiting their mass. The host star's super-solar metallicity supports core accretion, but uncertainties in M-dwarf metallicity estimates complicate definitive conclusions. Compared to other GEMS (Giant Exoplanets around M-dwarf Stars) orbiting metal-rich stars, TOI-5573b aligns with the observed pattern that giant planets preferentially form around M-dwarfs with super-solar metallicity. Further high-resolution spectroscopic observations are needed to explore the role of stellar metallicity in shaping the formation and properties of giant exoplanets like TOI-5573b.

          The VELOCE modulation zoo III. Detecting additional pulsation modes in optical spectra of classical Cepheids using semi-partial distance correlation periodograms

 - **Abstract**
 Known for their large amplitude radial pulsations, classical Cepheids are critical standard candles in astrophysics. However, they also exhibit various pulsational irregularities and additional signals that provide deeper insights into their structure and evolution. These signals appear in spectroscopic observations as shape deformations of the spectral lines. Using semi-partial distance correlation periodograms, we analyse high-precision spectroscopic data from the VELOCE project for four stars: $\delta$ Cep, BG Cru, X Sgr, and Polaris. For $\delta$ Cep, our control star, only the main radial mode is detected, confirming its stability and suitability as a benchmark for the method. In BG Cru, a strong additional signal at $\sim 3.01$ d is identified, likely linked to line splitting. X Sgr exhibits dominant additional signals, notably one at $\sim 12.31$ d, also associated with significant line splitting. Polaris reveals multiple low-frequency signals, with the most prominent candidate at $\sim 59.86$ d, which might be linked to the star's rotation period. We explore the semi-partial distance correlation periodograms by incorporating CCFs and their variants, such as the median-subtracted CCFs, which improves the sensitivity to variations in line shape. In particular, the latter enables the faithful detection of primary and additional signals present in the 1D spectra of fainter stars and low-amplitude pulsators. The semi-partial distance correlation periodograms demonstrate their utility for isolating signals associated with line shape variations; although, the analyses are complicated by the presence of artefact subharmonics and a visible low-frequency power increase for Polaris and BG Cru. This study underscores the method's potential for finding new and unexpected signals as well as detailed analyses of Cepheid pulsations and opens new pathways for asteroseismic investigations.

          Characterisation of B-type stars in four young Galactic open clusters. I. Stellar content and binary properties

 - **Abstract**
 Multiplicity among massive stars represents a major uncertainty in stellar evolution theory, because the extra physical processes that it introduces significantly impacts each star's structure. While multiplicity of O-type stars is fairly well constrained, for B-type stars it is not. B-type stars are more common and have longer lifetimes, thus providing an opportunity to characterize multiplicity at different ages. Moreover, young open clusters are advantageous for studying coeval and chemically homogeneous environments. Using a multi-epoch spectroscopic campaign with the HERMES spectrograph we determine multiplicity properties and rotation rates of 74 B-type stars in four Galactic open clusters: $h$ and $\chi$ Persei, NGC 457, NGC 581, and NGC 1960. We measure radial velocities with a cross-correlation method and determine tentative orbital solutions for 26 of the 28 identified binaries. We detect several Be stars, five of them being members of binary systems. We correct the observed binary fractions for observational biases and determine an average intrinsic binary fraction of 79$_{-16}^{+19}\%$. The consistency in binary fraction among the four clusters, which are between 15 and 30 Myr, suggests a reasonably homogenous binary fraction across this age range. We used TLUSTY atmosphere models to determine the projected rotational velocities, with an average value of 240 km s$^{-1}$ for both single and binary systems. Whereas, the Be stars show higher velocities between 200 and 360 km s$^{-1}$.

          Saha ionization for non-equilibrium states: an application to primordial hydrogen recombination

 - **Abstract**
 It is widely known that the Saha equation is not suitable for describing plasmas out of thermodynamic equilibrium. The primordial hydrogen recombination plasma is an example of this. In this work, we propose a theoretical modification to the standard Saha curve by introducing a non-Gaussian generalization of the Saha equation, motivated by Tsallis statistics. In particular, we explore the possibility that a time-dependent $q$-parameter may serve as an effective proxy for the evolving thermodynamic conditions during recombination, especially considering that hydrogen recombination occurs from excited states. Within this framework, the $q$-parameter could be interpreted as encoding departures from equilibrium and could play the role of effective time-dependent temperature. This indicates that the time evolution of the $q$-parameter could provide a phenomenological mechanism for incorporating non-equilibrium effects into the recombination history. Our findings suggest that the Tsallis parameterization provides an alternative path to fit the distribution of free electrons by using an effective temperature. Our approach enables us to reproduce hydrogen recombination results predicted by the Peebles kinetic approach, HYREC-2 code, or any other recombination model.

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce the Mirya-m1 Cosmic Ray Detector, the largest and only cosmic ray detector in Turkiye designed for space weather research. Mirya-m1, modeled and built after the Muon Impact Tracer and Observer (MITO) (Ayuso et al. 2021), is located at the Eastern Anatolia Observatory (DAG) site of the Turkiye National Observatories in Erzurum, Turkiye, at an altitude of 3099 meters. This elevation positions Mirya-m1 among the highest-altitude cosmic ray detectors globally. The detector consists of two stacked scintillator counters, each measuring 1x1 meters, separated by a vertical distance of 1.36 meters. Each scintillator is monitored by four H1411 Hamamatsu photomultiplier tubes, enabling precise detection and measurement of light by incident cosmic rays. In this study, we present the data collected throughout 2024, which includes the detection of two Forbush decrease events in March and May 2024. These significant detections demonstrate the capability of Mirya-m1 to contribute valuable data for space weather research, establishing its potential as a critical instrument for cosmic ray studies in the region.

 - **Abstract**
 There is a growing number of Earth's co-orbital bodies being discovered. At least five of them are known to be temporarily in quasi-satellite orbits. One of those, 469219 Kamo'oalewa, was identified as possibly having the same composition as the Moon. We explore the conditions necessary for lunar ejecta to evolve into Earth's co-orbital bodies, with particular attention to quasi-satellite orbits. We investigate the parameter space of ejection velocity and geographic launch location across the lunar surface. The study employs numerical simulations of the four-body problem (Sun-Earth-Moon-particle) with automated classification for co-orbital states. Particles are ejected from randomly distributed points covering the lunar surface with velocities from 1.0 to 2.6 times the Moon's escape velocity. Trajectories co-orbital to Earth are found to be common, with approximately 6.68% of particles evolving into Earth co-orbital motion and 1.92% exhibiting quasi-satellite behavior. We identify an optimal ejection velocity (1.2v$_{esc}$) for quasi-satellite production, yielding over 6% conversion efficiency. Successful ejections show a strong preference for the equatorial regions of the trailing hemisphere. Collisions with Earth or Moon occur for only 4% of the sample. Extended integrations reveal long-lived configurations, including tadpole orbits persisting for 10,000 years and horseshoe co-orbitals maintaining stability for 5,000 years. Our results strengthen the plausibility of lunar origin for Earth's co-orbital bodies, including quasi-satellites like Kamo'oalewa and 2024PT5. We identify both "prompt" and "delayed" co-orbital formation mechanisms, with a steady-state production regime that could explain the presence of lunar-derived objects in Earth's co-orbital regions despite infrequent major lunar impacts.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents the spherically-averaged 21 cm power spectrum derived from Epoch of Reionization (EoR) observations conducted with the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA). The analysis uses EoR0-field data, centered at (RA$=0h$, DEC$=-27^{\circ}$), collected between 2013 and 2023. Building on the improved methodology described in Trott et al. 2020, we incorporate additional data quality control techniques introduced in Nunhokee et al. 2024. We report the lowest power level limits on the EoR power spectrum at redshifts $z=6.5$, $z=6.8$, and $z=7.0$. These power levels, measured in the East-West polarization, are $(30.2)^2$ mK$^2$ at $k=0.18\, h$ Mpc$^{-1}$, $(31.2)^2$ mK$^2$ at $k=0.18\, h$ Mpc$^{-1}$ and $(39.1)^2$ mK$^2$ at $k=0.21\, h$ Mpc$^{-1}$ respectively. The total integration time amounts to 268 hours. These results represent the deepest upper limits achieved by the MWA to date and provide the first evidence of heated intergalactic medium (IGM) at redshifts $z=6.5$ to $7.0$.

 - **Abstract**
 Tianyu telescope, an one-meter robotic optical survey instrument to be constructed in Lenghu, Qinghai, China, is designed for detecting transiting exoplanets, variable stars and transients. It requires a highly automated, optimally distributed, easily extendable, and highly flexible software to enable the data processing for the raw data at rates exceeding 500MB/s. In this work, we introduce the architecture of the Tianyu pipeline and use relative photometry as a case to demonstrate its high scalability and efficiency. This pipeline is tested on the data collected from Muguang observatory and Xinglong observatory. The pipeline demonstrates high scalability, with most processing stages increasing in throughput as the number of consumers grows. Compared to a single consumer, the median throughput of image calibration, alignment, and flux extraction increases by 41%, 257%, and 107% respectively when using 5 consumers, while image stacking exhibits limited scalability due to I/O constraints. In our tests, the pipeline was able to detect two transiting sources. Besides, the pipeline captures variability in the light curves of nine known and two previously unknown variable sources in the testing data. Meanwhile, the differential photometric precision of the light curves is near the theoretical limitation. These results indicate that this pipeline is suitable for detecting transiting exoplanets and variable stars. This work builds the fundation for further development of Tianyu software.

          Late-time suppression of structure growth as a solution for the $S_8$ tension

 - **Abstract**
 The $S_8$ value inferred from the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) Year 3 cosmic shear data, under the assumption of the flat $\Lambda$CDM model, is 2-3$\sigma$ lower than that inferred from observations of the early-time universe, such as cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy data. Resolving the $S_8$ tension requires a scenario in which structure formation on small scales is suppressed in the late universe. As potential solutions, we consider extended models both within and beyond the $\Lambda$CDM model -- models that incorporate parameterized baryonic feedback effects, the effect of varying neutrino mass, and modified structure growth, each of which can lead to a suppression of structure growth at lower redshifts, with its own distinct scale- and redshift-dependencies. In particular, we consider phenomenological modified gravity models in which the suppression of structure growth is triggered at lower redshifts, as dark energy ($\Lambda$) begins to dominate the background expansion. We show that the modified growth factor models -- especially those featuring more rapid growth suppression at lower redshifts -- provide an improved fit to the combined datasets of the HSC-Y3 cosmic shear correlation functions, the Planck CMB, and the ACT DR6 CMB lensing, compared to the fiducial $\Lambda$CDM model and the models including the baryonic effects or the massive neutrino effect within the the $\Lambda$CDM framework.

 - **Abstract**
 High energy solar protons were observed by particle detectors aboard spacecraft in near-Earth orbit on May 11, 2024 and produced the 74th ground level enhancement (GLE74) event registered by ground-based neutron monitors. This study involves a detailed reconstruction of the neutron monitor response, along with the identification of the solar eruption responsible for the emission of the primary particles, utilizing both in situ and remote-sensing. Observations spanning proton energies from a few MeV to around 1.64 GeV, collected from the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES), the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO-A), and neutron monitors, were integrated with records of the associated solar soft X-ray flare, coronal mass ejection, and radio bursts, to identify the solar origin of the GLE74. Additionally, a time-shift analysis was conducted to link the detected particles to their solar sources. Finally, a comparison of GLE74 to previous ones is carried out. GLE74 reached a maximum particle rigidity of at least 2.4 GV and was associated with a series of type III, type II, and type IV radio bursts. The release time of the primary solar energetic particles (SEPs) with an energy of 500 MeV was estimated to be around 01:21 UT. A significant SEP flux was observed from the anti-Sun direction with a relatively broad angular distribution, rather than a narrow, beam-like pattern, particularly during the main phase at the particle peak flux. Comparisons with previous GLEs suggest that GLE74 was a typical event in terms of solar eruption dynamics.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first results of a pilot 'TASmanian Search for Inclined Exoplanets' (TASSIE) program. This includes observations and analysis of five short-period exoplanet candidates using data from TESS and the Harlingten 50 cm telescope at the Greenhill Observatory. We describe the instrumentation, data reduction process and target selection strategy for the program. We utilise archival multi-band photometry and new mid-resolution spectra to determine stellar parameters for five TESS Objects of Interest (TOIs). We then perform a statistical validation to rule out false positives, before moving on to a joint transit analysis of the remaining systems. We find that TOI3070, TOI3124 and TOI4266 are likely non-planetary signals, which we attribute to either short-period binary stars on grazing orbits or stellar spots. For TOI3097, we find a hot sub-Jovian to Jovian size planet ($R_{3097Ab}$ = 0.89 $\pm$ 0.04 $R_{J}$, $P_{3097Ab}$ = 1.368386 $\pm$ 0.000006 days) orbiting the primary K dwarf star in a wide binary system. This system shows indications of low metallicity ([Fe/H] $\approx$ -1), making it an unlikely host for a giant planet. For TOI3163, we find a Jovian-size companion on a circular orbit around a late F dwarf star, with $R_{3163b}$ = 1.42 $\pm$ 0.05 $R_{J}$ and $P_{3163b}$ = 3.074966 $\pm$ 0.000022 days. In future, we aim to validate further southern giant planet candidates with a particular focus on those residing in the sub-Jovian desert/savanna.

 - **Abstract**
 The nature of dark matter is still mysterious despite various astronomical evidence. As a possible candidate, self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) can potentially resolve some issues appearing in cold dark matter paradigm. Here we investigate how SIDM around supermassive black holes (SMBH) in galaxy centers may form a density spike and imprint in the spectrum shape of stochastic gravitational-wave background from SMBH binaries (SMBHBs). Employing a refined dynamical friction formula and consistently evolving the orbital dynamics, we demonstrate that current pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) data is sensitive to the cross section of SIDM with $\sigma(v)/m_\chi\lesssim0.66\,\mathrm{cm}^2/\mathrm{g}$, comparable to other astrophysical probes. We also highlight the importance of including the eccentricity of SMBHBs in the parameter inference, which would affect the results significantly. Our findings reveal the promising potential of PTAs observations in probing the nature of dark matter.

          The X-ray variability of tidal disruption events

 - **Abstract**
 When a star is torn apart by the tidal forces of a supermassive black hole (a so-called TDE) a transient accretion episode is initiated and a hot, often X-ray bright, accretion disk is formed. Like any accretion flow this disk is turbulent, and therefore the emission from its surface will vary stochastically. As the disk has a finite mass supply (i.e., at most the initial mass of the disrupted star) the disk will also undergo long-timescale evolution, as this material is lost into the black hole. In this paper we combine theoretical models for this long time evolution of the disk with models for the stochastic variability of turbulent accretion flows which are correlated on short (orbital) timescales. This new framework allows us to demonstrate that (i) dimming events should be more prevalent than brightening events in long term TDE X-ray light curves (i.e., their log-luminosity distribution should be asymmetric), (ii) TDE X-ray light curves should follow a near- (but formally sub-)linear correlation between their root mean square variability and the mean flux, (iii) the fractional variability observed on short timescales across an X-ray observing band should increase with observing energy, and (iv) TDEs offer a unique probe of the physics of disk turbulence, owing to their clean spectra and natural evolutionary timescales. We confirm predictions (i) and (ii) with an analysis of the long timescale variability of two observed TDEs, and show strong support for prediction (iii) using the intra-observation variability of the same two sources.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a fully analytical propagator for the orbits of lunar artificial satellites in a lunar gravity and third-body model sufficiently precise for a wide range of practical applications. The gravity model includes the twelve most important lunar gravity harmonics as well as the Earth's quadrupole tidal terms with a precise representation of the Earth's lunicentric ephemeris, and it gives an accuracy comparable to the way more extended semi-analytical propagator SELENA [6] for satellite orbits at altitudes from 300 to 3000 km. Extra terms of a more complete gravity model are straightforward to include using the formulas of the presently discussed analytical theory. The theory is based on deriving an approximate analytical solution of the secular part of the equations of motion using a Hamiltonian normal form in closed form. In total, we have two types of element transformations: from osculating to mean elements (as in [6]), and from mean to proper elements. The solution of the problem in proper elements is trivial, and, through the inverses of the above transformations, it allows to recover the position and velocity of a satellite analytically at any time t given initial conditions of the osculating elements at time $t_0$ without any intermediate numerical propagation. The propagator model is valid in time spans of several decades, and for every initial condition leading to no-fall on the Moon's surface, except for identified thin zones around a set of secular resonances corresponding to commensurabilities between the satellite's secular frequencies and the secular frequencies of the lunicentric Earth's orbit. Open software python and symbolic routines implementing our propagator are provided in the repository [14]. Precision tests with respect to fully numerical orbital propagation in Cartesian coordinates are reported.

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the density profile, shape, and virial mass of the Milky Way's dark matter halo using K giants (KG) from LAMOST and SDSS/SEGUE, as well as blue horizontal branch (BHB) stars from SDSS. Incorporating Gaia DR3 proper motions, we first investigate the velocity ellipsoid distribution within the $(R, |z|)$ space. The ellipsoids projected onto the $(v_R, v_z)$ plane exhibit near-spherical alignment. We then probe the underlying dark matter distribution using the axisymmetric Jeans equations with multi-Gaussian expansion (MGE) and the spherically aligned Jeans anisotropic modelling (JAM${\rm sph}$), allowing for different flattened dark matter density models. For each model, we apply two fitting approaches: fitting the KGs and BHBs separately or fit them simultaneously as two dynamical tracers in one gravitational potential. We find consistent results on the dark matter density profiles, $r_{200}$, and $M_{200}$ within a 1-$\sigma$ confidence region for models constrained by KGs, BHBs, and both. We find the strongest consistency between KGs and BHBs in constraining dark matter profiles for models incorporating radially varying halo flattening ($q(r_{\rm gc})$), which suggests the Milky Way's dark matter halo shape evolves with Galactocentric distance ($r_{\rm gc}$). Specifically, the halo flattening parameter $q_h$ decreases within $r_{\rm gc} < 20$ kpc and increases for $r_{\rm gc} > 20$ kpc. In this model, $M_{\rm tot} (< 60~{\rm kpc}) = 0.533^{+0.061}_{-0.054} \times 10^{12}$ $M_{\odot}$, $r_{200}$ is $188\pm15$ kpc, with $M_{200}$ estimated at $0.820^{+0.210}_{-0.186} \times 10^{12} M_{\odot}$.

 - **Abstract**
 Theoretical frameworks for reflection and emission spectroscopy of exoplanet surfaces are becoming increasingly important for the characterization of rocky exoplanets, especially with the rapid growth of the detected exoplanet population and observational capabilities. The Hapke theory of reflectance and emittance spectroscopy has been widely adopted in the exoplanet community, yet a key physical effect - the opposition surge enhancement at small phase angles - remains largely neglected. This phenomenon, driven by shadow hiding and coherent backscattering, introduces a significant brightening that depends on wavelength, particle size, and surface morphology. In this paper, I propose an alternative formulation for opposition surge modeling, ensuring a smooth-to-sharp transition at small phase angles, dictated by wavelength-dependent scattering properties. I evaluate the impact of opposition surge on phase curves and surface spectra, comparing a family of models with increasing simplifications, ranging from a full wavelength-dependent opposition effect to its complete omission. My results indicate that neglecting opposition effects can introduce systematic deviations in retrieved albedos, spectral features, and phase curves, with errors reaching up to 20%-30% in certain spectral bands. Upcoming JWST observations will probe phase angles below ~10° for rocky exoplanets around M dwarfs; thus, accounting for opposition effects is crucial for accurate surface characterization. Proper treatment of this effect will lead to improved retrievals of surface albedo, mineralogical composition, and roughness properties. This study establishes a physically consistent framework for exoplanet phase-curve modeling and provides a foundation for future retrieval algorithms aimed at interpreting exoplanet surfaces.

 - **Abstract**
 The frequencies of gravity mode oscillations are determined by the chemical, thermal, and structural properties of stellar interiors, facilitating the study of internal mixing mechanisms in stars. We investigate the impact of discontinuities in the chemical composition induced by the formation of an adiabatic semiconvection region during the core helium (He)-burning phase of evolution of hot subdwarf B-type (sdB) stars. We scrutinize the asteroseismic attributes of the evolutionary stages and assess the core He-burning phase by evaluating the parameter linked to the average interval between the deep trapped modes in both sdB evolutionary models and the observations of KIC 10001893. We perform evolutionary and asteroseismic analyses of sdB stars using MESA and GYRE to examine the properties of the semiconvection region. We address the challenges of relying solely on average interval between oscillation mode periods with consecutive radial orders to identify the core He-burning stage. To enhance identification, we propose a new parameter representing the average interval between deep trapped modes during some of the stages of sdB evolutionary models. Additionally, our results show that integrating convective penetration with convective premixing improves our models and yields comparable outcomes without the need for additional model parameters. Our results can advance the development of detailed evolutionary models for sdB stars by refining internal mixing schemes, enhancing the accuracy of pulsation predictions, and improving alignment with observational data.

 - **Abstract**
 We report a novel mechanism where two families of primordial black holes (PBHs) may form at nearly the same comoving scales but at two different epochs. It is realized in two-stage inflation where a non-inflationary stage is sandwiched by the two inflationary stages. In this case, smaller PBHs form when the comoving scale of interest re-enters the horizon during the break period, and larger PBHs form when the scale re-enters the horizon after inflation. This mechanism may realize both reheating of the universe through the evaporation of ultralight PBHs formed during the break stage and the dark matter by those formed after inflation. We show that this scenario may give rise to a distinctive signature in the stochastic gravitational wave background that can be tested by the near-future gravitational wave observatories such as LISA and DECIGO. Our work thus provides a unified observational window into the physics of inflation, reheating, and dark matter.

 - **Abstract**
 In the study of stellar flares, traditional method of calculating total energy emitted in the continuum assumes the emission originating from a narrow chromospheric condensation region with a constant temperature of 10000 K and variable flare area. However, based on multicolor data from 7 new flares observed in Białków and Shumen observatory and 8 flares from (Howard et al., 2020) observed on 10 main-sequence stars (spectral types M5.5V to K5V) we show that flare areas had a relative change in the range of 10% - 61% (for more than half of the flares this value did not exceed 30%) throughout the events except for the impulsive phase, and had values starting from 50 +/- 30 ppm to 300 +/- 150 ppm for our new flares and from 380 +/- 200 ppm to 7600 +/- 3000 ppm from (Howard et al., 2020) data, while their temperature increased on average by the factor 2.5. The peak flare temperatures for our seven observed flares ranged from 5700 +/- 450 K to 17500 +/- 10050 K. Five of these flares had their temperatures estimated using the Johnson-Kron-Cousins B filter alongside TESS data, one flare was analyzed using the SLOAN g' and r' bandpasses, and another was evaluated using both the SLOAN g' and r' bandpasses and TESS data. Using flare temperature and area from our data and data from Howard et al., 2020, along with the physical parameters of stars where the flares occurred, we developed a semi-empirical grid that correlates a star's effective temperature and flare amplitude in TESS data with the flare's peak temperature. This allows interpolation of a flare's peak temperature based on the star's effective temperature (ranging from 2700 K to 4600 K) and flare amplitude from TESS observations. Applying this grid to 42257 flares from TESS survey, we estimated peak flare temperatures between 5700 K and 38300 K, with most flares showing peak black-body temperatures around 11100 +/- 2400 K.

 - **Abstract**
 The Lyman-$\alpha$ forest opacity fluctuations observed from high redshift quasar spectra have been proven to be extremely successful in order to probe the late phase of the reionization epoch. For ideal modeling of these opacity fluctuations, one of the main challenges is to satisfy the extremely high dynamic range requirements of the simulation box, resolving the Lyman alpha forest while probing the large cosmological scales. In this study, we adopt an efficient approach to model Lyman-$\alpha$ opacity fluctuations in coarse simulation volume, utilizing the semi-numerical reionization model SCRIPT (including inhomogeneous recombination and radiative feedback) integrated with a realistic photoionization background fluctuation generating model. Our model crucially incorporates ionization and temperature fluctuations, which are consistent with the reionization model. After calibrating our method with respect to high-resolution full hydrodynamic simulation, Nyx, we compare the models with available observational data at the redshift range, $z=5.0-6.1$. With a fiducial reionization model (reionization end at $z=5.8$), we demonstrate that the observed scatter in the effective optical depth can be matched reasonably well by tuning the free parameters of our model i.e. the effective ionizing photon mean free path and mean photoionization rate. We further pursue an MCMC-based parameter space exploration utilizing the available data to put constraints on the above free parameters. Our estimation prefers a slightly higher photoionization rate and slightly lower mean free path than the previous studies which is also a consequence of temperature fluctuations. This study holds significant promise for efficiently extracting important physical information about the Epoch of Reionization, utilizing the wealth of available and upcoming observational data.

 Context. The sizes of many asteroids, especially slowly rotating, low-amplitude targets, remain poorly constrained due to selection effects. These biases limit the availability of high-quality data, leaving size estimates reliant on spherical shape assumptions. Such approximations introduce significant uncertainties propagating, e.g. into density determinations or thermophysical and compositional studies, affecting our understanding of asteroid properties. Aims. This work targets poorly studied main-belt asteroids, most of which lacked shape models. Using only high-quality dense light curves, thermal IR observations (incl. WISE), and stellar occultations, we aimed to produce reliable shape models and scale them via two independent techniques, allowing size comparison. We conducted two campaigns to obtain dense photometric light curves and to acquire multi-chord stellar occultations. Methods. Shape and spin models were reconstructed using lightcurve inversion. Sizes were determined by (1) thermophysical modeling with the Convex Inversion Thermophysical Model (CITPM), optimizing spin and shape models to visible lightcurve and IR data, and (2) scaling shape models with stellar occultations. Results. We obtained precise sizes and shape models for 15 asteroids. CITPM- and occultation-derived sizes agree within 5% in most cases, demonstrating the modeling's reliability. Larger discrepancies usually stem from incomplete occultation chord coverage. The study also gives insights into surface properties incl. albedo, roughness and thermal inertia. Conclusions. Using high-quality data and an advanced TPM integrating thermal and visible data with shape adjustment enabled precise size estimates comparable to those from multi-chord stellar occultations. We resolved major inconsistencies in previous size estimates, providing solid input for future studies on asteroid densities and surfaces.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) simulations featuring a double detonation scenario have managed to reproduce the overall trend of the Phillips relation reasonably well. However, most, if not all, multidimensional simulations struggle to reproduce the scatter of observed SNe around this relation, exceeding it substantially. In this study, we investigate whether the excessive scatter around the Phillips relation can be caused by an off-center ignition of the carbon-oxygen (CO) core in the double detonation scenario and if this can help constrain possible SN Ia explosion channels. We simulated the detonation of three different initial CO white dwarfs of $0.9$, $1.0$, and $1.1\,M_\odot$, artificially ignited at systematically offset locations using the Arepo code. After nucleosynthetic postprocessing, we generated synthetic observables using the Artis code and compared these results against observational data and models of other works. We find that our simulations produce synthetic observables well within the range of the observed data in terms of viewing angle scatter. The majority of the viewing angle variability seems to be caused by line blanketing in the blue wavelengths of intermediate-mass elements and lighter iron-group elements, which are asymmetrically distributed in the outer layers of the ashes. Our results suggest that although the off-center ignition of the CO introduces substantial line of sight effects, it is not responsible for the excessive viewing angle scatter observed in other models. Instead, this effect seems to be caused by the detonation ashes from the rather massive helium (He) shells in current state-of-the-art models. Further reducing the He-shell masses of double detonation progenitors may be able to alleviate this issue and yield observables that reproduce the Phillips relation.

 - **Abstract**
 This article questions the common assumption of cold dark matter (DM) by exploring the possibility of a non-zero equation of state (EoS) without relying on any parametric approach. In standard cosmological analyses, DM is typically modeled as pressureless dust with $w_{\rm DM} = 0$, an assumption that aligns with large-scale structure formation, supports the empirical success of the $\Lambda$CDM model, and simplifies cosmological modeling. However, there is no fundamental reason to exclude a non-zero $w_{\rm DM}$ from the cosmological framework. In this work, we explore this possibility through non-parametric and model-independent reconstructions based on Gaussian Process Regression. The reconstructions use Hubble parameter measurements from Cosmic Chronometers (CC), the Pantheon+ sample of Type Ia supernovae, and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data from DESI DR1 and DR2. Our findings suggest that a dynamical EoS for DM, although statistically mild, cannot be conclusively ruled out. Notably, we observe a tendency toward a negative $w_{\rm DM}$ at the present epoch, a result that is particularly intriguing and may have meaningful implications for modern cosmology.

 - **Abstract**
 A mechanism is proposed for synchronizing core-collapse supernova with a recent loss of a red supergiant (RSG) envelope in the common envelope regime. A perequisite for the synchronization is a moderate RSG expansion during final decade. This scenario is based on the phenomenon of preSN~II dense shell formed at the final stage of 10-20 yr as a result of powerfull mass loss. The energy deposition into the RSG envelope that powers the enormous mass loss rate is able to expand the RSG. The moderate expansion is sufficient for the close secondary component to plunge into the common envelope with a subsequent explosion of stripped helium core. Superluminous SN~2006gy is suggested to be the outcome of this scenario.

 - **Abstract**
 The Yarkovsky effect on real asteroids is complicated to calculate either by analytical or numerical methods, since they are generally irregular in shape. We propose an index to properly characterise the shape of any asteroid, through which the Yarkovsky effect can be easily calculated without the heavy computations of surface temperatures. By analysing the energy absorbed and then emitted by a surface element, we find that the effective working power produced by the radiation recoil force on this surface element and its contribution to the Yarkovsky effect are both proportional to the double projected area of the surface element. The normalized total projected area over the asteroid's surface is defined as the shape index ($S_1$). We model the Yarkovsky effects of different asteroids using multiphysics software COMSOL, and take the rate of semi-major axis drift ($d a/d t$) obtained in these numerical simulations as the measurement of the strength of Yarkovsky effect. A linear relationship between $d a/d t$ and $S_1$ is confirmed. The shape index is then improved by taking the shadowing effect into account. A much better linear relationship is found between $d a/d t$ and the improved index $S_2$. This linear relationship is obeyed very well in a wide range of thermal parameter values. The influences of scattering and self-heating effects on the linear relationship are found ignorable. Using the shape index and the linear relation obtained in this paper, the rate of semi-major axis migration due to the Yarkovsky effect can be calculated accurately. Compared with the full numerical modeling of surface temperature and then the thermal radiation on an irregularly shaped asteroid, it is very easy to compute the shape index, which brings great convenience to the estimation of Yarkovsky effect.

 - **Abstract**
 The surface of Europa experiences a competition between thermally-induced crystallization and radiation-induced amorphization processes, leading to changes of its crystalline structure. The non-linear crystallization and temperature-dependent amorphization rate, incorporating ions, electrons and UV doses, are integrated into our multiphysics surface model (MSM) LunaIcy, enabling simulations of these coupled processes on icy moons. Thirty simulations spanning 100 000 years, covering the full ranges of albedo and latitude values on Europa, explore the competition between crystallization and irradiation. This is the first modeling of depth-dependent crystallinity profiles on icy moons. The results of our simulations are coherent with existing spectroscopic studies of Europa, both methods showing a primarily amorphous phase at the surface, followed by a crystalline phase after the first millimeter depth. Our method provides quantitative insights into how various parameters found on Europa can influence the subsurface crystallinity profiles. Interpolating upon our simulations, we have generated a crystallinity map of Europa showing, within the top millimeter, highly crystalline ice near the equator, amorphous ice at the poles, and a mix of the two at mid-latitudes. Regions/depths with balanced competition between crystallization and amorphization rates are of high interest due to their periodic fluctuations in crystalline fraction. Our interpolated map reveals periodic variations, with seasonal amplitudes reaching up to 35% of crystalline fraction. These variations could be detected through spectroscopy, and we propose a plan to observe them in forthcoming missions.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the one-dimensional Lyman-alpha forest power spectrum measurement derived from the data release 1 (DR1) of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). The measurement of the Lyman-alpha forest power spectrum along the line of sight from high-redshift quasar spectra provides information on the shape of the linear matter power spectrum, neutrino masses, and the properties of dark matter. In this work, we use a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-based estimator, which is validated on synthetic data in a companion paper. Compared to the FFT measurement performed on the DESI early data release, we improve the noise characterization with a cross-exposure estimator and test the robustness of our measurement using various data splits. We also refine the estimation of the uncertainties and now present an estimator for the covariance matrix of the measurement. Furthermore, we compare our results to previous high-resolution and eBOSS measurements. In another companion paper, we present the same DR1 measurement using the Quadratic Maximum Likelihood Estimator (QMLE). These two measurements are consistent with each other and constitute the most precise one-dimensional power spectrum measurement to date, while being in good agreement with results from the DESI early data release.

 - **Abstract**
 Recurrent novae undergo thermonuclear-powered eruptions separated by less than 100 years, enabled by subgiant or red giant donors transferring hydrogen-rich matter at very high rates onto their massive white dwarf companions. The most-rapidly moving parts of envelopes ejected in successive recurrent nova events are predicted to overtake and collide with the slowest ejecta of the previous eruption, leading to the buildup of vast (~ 10 - 100 parsec) super-remnants surrounding all recurrent novae; but only three examples are currently known. We report deep narrowband imaging and spectroscopy which has revealed a ~ 70-parsec-diameter shell surrounding the frequently recurring nova RS Ophiuchi. We estimate the super-remnant mass to be ~ 20 - 200 solar masses, expanding at a few tens of km/s, with an age of order 50-100 kyr. Its extremely low surface brightness and large angular size help explain the hitherto surprising absence of nova super-remnants. Our results support the prediction that ALL recurrent novae are surrounded by similar extended structures.

 - **Abstract**
 In the first part of this work, we provide a curated overview of the theoretical framework necessary for incorporating dephasing due to environmental effects (EE) in gravitational wave (GW) templates. We focus in particular on the relationship between orbital perturbations in the time-domain and the resulting dephasing in both time and frequency domain, elucidating and resolving some inconsistencies present in the literature. We discuss how commonly studied binary environments often result in several sources of dephasing that affect the GW signal at the same time. This work synthesizes insights from two decades of literature, offering a unified conceptual narrative alongside a curated reference of key formulas, illustrative examples and methodological prescriptions. It can serve both as a reference for researchers in the field as well as a modern introduction for those who wish to enter it. In the second part, we derive novel aspects of dephasing for eccentric GW sources and lay the foundations for consistently treating the full problem. Our results highlight the unique potential of modelling and searching for EE in eccentric binary sources of GWs.

 - **Abstract**
 Pulsar timing at low frequencies offers a powerful tool for studying the interstellar medium. Additionally, pulsar observations in the ecliptic enables us to study the effects of the solar wind which becomes much more prominent at low radio frequencies. The Irish station of the LOw Frequency ARray (I-LOFAR) is a sensitive low-frequency radio telescope, capable of delivering high-precision data for pulsar studies. We present a comprehensive dataset of times-of-arrival, timing solutions and dispersion measure (DM) time series for seven ecliptic pulsars observed over two-to-three years with I-LOFAR. The primary objectives are to investigate time-dependent dispersion effects and provide high-precision timing data for pulsar timing experiments. We measure DM variations through pulsar timing and analysed these across different ecliptic latitudes to assess the impact of the solar wind on each pulsar. We model the intrinsic pulse-profile variability as a function of frequency. The high-precision DM time series for all seven pulsars exhibit clear variations dependent on their ecliptic latitudes, revealing the impact of the solar wind. Some pulsars show significant changes in their pulse widths across the frequency band, while others remain stable. We examine and quantify the pulse-nulling present in PSR J0826+2637, we report evidence for DM chromaticity in PSR J1645-0317, and we describe how PSR J2145-0750's DM precision is such that it could resolve the ionospheric DM contribution. This makes it a target of interest for telescopes in areas of the globe where the ionospheric electron density is higher, e.g. the Murchison Radio Observatory in Australia. This data release underscores the potential of I-LOFAR, or any standalone international LOFAR station, for advancing low-frequency pulsar studies, particularly in analyses of dispersion in the interstellar medium, the solar wind and the ionosphere.

          The vertical structure of debris discs and the role of disc gravity

 - **Abstract**
 Debris discs provide valuable insights into the formation and evolution of exoplanetary systems. Their structures are commonly attributed to planetary perturbations, serving as probes of as-yet-undetected planets. However, most studies of planet-debris disc interactions ignore the disc's gravity, treating it as a collection of massless planetesimals. Here, using an analytical model, we investigate how the vertical structure of a back-reacting debris disc responds to secular perturbations from an inner, inclined planet. Considering the disc's axisymmetric potential, we identify two dynamical regimes: planet-dominated and disc-dominated, which may coexist, separated by a secular-inclination resonance. In the planet-dominated regime ($M_d/m_p\ll1$), we recover the classical result: a transient warp propagates outward until the disc settles into a box-like structure centered around the planetary orbit's initial inclination $I_p(0)$, with a distance-independent aspect ratio $\mathcal{H}(R)\approx I_p(0)$. In contrast, in the disc-dominated regime ($M_d/m_p\gtrsim1$), the disc exhibits dynamical rigidity, remaining thin and misaligned, with significantly suppressed inclinations and a sharply declining aspect ratio, $\mathcal{H}(R)\propto I_p(0)R^{-7/2}$. In the intermediate regime ($M_d/m_p\lesssim1$), the system exhibits a secular-inclination resonance, leading to long-lived, warp-like structures and a bimodal inclination distribution, containing both dynamically hot and cold populations. We provide analytic formulae describing these effects as a function of system parameters. We also find that the vertical density profile is intrinsically non-Gaussian and recommend fitting observations with non-zero slopes of $\mathcal{H}(R)$. Our results may be used to infer planetary parameters and debris disc masses based on observed warps and scale heights, as demonstrated for HD110058 and $\beta$ Pic.

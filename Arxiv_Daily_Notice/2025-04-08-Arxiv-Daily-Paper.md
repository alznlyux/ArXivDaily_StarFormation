          The DESI Y1 RR Lyrae catalog I: Empirical modeling of the cyclic variation of spectroscopic properties and a chemodynamical analysis of the outer halo

 - **Abstract**
 We present the catalog of RR Lyrae stars observed in the first year of operations of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey. This catalog contains 6,240 RR Lyrae stars out to $\sim100$\,kpc from the Galactic center and over 12,000 individual epochs with homogeneously-derived stellar atmospheric parameters. We introduce a novel methodology to model the cyclical variation of the spectroscopic properties of RR Lyrae from single-epoch measurements. We employ this method to infer the radial velocity and effective temperature variation of fundamental mode and first-overtone RR Lyrae stars and to determine their systemic velocities and mean temperatures. For fundamental mode pulsators, we obtain radial velocity curves with amplitudes of $\sim$30--50\,km\,s$^{-1}$ and effective temperature curves with 300--1,000\,K variations, whereas for first-overtone pulsators these amplitudes are $\sim20$\,km\,s$^{-1}$ and $\sim 600$\,K, respectively. We use our sample to study the metallicity distribution of the halo and its dependence on Galactocentric distance ($R_{\rm GC}$). Using a radius-dependent mixture model, we split the data into chemodynamically distinct components and find that our inner halo sample ($R_{\rm GC}\lesssim50$\,kpc) is predominantly composed of stars with [Fe/H] $\sim-1.5$\,dex and largely radial orbits (with an anisotropy parameter $\beta\sim0.94$), that we associate with the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus merger event. Stars in the outer halo field exhibit a broader and more metal-poor [Fe/H] distribution with more circular orbits ($\beta\sim0.39$). The metallicity gradient of the metal-rich and the metal-poor components is found to be $0.005$ and $0.010$\,dex\,kpc$^{-1}$, respectively. Our catalog highlights DESI's tantalizing potential for studying the Milky Way and the pulsation properties of RR Lyrae stars in the era of large spectroscopic surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 We show that perturbative techniques inspired by effective field theory (EFT) can be used to "paint on" the 21~cm field during reionization using only the underlying linear density field. This procedure is accurate to within O(10%) on large scales and thus can be used to enlarge or "supersize" hydrodynamical simulations. In particular, the EFT provides a mapping between the linear density field and a nonlinear tracer field, both in real and redshift space. We show that this mapping can be reliably extracted from relatively small simulation volumes using the THESAN suite of simulations, which have a comoving volume of (95.5 Mpc)^3. Specifically, we show that if we fit the EFT coefficients in a small ~5% sub-volume of the simulation, we can accurately predict the 21cm field in the rest of the simulation given only the linear density field. We show that our technique is robust to different models of dark matter and differences in the sub-grid reionization modeling.

          Describing the Non-Universal Galaxy Merger Timescales in IllustrisTNG: Effects of Host Halo Mass, Baryons, and Sample Selection

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxy merger timescales are crucial for understanding and modeling galaxy formation in our hierarchically structured Universe. However, previous studies have reported widely varying dependencies of merger timescales on initial orbital parameters and mass ratio at the first crossing of $r_{\rm vir}$. Using IllustrisTNG simulations, we find that these dependencies vary with host halo mass, suggesting that discrepancies in prior studies may arise from differences in the systems analyzed. Specifically, in low-mass halos, merger timescales show a stronger dependence on initial orbital parameters, while in high-mass halos, this dependence weakens. To account for these variations, we present a fitting formula that incorporates host mass dependence, achieving a logarithmic scatter smaller than 0.15 dex. Comparing dark matter-only and baryonic simulations, we observe similar merger timescales for circular orbits but notable differences for radial orbits. In halos with $M_{\rm{host}} < 10^{12.5} h^{-1} M_{\odot}$, mergers in dark matter-only runs take longer than in baryonic runs, whereas the trend reverses in more massive halos. We attribute these differences to the competing effects of tidal disruption by central galaxy disks and the resistance of baryonic satellites to tidal stripping. Finally, we extend our model to predict merger timescales from any starting radius within the halo. By fitting the extended model to the entire infall sample, we find that using only the merger sample can underestimate merger timescales, particularly for low mass ratios. Our model provides a valuable tool for improving semi-analytical and empirical models of galaxy formation.

 - **Abstract**
 Triple stellar systems, consisting of three gravitationally bound stars, play a fundamental role in a wide array of astrophysical processes, from stellar evolution to the formation of exotic objects and gravitational wave sources. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the dynamics and evolution of triple stellar systems, highlighting their crucial role in shaping stellar populations and driving diverse astrophysical phenomena. We begin by discussing the observed properties of triples, including their frequency and orbital configurations, emphasizing the challenges in characterizing these systems. We then delve into the intricate dynamics of triples, exploring hierarchical, secular, quasi-secular, and chaotic regimes, with particular attention to the von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai (vZLK) mechanism and its extensions. The interplay between stellar evolution and triple dynamics is examined, including mass loss, mass transfer, common-envelope evolution, and supernovae effects. We discuss the development and applications of triple population synthesis codes, demonstrating their power in modeling complex evolutionary scenarios and predicting observational outcomes. Finally, we emphasize the unique role of triple evolution in producing a wide range of astrophysical phenomena, from interacting binaries and stellar mergers to explosive transients and gravitational wave sources, underscoring the importance of triple systems in our understanding of stars and stellar populations.

 - **Abstract**
 Astronomers generally assume planet-forming disks are aligned with the rotation of their host star. However, recent observations have shown evidence of warping in protoplanetary disks. One can measure the statistical alignment between the inclination angles of the disk and stellar spin using the projected rotational velocity, radius, and rotation period of the star and interferometric measurements of the protoplanetary disk. Such work is challenging due to the difficulty in measuring the properties of young stars and biases in methods to combine them for population studies. Here, we provide an overview of the required observables, realistic uncertainties, and complications when using them to constrain the orientation of the system. We show in several tests that we are able to constrain the uncertainties on the necessary stellar parameters to better than 5% in most cases. We show that by using a hierarchical Bayesian model, we can account for many of the systematic effects (e.g., biases in measured stellar and disk orientations) by fitting for the alignments of each system simultaneously. We demonstrate our hierarchical model on a realistic synthetic sample and verify that we can recover our input alignment distribution to $\leq$5$^{\circ}$ with a modest ($\simeq$30 star) sample. As the sample of systems with disk inclinations grows, future studies can improve upon our approach with a three-dimensional treatment of misalignment and better handling of non-Gaussian errors.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent advancements in near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy have opened new opportunities for studying multiple stellar populations in globular clusters (GCs), particularly for newly discovered clusters in the inner Milky Way. While optical spectroscopy has traditionally played a primary role in detailed chemical abundance studies of GCs, the increasing discovery of GCs in highly reddened environments underscores the need for robust NIR spectroscopic methods. To evaluate the utility of high-resolution NIR spectroscopy for studying multiple stellar populations, we observed six stars in M5, a well-studied halo GC, using the recently commissioned IGRINS-2 spectrograph on the Gemini-North telescope. Our chemical abundance measurements in the NIR wavelength range show good agreement with those derived from high-resolution optical spectroscopy, with minor systematic offsets in elements such as Na and Mg. In addition, the measured chemical abundance ratios clearly reproduce the distinctive patterns of multiple stellar populations, including the Na-O anti-correlation. The ability of NIR spectroscopy to measure C, N, and O abundances with high precision further enhances its utility for studying chemical properties of stars and GCs. Our findings demonstrate that IGRINS-2 and similar instruments have significant potential to advance our understanding of GC formation, stellar chemical evolution, and the evolutionary history of the Milky Way.

 At regime, SKAO is expected to provide the researchers with an annual amount of more than 700 hundred PB of data. The advanced analysis of all those data will take place within a network (SRCnet) of so-called SKA Regional Centres, which, under the "Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable" (FAIR) principles, will also take the responsibility for curating and archiving both the Observatory Data Products and user-generated Advanced Data Products, as well as for helping the researchers in the estimate of the needed computational effort at the proposal stage. This contribution describes the status and the perspectives of this international network, with particular emphasis on the INAF-led Italian node which is part of that.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar population synthesis (SPS) models are a key tool for deriving the age, metallicity, radial velocity and reddening of star clusters from their integrated spectra. Using a sample of 129 star clusters with high-quality spectra, we analyze the uncertainties associated with selecting an empirical versus a theoretical stellar spectral library in the SPS models. We find that the fits from the different models agree on the goodness of fit metrics and inferred reddening. However, the derived age and metallicity can be affected by the choice of the stellar library, with synthetic libraries tending to give lower age and metallicity, especially for spectra with low SNR. Ages and reddening values from SSP-equivalent fits are consistent with the multi-population fits, however, SSP-equivalent metallicities are affected by the coarse coverage of the SPS grid in [Fe/H]. When comparing the spectral fitting results with the literature, we find that (1) all models underestimate age for old and metal-poor systems; (2) on average, SPS models based on synthetic stellar libraries better match the isochrone ages and metallicities from high-resolution stellar spectroscopy.

 - **Abstract**
 XRISM has delivered one of its first light observations on N132D, the X-ray brightest supernova remnant in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Utilizing 193 ks of high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy data, we conduct a comprehensive search for charge exchange emission. By incorporating a charge exchange model into our spectral analysis, we observe an improvement in the fits of two weak features at 2.41 keV and 2.63 keV. These features, with a combined significance of 99.6%, are consistent with transitions from highly ionized silicon ions in high Rydberg states, which are unique indicators of charge exchange. Our analysis constrains the charge exchange flux to no more than 4% of the total source flux within the 1.7-3.0 keV band, and places an upper limit on the charge exchange interaction velocity at 450 km/s. This result supports ongoing shock-cloud interactions within N132D and highlights the unique capabilities of XRISM to probe the complex physical processes at play.

 - **Abstract**
 Over the decades, astronomical X-ray telescopes have utilized the Wolter type-1 optical design, which provides stigmatic imaging in axial direction but suffers from coma and higher-order aberrations for off-axis sources. The Wolter-Schwarzschild design, with stigmatic imaging in the axial direction, while suffering from higher-order aberrations, is corrected for coma, thus performing better than the Wolter type-1. The Wolter type-1 and Wolter-Schwarzschild designs are optimized for on-axis but have reduced angular resolution when averaged over a wide field of view, with the averaging weighted by the area covered in the field of view. An optical design that maximizes angular resolution at the edge of the field of view rather than at the center is more suitable for wide-field X-ray telescopes required for deep-sky astronomical surveys or solar observations. A Hyperboloid-Hyperboloid optical design can compromise axial resolution to enhance field angle resolution, hence providing improved area-weighted average angular resolution over the Wolter-Schwarzschild design, but only for fields of view exceeding a specific size. Here, we introduce a new optical design that is free from coma aberration and capable of maximizing angular resolution at any desired field angle. This design consistently outperforms Wolter-1, Wolter-Schwarzschild, and Hyperboloid-Hyperboloid designs when averaged over any field of view size. The improvement in performance remains consistent across variations in other telescope parameters such as diameter, focal length, and mirror lengths. By utilizing this new optical design, we also present a design for a full-disk imaging solar X-ray telescope.

 - **Abstract**
 The expansion structure of supernova remnants (SNRs) is important for understanding not only how heavy elements are distributed into space, but also how supernovae explode. The ejecta expansion structure of the young core-collapse SNR Cas A is investigated, with Doppler parameter mapping of the Fe-K complex by the Resolve microcalorimeter onboard the X-ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission, XRISM. It is found that the Fe ejecta are blueshifted in the southeast (SE) and redshifted in the northwest (NW), indicating an incomplete shell structure, similar to the intermediate mass elements (IMEs), such as Si and S. The Fe has a velocity shift of $\sim1400$ km~s$^{-1}$ in the NW and $\sim2160$ km~s$^{-1}$ in the SE region, with the error range of a few 100s km~s$^{-1}$. These values are consistent with those for the IMEs in the NW region, whereas larger than those for the IMEs in the SE region, although the large error region prevented us from concluding which component has significantly higher velocity. The line broadening is larger in the center with values of $\sim$2000--3000~km~s$^{-1}$, and smaller near the edges of the remnant. The radial profiles of the Doppler shift and broadening of the IMEs and Fe indicate that the Fe ejecta may expand asymmetrically as IME ejacta, although the large error regions do not allow us to conclude it. Moreover, we see little bulk Doppler broadening of the Fe lines in the northeastern jet region whereas the IME lines exhibit significant broadening. No such narrow lines are detected in the NW region. These findings suggest an asymmetric expansion of the ejecta potentially driven by large-scale asymmetries originating from the supernova explosion. This interpretation aligns with the large-scale asymmetries predicted by models of neutrino-driven supernova explosions.

 Aims. Quasar strong gravitational lenses are important tools for putting constraints on the dark matter distribution, dark energy contribution, and the Hubble-Lemaitre parameter. We aim to present a new supervised machine learning-based method to identify these lenses in large astrometric surveys. The Gaia Focused Product Release (FPR) GravLens catalogue is designed for the identification of multiply imaged quasars, as it provides astrometry and photometry of all sources in the field of 4.7 million quasars. Methods. Our new approach for automatically identifying four-image lens configurations in large catalogues is based on the eXtreme Gradient Boosting classification algorithm. To train this supervised algorithm, we performed realistic simulations of lenses with four images that account for the statistical distribution of the morphology of the deflecting halos as measured in the EAGLE simulation. We identified the parameters discriminant for the classification and performed two different trainings, namely, with and without distance information. Results. The performances of this method on the simulated data are quite good, with a true positive rate and a true negative rate of about 99.99% and 99.84%, respectively. Our validation of the method on a small set of known quasar lenses demonstrates its efficiency, with 75% of known lenses being correctly identified. We applied our algorithm (both trainings) to more than 0.9 million quadruplets selected from the Gaia FPR GravLens catalogue. We derived a list of 1127 candidates with at least one score larger than 0.75, where each candidate has two scores -- one from the model trained with distance information and one from the model trained without distance information -- and including 201 very good candidates with both high scores.

 Analyzing longitude-velocity diagrams (LVDs) in the CS(J=2-1) and H13CN(J=1-0) molecular lines from the internal release data of the ALMA Central-Molecular-Zone Exploration Survey (ACES) and in the 13CO (J=1-0) line from the Nobeyama Galactic-Centre (GC) survey, we identify six GC Arms as prominent straight LV ridges. In addition to the currently known Arms I to IV, we identify a new inner arm, Arm V, and further highlight the circum-nuclear disc (CND) as Arm VI. Integrated intensity maps of the Arms on the sky suggest that most of the Arms compose ring-like structures inclined from the Galactic plane. We determine the radii (curvatures) of the Arms using the velocity-gradient ($dv/dl$) method, assuming that the arms are rotating on circular orbits at a constant velocity of $\sim 150$ km/s. We show that Arms I and II compose the main ring structure of the CMZ with radii $\sim 100$--120 pc; Arm III is a dense arm 42 pc from the GC; Arm IV is a clear and narrow arm 20 pc from the GC; and Arm V is a faint, long arm of 8.2 pc radius. We show that the circum-nuclear disc (CND) composes the sixth arm, Arm VI, of radius $\sim 2.3$ pc associated with bifurcated spiral fins. We also discuss the association of the 20- and 50-km/s clouds with these Arms. The radii of the arms fall on an empirical relation $R\sim 630 (2/5)^N$ for $N=1$ (Arm I) to 6 (VI), suggesting either discrete rings or a logarithmic spiral with pitch angle $\sim 22^\circ$. The vertical full extent of the arm increases with radius and is represented by $z\sim 0.7 (R/1 {\rm pc})^{0.7}$ pc. The tilt angle of the arms from the Galactic plane, or the warping, increases rapidly toward the GC.

 - **Abstract**
 Red supergiants (RSGs), as the descendants of OB-type stars and the progenitors of supernovae, provide crucial insights into the evolution of massive stars, particularly in binary systems. Previous studies show that the binary fraction of RSGs ($\approx$ 15% - 40%) is significantly lower than that of their predecessors ($\approx$ 50% - 70%). In this work, we investigate the binary fraction of RSGs with the recently selected largest samples of 4695 and 2097 RSGs in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), respectively. The binary system with a hot companion (O-, B- and A-type star) is identified by detecting the ultraviolet (UV) excess in the observed spectral energy distribution (SED) ranging from ultraviolet to mid-infrared after subtracting the model SED of RSG since RSGs are very weak in the UV band. It is found that the lower limit of binarity is 30.2% $\pm$ 0.7% and 32.2% $\pm$ 1% in the LMC and SMC, respectively. If the sample is limited to luminous RSGs with log $L/L_{\odot} > 4.0$, the binary fraction becomes 26.6% $\pm$ 1.1% and 26.4% $\pm$ 1.7% in the LMC and SMC, respectively. The derived binary fraction is valid in the range of $\sim$ 2.3 < $\log P / [\text{d}]$ < $\sim$ 8. Our study suggests that roughly one-third of massive stars host a third companion within $\sim$ 30,000 AU. In addition, 15 RSGs are also identified as binary via HST/STIS spectra, and a handful of the binaries identified by the SED fitting are confirmed by their light curve and radial velocity dispersion. The stellar parameters of the companions, i.e. $T_{\mathrm{eff}}$, $R$, $L$ and log $g$, are calculated by model fitting.

          Capturing Small-Scale Reionization Physics: A Sub-Grid Model for Photon Sinks with SCRIPT

 - **Abstract**
 The epoch of reionization represents a major phase transition in cosmic history, during which the first luminous sources ionized the intergalactic medium (IGM). However, the small-scale physics governing ionizing photon sinks - particularly the interplay between recombinations, photon propagation, and self-shielded regions - remains poorly understood. Accurately modeling these processes requires a framework that self-consistently links ionizing emissivity, the clumping factor, mean free path, and photoionization rate. In this work, we extend the photon-conserving semi-numerical framework, SCRIPT, by introducing a self-consistent sub-grid model that dynamically connects these quantities to the underlying density field, enabling a more realistic treatment of inhomogeneous recombinations and photon sinks. We validate our model against a comprehensive set of observational constraints, including the UV luminosity function from HST and JWST, CMB optical depth from Planck, and Lyman-$\alpha$ forest measurements of the IGM temperature, photoionization rate, and mean free path. Our fiducial model also successfully reproduces Lyman-$\alpha$ opacity fluctuations, reinforcing its ability to capture large-scale inhomogeneities in the reionization process. Notably, we demonstrate that traditionally independent parameters, such as the clumping factor and mean free path, are strongly correlated, with implications for the timing, morphology, and thermal evolution of reionization. Looking ahead, we will extend this framework to include machine learning-based parameter inference. With upcoming 21cm experiments poised to provide unprecedented insights, SCRIPT offers a powerful computational tool for interpreting high-redshift observations and refining our understanding of the last major phase transition in the universe.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the errors in modeling the redshift-space distortion (RSD) effect at large linear scales, using data from the Millennium simulation. While standard theoretical templates, such as the Kaiser formula and the TNS method, could precisely model RSD for individual large-scale modes, we find that for tracers with number densities lower than $\sim10^{-3}({\rm Mpc}/h)^{-3}$, there is a few-percent level bias in the predicted power spectrum. This error arises due to the amplification of intrinsic Poisson noise during RSD modeling from real-space power spectrum. This amplified noise can be analytically expressed as $1 + \epsilon/[{\bar{n}P}({1+\epsilon})]$, with $\epsilon=2\beta/3+\beta^2/5$, where $P$ denotes the real-space tracer power spectrum and $\beta \equiv f/b$. Specifically, for halos with a number density of around $5\times10^{-4}({\rm Mpc}/h)^{-3}$, this phenomenon results in an additional systematic error of 2.5\%. Our result suggests that caution should be exercised when modeling the RSD directly using real-space power spectra of tracers measured from simulations or from the real surveys. This is relevant, e.g., in situations where the real-space tracer power spectrum is predicted by emulators trained using simulation data.

          Biases induced by retardance and diattenuation in the measurements of long-baseline interferometers

 - **Abstract**
 I derive in this paper theoretical expressions for biases on fringe contrast and fringe visibility phase for optical interferometers whose polarizing properties can be described by beam rotation, retardance, and diattenuation. The nature of these biases is discussed for natural light, circular and linear polarization, and partially polarized light. Expansions are obtained for small degrees of polarization, small differential retardance, and small diattenuation. The biases on fringe contrasts are already known. It is shown in this paper that retardance and diattenuation are also sources of bias on the visibility phases and derived quantities. In some cases, the bias is zero. If the retardance is achromatic, differential phases are not affected. Closure phases are not affected to the second order for an interferometer with weak diattenuation and weak differential retardance and for moderately polarized sources whatever the type of light. Otherwise, a calibration procedure is required. It is shown that astrometric measurements are biased in the general case. The bias depends on both the polarization properties of the interferometer and on the (u,v) sampling. In the extreme case where the samples are aligned on a line crossing the origin of the spatial frequency plane, the bias is undetermined and can be arbitrarily large. In all other cases, it can be calibrated if the polarizing characteristics of the interferometer are known. In the case of low differential retardance and low degree of polarization, the bias lies on a straight line, crossing the astrometric reference point. If the degree of linear polarization varies during the observations, then the astrometric bias has a remarkable signature, which describes a section of the line. For slightly polarizing interferometers, a fixed offset is added without changing the shape of the bias.

 - **Abstract**
 The measurement of the spatial fluctuations of the neutral hydrogen 21 cm signal arising during the Dark Ages and Cosmic Dawn periods of our Universe (z from 200 to 10) holds the potential to resolve these still-unexplored earliest phases of the evolution of matter structures. As these cosmological signals are very weak, large distributed telescopes are required at locations free from terrestrial radio interference and ionospheric disturbances. This paper presents a description of the scientific aims, the instrumental concept, and technological developments of an experiment - dubbed the Dark-ages EXplorer (DEX) - which would allow us to (a) measure the Global Signal and (b) measure the angular density fluctuations and conduct line-of-sight tomography in the Dark Ages and Cosmic Dawn epochs. Additional scientific goals are also briefly described. The experiment consists of a low-frequency radio interferometer, which should ideally be located on the far side of the Moon. The paper presents findings from an ESA Concurrent Design Facility (CDF) study, which was conducted to assess the feasibility of such a system using present-day technologies with a high TRL (Technology Readiness Level). Although the study finds that the number of antennas needed to achieve the primary scientific goals is not yet feasible at the moment, it points to a path of technological development that can lead to a realistic and valuable experiment in the medium-term future (i.e., the next decade(s)), as well as development of multi-purpose use technology that can be applied on Earth, and towards other lunar operations.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the AI Cosmologist, an agentic system designed to automate cosmological/astronomical data analysis and machine learning research workflows. This implements a complete pipeline from idea generation to experimental evaluation and research dissemination, mimicking the scientific process typically performed by human researchers. The system employs specialized agents for planning, coding, execution, analysis, and synthesis that work together to develop novel approaches. Unlike traditional auto machine-learning systems, the AI Cosmologist generates diverse implementation strategies, writes complete code, handles execution errors, analyzes results, and synthesizes new approaches based on experimental outcomes. We demonstrate the AI Cosmologist capabilities across several machine learning tasks, showing how it can successfully explore solution spaces, iterate based on experimental results, and combine successful elements from different approaches. Our results indicate that agentic systems can automate portions of the research process, potentially accelerating scientific discovery. The code and experimental data used in this paper are available on GitHub at this https URL. Example papers included in the appendix demonstrate the system's capability to autonomously produce complete scientific publications, starting from only the dataset and task description

 - **Abstract**
 Satellites play a crucial role in understanding the formation and evolution of trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs). The spin--orbit evolution of satellite systems depends on their thermal histories, allowing us to constrain the rock mass fraction within TNOs based on their current spin--orbit states. In this study, we perform coupled thermal--orbital evolution calculations for two satellite systems around undifferentiated TNOs: Orcus--Vanth and Salacia--Actaea. Our results demonstrate that the current spin--orbit states of these systems are consistent with a rock mass fraction of approximately 20--30%. Additionally, we estimate the organic mass fraction within the TNOs and find that it is comparable to the rock mass fraction. These findings suggest that the chemical composition of TNOs closely resembles that of comets.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. B hypergiants (BHGs) are important for understanding high-mass stellar evolution. While they are in a similar parameter space of B supergiants (BSGs), some BHGs are known to be luminous blue variables (LBVs). Their spectra with absorption and emission features resemble Of/WNh stars. Yet, their wind physics and their evolutionary connections are not clear. Aims. In this study, we aim to understand (i) the atmospheric and wind structure, (ii) the wind-launching and -driving mechanisms, and (iii) the spectrum formation of early-type BHGs. As an observational prototype, we use zet1 Sco (B1.5Ia+). Methods. Using the atmosphere code PoWRhd, we calculated the first hydrodynamically consistent models at the BHG domain. They give insights into the radiative driving of the calculated wind regimes and enable us to study the influence of clumping and X-rays on the resulting wind structure. Results. Our consistent model reproduces the main spectral features of zet1 Sco. The obtained mass-loss rate is higher than that of similar spectral type BSGs. However, the wind optical depth of BHGs is way below unity, making them less of a transition type. To reproduce zet1 Sco's spectrum, we needed low clumping with subsonic onset. The wind has a shallow-gradient velocity profile, deviating from the beta law, and is mainly driven by Fe III opacity. Conclusions. Our study suggests that despite more mass loss, early-type Galactic BHGs have winds relatively similar to BSGs. Their winds are not thick enough to characterize them as "transition-type" stars, unlike Of/WNh, implying that emission features arise more easily in cooler than in hotter stars. The spectral BHG appearance is likely connected to atmospheric inhomogeneities below the sonic point. To reach an appearance similar to LBVs, BHGs need to be either closer to the Eddington limit or have higher wind clumping than inferred for zeta1 Sco.

 - **Abstract**
 The Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) has detected thousands of sources since its launch in 2008, with many remaining unidentified. Some of these point sources may arise from source confusion. Specifically, there could be extended sources erroneously described as groups of point sources. Using the DBSCAN clustering algorithm, we analyze unidentified Fermi-LAT sources alongside some classified objects from the 4FGL-DR4 catalog. We identified 44 distinct clusters containing 106 sources, each including at least one unidentified source. Detailed modeling of selected clusters reveals some cases where extended source models are statistically preferred over multiple point sources. The work is motivated by prior observations of extended TeV gamma-ray sources, such as HESS J1813-178, and their GeV counterparts. In the case of HESS J1813-178, two unidentified Fermi-LAT point sources were detected in the region. Subsequent multiwavelength analysis combining TeV and GeV data showed that a single extended source is a better description of the emission in this region than two point-like sources.

 - **Abstract**
 This study examines the impact of diffuse Galactic emission on sky-based direction-independent (DI) gain calibration using realistic forward simulations of Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR) observations of the high-redshift 21 cm signal of neutral hydrogen during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). We simulated LOFAR observations between 147 - 159 MHz using a sky model that includes a point source catalogue and diffuse Galactic emission. The simulated observations were DI-gain calibrated with the point source catalogue alone, utilising the LOFAR-EoR data analysis pipeline. A full power spectrum analysis was conducted to assess the systematic bias introduced by DI-gain calibration using complete and incomplete sky models, relative to thermal noise. Additionally, the cross-coherence between observation pairs was computed to determine whether DI-gain calibration errors are coherent or incoherent in specific regions of power spectrum space as a function of integration time. We find that DI-gain calibration with an incomplete sky model that omits diffuse Galactic emission introduces a systematic bias in the power spectrum for $k_{\parallel}$ bins < 0.2 $h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. The power spectrum errors in these bins are coherent; therefore, the resulting bias can be mitigated during the foreground removal step. In contrast, errors for $k_{\parallel}$ > 0.2 $h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ are largely incoherent and average down as noise. We conclude that missing diffuse Galactic emission in the sky model is not a significant contributor to the excess noise observed in the current LOFAR-EoR upper limit results on the 21 cm signal power spectrum.

 - **Abstract**
 Models of interacting dark energy and dark matter offer a possible solution to cosmological tensions. In this work, we examine a pure momentum-exchange model with a time-dependent coupling strength $\xi(z)$ that could help to alleviate the $S_8$ tension. We perform Fisher forecasting and MCMC analysis to constrain the coupling strength of this interaction for different redshift bins $0.0<z<2.1$, using the specifications of upcoming DESI-like surveys. For this analysis, we examine both a model with a constant equation of state $w=-0.9$, as well as a thawing dark energy model with an evolving $w(z)$. We show that, for a constant equation of state, $\xi(z)$ can be well constrained in all redshift bins. However, due to a weaker effect at early times, the constraints are significantly reduced at high redshifts in the case of a thawing $w(z)$ model.

 - **Abstract**
 Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are enigmatic millisecond-duration radio transients of extra-galactic origin, whose underlying mechanisms and progenitors remain poorly understood. FRBs are broadly classified into two categories: repeating FRBs, which emit multiple bursts over time, and one-off FRBs, which are detected as single events. A central question in FRB research is whether these two classes share a common origin. In this study, we present observations of FRB 20240114A, a repeating FRB that entered a hyperactive phase in January 2024. We conducted a 318-hour monitoring campaign using the Kunming 40-Meter Radio Telescope (KM40M) in the S-band (2.187-2.311 GHz), during which we detected eight radio bursts. We analyzed their properties, including dispersion measure (DM), bandwidth, pulse width, flux, fluence, and energy. Additionally, we searched for counterparts in overlapping data from the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST) in the L-band (1.0-1.5 GHz). While no bursts were temporally aligned between the two telescopes, we identified one FAST burst that arrived approximately 6 ms after one of the KM40M bursts. The absence of FAST counterparts for the KM40M bursts suggests that individual bursts from FRB 20240114A are likely narrow-band, with fractional bandwidths less than 10%. By comparing the cumulative event rates from KM40M and FAST observations, we found that the two measurements are compatible, indicating a possible flattening of the event rate at higher energies. This feature aligns with observations of one-off FRBs, supporting the hypothesis that repeating and one-off FRBs may share a common origin.

 We present a study of the $^{12}$CO(1-0) line emission anisotropy across the Milky Way's disk to examine the effect of stellar feedback and Galactic dynamics on the distribution of the dense interstellar medium. The Hessian matrix method is used to characterize the CO line emission distribution and identify the preferential orientation across line-of-sight velocity channels in the Dame et al. 2001 composite Galactic plane survey, which covers the Galactic latitude range $|b|<5^{\circ}$. The structures sampled with this tracer are predominantly parallel to the Galactic plane toward the inner Galaxy, in clear contrast with the predominantly perpendicular orientation of the structures traced by neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) emission toward the same regions. The analysis of the Galactic plane portions sampled at higher angular resolution with other surveys reveals that the alignment with the Galactic plane is also prevalent at smaller scales. We find no preferential orientation in the CO emission toward the outer Galaxy, in contrast with the preferential alignment with the Galactic plane displayed by HI in that portion of the Milky Way. We interpret these results as the combined effect of the decrease in mid-plane pressure with increasing Galactocentric radius and SN feedback lifting diffuse gas more efficiently than dense gas off the Galactic plane.

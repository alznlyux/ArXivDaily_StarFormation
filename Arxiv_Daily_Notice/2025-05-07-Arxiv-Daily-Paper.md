 - **Abstract**
 Correlations in the Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) forest, both as a function of line of sight separation (1D) and 3D separation, provide a unique window to the distribution of matter at redshifts not accessible by current galaxy surveys. While optimal quadratic estimators have been used to measure 1D correlations, they are computationally expensive and difficult to extend to 3D analyses. On the other hand, estimators based on the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) are significantly faster, but are affected by missing data in the spectra (masked pixels) and so far have not used pixel weights to reduce the uncertainties in the measurement. In this publication we describe how to compute the window matrix that enables forward-modeling the impact of masked pixels and weights on the FFT-based estimators. We use Gaussian and hydrodynamical simulations with artificially masked pixels to validate the method on the measurement of 1D correlations. Finally, we show that the formalism can be extended to model the impact on 3D correlations, in particular on the cross-spectrum, the correlation of 1D Fourier modes as a function of transverse separation. This work will enable more precise clustering measurements with the Ly$\alpha$ forest dataset recently collected by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI).

 - **Abstract**
 Over the past 16 years, the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) has significantly advanced our view of the GeV gamma-ray sky, yet several key questions remain - such as the composition of the isotropic gamma-ray background, the origin of the Fermi Bubbles or the potential presence of signatures from exotic physics like dark matter. Addressing these challenges requires sophisticated astrophysical modeling and robust statistical methods capable of handling high-dimensional parameter spaces. In this work, we analyze 14 years of high-latitude ($|b|\geq30^{\circ}$) Fermi-LAT data in the range from 1 to 10 GeV using simulation-based inference (SBI) via neural ratio estimation. This approach allows us to detect individual gamma-ray sources and derive a list of significant gamma-ray emitters containing more than 98\% of all sources listed in the Fermi-LAT Fourth Source Catalog (4FGL) with a flux $S>3\times10^{-10}\;\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ (about a factor of three larger than the flux above which 4FGL is nearly complete), without any non-4FGL source detected in that flux range. Additionally, we reconstruct the source-count distribution in both parametric and non-parametric forms, achieving large agreement with previous literature results as well as those sources detected by our SBI pipeline. We also quantitatively validate our gamma-ray emission simulator via an anomaly detection technique, demonstrating that the synthetic data closely reproduces the complexity of the real observations.

          Vlasov Perturbation Theory applied to $Λ$CDM

 - **Abstract**
 We apply the framework of Vlasov Perturbation Theory (VPT) to the two-loop matter power spectrum within $\Lambda$CDM cosmologies. The main difference to Standard Perturbation Theory (SPT) arises from taking the velocity dispersion tensor into account, and the resulting screening of the backreaction of UV modes renders loop integrals cutoff-independent. VPT is informed about non-perturbative small scale dynamics via the average value of the dispersion generated by shell-crossing, which impacts the evolution of perturbations on weakly non-linear scales. When using an average dispersion from halo models, the VPT power spectrum agrees with the one from the simulation, up to differences from missing three-loop contributions. Alternatively, treating the average dispersion as free parameter we find a remarkably stable prediction of the matter power spectrum from collisionless dynamics at percent level for a wide range of the dispersion scale. We quantify the impact of truncating the Vlasov hierarchy for the cumulants of the phase-space distribution function, finding that the two-loop matter power spectrum is robust to neglecting third and higher cumulants. Finally, we introduce and validate a simplified fast scheme fVPT that can be easily incorporated into existing codes and is as numerically efficient as SPT.

 - **Abstract**
 We present early multi-wavelength photometric and spectroscopic observations of the Type IIb supernova SN 2024uwq, capturing its shock-cooling emission phase and double-peaked light curve evolution. Early spectra reveal broad H-alpha (v ~ 15,500 km s$^{-1}$) and He I P-Cygni profiles of similar strengths. Over time the He I lines increase in strength while the H-alpha decreases, consistent with a hydrogen envelope ($M_{env}$ = 0.7 - 1.35 $M_\odot$ ) overlying helium-rich ejecta. Analytic modeling of early shock cooling emission and bolometric light analysis constrains the progenitor to a partially stripped star with radius R = 10 - 60 $R_\odot$, consistent with a blue/yellow supergiant with an initial ZAMS mass of 12 - 20 $M_\odot$ , likely stripped via binary interaction. SN 2024uwq occupies a transitional position between compact and extended Type IIb supernovae, highlighting the role of binary mass-transfer efficiency in shaping a continuum of stripped-envelope progenitors. Our results underscore the importance of both early UV/optical observations to characterize shock breakout signatures critical to map the diversity in evolutionary pathways of massive stars. Upcoming time domain surveys including Rubin Observatory's LSST and UV missions like ULTRASAT and UVEX will revolutionise our ability to systematically capture these early signatures, probing the full diversity of stripped progenitors and their explosive endpoints.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate potential deviations from the standard adiabatic evolution of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature, $T_{\rm CMB}(z)$, using the latest Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) effect measurements and molecular line excitation data, covering a combined redshift range of $0 < z \lesssim 6$. We follow different approaches. First, we reconstruct the redshift evolution of $T_{\rm CMB}(z)$ in a model-independent way using Gaussian Process regression. The tightest constraints come from SZ measurements at $z < 1$, while molecular line data at $z > 3$ yield broader uncertainties. By combining both datasets, we find good consistency with the standard evolution across the full analysed redshift range, inferring a present-day CMB monopole temperature of $T_0 = 2.744 \pm 0.019$ K. Next, we test for deviations from the standard scaling by adopting the parameterisation $T_{\rm CMB}(z) = T_0(1+z)^{1-\beta}$, where $\beta$ quantifies departures from adiabaticity, with $\beta = 0$ corresponding to the standard scenario. In this framework, we use Gaussian Process reconstruction to test the consistency of $\beta = 0$ across the full redshift range and perform $\chi^2$ minimisation techniques to determine the best-fit values of $T_0$ and $\beta$. In both cases, we find good consistency with the standard temperature-redshift relation. The $\chi^2$-minimisation analysis yields best-fit values of $\beta = -0.0106 \pm 0.0124$ and $T_0 = 2.7276 \pm 0.0095$ K, in excellent agreement with both $\beta = 0$ and independent direct measurements of $T_0$ from FIRAS and ARCADE. We discuss the implications of our findings, which offer strong empirical support for the standard cosmological prediction and place tight constraints on a wide range of alternative scenarios of interest in the context of cosmological tensions and fundamental physics.

 - **Abstract**
 Context: Globular clusters (GCs) host multiple populations characterised by abundance variations in a number of light elements. In many cases, these populations also show spatial and/or kinematic differences, which vary in strength from cluster to cluster and tend to decrease with the clusters' dynamical ages. Aims: In this work, we aim to study the dynamical mixing of multiple populations and establish a link between the more theoretical aspects of the mixing process and various observational parameters that quantify differences between the populations' spatial concentration and velocity anisotropy. Methods: We follow the dynamical mixing of multiple populations in a set of numerical simulations through their distribution in the energy and angular momentum phase space and quantify the evolution of their degree of dynamical mixing. Results: We present the degree of dynamical mixing traced by the intrinsic differences in the phase space distribution of the populations. We compare the differences in phase-space with three observable quantities that describe the degree of mixing in the structural and kinematic differences of the populations: $A^{+}$, commonly used in the literature for spatial differences; and we introduce two new parameters, $\Delta A_{\beta}$ that traces the difference in velocity anisotropy and $\sigma_{\text{Lz}}$, that traces the angular momentum distribution of stars. Conclusions: Our study provides new insights into the dynamics of phase space mixing of multiple populations in globular clusters. We show that differences between the 1P and the 2P observed in old clusters contain key information on the cluster's dynamics and the 1P and the 2P spatial and kinematic properties set by the formation processes, but caution is necessary in using the strength of the present-day differences to quantitatively constrain those imprinted at the time of formation.
#### Title:
          Pressure Parametrization of Dark Energy: First and Second-Order Constraints with Latest Cosmological Data

 - **Abstract**
 We explore an extension of the $\Lambda$CDM model in which the pressure $p$ of the dark energy (DE) fluid evolves with the expansion of the Universe, expressed as a function of the scale factor $a$. The corresponding energy density $\rho$ is derived from the continuity equation, resulting in a dynamical equation-of-state parameter $w \equiv p/\rho$ during the late-time expansion of the Universe. The pressure is modeled using a Taylor expansion around the present epoch ($a = 1$), introducing deviations from a cosmological constant within the dynamical dark energy (DDE) framework. At first order, a single new parameter $\Omega_1$ captures linear deviations, while a second-order parameter, $\Omega_2$, accounts for quadratic evolution in the pressure. We constrain the first- and second-order DDE models using multiple observational datasets and compare their performance against $\Lambda$CDM and the CPL parameterization. A joint analysis of Planck CMB, DESI, and DESY5 data yields the strongest evidence for DDE, with a $2.7\sigma$ deviation in the first-order model and over $4\sigma$ in the second-order model, providing strong statistical support for a departure from a cosmological constant. The reconstructed DE evolution in the second-order case reveals a distinctive non-monotonic behavior in both energy density and $w_{\rm DE}(a)$, including clear phantom-crossing phenomena. Notably, the late-time evolution of $w_{\rm DE}(a)$ remains consistent across datasets and shows strong agreement with the CPL parameterization, underscoring the robustness of the pressure-based approach.

 - **Abstract**
 We present extensive ultraviolet to optical photometric and optical to near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopic follow-up observations of the nearby intermediate-luminosity ($M_V = -$16.81$\pm$0.19~mag) Type Iax supernova (SN) 2024pxl in NGC 6384. SN~2024pxl exhibits a faster light curve evolution than the high-luminosity members of this class, and slower than low-luminosity events. The observationally well-constrained rise time of $\sim$10 days and an estimated synthesized $^{56}$Ni mass of 0.03 M$_\odot$, based on analytical modeling of the pseudobolometric light curve, are consistent with models of the weak deflagration of a carbon-oxygen white dwarf. Our optical spectral sequence of SN~2024pxl shows weak \ion{Si}{2} lines and spectral evolution similar to other high-luminosity Type Iax SNe, but also prominent early-time \ion{C}{2} line, like lower-luminosity Type Iax SNe. The late-time optical spectrum of SN~2024pxl closely matches that of SN 2014dt, and its NIR spectral evolution aligns with those of other well-studied, high-luminosity Type Iax SNe. The spectral-line expansion velocities of SN~2024pxl are at the lower end of the Type Iax SN velocity distribution, and the velocity distribution of iron-group elements compared to intermediate-mass elements suggests that the ejecta are mixed on large scales, as expected in pure deflagration models. SN~2024pxl exhibits characteristics intermediate between those of high-luminosity and low-luminosity Type~Iax SNe, further establishing a link across this diverse class.

 - **Abstract**
 In spite of accounting for only a small fraction of the mass of the Interstellar Medium (ISM), dust plays a primary role in many physical and chemical processes in the Universe. It is the main driver of extinction of radiation in the UV/optical wavelength range and a primary source of thermal IR emission. Dust grains contain most of the refractory elements of the ISM and they host chemical processes that involve complex molecular compounds. However, observational evidence suggests that grain structure is highly non-trivial and that dust particles are characterized by granularity, asymmetry and stratification, which significantly affect their interaction with radiation fields. Accurate modeling of such interaction is fundamental to properly explain observational results, but it is a computationally demanding task. Here we present the possibility to investigate the effects of radiation/particle interactions in non-spherically symmetric conditions using a novel implementation of the Transition Matrix formalism, designed to run on scalable parallel hardware facilities.

          Stellar wind parameters of massive stars in accretion-powered High Mass X-ray Binary Pulsars

 - **Abstract**
 The process of mass-exchange between the components of High Mass X-ray Binary (HMXB) systems with neutron stars undergoing wind-fed accretion is discussed. The X-ray luminosity of these systems allows us to evaluate the mass capture rate by the neutron star from the stellar wind of its massive companion and set limits on the relative velocity between the neutron star and the wind. We find that the upper limit to the wind velocity in the orbital plane during the high state of the X-ray source is in the range 120--1000 km/s, which is by a factor of 2--4 lower than both the terminal wind velocity and the speed of the wind flowing out from the polar regions of massive stars for all the objects under investigation. This finding is valid not only for the systems with Be stars, but also for those system in which the optical components do not exhibit the Be phenomenon. We also show that the lower limit to the radial wind velocity in these systems can unlikely be smaller than a few per cent of the orbital velocity of the neutron star. This provide us with a new constraint on the mass-transfer process in the outflowing disks of Be-type stars.

          Spectral Analysis of Cyg X-3 using simultaneous AstroSat and Insight-HXMT Observations

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results from the spectral analysis of Cygnus X-3 using simultaneous data from AstroSat and Insight-HXMT during its soft state. A pure reflection spectrum, including emission lines of iron, silica, and sulfur, provides a good fit to the spectra. Orbital phase-resolved analysis shows no significant spectral parameter variations, except for the normalization. Leveraging IXPE polarization results, we model the funnel-shaped geometry and estimate scattered flux and observed polarization for various funnel parameters and observer inclinations. We consider two scenarios: reflection from the funnel walls and scattering by gas within the funnel. Our results reconfirm previous findings, showing that reflection can produce a high polarization degree (PD) of 23$\%$, but not a low PD of 12$\%$. Conversely, scattering can produce a PD of 10-12$\%$, but not as high as 23$\%$ for a fixed observer inclination of $30^\circ$. Scattering results align with previous findings without absorption, but with absorption, PD drops significantly with increasing funnel opening angle. Thus, we can identify common funnel parameters that can produce the different observed PDs in the soft and hard states. The intrinsic luminosity of the source was estimated by comparing the results from a plane disk and the funnel model, to be $\sim7$ $\times$ 10$^{40}$ erg/s for 12$\%$ PD (scattering) and $\sim5$ $\times$ 10$^{41}$ erg/s for 23$\%$ PD (reflection). However, for the reflection model, the luminosity may decrease to $\sim$ 10$^{40}$ erg/s when the 23$\%$ PD observed is taken as a lower limit.

          A Wide-band High-frequency Type-II Solar Radio Burst

 - **Abstract**
 Type-II radio bursts are typically observed below ~ 400 MHz, with narrow-band slowly-drifting fundamental and harmonic structures. Here we report an unusual high-frequency wide-band type-II burst with starting frequency as high as 600 - 700 MHz and the instantaneous bandwidth being as wide as ~ 300 MHz. The estimated average spectral drift is ~ 2.18 MHz/s, its mean duration at each frequency is ~ 3 min, the maximum brightness temperature can exceed 10^11 to 10^12 K. According to the simultaneous EUV and radio imaging data, the radio sources distribute over a relatively broad region that concentrates around a dip of the nose front of the shock-like EUV wave structure. The dip is likely caused by the strong interaction of the eruption with the overlying closed dense loops that are enclosed by the large-scale streamer structure, indicating that the Type-II burst originates from such CME-shock interaction with dense-closed loop structures. The observations suggest that the unusual wide-band high frequency type-II radio burst originates from a dense streamer region in the corona, supported by EUV shock-like structure that get steepened very close to the solar surface ~ 1.23 R0 and type-II radio source coincides with the shock dip. Further the wide-band feature is due to the source stemming from a region with large density variation and not due to the intensity variation across the shock structure.

          Very massive stars at low metallicity: evolution, synthetic spectroscopy, and impact on the integrated light of starbursts

 - **Abstract**
 We study the spectroscopic appearance of very massive stars and their effect on the integrated light of starbursts at low metallicity (Z). We adopt two frameworks for the mass loss rates of VMS: in one case we assume no Z dependence, in the other case we assume a linear scaling with Z. We compute evolutionary models for masses 150, 200, 250 and 300 Msun at Z=0.2, 0.1 and 0.01 Zsun. We compute the associated synthetic spectra at selected points along the evolutionary tracks. Finally we build population synthesis models including VMS. We find that the evolution of VMS critically depends on the assumptions regarding mass loss rates. In case of no Z dependence VMS remain hot for all their lifetime. Conversely when mass loss rates are reduced because of lower Z VMS follow a classical evolution towards the red part of the HR diagram. VMS display HeII 1640 emission in most phases of their evolution, except when they become too cool. This line is present in the integrated light of population synthesis models down to 0.1 Zsun whatever the star formation history, and is also sometimes seen at Z=0.01 Zsun. HeII 1640 is weaker in models that include a Z scaling of the mass loss rates. The optical spectra of starbursts, especially the Wolf-Rayet bumps, sometimes display VMS signatures when these stars are present. At low Z, adding VMS to population synthesis models produces more ionising photons down to 45 eV. At higher energy the ionising flux depends on age, Z, assumption regarding VMS mass loss rates, and on the very short phases at the end of VMS evolution. HeII ionising fluxes large enough to produce some amount of nebular HeII 4686 emission can be produced under specific circumstances. Our models are able to reproduce qualitatively and sometimes also quantitatively the UV spectra of star-forming regions. However we are not able to clearly identify which mass loss framework is favoured.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent in situ observations from Parker Solar Probe (PSP) near perihelia reveal ion beams, temperature anisotropies, and kinetic wave activity. These features are likely linked to solar wind heating and acceleration. During PSP Encounter 17 (at $11.4R_s$) on Sep-26-2023, the PSP/FIELDS instrument detected enhanced ion-scale wave activity associated with deviations from local thermodynamic equilibrium in ion velocity distribution functions (VDFs) observed by the PSP/Solar Probe Analyzers-Ion (SPAN-I). Dense beams (secondary populations) were present in the proton VDFs during this wave activity. Using bi-Maxwellian fits to the proton VDFs, we found that the density of the proton beam population increased during the wave activity and, unexpectedly, surpassed the core population at certain intervals. Interestingly, the wave power was reduced during the intervals when the beam population density exceeded the core density. The drift velocity of the beams decreases from 0.9 to 0.7 of the Alfvén speed and the proton core shows a higher temperature anisotropy ($T_\perp/T_\parallel>2.5$) during these intervals. We conclude that the observations during these intervals are consistent with a reconnection event during a heliospheric current sheet crossing. During this event, $\alpha$ particle parameters (density, velocity, and temperature anisotropy) remained nearly constant. Using linear analysis, we examined how the proton beam drives instability or wave dissipation. Furthermore, We investigated the nonlinear evolution of ion kinetic instabilities using hybrid kinetic simulations. This study provides direct clues about energy transfer between particles and waves in the young solar wind.

 - **Abstract**
 The exact location of the $\gamma$-ray emitting region in blazar jets has long been a matter of debate. However, the location has important implications about the emission processes, geometric and physical parameters of the jet, as well as the nature of interaction of the jet with the interstellar and intergalactic medium. Diverse conclusions have been drawn by various authors based on a variety of methods applied to different data sets of many blazars, e.g., the location is less than 0.1 pc from the central engine within the broad line region (BLR) or a few or tens of pc downstream beyond the dusty torus or at some intermediate distance. Here we use a method, established in a previous work, in which the location of the GeV/optical emission is determined using the ratio of energy dissipated during contemporaneous outbursts at those wave bands. We apply it to a total of 47 multi-wavelength outbursts in 10 blazars. We find that the location of the GeV/optical emission is beyond the BLR for all cases. This result is consistent with other studies, in which the location has been determined for a large sample of blazars. We compare the location determined by our method for several GeV outbursts of multiple blazars to that obtained by other authors using different methods. We find that our results are consistent in such one-to-one comparison in most cases, for which the required data were available.

          On the spin-orbit problem for highly elliptical orbits and recursive excitation

 - **Abstract**
 Examining the spin-orbit coupling effects for highly elliptical orbits is relevant to the mission design and operation of cislunar space assets, such as the Lunar Gateway. In high-eccentricity orbits, the gravity-gradient moment is here modelled as an instantaneous excitation at each periapsis passage. By approximating the gravity-gradient moment through Dirac pulses, we derive a recursive discrete map describing the rotational state of the satellite at the periapsis passage. Thanks to the recursive map, we are able to find the initial attitude corresponding to an unbounded growth of angular velocity, and to identify initial conditions whose evolution is such that the pulses have the same sign (in-phase condition) or the alternate sign (counterphase condition) at successive periapsis passages. In the recursive map, we perform the numerical analysis up to ten periapsis passages. In order to justify the introduction of the discrete map, we compare the results of the discrete map with those found in the spin-orbit problem. Because of numerical errors due to the high eccentricity, we restrict the investigation up to three periapsis passages in the spin-orbit problem. Moreover, we apply the Fast Lyapunov Indicators method to draw the phase portrait and detect the initial conditions fulfilling the counterphase condition.

 - **Abstract**
 How effective are methods for estimating bolide energies from infrasound signal period-yield relationships? A single global period-energy relation can obscure significant variability introduced by parameters such as the atmospheric Doppler wind profile and the bolide's energy deposition profile as a function of altitude. Bolide speed, entry angle, burst altitude, and multi-episode fragmentation all may play a role in defining the detected period of the shockwave. By leveraging bolide light curve data from the Center for Near Earth Object Studies (CNEOS), we re-examined the period-energy relation as a function of these parameters. Through a bootstrap approach, we show that various event subsets can deviate from widely cited period-energy models and we identify which specific conditions most strongly reshape the period-energy scaling. The results define both the fidelity and reliability of period-energy relations when no additional data beyond the infrasound record is available and improve the outcome when supporting data from bolide trajectories and light curves are included. Ultimately, these findings expand the scope of earlier models, providing a nuanced and robust framework for infrasound-only yield estimation under a range of bolide scenarios.

 - **Abstract**
 For time-domain astronomy, it is crucial to frequently image celestial objects at specific depths within a predetermined cadence. To fulfill these scientific demands, scientists globally have started or planned the development of non-interferometric telescope arrays in recent years. Due to the numerous parameters involved in configuring these arrays, there is a need for an automated optimization framework that selects parameter sets to satisfy scientific needs while minimizing costs. In this paper, we introduce such a framework, which integrates optical design software, an exposure time calculator, and an optimization algorithm, to balance the observation capabilities and the cost of optical telescope arrays. Neural networks are utilized to speed up results retrieval of the system with different configurations. We use the SiTian project as a case study to demonstrate the framework's effectiveness, showing that this approach can aid scientists in selecting optimal parameter sets. The code for this framework is published in the China Virtual Observatory PaperData Repository, enabling users to optimize parameters for various non-interferometric telescope array projects.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the multi-band photometric and low-resolution spectroscopic analysis of four W Ursae Majoris eclipsing binaries (EWs) - J080510.1+141528 (hereinafter as J0805a), J080516.3+143138 (hereinafter as J0805b), J143358.7+053953 (hereinafter as J1433), and J143458.4+054143 (hereinafter as J1434). The multi-band ground based photometric data are collected using the 1.3-m Devasthal Fast Optical Telescope (DFOT) while we also make use of TESS photometric observations. The spectroscopic analysis is based on the low-resolution observations by 4-m Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST). The ephemeris of these systems are updated using the photometric data from TESS and other photometric surveys. The system J0805b shows a secular change in the orbital period with a period change rate of 4.2 ($\pm$ 0.1) $\times10^{-7}$ days per year while the orbital period change rate for J1433 is calculated as -1.1 ($\pm$ 0.1) $\times10^{-6}$ days per year. The mass-transfer rate for J0805b is found to be dM$_{1}$/dt = -1.56($\pm$0.07) $\times 10^{-6}$ M$_{\odot}$/year and dM$_{1}$/dt = -7.95($\pm$0.87) $\times 10^{-7}$ M$_{\odot}$/year for J1433. All the systems have inclination > 79$^{\circ}$ except J1433 which has inclination of 72.8$^{\circ}$. The mass-ratios (less massive to more massive component) for these targets are < 0.5. All the system except J0805b are A-subtype contact binaries. The absolute parameters of the systems are determined using GAIA DR3 parallax and reddening information. The LAMOST spectra are analyzed using spectral subtraction technique. A small excess emission is detected for J1433 in H$_{\alpha}$ and H$_{\beta}$ region. The systems are plotted on Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram and compared with previously studied systems. The mass-ratio vs radius-ratio relation is also investigated for these systems.

 - **Abstract**
 With current and upcoming experiments on the horizon, the global 21-cm signal can open up new avenues for probing dark matter (DM) physics at redshifts that are otherwise inaccessible to other observables. This work investigates the effects of elastic scattering between DM and baryons on the global 21-cm signal in two distinct interacting DM (IDM) models: Coulomb-like and velocity-independent interactions. Our analysis incorporates key astrophysical parameters essential for accurately modeling the global signal, including star formation efficiency, escape fraction of ionizing photons, normalization of the X-ray luminosity, the number of Lyman-Werner photons emitted per stellar baryon, the minimum virial temperature of star-forming halos, as well as the IDM particle mass and cross section. We perform a Fisher analysis to forecast the sensitivity of four global 21-cm signal experimental scenarios as probes of DM-baryon scattering. We find that global signal experiments, even at the sensitivity of the current facilities such as EDGES and SARAS3, could improve existing cosmological and astrophysical constraints on DM-baryon scattering. Our results also highlight the degeneracies among the DM-baryon interaction cross section and astrophysical quantities. In particular, degeneracies between the IDM cross section and two astrophysical parameters, the minimum virial temperature, and Lyman-Werner photon production, can significantly impact the DM interaction inference. Conversely, the velocity-independent cross section is found to be insensitive to uncertainties in the X-ray luminosity. These findings underscore the necessity of accurately characterizing the uncertainties in astrophysical parameters to leverage the full potential of the 21-cm global signal experiments in probing IDM physics.

 - **Abstract**
 High-precision infrared spectroscopic measurements now enable detailed characterization of sub-Neptune atmospheres, potentially providing constraints on their interiors. Motivated by this, atmospheric models have been developed to explore chemical interactions between hydrogen-dominated atmospheres and possibly underlying magma oceans with various redox states. Recent models have predicted monosilane (SiH$_4$) as a potential atmospheric species derived from magma oceans in sub-Neptunes, but suggested that it is highly depleted in the observable atmospheric layers. Here, we propose that SiH$_4$ can persist throughout the atmospheres of sub-Neptunes with FeO-free reduced magma oceans by considering the dissolution of H$_2$O into the magma oceans, a factor not accounted for in previous models. We construct a one-dimensional atmospheric model to simulate the chemical equilibrium composition of hydrogen-dominated atmospheres overlying FeO-free magma oceans, incorporating H-O-Si chemistry. Our results show that the dissolution of H$_2$O enhances the SiH$_4$ molar fraction to levels of 0.1--10~\%, preventing it from reverting to silicates in the upper atmospheric layers. We find that SiH$_4$-rich atmospheres can exist across a broad parameter space with ground temperatures of 2000--6000~K and hydrogen pressures of 10$^2$--10$^5$~bar. We discuss that SiH$_4$-rich atmospheres could contain the other silanes but lack C-/N-/O-bearing species. The detection of SiH$_4$ in future observations of sub-Neptunes would provide compelling evidence for the presence of a rocky core with a reduced magma ocean. However, the accuracy of our model is limited by the lack of data on the non-ideal behavior and radiative properties of SiH$_4$, highlighting the need for further numerical and laboratory investigations.

 - **Abstract**
 The study of cyclic hydrocarbons is of utmost relevance in current astrochemical research, as they are considered to be among the most significant reservoirs of carbon in the interstellar medium. However, while unsaturated cyclic hydrocarbons with three, five, and six carbon atoms have been widely investigated, the highly strained antiaromatic cyclobutadiene, c-C4H4, still remains uncharted. Here, we employed high-level CCSD(T)-F12/cc-pVTZ-F12//B2PLYPD3/aug-cc-pVTZ theoretical calculations to analyze whether the cyano (CN), ethynyl (CCH), and hydroxy (OH) derivatives of c-C4H4 and its structural isomers butatriene (H2CCCCH2) and vinylacetylene (H2CCHCCH) can readily form via the gas-phase reaction: C4H4 + X -> C4H3X + H (where X = CN, CCH, and OH). For each system, we thoroughly explored the corresponding potential energy surfaces, identifying their critical points to enable a detailed analysis of the thermochemistry. Hence, we found various exothermic pathways for the formation of CN and CCH derivatives of butatriene and vinylacetylene, with no net activation barriers, while the formation of the OH derivatives is in general less favorable. Prior to the mechanistic study, we also analyzed the complete conformational panorama and stability of all the derivatives at the CCSD(T)-F12/cc-pVTZ-F12 level. Overall, c-C4H3CN and c-C4H3CCH emerge as particularly promising candidates for interstellar detection, provided that the parental c-C4H4 is present in the gas phase. These findings highlight the potential for detecting polar derivatives of c-C4H4 as indirect evidence of its presence in the ISM, as it appears to be "invisible" to radioastronomical observations. Also, this study underscores the need for future laboratory and theoretical efforts to characterize the spectroscopic properties of the proposed derivatives, paving the way for their eventual identification in space.

 - **Abstract**
 Satellites around large asteroids are preferentially found among those with the most rapid rotation and elongated shape. The taxonomic statistics are similarly skewed; in total, 13 asteroids larger than 100 km are known to have satellites, but none have been discovered among S-type asteroids. Previous modeling suggests that satellites could be generated by impacts, but spin and shape have never been tracked in models to relate collisional circumstances with those two observed properties concerning the primary. Here we show, by combining simulations of impacts into porous low-density asteroids, their subsequent disruption, reaccumulation and long-term satellite stability, a direct pathway for the formation of satellites. The immediate distortion and elongation of a rotating target body provides a launching point for some debris distinct from simple ballistic ejecta trajectories. The debris that are found to originate from the distorted long-axis is sourced primarily from 10-20 km below the surface and can be placed directly onto eccentric orbits with sufficiently large pericenter distances that avoid rapid re-impact. The specific energy and resultant total mass loss in satellite-forming collisions are not constraining, which explains the observed lack of correlation between asteroids with satellites and those that are part of large asteroid families.

 - **Abstract**
 This study presents a prototype D-band waveguide orthomode transducer (OMT) fabricated using chemically etched brass platelets. This method offers a fast, cost-effective, and scalable approach for producing waveguide OMTs above 100 GHz, making it well-suited for current and future Cosmic Microwave Background polarization experiments, where large focal planes with thousands of receivers are required to detect the faint primordial \textit{B}-modes. Chemical etching has already demonstrated its effectiveness in manufacturing corrugated feedhorn arrays with state-of-the-art performance up to 150 GHz. Here, we evaluate its applicability to more complex structures, such as OMTs. We designed a single OMT prototype operating in the 130-170 GHz range, fabricated by chemically etching 0.15 mm-thick brass plates, which were then stacked, aligned, and mechanically clamped. Simulations based on metrological measurements of the OMT profile predict return losses below $-$10 dB, isolation better than $-$30 dB, and transmission around $-$0.5 dB. The measured transmission and isolation, however, is around $-$1.5/$-$2 dB and $<-$20 dB, respectively. Further simulations show that the degradation in the transmission is related to defects and roughness along the etched profile ($\mathrm{RMS}\simeq$3 $\mu$m), which is a typical and unavoidable effect of chemical etching. The discrepancy in isolation, instead, could arise from a slight rotation ($\sim$3$^{\circ}$) of the polarization angle within the measurement chain. Our results show that chemical etching is a fast, low-cost, and scalable technique for producing waveguide OMTs with state-of-the-art performance in terms of return loss and isolation. However, at frequencies above 100 GHz the transmission coefficient may degrade due to the mechanical precision limitations of chemical etching.

 - **Abstract**
 Using observations from GMRT and FAST, we conducted multi-wavelength studies on PSR J1948+3540 and analyzed its intensity modulation characteristics in detail. We found that the intensity modulation of this pulsar exhibits broad low-frequency modulation features. The modulation frequency/period is time-dependent, but the dominant modulation component varies with the observing frequency. Specifically, at low frequencies, the modulation is dominated by the first half of the middle component, while at high frequencies, it is dominated by the second half of the middle component. Spectral analysis revealed that the intensities of the leading and trailing components vary with the observing frequency, but the middle component does not change significantly. Besides, the polarization analyses reveal that the peak of the radiation intensity is located in the latter half of the middle component, whereas the linear polarization is dominant in the former half. However, due to the low degree of linear polarization, the change of the dominant modulation component with the observed frequency is not caused by the variation in linear polarization. The phenomenon of the dominant modulation component varying with observing frequency has not been reported before and remains difficult to understand within the current theoretical framework.

 We present the result of a proof-of-concept simulation designed to classify LEO satellites based on their occultations of background stars. We generate satellite shapes drawn from two broad shape classes, 'boxwing' and 'square'. We then simulate the resulting occultation photometry that would be caused by these satellites orbiting in LEO and intersecting with background stars. The resulting data is then inverted to attempt to recover the input shape and classify the satellite correctly. We find that the technique is theoretically sound, but ambitious with current telescope capabilities. We construct an equation for the required success rate of the method, as a function of exposure time and density of background stars. We find that successful classification requires short exposure times and high background stellar densities. For success rates in excess of 75%, we find a required exposure time of $\sim2.0\times10^{-3}$s, and $\sim500$ stars along the satellites path. Results are presented in terms of these two key parameters, and are discussed in the context of current observational capabilities and alternative satellite characterisation methods.

          A generalised non-linear reconstructor for all Fourier-type wavefront sensors

 - **Abstract**
 State-of-the-art adaptive optics (AO) systems perform non-linear Fourier-type wavefront sensing for real-time corrections of dynamic wavefront aberrations. This general class of sensors uses a filtering mask in the focal plane that converts phase fluctuations of the incoming light into intensity variations in the subsequent pupil plane. Due to their high sensitivity, Fourier-type wavefront sensors (WFSs) are the sensors of choice for many current and upcoming AO systems in ophthalmic imaging, free-space optical communications (FSOC) and astronomical ground-based telescopes such as the forthcoming generation of extremely large telescopes (ELTs). Conventionally, linear methods, like a matrix-vector-multiplication (MVM), are used for the inversion of Fourier-type WFSs. However, their non-linear behavior gives rise to severe performance degradations when significant channel perturbations are observed. They are expected to occur during strong atmospheric turbulence conditions, which are commonplace for non-rural sites and daytime observations. This study presents a novel type of iterative reconstructor to overcome non-linear wavefront sensing regimes. The underlying method is the non-linear Landweber iteration with Nesterov acceleration, well known in the field of inverse problems. A significant advantage of the new approach is its direct applicability to any Fourier-type WFS. This is implemented by adapting the filtering mask of the specific Fourier-type WFSs in the model-based algorithm. Several Fourier-type wavefront sensors are considered for ELT-scale instruments and their performance with the new algorithm is compared. The study goes on to concentrate on the pyramid wavefront sensor (PWFS), one of the most well-known Fourier-type WFSs. We demonstrate in end-to-end simulations that this novel approach outperforms linear methods in non-linear sensing regimes.

 - **Abstract**
 Deuterated molecules can be used to study the physical conditions and the astro-chemical evolution of molecular clouds. large-sample surveys for deuterated molecules are needed to understand the enhancement of deuterated molecules from diffuse molecular gas to cold cores. A single-pointing survey toward the 559 Planck cold clumps of the Early Cold Core Catalogue (ECC) has been conducted using the Arizona Radio Observatory 12-meter telescope, focusing on the $J$=1-0 transitions of DCO$^+$ and DCN. The survey included observations of 309 cores for DCO$^+$ and DCN 1-0 simultaneously, followed by 71 of these cores where DCO$^+$ 1-0 was detected for H$^{13}$CO$^+$ and H$^{13}$CN 1-0 simultaneously, aiming to determine the deuterated fraction ($D_{\rm frac}$). Additionally, 250 cores were observed for DCO$^+$, DCN, H$^{13}$CO$^+$ and H$^{13}$CN 1-0 simultaneously. Among the 309 sources, DCO$^+$ and DCN 1-0 were detected in 79 and 11 sources, with a detection rates of 25.6 % and 3.6 % respectively. In the 250 sources observed for all four species, DCO$^+$, DCN, H$^{13}$CO$^+$ and H$^{13}$CN 1-0 were detected in 58, 9, 57 and 13 sources, with a detection rate of 23.2 %, 3.6 %, 22.8 % and 5.2 % respectively. The $D_{\rm frac}$(HCO$^+$) values in 112 sources range from 0.89 % to 7.4 % with a median value of 3.1 %, while $D_{\rm frac}$(HCN) values in 11 sources range from 1.5 % to 5.5 % with a median value of 2.3 %. The line widths of DCO$^+$ and H$^{13}$CO$^+$ 1-0 detections are mostly within 1 km s$^{-1}$. The similarity in $D_{\rm frac}$ values between HCO$^+$ and HCN indicates that the higher detection rate of DCO$^+$ 1-0 compared with DCN 1-0 is due to the lower critical density of DCO$^+$ 1-0. We suggest that the enhancement of DCO$^+$ and DCN likely begins in the early diffuse stage of the molecular cloud, rather than during the cold core formation stage.

 - **Abstract**
 This study employs stellar parameters from spectroscopic surveys and Zhang et al. based on Gaia XP spectra, along with photometric data from GALEX, UVOT, and Gaia, to obtain extensive ultraviolet color excess information for the relevant bands of GALEX and UVOT. By considering the impact of stellar parameters (\teff, \feh, and \logg) on intrinsic color indices, and utilizing the blue-edge method combined with a random forest algorithm, an empirical relationship between stellar parameters and intrinsic ultraviolet color indices is established. By combining observed color indices, the study derives color excesses for 11,624,802 and 65,531 stars in the GALEX/near-UV and far-UV bands, and 336,633, 137,739, and 253,271 stars in the UVOT/\uvwa, \uvmb, and \uvwb\ bands, constructing corresponding ultraviolet extinction maps. Notably, the color excess data for the GALEX/near-UV band shows a tenfold increase from previous results, with the extinction map covering approximately two-thirds of the sky at a resolution of 0.4$^{\circ}$. The typical uncertainties in the ultraviolet color excesses are 0.21 mag, 0.30 mag, 0.19 mag, 0.24 mag, and 0.21 mag for \enb, \efb, \ewab, \embb, and \ewbb, respectively. By comparing the spatial distributions of \rv\ derived from ultraviolet and Gaia optical band measurements with those obtained from infrared and optical data in previous works, it is evident that the \rv\ distributions based on the ultraviolet data show noticeable differences, with some regions even exhibiting opposite trends. This suggests that a single-parameter \rv\ extinction law may not be sufficient to simultaneously characterize the extinction behavior across infrared, optical, and ultraviolet bands.

 - **Abstract**
 Aiming at a general description of four basic solutions describing the accretion processes, i.e., the Shakura-Sunyaev thin disc (SSD), the Shapiro-Lightman-Eardley solution (SLE), the slim disc, and the advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF), we present generalized axisymmetric height-averaged equations, where the entropy advection, the radiation pressure, and photon trapping effect are all included self-consistently. Our generalized solution can reproduce the ADAF, SLE, SSD, and slim disc branches in a wide range of accretion rates from sub- to super-Eddington accretion. An S-curve in the $\dot{m}-\Sigma$ plane is also reproduced, representing the SSD branch, the radiation-pressure-dominant branch, and the slim disc branch. The solution gives a natural transition between SSD and slim disc when photon trapping occurs in the accretion flow, producing a radially hybrid SSD-slim disc structure in a certain range of accretion rates. The coexistence of ADAF and SSD below a critical accretion rate is clearly shown with distinct advection fraction of accretion energy. We also present the luminosity, radiation efficiency, and spectrum from the generalized solutions for a large range of accretion rates in stellar mass black holes.

 - **Abstract**
 We measure the true obliquity of TOI-2364, a K dwarf with a sub-Saturn-mass ($M_p = 0.18\,M_J$) transiting planet on the upper edge of the hot Neptune desert. We used new Rossiter-McLaughlin observations gathered with the Keck Planet Finder to measure the sky-projected obliquity $\lambda = 7$$^\circ$$^{+10^\circ}_{-11^\circ}$. Combined with a stellar rotation period of $23.47\pm0.29$ days measured with photometry from the Tierras Observatory, this yields a stellar inclination of $90^{\circ} \pm 13^{\circ}$ and a true obliquity $\psi = 15.6$$^\circ$$^{+7.7^\circ}_{-7.3^\circ}$, indicating that the planet's orbit is well aligned with the rotation axis of its host star. The determination of $\psi$ is important for investigating a potential bimodality in the orbits of short-period sub-Saturns around cool stars, which tend to be either aligned with or perpendicular to their host stars' spin axes.

 - **Abstract**
 High-amplitude $\delta$ Scuti stars (HADS) that pulsate in their first three radial modes are rare in current samples. Here, we analyse five such triple-mode HADS observed by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) and report that the previously considered second overtone mode ($f_2$) is actually the non-radial component of a resonating integration mode (RI mode, resulting from resonance between a radial p-mode and a non-radial p-g mixed mode), which shows significant amplitude and frequency variations over short timescales (approximately 20 days). This RI mode appears to be widespread among these stars. Notably, all five stars are in the post-main sequence evolutionary phase, actively crossing the Hertzsprung gap. These stars offer valuable insights into stellar evolution during the Hertzsprung gap, which is one of the most rapid evolutionary stages in a star's life.

 - **Abstract**
 The extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) brightenings identified by Solar Orbiter, commonly known as campfires, are the smallest transient brightenings detected to date outside active regions in the solar corona. We investigate the spatio-temporal distribution of a large ensemble of the finest-scale EUV transient brightenings observed by the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) aboard Solar Orbiter. We perform a statistical analysis of the EUV brightenings by using quiet-Sun observations at the highest possible spatial resolution ever obtained by EUI. We use observations in the 17.4 nm passband of the High Resolution EUV Imager (HRIEUV) of EUI acquired during the closest perihelia of Solar Orbiter in 2022 and 2023. Solar Orbiter being at a distance 0.293 AU from the Sun, these observations have an exceptionally high image scale of 105 km, recorded at a fast cadence of 3 seconds. We use a wavelet-based automatic detection algorithm to detect and characterise the events of interest, and study their morphological and photometrical properties. We report the detection of smallest and shortest lived EUV brightenings to date in the quiet-Sun. The size and lifetime of the detected EUV brightenings appear power-law distributed down to a size of 0.01 Mm$^{2}$ and a lifetime of 3 seconds. In general their sizes lie in the range of 0.01 Mm$^{2}$ to 50 Mm$^{2}$ , and their lifetimes vary between 3 seconds and 40 minutes. We find an increasingly high number of EUV brightenings at smaller spatial and temporal scales. We estimate that about 3600 EUV brightenings appear per second on the whole Sun. The HRIEUV brightenings thus represent the most prevalent, localised and finest-scale transient EUV brightenings in the quiet regions of the solar corona.

 - **Abstract**
 The TRAPPIST-1 planetary system is observationally favorable for studying if planets orbiting M stars can retain atmospheres and host habitable conditions. Recent JWST secondary eclipse observations of TRAPPIST-1 c rule out a thick \ch{CO2} atmosphere but do not rule out atmospheric water vapor or its photochemical product, oxygen. Given the high expected escape rate, maintenance of atmospheric water vapor would require a present-day water source, such as volcanic outgassing. Here, we simulate water outgassing on the TRAPPIST-1 planets over a broad phase space based on solar system terrestrial bodies. We then apply two filters based on observation and geochemistry that narrow this phase space and constrain the plausible outgassing scenarios. For all seven TRAPPIST-1 planets, we find that the water outgassing rate is most likely $\sim$0.03x Earth's but has upper limits of $\sim$8x Earth's. The allowed range also implies low, Mars-like magma emplacement rates and relatively dry, Earth-like mantles, although mantle water mass fractions up to 1 wt\% are possible. We also present scenarios with magma emplacement rates similar to Mars, Earth, and Io, resulting in different preferred mantle water content and outgassing rates. We find that water outgassing rates are potentially high enough to balance water escape rates, providing a theoretical pathway for the TRAPPIST-1 planets to maintain surface water or water-vapor-containing atmospheres over long timescales. The bounds on outgassing rates and interior properties can be used in atmospheric chemistry and escape models to contextualize future observations of the TRAPPIST-1 planets, and may be applicable to other terrestrial exoplanets.

 - **Abstract**
 We present results from a large spectroscopic survey of the nearest young association to the Sun, Upper Scorpius, conducted using 2dF/HERMES on the Anglo-Australian Telescope. We use spectroscopic youth criteria such as Li-equivalent widths to identify >1000 pre-main sequence (PMS) members across the region and measure radial velocities, combining these with Gaia EDR3 5-parameter astrometry to obtain 6D kinematic information. We separate confirmed PMS association members into distinct kinematic groups and measure expansion and rotation trends in each. We find strong evidence for asymmetric expansion in several groups and derive expansion timescales from the greatest rates of expansion in each group. We also trace the past motion of these groups using an epicycle approximation and estimate the time since their most compact configuration. These kinematic properties are compared to literature ages and the star formation history of Upper Scorpius is discussed. We find evidence that a scenario in which star formation in the subgroups of Upper Scorpius proceeded independently, either by self-instability or external feedback from Upper Centaurus-Lupus, is more likely than a recently proposed "cluster chain" scenario in which these subgroups have triggered each other.

          Effects of transient stellar emissions on planetary climates of tidally-locked exo-earths

 - **Abstract**
 Space weather events in planetary environments sourced from transient host star emissions, including stellar flares, coronal mass ejections, and stellar proton events, can substantially influence an exoplanet's climate and atmospheric evolution history. These time-dependent events may also affect our ability to measure and interpret its properties by modulating reservoirs of key chemical compounds and changing the atmosphere's brightness temperature. The majority of previous work focusing on photochemical effects used single-column models. Here, using three-dimensional (3D) general circulation models with interactive photochemistry, we simulate the climate and chemical impacts of stellar flare-sourced energetic particle precipitation. We examine their effects on synchronously rotating TRAPPIST-1e-like planets on a range of spatiotemporal scales. We find that sudden thermospheric cooling is associated with radiative cooling of NO and CO$_2$, and middle-to-lower atmospheric warming is associated with transient increases in infrared absorbers such as N$_2$O and H$_2$O. In certain regimes, these temperature changes are strongly affected by O$_3$ variability depending on the flare's spectral shape and energy. However, the role of O$_3$ in temperature change is reduced in the most extreme flaring scenarios explored in our simulations. In addition to effects on planetary climate and atmospheric chemistry, we also find that intense flares can energize the middle atmosphere, causing enhancements in wind velocities up to 40 m s$^{-1}$ in sub-stellar night-sides between 30 and 50 km in altitude. Our results suggest that successive, energetic eruptive events from younger stars may be pivotal factors in determining the atmosphere dynamics of their planets.

          Impact of Galactic non-Gaussian foregrounds on CMB lensing measurements

 - **Abstract**
 Weak gravitational lensing of the CMB has been established as a robust and powerful observable for precision cosmology. However, the impact of Galactic foregrounds, which has been studied less extensively than many other potential systematics, could in principle pose a problem for CMB lensing measurements. These foregrounds are inherently non-Gaussian and hence might mimic the characteristic signal that lensing estimators are designed to measure. We present an analysis that quantifies the level of contamination from Galactic dust in lensing measurements, focusing particularly on measurements with the Atacama Cosmology Telescope and the Simons Observatory. We employ a whole suite of foreground models and study the contamination of lensing measurements with both individual frequency channels and multifrequency combinations. We test the sensitivity of different estimators to the level of foreground non-Gaussianity, and the dependence on sky fraction and multipole range used. We find that Galactic foregrounds do not present a problem for the Atacama Cosmology Telescope experiment (the bias in the inferred CMB lensing power spectrum amplitude remains below $0.3\sigma$). For Simons Observatory, not all foreground models remain below this threshold. Although our results are conservative upper limits, they suggest that further work on characterizing dust biases and determining the impact of mitigation methods is well motivated, especially for the largest sky fractions.

          The Impact of External Radiation on the Inner Disk Chemistry of Planet Formation

 - **Abstract**
 The vast majority of young stars hosting planet-forming disks exist within clustered environments, like the Orion Nebula, implying that seemingly `extreme' UV environments (10^4 G_0 and above) are not so atypical in the context of planet formation. Using thermo-chemical modeling, we explore how the temperature and chemistry within a protoplanetary disk around a T Tauri star is impacted by the surrounding UV environment. The disk becomes hotter due to heating by photodissociation of molecules, photoelectric heating, H_2, and atomic processes and as a result the area in which molecules exist in the ice-phase shrinks, being pushed both downward and inward. Beyond 1AU the chemistry changes most significantly in a UV-rich background; the atmosphere becomes more H2O, OH, and atomic-rich. Hydrocarbons, however, reside primarily well within 1AU of the disk, thus their abundance and distribution is not impacted by the UV field, up to a 10^6 G0. The products of photodissociation and photochemistry are formed deeper into the disk with increasing UV background field strength beyond 1AU, impacting the chemistry near the midplane. Effectively a `reset' chemistry takes place, with an enhancement of atoms, simple molecules, and molecules in the gas-phase. Planets that form in highly irradiated regions will be exposed to a different chemical reservoir in the gas and ice-phases than that in an isolated disk, and the impact from the UV background should only be detectable in highly irradiated disks (~10^6 G_0).

 - **Abstract**
 The intense stellar irradiation of ultra-hot Jupiters results in some of the most extreme atmospheric environments in the planetary regime. On their daysides, temperatures can be sufficiently high for key atmospheric constituents to thermally dissociate into simpler molecular species and atoms. This dissociation drastically changes the atmospheric opacities and, in turn, critically alters the temperature structure, atmospheric dynamics, and day-night heat transport. To this date, however, simultaneous detections of the dissociating species and their thermally dissociation products in exoplanet atmospheres have remained rare. Here we present the simultaneous detections of H$_2$O and its thermally dissociation product OH on the dayside of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-121 b based on high-resolution emission spectroscopy with the recently commissioned Near InfraRed Planet Searcher (NIRPS). We retrieve a photospheric abundance ratio of log$_{10}$(OH/H$_2$O) $= -0.15\pm{0.20}$ indicating that there is about as much OH as H$_2$O at photospheric pressures, which confirms predictions from chemical equilibrium models. We compare the dissociation on WASP-121 b with other ultra-hot Jupiters and show that a trend in agreement with equilibrium models arises. We also discuss an apparent velocity shift of $4.79^{+0.93}_{-0.97} $km s$^{-1}$ in the H$_2$O signal, which is not reproduced by current global circulation models. Finally, in addition to H$_2$O and OH, the NIRPS data reveal evidence of Fe and Mg, from which we infer a Fe/Mg ratio consistent with the solar and host star ratios. Our results demonstrate that NIRPS can be an excellent instrument to obtain simultaneous measurements of refractory and volatile molecular species, paving the way for many future studies on the atmospheric composition, chemistry, and the formation history of close-in exoplanets.

 - **Abstract**
 We present new photometric observations of the core-collapse supernova SN 2023ixf occurred in M101, taken with the RC80 and BRC80 robotic telescopes in Hungary. The initial nickel mass from the late-phase bolometric light curve extending up to 400 days after explosion, is inferred as $M_{\rm Ni} = 0.046 \pm 0.007$ M$_\odot$. The comparison of the bolometric light curve with models from hydrodynamical simulations as well as semi-analytic radiative diffusion codes reveals a relatively low-mass ejecta of $M_{\rm ej} \lesssim 9$ M$_\odot$, contrary to SN~2017eaw, another H-rich core-collapse event, which had $M_{\rm ej} \gtrsim 15$ M$_\odot$.

          Role of CME clusters and CME-CME interactions in producing sustained $γ$-ray emission

 - **Abstract**
 Fast (V$_{\rm CME}$>1000${\rm \,km\,s^{-1}}$) coronal mass ejections (CMEs) capable of accelerating protons beyond 300MeV are thought to trigger hours-long sustained $\gamma$-ray emission (SGRE) after the impulsive flare phase. Meanwhile, CME-CME interactions can cause enhanced proton acceleration, increasing the fluxes of solar energetic particles. This study explores the role of fast CME interactions in SGRE production during CME clusters, which we define as a series of CMEs linked to >C-class flares with waiting times <$\,$1$\,$day from the same active region (AR). We focus on clusters in major CME-productive ARs (major ARs), by defining a major AR as one that produced >$\,$1 CME-associated major (>M-class) flare. The study identified 76 major ARs between 2011 and 2019, of which 12 produced all SGRE events. SGRE-producing ARs exhibit higher median values for the speed of their fastest CMEs (2013 vs. 775${\rm \,km\,s^{-1}}$) and the class of their strongest flares (X1.8 vs. M5.8), compared to SGRE-lacking ARs. They also produced relatively faster CMEs (median speed: 1418 vs. 1206.5${\rm \,km\,s^{-1}}$), with the SGRE-associated CMEs occurring during periods of higher CME rates than typical fast CME epochs. Twelve of 22 (54.5%) SGRE events and 5 of 7 (71.4%) long-duration (>$10\,$h) SGRE events occurred during CME clusters, with high chances of CME-CME interactions. A case study on very active major ARs showed that all SGRE-associated CMEs with V$_{\rm CME}\lesssim$ 2000${\rm \,km\,s^{-1}}$ underwent CME-CME interactions within 10$\,$R$_\odot$, while SGRE-associated CMEs faster than 3000${\rm \,km\,s^{-1}}$ did not undergo interactions.

          Millisecond Pulsars in M2: New discoveries and a detailed timing analysis

 - **Abstract**
 Globular clusters (GCs) offer a unique environment for discovering and studying millisecond pulsars. In this paper, we present a multi-epoch search and detailed timing analysis of millisecond pulsars in the GC M2, using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope. We have discovered two new binary millisecond pulsars in M2, designated M2F and M2G, respectively. We provide measurements of the emission properties of all known pulsars in M2, including their polarization profiles, rotation measures, flux densities, scintillation characteristics, and so forth. In particular, we report the first rotation measure at the distance and direction of this cluster. Additionally, we report the first phase-coherent timing solutions for the M2 pulsars. From our Bayesian timing analysis, we have measured their spin and orbital parameters with high precision, including the advance of periastron for M2A and M2E indicating total system masses of 1.75(13) and 1.80(5) solar masses respectively. Using archival data from the Hubble Space Telescope, we have identified an optical counterpart of M2C, which is likely the white dwarf companion of the pulsar. By combining results from optical and radio observations, we have reconstructed the binary evolution track of this system and estimated the cooling age of the companion to be approximately 10\,Myr, making it the youngest white dwarf in any known GC binary pulsars. Furthermore, using the spin period derivatives of M2 pulsars, we have investigated the gravitational potential of the cluster and found that our results strongly support the latest central-stellar-velocity dispersion measurement in M2.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a suite of dynamical simulations designed to explore the orbital and accretion properties of compact (2--7 AU) symbiotic systems, focusing on wind accretion, drag forces, and tidal interactions. Using three levels of physical complexity, we model systems of accreting white dwarfs (WDs) with masses of 0.7, 1.0, and 1.2 M$_\odot$ orbiting evolving Solar-like stars with 1, 2, and 3 M$_\odot$. We show that systems alternate between standard wind accretion and Wind Roche Lobe Overflow (WRLO) regimes during periods of high mass-loss rate experienced by the donor star (the peak of red giant phase and/or thermal pulses). For some configurations, the standard wind accretion has mass accretion efficiencies similar to those obtained by WRLO regime. Tidal forces play a key role in compact systems, leading to orbital shrinkage and enhanced accretion efficiency. We find that systems with high-mass WDs ($\geq 1$ M$_\odot$) and massive donors (2--3 M$_\odot$) are the only ones to reach the Chandrasekhar limit. Interestingly, the majority of our simulations reach the Roche lobe overflow condition that is not further simulated given the need of more complex hydrodynamical simulations. Our analysis shows that increasing physical realism, by including drag and tides, systematically leads to more compact final orbital configurations. Comparison with compact known symbiotic systems seems to suggest that they are very likely experiencing orbital decay produced by tidal forces.

          From Theory to Forecast: Neutrino Mass Effects on Mode-Coupling Kernels and Their Observational Implications

 - **Abstract**
 We present an analytical expression that gives both the matter and tracer (halo or galaxy) power spectrum with 1-loop corrections that include the neutrino effects on the mode coupling kernels. We use the FFTLog algorithm to accelerate calculating the higher-order corrections to the power spectrum. We then use our power spectrum and bispectrum models to pursue two main goals. First, we examine the impact of neutrino mass on cosmological parameter estimation from both the power spectrum and bispectrum in real space. We create 1-loop power spectrum and bispectrum templates in real-space and fit to the \texttt{Quijote} simulation suite, including the cross-covariance between the power spectrum and the bispectrum. We show the neutrino signature kernels estimate the same cosmological parameters as the model with the SPT (Standard Perturbation Theory) kernels, even for DESI Year 5 volume, except for the galaxy bias parameters inferred from the bispectrum. Second, we investigate to what extent the bispectrum can improve parameter constraints. We perform a Fisher forecast using the power spectrum, the tree-level bispectrum, and a joint analysis that includes the cross-covariance between them. We show that including the bispectrum can substantially reduce the error bars on key parameters. For the neutrino mass in particular, the uncertainty is reduced by $\sim 20\%$

 - **Abstract**
 N-Point Correlation Functions, usually with N = 2, 3, and their Fourier-space analogs power spectrum and bispectrum, are major tools used in cosmology to capture the clustering of large-scale structure. We outline how the clustering these functions capture emerges, explain that inflation produces a 2PCF or power spectrum but that subsequent evolution eventually produces a 3PCF or bispectrum, and beyond (and that inflation may do so as well at some level). Furthermore, in principle the Universe also has a 4PCF or trispectrum, and even clustering beyond. For each of these tools, we discuss the motivation, the practical details of how they are estimated, the current algorithms used to compute them, the theory behind them, and recent applications to data. Throughout, we focus on positioning the reader to find and apply these algorithms with some understanding, linking to public code for each algorithm to the fullest extent possible.

          Analytical estimates for heliocentric escape of satellite ejecta

 - **Abstract**
 We present a general analytic framework to assess whether impact ejecta launched from the surface of a satellite can escape the gravitational influence of the planet--satellite system and enter heliocentric orbit. Using a patched-conic approach and defining the transition to planetocentric space via the Hill sphere or sphere of influence, we derive thresholds for escape in terms of the satellite-to-planet mass ratio and the ratio of the satellite's orbital speed to its escape speed. We identify three dynamical regimes for ejecta based on residual speed and launch direction. We complement this analysis with the circular restricted three-body problem (CR3BP), deriving a necessary escape condition from the Jacobi integral at $\mathrm{L_{2}}$ and showing that it is consistent with the patched-conic thresholds. Applying our model to the Earth--Moon system reveals that all three outcomes--bound, conditional, and unbound--are accessible within a narrow range of launch speeds. This behavior is not found in other planetary satellite systems, but may occur in some binary asteroids. The framework also shows that the Moon's tidal migration has not altered its propensity to produce escaping ejecta, reinforcing the plausibility of a lunar origin for some near-Earth asteroids.

 - **Abstract**
 {The multiple outburst events of comet 12P/Pons-Brooks during its 2024 apparition offer a unique window into highly-active volatile releasing processes not observable during quiescent periods. We performed radio observations of comet 12P/Pons-Brooks with the Tianma-65m radio telescope, targeting the OH and NH$_3$ inversion lines at 18-cm and 1.3-cm, respectively. By monitoring 12P at different heliocentric distances on its inbound journey, we aim to provide insights into the comet's volatile composition and outburst behavior. Four observations were carried out between December 2023 and March 2024 when the comet was approaching the Sun from 2.22 AU to 1.18 AU. We conducted 18-cm OH lines observations on 4 single days using the cryogenically cooled receiver system of the telescope to derive $\rm H_{2}O$ production rate. During 12P's outburst on December 14, we also conducted observations targeting the $\rm NH_{3}$ emission. OH 18-cm lines were clearly detected with a signal-to-noise ratio of $\sim$4$\sigma$ (peak intensity). A tentative detection of $\rm NH_{3}$ was made at the $\sim$$3\sigma$ level during the outburst phase, but the detection needs to be further verified. Our observations provide information on the outgassing behavior of 12P/Pons-Brooks during its 2024 apparition. The water production rate of 12P, derived from the 18-cm OH lines is consistent with measurements obtained in other works. The possible detection of $\rm NH_{3}$ during an outburst suggests possible connections between subsurface volatile reservoir and the outburst mechanism. These results could further our understanding of the composition and activity of Halley-type comets.

          Planets Around Solar Twins/Analogs (PASTA) II: chemical abundances, systematic offsets, and clues to planet formation

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Previous studies have suggested that the Sun is relatively depleted in refractory elements compared to other solar twins or analogs, potentially as a result of planet formation. However, such conclusions are often limited by inhomogeneous samples and a lack of direct comparison with stars known to host planets. Aims. We aim to perform a homogeneous and precise abundance analysis of solar twins and analogs that host planets, to investigate possible chemical signatures associated with planet formation. Methods. We obtain high-resolution, high signal-to-noise ratio Magellan/MIKE spectra for 25 solar-like stars, including 22 confirmed or candidate planet hosts and three comparison stars. Stellar parameters and elemental abundances for 23 elements (from C to Eu) are derived through a strict line-by-line differential analysis relative to the Sun. Results. Our sample spans [Fe/H] = -0.23 to +0.18 dex and includes 20 solar analogs, six of which are solar twins. Typical abundance uncertainties range from 0.01 to 0.05 dex for lighter elements (e.g., Fe, Si, C, O, Na) and up to 0.1 dex for neutron-capture elements. The Sun is consistently depleted in refractory elements relative to all solar analogs and twins, regardless of planet type. Stars hosting small planets tentatively show slightly stronger refractory element depletion than those hosting giant planets, though the difference is not yet statistically significant. Conclusions. We emphasize the need for strictly differential, line-by-line analyses relative to the Sun, as well as careful consideration of systematic differences between instruments, to ensure consistency and the homogeneity required to achieve our goals.

 - **Abstract**
 A search has been carried out for the pulsar J0311+1402, which has a period of $P = 40.9$ s, in the data archive of the Large Phased Array (LPA) radio telescope. When searching using fast folding algorithm (FFA), periodic pulsar radiation at a frequency of 111 MHz was not detected. In 3321 observation sessions lasting 5 minutes, 35 strong pulses were detected with a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) greater than 10. Some of the pulses have a complex multi-peak structure consisting of narrow details, while some of the pulses are single-component. The peak flux densities of the details of these strong pulses range from 2 to 11 Jy. The peak value ($S_{\rm p} = 2$\,Jy) and the integral ($S_{\rm i} = 7$\,mJy) flux density in the average profile were obtained from the strong pulses. It is shown that pulsar pulses in the meter-wavelength range arrive sporadically, and the pulsar is similar in its properties to a rotating radio transient (RRAT). The pulsar has the minimal dispersion measure, the minimal distance from the Sun, and the minimal pseudo-luminosity of all known pulsars. Pulsar timing made it possible to improve the previously obtained value of the period ($P$) and to estimate the period derivative ($\dot P$). In the dependency of timing residuals (TRs) from the times of arrival (TOA) of pulses discontinuities are visible, when no pulses were observed. The duration of these breaks can be hundreds of days.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we investigate the inflationary phenomenology of parity-violating (PV) extensions of symmetric teleparallel gravity by applying this PV gravity theory to axion inflation. The presence of PV terms induces velocity birefringence in the tensor perturbations. During inflation, when the inflaton rapidly traverses the cliff-like region in its potential, the tensor modes at specific scales for one of the two circular polarization states undergo significant amplification due to tachyonic instability. Consequently, the resulting primordial gravitational waves (GWs), characterized by a one-handed polarization and a multi-peak structure in their energy spectrum, exhibit a significant amplitude potentially detectable by LISA and Taiji, and their chirality could be determined by the LISA-Taiji network. The detection of such a chiral GW signal provides an opportunity to probe inflation and PV gravity theory.

          Testing the Cosmic Distance Duality Relation with Neural Kernel Gaussian Process Regression

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we test the cosmic distance duality relation (CDDR) by combining Pantheon+ Type Ia supernova (SNe Ia) data and DESI DR2 baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements. To resolve the redshift mismatch between the two datasets, we develop a new method called Neural Kernel Gaussian Process Regression (NKGPR), which uses two neural networks to simultaneously learn the mean and kernel functions of a Gaussian process. This approach improves upon traditional Gaussian process regression by mitigating trend mismatches and removing the need for manual kernel selection. We investigate possible deviations from the CDDR by adopting three parameterizations of the deviation function and constrain the model-independent parameter $\eta_0$ through a marginalized likelihood analysis. Our results show no significant departure from the expected relation, confirming the consistency of the CDDR within current observational uncertainties.

 - **Abstract**
 Solar extreme ultraviolet (EUV) irradiance plays a crucial role in heating the Earth's ionosphere, thermosphere, and mesosphere, affecting atmospheric dynamics over varying time scales. Although significant effort has been spent studying short-term EUV variations from solar transient events, there is little work to explore the long-term evolution of the EUV flux over multiple solar cycles. Continuous EUV flux measurements have only been available since 1995, leaving significant gaps in earlier data. In this study, we propose a Bayesian deep learning model, named SEMNet, to fill the gaps. We validate our approach by applying SEMNet to construct SOHO/SEM EUV flux measurements in the period between 1998 and 2014 using CaII K images from the Precision Solar Photometric Telescope. We then extend SEMNet through transfer learning to reconstruct solar EUV irradiance in the period between 1950 and 1960 using CaII K images from the Kodaikanal Solar Observatory. Experimental results show that SEMNet provides reliable predictions along with uncertainty bounds, demonstrating the feasibility of CaII K images as a robust proxy for long-term EUV fluxes. These findings contribute to a better understanding of solar influences on Earth's climate over extended periods.

          A tunable Monte Carlo method for mixing correlated-k opacities. PRAS: polynomial reconstruction and sampling

 - **Abstract**
 Accurately accounting for mixed-gas opacities is critical for radiative-transfer (RT) calculations in sub-stellar atmospheres. To produce the total k-coefficients of an arbitrary mixture of gases and their associated volume mixing ratios (VMRs), several methods are applied in the literature with various levels of overall accuracy and ease of computation. We propose a simple, tunable random overlap method, polynomial reconstruction and sampling (PRAS). PRAS is a Monte Carlo-based technique, sampling polynomial approximations of the opacity cumulative distribution function (CDF) in a wavelength band for each species requiring mixing. The method enables control over the end accuracy of the opacity mixture through choices in CDF fitting and number of random samples used in the mixing scheme. We find PRAS is typically as accurate, or more accurate, than other methods at recovering individual, pre-mixed k-coefficients. In an emission spectrum comparison test, PRAS, even with a small number of samples (100), is within ~2% of the reference 16+16 Legendre quadrature node random overlap with resorting and rebinning (RORR) results, and is typically more accurate than the 4+4 and 8+8 Legendre node schemes. In the vertical flux and heating rate tests, we also find that PRAS is generally more accurate than other schemes, and an improvement over the adaptive equivalent extinction (AEE) method. Overall, our current tests show PRAS is a generally viable alternative for the calculation of randomly overlapped opacities, especially in scenarios where increased accuracy of the RT calculation is required and when larger numbers of quadrature points are used. PRAS may therefore provide a benefit in performance and accuracy for high-precision retrieval modelling of JWST data.

 - **Abstract**
 The hadron production in the simulation of extensive air showers is a long standing problem and the origin of large uncertainties in the reconstruction of the mass of the high energy primary cosmic rays. Hadronic interaction models re-tuned after early LHC data give more consistent results among each other compared to the first generation of models, but still can't reproduce extended air shower data (EAS) consistently resulting in the so-called "muon puzzle". Using more recent LHC data like in the QGSJET-III model improve further the description of EAS by such a model but is not enough to resolve the discrepancy. On the other hand, the EPOS project is a theoretical global approach aiming at describing data from very fundamental electron-positron interactions to central heavy ions collisions. We will demonstrate that this approach can provide new constraints, changing the correlation between the measured data at mid-rapidity and the predicted particle production at large rapidities, which drive the EAS development. Thus, using the same accelerator data, different predictions are obtained in air shower simulations in much better agreement with the current air shower data (for both the maximum shower development depth Xmax and the energy spectrum of the muons at ground). Using the EPOS LHC-R model, the detailed changes will be addressed and their consequences on EAS observable at various energies.

 - **Abstract**
 The air shower array Carpet-3 detected a 300 TeV photon from the direction of GRB 221009A at 4536 s after the Fermi-GBM trigger for this event. If the association with this gamma-ray burst is real, it poses two puzzles. First, why was this photon not absorbed by the extragalactic background light? ``New physics'' beyond the Standard Model is required to explain how it managed to reach Earth from a cosmological distance. Second, why was this photon detected when the VHE afterglow observed by LHAASO already faded? A novel astrophysical mechanism is required to explain this delay. In this work we show that Lorentz invariance violation (LIV), which arises as a low-energy limit of certain quantum gravity theories, can solve both puzzles. It shifts thresholds of particle interaction and changes the opacity of the extragalactic background, and cause energy-dependent variations of the photon velocity, which changes the photon time of flight. We investigate the LIV parameter space assuming that the 300 TeV photon is a part of the VHE afterglow detected by LHAASO in the TeV range. We identify viable solutions and place stringent two-sided constraints on the LIV energy scale required to resolve the observational puzzles. First-order LIV appears to be incompatible with the constraints set by analyzing the TeV afterglow of this GRB. Viable solutions emerge for higher orders. In particular, the commonly studied second-order subluminal LIV with $E_{\rm LIV2} = 1.30_{-0.35}^{+0.56} \times 10^{-7} E_{\rm Pl}$ (95.4% credibility level; $E_{\rm Pl}$ is the Planck energy) is consistent with all the observed data.

          The impact of organic hazes and graphite on the observation of CO2-rich sub-Neptune atmospheres

 - **Abstract**
 Many sub-Neptune and super-Earth exoplanets are expected to develop metal-enriched atmospheres due to atmospheric loss processes such as photoevaporation or core-powered mass loss. Thermochemical equilibrium calculations predict that at high metallicity and a temperature range of 300-700 K, CO2 becomes the dominant carbon species, and graphite may be the thermodynamically favored condensate under low-pressure conditions. Building on prior laboratory findings that such environments yield organic haze rather than graphite, we measured the transmittance spectra of organic haze analogues and graphite samples, and computed their optical constants across the measured wavelength range from 0.4 to 25 {\mu}m. The organic haze exhibits strong vibrational absorption bands, notably at 3.0, 4.5, and 6.0 {\mu}m, while graphite shows featureless broadband absorption. The derived optical constants of haze and graphite provide the first dataset for organic haze analogues formed in CO2-rich atmospheres and offer improved applicability over prior graphite data derived from bulk reflectance or ellipsometry. We implemented these optical constants into the Virga and PICASO cloud and radiative transfer models to simulate transit spectra for GJ 1214b. The synthetic spectra with organic hazes reproduce the muted spectral features in the NIR observed by Hubble and general trends observed by JWST for GJ 1214b, while graphite models yield flat spectra across the observed wavelengths. This suggests haze features may serve as observational markers of carbon-rich atmospheres, whereas graphite's opacity could lead to radius overestimation, offering a possible explanation for super-puff exoplanets. Our work supplies essential optical to infrared data for interpreting observations of CO2-rich exoplanet atmospheres.

 - **Abstract**
 We present ALMA observations of the Class 0 protostar IRAS 04166+2706, obtained as part of the ALMA large program Early Planet Formation in Embedded Disks (eDisk). These observations were made in the 1.3 mm dust continuum and molecular lines at angular resolutions of $\sim 0.05''$ ($\sim 8$ au) and $\sim 0.16''$ ($\sim25$ au), respectively. The continuum emission shows a disk-like structure with a radius of $\sim22$ au. Kinematical analysis of $^{13}$CO(2-1), C$^{18}$O(2-1), H$_2$CO (3$_{0,3}$-2$_{0,2}$), CH$_3$OH (4$_2$-3$_1$) emission demonstrates that these molecular lines trace the infalling-rotating envelope and possibly a Keplerian disk, enabling us to estimate the protostar mass to be $0.15 \rm{M_\odot} < \rm{M_\star} < 0.39 M_\odot$. The dusty disk is found to exhibit a brightness asymmetry along its minor axis in the continuum emission, probably caused by a flared distribution of the dust and the high optical depth of the dust emission. In addition, the CO(2-1) and SiO(5-4) emissions show knotty and wiggling motions in the jets. Our high angular resolution observations revealed the most recent mass ejection events, which have occurred within the last $\sim 25$ years.

          Evidence for an intrinsic luminosity-decay correlation in GRB radio afterglows

 - **Abstract**
 We present the discovery of a correlation, in a sample of 16 gamma-ray burst 8.5 GHz radio afterglows, between the intrinsic luminosity measured at 10 days in the rest frame, $L_{\mathrm{Radio,10d}}$, and the average rate of decay past this time, $\alpha_{>10d}$. The correlation has a Spearman's rank coefficient of $-0.70 \pm 0.13$ at a significance of $>3\sigma$ and a linear regression fit of $\alpha_{>10d} = -0.29^{+0.19}_{-0.28} \log \left(L_{\mathrm{Radio,10d}} \right) + 8.12^{+8.86}_{-5.88}$. This finding suggests that more luminous radio afterglows have higher average rates of decay than less luminous ones. We use a Monte Carlo simulation to show the correlation is not produced by chance or selection effects at a confidence level of $>3\sigma$. Previous studies found this relation in optical/UV, X-ray and GeV afterglow light curves, and we have now extended it to radio light curves. The Spearman's rank coefficients and the linear regression slopes for the correlation in each waveband are all consistent within $1\sigma$. We discuss how these new results in the radio band support the effects of observer viewing geometry, and time-varying microphysical parameters, as possible causes of the correlation as suggested in previous works.

          Rescattering of non-minimal coupling scalar particles during inflation

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the rescattering effects arising from non-minimally coupled scalar particles $\chi$ that are suddenly produced during inflation. The coupling term $\xi R \chi^2$ significantly enhances resonant particle production compared to minimal coupling scenarios. Consequently, the produced $\chi$ particles rescattering off the homogeneous inflaton condensate $\phi$, generating abundant $\delta\phi$ quanta within very short time intervals. This process leads to characteristic enhancements in the power spectrum of primordial curvature perturbations at scales corresponding to the moments of particle production. When this occurs at small scales, the power spectrum amplitude can reach as high as $\mathcal{O}(10^{-2})$. Furthermore, analysis of the equilateral bispectrum shows that this mechanism also induces substantial non-Gaussian features.

 - **Abstract**
 The combined Planck, BICEP/Keck Array and BAO measurements of the scalar spectral index and the tensor-to-scalar ratio from the cosmic microwave background observations severely constrain or completely rule out several models of inflationary potentials. On the other hand, the data seems to favor concave potentials over convex ones. In this paper, we study preheating and gravitational waves after inflation in a large-field, regularized hilltop potential where inflation takes place in the concave plateau. The inflaton, $\phi$, is coupled to a subdominant scalar field, $\chi$, through a quartic coupling. After inflation ends, $\phi$ oscillates about the potential minimum and becomes inhomogeneous. The growth of the fluctuation modes, $\delta\phi_k$ and $\delta\chi_k$, in a homogeneous, oscillating background is analyzed in linear perturbation theory, revealing that small modes likely experience broad self-resonance or external parametric resonance. To determine if the resonances are sufficiently strong to cause unstable growth of the modes we perform a lattice simulation. The lattice simulations demonstrate that, although the initial inhomogeneities generate a stochastic gravitational wave background that remains below the present observational limit, the fluctuations do not grow exponentially, and the occupation numbers of $\delta\phi_k$ and $\delta\chi_k$ remain close to zero.

 - **Abstract**
 OB associations, as an intermediate stage between Galactic clusters and field stars, play an important role in understanding the star formation process, early stellar evolution, and Galactic evolution. In this work, we construct a large sample of OB stars with 6D phase space parameters ($l, b, d, V_{\rm los}, pmra ,pmdec$) by combining the distances from Bailer-Jones et al. (2021), radial velocities derived from low-resolution spectra of the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST), and proper motions from the \textit{Gaia} Data Release 3 (DR3). This sample includes 19,933 OB stars, most of which are located within 6\,kpc of the Sun. Using 6D phase space parameters and friends-of-friends clustering algorithm, we identify 67 OB associations and 112 OB association candidates, among them, 49 OB associations and 107 OB association candidates are newly identified. The Galactic rotation curve derived using 67 OB association members is relatively flat in the range of Galactocentric distances 7$<$$R$$<$13\,kpc. The angular rotation velocity at solar Galactocentric distance of $R_\odot$ =8.34\,kpc is $\Omega_0$ = 29.05$\pm$0.55\,km\,s$^{-1}$\,kpc$^{-1}$. The spatial distribution of the 67 OB associations indicates that they are mainly located at low Galactic latitudes and near spiral arms of the Milky Way. Additionally, we estimate the velocity dispersions and sizes of these 67 OB associations. Our results show that the velocity dispersions decrease as Galactocentric distances increase, while their sizes increase as Galactocentric distances increase.

          Abundance and Phase-Space Distribution of Subhalos in Cosmological N-body Simulations: Testing Numerical Convergence and Correction Methods

 - **Abstract**
 Subhalos play a crucial role in accurately modeling galaxy formation and galaxy-based cosmological probes within the highly nonlinear, virialized regime. However, numerical convergence of subhalo evolution is difficult to achieve, especially in the inner regions of host halos where tidal forces are strongest. I investigate the numerical convergence and correction methods for the abundance, spatial, and velocity distributions of subhalos using two $6144^3$-particle cosmological N-body simulations with different mass resolutions -- Jiutian-300 ($1.0 \times 10^{7}\,h^{-1}M_{\odot}$) and Jiutian-1G ($3.7 \times 10^{8}\,h^{-1}M_{\odot}$) -- with subhalos identified by HBT+. My study shows that the Surviving subhalo Peak Mass Function (SPMF) converges only for subhalos with $m_{\mathrm{peak}}$ above $5000$ particles but can be accurately recovered by including orphan subhalos that survive according to the merger timescale model of Jiang et al., which outperforms other models. Including orphan subhalos also enables recovery of the real-space spatial and velocity distributions to $5$--$10\%$ accuracy down to scales of $0.1$--$0.2\,h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$. The remaining differences are likely due to cosmic variance and finite-box effects in the smaller Jiutian-300 simulation. Convergence below $0.1\,h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$ remains challenging and requires more sophisticated modeling of orphan subhalos. I further highlight that redshift-space multipoles are more difficult to recover even at larger scales because unreliable small-scale pairs at $r_{\mathrm{p}} < 0.1\,h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$ in real space affect scales of tens of $\mathrm{Mpc}$ in redshift space due to elongated Fingers-of-God effects. Therefore, for redshift-space statistics, I recommend using modified or alternative measures that reduce sensitivity to small projected separations in subhalo-based studies.

 - **Abstract**
 We show that the observed 60Fe/26Al flux ratio provided by the SPectrometer on INTEGRAL satellite (0.24 +- 0.04) can be reproduced only if rotation is taken into account in the computation of the stellar models. Predictions from non-rotating stellar models yield to a significantly lower ratio (0.062), which is incompatible with the observed value. The adopted models and the associated yields are based on a combination of models already published by Limongi & Chieffi (2018) complemented by additional ones fully consistent with the original grid, allowing a finer resolution in the initial rotational velocity distribution.

 - **Abstract**
 We performed the spectral and temporal analysis of MAXI J1803-298 using AstroSat/LAXPC and NICER observations taken in May 2021 during the initial phase of the outburst. We found that the source traverses through the hard, intermediate, and soft spectral states during the outburst. The spectrum in all states can be described using soft emissions from the thermal disk and hard emissions from the coronal regions. The variation in the inner disk temperature and normalization of the disk indicates the motion of the truncated disk across these different spectral states. We confirmed the presence of broad features, Type-C, and Type-B QPOs in the power spectra of different spectral states. We investigated the fractional rms and lags of all the variability features and discovered that the lag swung between positive and negative during the outburst evolution. While modeling the features with a simple model that considers variations in accretion parameters such as the accretion rate, heating rate, and inner disk radius, along with delays between them, we found a dynamic reversal in the origin of variability between the corona and the disk. Furthermore, our results are consistent with previous works and a radio study conducted on this source during its outburst.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Solar flux atlases observe the spatially integrated light from the Sun, treating it as a star. They are fundamental tools for gaining insight into the composition of the Sun and other stars, and are utilized as reference material for a wide range of solar applications such as stellar chemical abundances, atmospheric physics, stellar activity, and radial velocity signals. Aims. We provide a detailed comparison of solar activity in some of the well-known solar atlases against the new High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Searcher for the Northern hemisphere (HARPS-N) Quiet Sun (QS) and measured activity (MA) atlases that are published, for the first time, in this work. Methods. Ten of the widely used individual spectral lines from each flux atlas were selected to compare solar activity using three methods: 1) Equivalent Widths 2) Activity number, a novel activity measure which we introduce in this work. 3) Bisectors and radial velocity. Results. The significantly smaller activity measured in the MA atlas compared to the other atlases, relative to the QS atlas, underscores the dominance of instrumental effects over solar activity in their impact on spectral lines, which cannot be corrected through simple line convolution to match resolutions of other atlases. Additionally, our investigation unexpectedly revealed a substantial intensity shift in the Ca ii H & K lines of other atlases compared to our HARPS-N atlases, likely caused by assumptions in normalisation techniques used in the early Kitt Peak atlases. Conclusions. With an average spot number of zero, our QS atlas is well suited to serve as an absolute benchmark atlas representative of solar minimum for the visible spectrum that other atlases can be compared against. Our recommendations are 1) publication of a detailed log along with the observations, to include exact dates and indications of solar activity...

 - **Abstract**
 One prominent model for quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) is that they originate from extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) involving stellar-mass objects orbiting around massive black holes and colliding with their accretion disks. We compute the gravitational wave signals from such a model, demonstrating that orbiter-disk interactions result in small frequency shifts and high-frequency tails due to the excitation of non-discrete modes. Interestingly, we show that QPE RX J1301.9+2747 could be detectable by future space-based gravitational wave detectors, provided a moderate eccentricity around $0.25$ and a mass exceeding $35\,M_\odot$ for the orbiter. Moreover, based on this QPE model, we show that the signal-to-noise ratio of the gravitational wave signals from QPEs, if detectable, will be sufficiently high to distinguish such systems from vacuum EMRIs and shed light on the origin of QPEs and environments around massive black holes.

 - **Abstract**
 The bispectrum, being sensitive to non-Gaussianity and mode coupling of cosmological fields induced by non-linear gravitational evolution, serves as a powerful probe for detecting deviations from General Relativity (GR). The signatures of modified gravity in the bispectrum are even more pronounced in redshift space, where anisotropies from peculiar velocities provide unbiased information on higher-order properties of gravity. We investigate the potential of all non-zero angular multipoles $B_l^m$ of redshift space bispectrum across all possible triangle configurations to probe degenerate higher-order scalar tensor (DHOST) theory. We show that the higher-order multipoles of the bispectrum with $l=2,4,6$ are more sensitive to the modifications in gravity than the spherically averaged monopole moment $l=0$. These multipoles demonstrate remarkable sensitivity to the higher-order growth history, which varies across triangle configurations, with acute triangles generally being the most sensitive to modification in GR. The values of various multipoles exhibit opposite signs in modified gravity compared to those predicted in GR, which serves as a robust indicator of the deviation from GR. We demonstrate that, unlike $l=2$ and $4$ multipoles, the $l=6$ multipoles with $m\leq 4$ are not affected by the quadratic bias and second-order tidal bias parameters, emphasising the need to leverage their capabilities in analyses. The $(l=6, m > 4)$ multipoles fail to capture the second-order growth, while all $l=8$ multipoles lack any independent information regarding modified gravity in both linear and nonlinear regimes.

 - **Abstract**
 Low-mass objects are ubiquitous in our Galaxy. Their low temperature provides them with complex atmospheres characterised by the presence of strong molecular absorption bands which, together with their faintness, have made their accurate characterisation a great challenge for astronomers over the last decades. M dwarfs account for 75% of the census of stars within 10 pc of the Sun, and their suitability as targets in the search for Earth-like planets has led many research groups to focus on the study of these objects, which is crucial for the understanding of the structure and kinematics of our Galaxy. Very low-mass stars and substellar objects with spectral types M7 or later, including the extended L, T, and Y spectral types, constitute the domain of ultracool dwarfs. The study of these objects, discovered definitively in 1995, is key for understanding the boundary between stellar and substellar objects and promises to experience a quantum leap thanks to the characteristics of new-generation surveys such as Euclid or LSST. Data analysis in the field of observational astronomy has undergone a paradigm shift during the last decades driven by an exponential growth in the volume and complexity of available data. In this revolution, the Virtual Observatory has become a cornerstone providing a system that fosters interoperability between astronomical archives around the world. In response to this growth in data complexity, the astronomical community has increasingly adopted machine learning techniques for the development of scalable, automated solutions. This thesis explores the discovery and characterisation of M dwarfs and ultracool dwarfs, using data-driven approaches supported by Virtual Observatory technologies and protocols. We rely on a variety of machine and deep learning techniques to develop flexible methodologies aimed at advancing our understanding of low-mass objects.

 - **Abstract**
 Over the past two decades, thousands of confirmed exoplanets have been detected. The next major challenge is to characterize these other worlds and their stellar systems. Much information on the composition and formation of exoplanets and circumstellar debris disks can only be achieved via direct imaging. Direct imaging is challenging because of the small angular separations (< 1 arcsec) and high star-to-planet flux ratios such as ~1e9 for a Jupiter analog or ~1e10 for an Earth analog in the visible. Atmospheric turbulence prohibits reaching such high flux ratios on the ground, so observations must be made above the Earth's atmosphere. The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (Roman), planned to launch in late 2026, will be the first space-based observatory to demonstrate high-contrast imaging with active wavefront control using its Coronagraph Instrument. The instrument's main purpose is to mature the various technologies needed for a future flagship mission to image and characterize Earth-like exoplanets. These technologies include two high-actuator-count deformable mirrors, photon-counting detectors, two complementary wavefront sensing and control loops, and two different coronagraph types. In this paper, we describe the complete set of flight masks in the Roman Coronagraph Instrument, their intended combinations, and how they were laid out, fabricated, and measured.

 - **Abstract**
 Turbulent coronae of supermassive black holes can accelerate non-thermal particles to high energies and produce observable radiation, but capturing this process is challenging due to comparable timescales of acceleration, cooling, and the development of cascades. We present a time-dependent numerical framework that self-consistently couples proton acceleration -- modeled by the Fokker-Planck equation -- with leptonic-hadronic radiation. For the neutrino-emitting Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068, we reproduce the neutrino spectrum observed by IceCube, while satisfying gamma-ray constraints. We also consider a transient corona scenario, potentially emerging in non-jetted tidal disruption events like AT 2019dsg, and show that early-stage cascade feedback can impact proton acceleration and radiation processes in weaker coronae, producing delayed optical/ultraviolet, X-ray, and neutrino emissions of $\mathcal O(100~\rm d)$. This flexible code efficiently models multi-messenger signals from both steady and transient astrophysical sources, providing insights in combining particle acceleration and radiation mechanisms.

 - **Abstract**
 Systematic effects that limit the achievable sensitivity of current low-frequency radio telescopes to the 21-cm signal are among the foremost challenges in observational 21-cm cosmology. The standard approach to retrieving the 21-cm signal from radio interferometric data separates it from bright astrophysical foregrounds by exploiting their spectrally smooth nature, in contrast to the finer spectral structure of the 21-cm signal. Contaminants exhibiting rapid frequency fluctuations, on the other hand, are difficult to separate from the 21-cm signal using standard techniques, and the power from these contaminants contributes to low-level systematics that can limit our ability to detect the 21-cm signal. Many of these low-level systematics are incoherent across multiple nights of observation, resulting in an incoherent excess variance above the thermal noise sensitivity of the instrument. In this paper, we develop a method called cross-GPR (cross covariance Gaussian process regression) that exploits the incoherence of these systematics to separate them from the 21-cm signal, which remains coherent across multiple nights of observation. We first develop and demonstrate the technique on synthetic signals in a general setting, and then apply it to gridded interferometric visibility cubes. We perform realistic simulations of visibility cubes containing foregrounds, 21-cm signal, noise, and incoherent systematics. The simulations show that the method can successfully separate and subtract incoherent contributions to the excess variance, and its advantages over standard techniques become more evident when the spectral behavior of the contaminants resembles that of the 21-cm signal. Simulations performed on a variety of 21-cm signal shapes also reveal that the cross-GPR approach can subtract incoherent contributions to the excess variance, without suppressing the 21-cm signal.

 This study investigates the sensitivity of the radio interferometers to identify imprints of spatially inhomogeneous dark matter annihilation signatures in the 21-cm signal during the pre-reionization era. We focus on the upcoming low-mode survey of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA-Low) telescope. Using CNNs, we analyze simulated 3D 21-cm differential brightness temperature maps generated via the DM21cm code, which is based on 21cmFAST and DarkHistory, to distinguish between spatially homogeneous and inhomogeneous energy injection/deposition scenarios arising from dark matter annihilation. The inhomogeneous case accounts for local dark matter density contrasts and gas properties, such as thermal and ionization states, while the homogeneous model assumes uniform energy deposition. Our study focuses on two primary annihilation channels to electron-positron pairs ($e^+e^-$) and photons ( $\gamma \gamma$), exploring dark matter masses from 1 MeV to 100 MeV and a range of annihilation cross-sections. For $\gamma \gamma$ channel, the distinction across dark matter models is less pronounced due to the larger mean free path of the emitted photons, resulting in a more uniform energy deposition. For $e^+e^-$ channel, the results indicate that the CNNs can effectively differentiate between the inhomogeneous and homogeneous cases. Despite observational challenges, the results demonstrate that these effects remain detectable even after incorporating noise from next-generation radio interferometers, such as the SKA. We find that the inhomogeneous dark matter annihilation models can leave measurable imprints on the 21-cm signal maps distinguishable from the homogeneous scenarios for the dark matter masses $m_{\rm DM}=1$ MeV and the annihilation cross-sections of $\geq 5 \times 10^{-30}~{\rm cm^3/sec}$ ($\geq 5 \times 10^{-29}~{\rm cm^3/sec}$ for $m_{\rm DM}=100$ MeV) for moderate SKA-Low noise.

 - **Abstract**
 Answering the question "do rocky exoplanets around M stars have atmospheres?" is a key science goal of the JWST mission, with 500 hours of Director's Discretionary Time (DDT) awarded to address it. Theoretically, the so-called "Cosmic Shoreline" may not hold around M stars due to their harsher XUV environment, possibly resulting in most rocky planets lacking significant atmospheres -- a hypothesis that remains to be statistically tested through judicious target selection. We identify target selection as a combinatorial optimization problem ("knapsack problem"). We develop a statistical framework to test population-level hypotheses from observations and combine a formation and evolution model, 1D-RCE atmosphere model, and genetic algorithm to simulate populations and find the optimal set of observations. We find that, firstly, if all rocky planets around M stars are indeed bare rocks, JWST can efficiently place an upper bound on the atmosphere occurrence rates to less than 1 in 8, even without optimized target selection, but further improvements to the constraint are cost-prohibitive. Secondly, if the Cosmic Shoreline hypothesis (XUV or bolometric) holds true for M stars, strong evidence ($\Delta$BIC>5) can be found within ~500 observing hours using the optimal strategy of a "wide and shallow" approach. Our statistical framework can be directly applied to upcoming observations to robustly identify the Cosmic Shoreline and to optimize target selection for determining other trends in exoplanet atmosphere observations, including those from future missions.

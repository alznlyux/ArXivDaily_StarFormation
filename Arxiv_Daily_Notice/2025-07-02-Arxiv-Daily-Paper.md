 - **Abstract**
 Catalog maintenance of space objects by limited number of ground-based sensors presents a formidable challenging task to the space community. This article presents a methodology for time-invariant tracking and surveillance of space objects in low Earth orbit (LEO) by optimally directing ground sensors. Our methodology aims to maximize the expected number of space objects from a set of ground stations by utilizing concepts from stochastic geometry, particularly the Poisson point process. We have provided a systematic framework to understand visibility patterns and enhance the efficiency of tracking multiple objects simultaneously. Our approach contributes to more informed decision-making in space operations, ultimately supporting efforts to maintain safety and sustainability in LEO.

 - **Abstract**
 We demonstrates that the single-field inflation field system exhibits a symmetry that constrains its evolution via the Ward identity even for non-attractor inflation. By analyzing loop diagram structures, we derive a superhorizon conserved quantity directly related to the two-point correlation function of curvature perturbations, generalizing previous one-loop results to arbitrary loop orders. This symmetry-based approach provides a framework for understanding quantum conservation laws beyond the leading perturbative order.

          Challenge-Based Funding to Spark Origins Breakthroughs

 - **Abstract**
 Origins of life research is marred by ambiguous questions and goals, creating uncertainty about when research objectives have been achieved. Because of numerous unknowns and disagreements about definitions and theories, the field lacks clear markers of progress. We argue that the origins community should focus on goals that have agreed-upon meaning and can be consensually categorized as achieved or unachieved. The origins community needs these goals to maintain coherence amongst a federation of problems with the shared, but nebulous aspiration of understanding the origins of life. We propose a list of challenges with clear 'Finish Lines'--explicit descriptions of what will be achieved if each goal is reached--similar to the X-prize model. The intent is not to impose top-down research directions, but to compel the community to coalesce around explicit problems of the highest priority, as physics, astronomy, and planetary science communities do when setting science objectives for missions and megaprojects. Even if the generated phenomena are not unequivocally life-like, demonstrating systems that achieve these goals will sharpen the distinction between life itself and the constellation of phenomena that co-occur with life.

#### Title:
          Quantum stress-energy at timelike boundaries: testing a new beyond-$Λ$CDM parameter with cosmological data

 - **Subjects:** Subjects:

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze the basic cosmological effects of a population of timelike boundaries -- a form of nontrivial spacetime topology -- containing a boundary layer of quantum stress energy. This accumulation of vacuum fluctuations of quantum fields can be consistently negative and UV sensitive, providing an additional source of cosmic energy density strong enough to compete with matter and dark energy. For boundary conditions enabling a solution with fixed comoving boundary size, this effect contributes a qualitatively new term to the Friedmann equation determining the expansion history, scaling like $-1/a$ for scale factor $a$. It naturally dominates at relatively late times ($a\approx1/2$), while leaving intact well-measured early universe physics such as big bang nucleosynthesis and recombination. For a wide window of parameters, the boundaries can be larger than the Planck length throughout their history, back through the start of inflation at any viable scale. We analyze CMB and BAO data sets (Planck, ACT, and DESI) allowing for this component, finding a slight preference ($\sim 2\sigma$) and a relaxation of current tensions in the data (including the neutrino mass) in a physical manner. This novel parameter fits into a larger space of physical parameters beyond-$\Lambda$CDM that may serve this role, including negative spatial curvature, which may also be motivated by topological considerations and chaotic dynamics. Finally, we comment on additional phenomenological prospects for testing for this form of topology in the universe.
#### Title:
          Energy-Dependent Transport of Cosmic Rays in the Multiphase, Dynamic Interstellar Medium

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the transport of spectrally resolved cosmic ray (CR) protons with kinetic energies between $1-100$ GeV within the dynamic, multiphase interstellar medium (ISM), using a two-moment CR fluid solver applied to a TIGRESS MHD simulation with conditions similar to the solar neighborhood. Our CR transport prescription incorporates space- and momentum-dependent CR scattering coefficients $\sigma=\kappa^{-1}$, computed from the local balance between streaming-driven Alfvèn wave growth and damping processes. We find that advection combines with momentum-dependent diffusion to produce a CR distribution function $f(p)\propto~p^{-\gamma}$ with $\gamma\approx4.6$ that agrees with observations, steepened from an injected power law slope $\gamma_\mathrm{inj}=4.3$. The CR pressure is uniform in the highly diffusive, mostly neutral midplane region, but decreases exponentially in the ionized extraplanar region where scattering is efficient. To interpret these numerical results, we develop a two-zone analytic model that captures and links the two (physically and spatially) distinct regimes of CR transport in the multiphase, dynamic ISM. At low momenta, CR transport is dominated by gas advection, while at high momenta, both advection and diffusion contribute. At high momentum, the analytic prediction for the spectral slope approaches $\gamma=(4/3)\gamma_\mathrm{inj}-1$, and the predicted scaling of grammage with momentum is $X\propto p^{1-\gamma_\mathrm{inj}/3}$, consistent with the simulations. These results support a physical picture in which CRs are confined within the neutral midplane by the surrounding ionized gas, with their escape regulated by both the CR scattering rate in the ionized extraplanar gas and the velocity and Alfvén speed of that gas, at effective speed $v_\mathrm{c,eff}\approx(1/2)[\kappa_\parallel~d(v+v_\mathrm{A,i})/dz]^{1/2}$.

          SMA and NOEMA reveal asymmetric sub-structure in the protoplanetary disk of IRAS23077+6707

 - **Abstract**
 We present high-resolution data of IRAS 23077+6707 (`Dracula's Chivito') with the Submillimeter Array (SMA at 1.33 mm/225.5 GHz) and the Northern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA at 2.7 mm/111.7 GHz and 3.1 mm/96.2 GHz). IRAS 23077+6707 is a highly-inclined and newly discovered protoplanetary disk, first reported in 2024. We combine SMA baselines from the Compact, Extended and Very Extended arrays, and NOEMA baselines from its A and C configurations, and present continuum images with resolution ${\lesssim}0.8''$, which constitute the first sub-arcsecond resolution maps of IRAS 23077+6707. The images show extended linear emission that spans $5.6{-}6.1''$ as expected for a radially extended, highly-inclined protoplanetary disk. Accompanied with lower resolution data, we show that the disk has a steep spectral index, ranging from $\alpha=3.2{-}3.9$. We present evidence of multiple radial emission peaks and troughs in emission, which may originate in disk rings and a central cavity. We further present evidence that these radial structures are asymmetric; hosting a a significant brightness asymmetry, with emission enhanced by up to 50% in the north versus the south. We discuss hypotheses about the potential origins of these features, including the possibility that IRAS 23077+6707 hosts a rare example of an eccentric protoplanetary disk, which can induce these radially asymmetric structures. We present a simple eccentric continuum model of IRAS 23077+6707, and show for an eccentricity of $e \approx 0.26$, that this can reproduce the bulk morphology of the emission.

          Mid-Infrared Dust Evolution and Late-time Circumstellar Medium Interaction in SN 2017eaw

 - **Abstract**
 We present JWST/MIRI and complementary ground-based near-infrared observations of the Type II SN 2017eaw taken 6 years post-explosion. SN 2017eaw is still detected out to 25 $\mu$m and there is minimal evolution in the mid-infrared spectral energy distribution (SED) between the newly acquired JWST/MIRI observations and those taken a year earlier. Modeling of the mid-infrared SED reveals a cool $\sim$160 K dust component of $5.5\times10^{-4}\ \mathrm{M}_\odot$ and a hot $\sim$1700 K component of $5.4\times10^{-8}\ \mathrm{M}_\odot$ both composed of silicate dust. Notably there is no evidence of temperature or mass evolution in the cool dust component in the year between JWST observations. We also present new and archival HST and ground-based ultraviolet (UV) and optical observations which reveal reduced but continued circumstellar medium (CSM)-ejecta interaction at $>$2000 days post-explosion. The UV and mid-infrared emission show similar decline rates, suggesting both probe the interface between the ejecta and CSM. Given this, the continued existence of boxy H$\alpha$ emission in the nebular spectra, the low inferred optical depth of the dust, and the lack of temperature and mass evolution, we suggest that the cool dust component in SN 2017eaw may be primarily due to pre-existing dust rather than newly-formed dust in the ejecta or cold dense shell.

          Lya2pcf: an efficient pipeline to estimate two- and three-point correlation functions of the Lyman-$α$ forest

 - **Abstract**
 Studying the matter distribution in the universe through the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest allows us to constrain small-scale physics in the high-redshift regime. Spectroscopic quasar surveys are generating increasingly large datasets that require efficient algorithms to compute correlation functions. Moreover, cosmological analyses based on Lyman-$\alpha$ forests can significantly benefit from incorporating higher-order statistics alongside traditional two-point correlations. In this work, we present Lya2pcf, a pipeline designed to compute three-dimensional two-point and three-point correlation functions using Lyman-$\alpha$ forest data. The code implements standard algorithms widely used in current spectroscopic surveys for computing the two-point correlation function with its distortion matrix, covariance matrices; and it naturally extends the two-point estimator to three-point correlations. Thanks to GPU optimization, Lya2pcf achieves a substantial reduction in computational time for both the two-point correlation function and its distortion matrix when compared to the widely used PICCA code. We apply Lya2pcf to data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) sixteenth data release (DR16) and a Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Year-5 (DESI Y5) mock dataset, demonstrating overall performance gains over PICCA, especially on GPUs. We show the first measurement of the anisotropic three-point correlation function on a large spectroscopic sample for all possible triangles with scales up to 80 Mpc/h. The estimator's fast computation and the resulting signal-to-noise ratio -- above one for many triangle configurations -- demonstrate the viability of incorporating three-point statistics into future cosmological inference analyses, particularly with the larger datasets expected from Stage IV spectroscopic surveys.

          Fewer Companions in the Crowd: The Low Close Binary Fraction in Globular Clusters from Gaia RVS

 - **Abstract**
 In dense environments like globular clusters (GCs), dynamical interactions can disrupt or harden close binaries, nonetheless, detailed comparisons with field binary fractions remain limited. Here, we present an analysis of the close binary fraction in a carefully selected sample of field stars and 10 GCs using Gaia Radial Velocity Spectrometer (RVS) data, which is among the largest samples of GCs analysed using multi-epoch spectroscopy to date. By assessing the peak-to-peak variations of the sources' radial velocity (RV), we estimate the close binary fractions through a method that fits the distribution as the product of two Gaussian distributions. By applying the same RV-variability method to both cluster members and field stars, we ensure a homogeneous and inclusive comparison between the two environments. Despite matching stellar parameters between the field and GC samples, our findings confirm that GCs possess a significantly lower close binary fraction than field stars. Interestingly, we do not detect any clear trend of binary fraction with cluster metallicity; metal-rich and metal-poor GCs are uniformly binary-poor (within uncertainties). We discuss possible interpretations, including dynamical hardening in dense environments and the effects of common envelope evolution, which may lead to companion accretion or merger events.

          On the cosmic-ray distribution in the Galactic Center region: New insights from H.E.S.S

 - **Abstract**
 We performed a spectro-morphological analysis of the diffuse emission in the Galactic center region with H.E.S.S. gamma-ray data. We relied on templates to model the diffuse emissions (the Galactic center ridge and the foreground component) and on a 3D likelihood fitting approach. We first assessed the validity of a continuous injection scenario near the Galactic center by investigating possible deviations from a 1/r profile of the cosmic-ray distribution and potential spectral variations within the Galactic center ridge. We found the data can appropriately be described by a scenario in which a steady source near the Galactic center continuously injects cosmic rays which diffuse through the Central Molecular Zone. We then derived the best-fit spectral parameters of the Galactic center ridge emission and we found a spectral transition near 10-20 TeV.

          Causal Discovery of Latent Variables in Galactic Archaeology

 - **Abstract**
 Galactic archaeology--the study of stellar migration histories--provides insights into galaxy formation and evolution. However, establishing causal relationships between observable stellar properties and their birth conditions remains challenging, as key properties like birth radius are not directly observable. We employ Rank-based Latent Causal Discovery (RLCD) to uncover the causal structure governing the chemodynamics of a simulated Milky Way galaxy. Using only five observable properties (metallicity, age, and orbital parameters), we recover in a purely data-driven manner a causal graph containing two latent nodes that correspond to real physical properties: the birth radius and guiding radius of stars. Our study demonstrates the potential of causal discovery models in astrophysics.

          DeepCHART: Mapping the 3D dark matter density field from Ly$α$ forest surveys using deep learning

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/

 - **Abstract**
 We present DeepCHART (Deep learning for Cosmological Heterogeneity and Astrophysical Reconstruction via Tomography), a deep learning framework designed to reconstruct the three-dimensional dark matter density field at redshift $z=2.5$ from Ly$\alpha$ forest spectra. Leveraging a 3D variational autoencoder with a U-Net architecture, DeepCHART performs fast, likelihood-free inference, accurately capturing the non-linear gravitational dynamics and baryonic processes embedded in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. When applied to joint datasets combining Ly$\alpha$ forest absorption and coeval galaxy positions, the reconstruction quality improves further. For current surveys, such as Subaru/PFS, CLAMATO, and LATIS, with an average transverse sightline spacing of $d_\perp=2.4h^{-1}$cMpc, DeepCHART achieves high-fidelity reconstructions over the density range $0.4<\Delta_{\rm DM}<15$, with a voxel-wise Pearson correlation coefficient of $\rho\simeq 0.77$. These reconstructions are obtained using Ly$\alpha$ forest spectra with signal-to-noise ratios as low as 2 and instrumental resolution $R=2500$, matching Subaru/PFS specifications. For future high-density surveys enabled by instruments such as ELT/MOSAIC and WST/IFS with $d_\perp\simeq 1h^{-1}\mathrm{cMpc}$, the correlation improves to $\rho\simeq 0.90$ across a wider dynamic range ($0.25<\Delta_{\rm DM}<40$). The framework reliably recovers the dark matter density PDF as well as the power spectrum, with only mild suppression at intermediate scales. In terms of cosmic web classification, DeepCHART successfully identifies 81% of voids, 75% of sheets, 63% of filaments, and 43% of nodes. We propose DeepCHART as a powerful and scalable framework for field-level cosmological inference, readily generalisable to other observables, and offering a robust, efficient means of maximising the scientific return of upcoming spectroscopic surveys.

          Metal-poor single Wolf-Rayet stars: the interplay of optically thick winds and rotation

 - **Abstract**
 The Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) hosts 12 known Wolf-Rayet stars (WRs), seven of which apparently single. Their formation is a challenge for current stellar evolution models, because line-driven winds are generally assumed to be quenched at a metallicity Z<0.004. Here, we present a set of MESA models of single stars with zero-age main sequence masses 20-80 M_sun, considering different initial rotation speeds (Omega=0-0.7 Omega_c), metallicities (Z=0.002-0.0045), and wind mass-loss models (optically thin and thick winds). We show that if we account for optically thick winds, as described by Sabhahit+2023, fast rotating (Omega=0.6 Omega_c) single metal-poor O-type stars (with M>20 M_sun) shed their envelope and become WR stars even at the low metallicity of the SMC. The luminosity, effective temperature, evolutionary timescale, surface abundance, and rotational velocity of our simulated WR stars are compatible to the WRs observed in the SMC. We speculate that this scenario can also alleviate the excess of giant stars across the Humphreys-Davidson limit. Our results have key implications for black hole masses, (pair instability) supernova explosions, and other observable signatures.

          Searching for new Hypervelocity Stars with Gaia DR3 and VLT/FORS2 Spectroscopy

 - **Abstract**
 Hypervelocity stars are unique objects moving through the Milky Way at speeds exceeding the local escape velocity, providing valuable insights into the Galactic gravitational potential and the properties of its central supermassive black hole. The advent of Gaia DR3 offers an unprecedented astrometric precision, enabling the discovery of new hypervelocity stars and facilitating their characterization. This study seeks to identify and characterize hypervelocity star candidates using Gaia DR3 data, focusing on stars lacking radial velocity measurements. Our goal was to estimate the total velocities of these stars and establish their origin within the Galactic framework, if possible. We applied strict selection criteria to Gaia DR3 data, focusing on sources with low parallax uncertainties and high astrometric fidelity. The distributions of the total velocities in the Galactic rest frame were derived and used to identify candidates. Spectroscopic follow-up with VLT/FORS2 provided radial velocity measurements for a subset of these candidates. We evaluated the probabilities of stars exceeding local escape velocities under different Galactic potential models and traced their past orbits to identify possible origins. From Gaia DR3, we identified 149 hypervelocity star candidates with Pesc > 50% of exceeding local escape velocities. Our follow-up spectroscopy for 23 of those sources confirms that the selected targets are traveling at high velocities, with many appearing to escape the Galaxy, depending on the Galactic potential adopted. Our analysis suggests that nearly one-third of the stars may have an extra-Galactic origin. These findings highlight the need for more precise astrometric and spectroscopic data to conclusively determine the origins of hypervelocity stars and improve models of the Galactic potential.

          Forecast for growth-rate measurement using peculiar velocities from LSST supernovae

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we investigate the feasibility of measuring the cosmic growth-rate parameter, $f\sigma_8$, using peculiar velocities (PVs) derived from Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) in the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). We produce simulations of different SN types using a realistic LSST observing strategy, incorporating noise, photometric detection from the Difference Image Analysis (DIA) pipeline, and a PV field modeled from the Uchuu UniverseMachine simulations. We test three observational scenarios, ranging from ideal conditions with spectroscopic host-galaxy redshifts and spectroscopic SN classification, to more realistic settings involving photometric classification and contamination from non-Ia supernovae. Using a maximum-likelihood technique, we show that LSST can measure $f\sigma_8$ with a precision of $10\%$ in the redshift range $ 0.02 < z < 0.14 $ in the most realistic case. Using three tomographic bins, LSST can constrain the growth-rate parameter with errors below $18\%$ up to $z = 0.14$. We also test the impact of contamination on the maximum likelihood method and find that for contamination fractions below $\sim 2\%$, the measurement remains unbiased. These results highlight the potential of the LSST SN Ia sample to complement redshift-space distortion measurements at high redshift, providing a novel avenue for testing general relativity and dark energy models.

          Testing Origin-of-Life Theories with the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO)

 - **Abstract**
 The Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) aims to telescopically constrain the frequency and abundance of biospheres in the solar neighborhood. Origin-of-life theories vary in their predictions for the environmental requirements and the expected frequency of abiogenesis, meaning that constraints on the frequency and distribution of life on exoplanets from HWO can in principle directly test theories of abiogenesis. We categorize origin-of-life theories into three broad classes and discuss how HWO could potentially test them. Nondetection of biology on a large sample of habitable planets would provide prior-independent evidence in favor of the class of abiogenesis theory which holds that the origin of life is a contingent, vanishingly unlikely event, whereas detection of event a single biosphere would falsify this class of theories. Correlations of candidate biospheres with planetary parameters such as UV irradiation, the presence of oceans, and the presence of continents can test specific origin-of-life theories. Simulated surveys with Bayesian analysis are required to quantify the ability of HWO to execute this science case. However, a clear theme from the limited such studies that have already been conducted is the need for large sample sizes ($\gtrsim50$ planets characterized) to provide meaningful constraints on abiogenesis theories, favoring a larger design sample for HWO.

          Prebiosignatures with the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO)

 - **Abstract**
 The Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) aims to characterize habitable exoplanets in search of signs of life. However, detectable life may be rare, either because abiogenesis is intrinsically contingent and unlikely, or because biospheres may efficiently recycle their products. Here, we explore the potential of HWO to test theories of life in the universe even if detectable life is rare by searching for "prebiosignature gases". Prebiosignatures gases are gases whose detection constrains theories of the evolution of prebiotic (habitable but uninhabited) planets, thereby testing theories of abiogenesis and guiding laboratory investigations of the origin of life. We catalog 5 theories of prebiotic environments that are potentially testable by HWO, identify their observational tests, and rank them by perceived detection plausibility. The prebiosignature paradigm is novel and potentially compelling, but considerable work is required to mature it and assess its practical relevance for HWO, especially simulated spectral observation and retrieval studies. However, consideration of the absorption properties of prebiosignature observables alone reveals that coverage at NUV wavelengths (200-400 nm) will be required to effectively realize a prebiosignature science case for HWO, supporting the argument for UV capabilities for HWO.

 - **Abstract**
 Future space observatories that seek to perform imaging and spectroscopy of faint astronomical sources will require ultra-low-noise detectors that are sensitive over a broad wavelength range. Silicon charge-coupled devices (CCDs), such as EMCCDs, skipper CCDs, multi-amplifier sensing (MAS) CCDs, and single-electron sensitive read out (SiSeRO) CCDs have demonstrated the ability to detect and measure single photons from X-ray energies to near the silicon band gap (~1.1 $\mu$m), making them candidate technologies for this application. In this context, we study a relatively unexplored source of low-energy background coming from Cherenkov radiation produced by energetic cosmic rays traversing a silicon detector. We present a model for Cherenkov photon production and absorption that is calibrated to laboratory data, and we use this model to characterize the residual background rate for ultra-low-noise silicon detectors in space. We study how the Cherenkov background rate depends on detector thickness, variations in solar activity, and the contribution of heavy cosmic ray species (Z > 2). We find that for thick silicon detectors, such as those required to achieve high quantum efficiency at long wavelengths, the rate of cosmic-ray-induced Cherenkov photon production is comparable to other detector and astrophysical backgrounds. We apply our Cherenkov background model to simulated spectroscopic observations of extra-solar planets, and we find that thick detectors continue to outperform their thinner counterparts at longer wavelengths despite a larger Cherenkov background rate. Furthermore, we find that minimal masking of cosmic-ray tracks continues to maximize the signal-to-noise of very faint sources despite the existence of extended halos of Cherenkov photons.

 - **Abstract**
 The distribution of absorption lines in the spectra of distant quasars, called the Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly-$\alpha$) forest, is a unique probe of cosmology and the intergalactic medium at high redshifts and small scales. The statistical power of ongoing redshift surveys demands precise theoretical tools to model the Ly-$\alpha$ forest. We address this challenge by developing an analytic, perturbative forward model to predict the Ly-$\alpha$ forest at the field level for a given set of cosmological initial conditions. Our model shows a remarkable performance when compared with the Sherwood hydrodynamic simulations: it reproduces the flux distribution, the Ly-$\alpha$ - dark matter halo cross-correlations, and the count-in-cell statistics at the percent level down to scales of a few Mpc. Our work provides crucial tools that bridge analytic modeling on large scales with simulations on small-scales, enabling field-level inference from Ly-$\alpha$ forest data and simulation-based priors for cosmological analyses. This is especially timely for realizing the full scientific potential of the Ly-$\alpha$ forest measurements by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument.

 - **Abstract**
 We examine the impact of repulsive self-interactions of moderate strength on fuzzy dark matter halos focusing on the core and granule size, the spatial dependence of the field's coherence, the turbulent vortex tangle and the oscillation frequency of the central soliton. Our analysis extends across the range from quantum-pressure-dominated to self-interaction-dominated stabilisation of the gravitationally bound solitonic core. Within this examined range of self-coupling strengths, we find that mergers with a given initial spatial configuration and an increasing self-interaction strength $g$, result in cores with increased size that exhibit a reduced central density and oscillate with decreased frequency. All of these features are in accordance with expectations from the study of isolated Self-interacting Fuzzy Dark Matter (SFDM) solitons. The characteristic size of the granules in the surrounding halo also grows but by a much smaller amount relative to the core; accordingly, typical inter-vortex distances are also only mildly affected. We also measure the total length of the vortex network which, although less robust, shows no clear dependence on increasing $g$ and no signs of decay over the timescales of our simulations. Measures of coherence of the field behave as in the non-interacting case, again clearly separating the coherent core form the quasi-coherent halo. Interestingly, we observe a relative increase of incoherent fluctuations coexisting with the coherent mode at the centre of the halo with increasing self-coupling strength, a phenomenon also observed in laboratory condensates at non-zero temperature.

 - **Abstract**
 Z-sources are a particular class of neutron star low-mass X-ray binaries characterized by a wide Z-like track in their hard colorsoft color (or hardness-intensity) diagrams, with three branches: the horizontal (HB), the normal (NB), and the flaring branch (FB). Spectropolarimetric observations with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) show that the polarization in these sources varies along the Z-track, reaching unexpectedly high values in the HB. In this work, we collected all the polarimetric results obtained so far from observations of Z-sources with IXPE, using a model-independent analysis with ixpeobssim. We first performed a detailed characterization of the spectral state of each source along the Z-track using IXPE, along with the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) and the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) data and then estimated the polarization for each branch. Although we confirm that the average polarization in the 2-8 keV band decreases moving from the HB to the NB for all three Z-sources observed in these branches, we also observe a qualitatively increasing trend from the NB to the FB. Whereas this increase is clearly significant for Cyg X-2 and Sco X-1, the polarization remains consistent at the 90% confidence level for GX 5-1 and GX 349+2, while for XTE J1701-462 and GX 340+0 only upper limits are found in the FB. For most sources, the average polarization angle in the 2-8 keV range remains consistent along the CCD; however, we observe a significant rotation for both Sco X1 and GX 349+2 (at the 90% confidence level) as they move from the NB to the FB. In addition, we observe a significant increase in the polarization degree with energy in most of the observed Z-sources, with some also exhibiting a rotation of the polarization angle with energy (approximately by 20-30 deg).

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results of astrochemical modeling of complex organic molecules (COMs) in the ice and gas of the prestellar core L1544 with the recently updated MONACO rate equations-based model. The model includes, in particular, non-diffusive processes, new laboratory verified chemical routes for acetaldehyde and methane ice formation and variation of H and $\rm H_2$ desorption energies depending on the surface coverage by $\rm H_2$ molecules. For the first time, we simultaneously reproduce the abundances of several oxygen-bearing COMs in the gas phase, the approximate location of the peak of methanol emission, as well as the abundance of methanol in the icy mantles of L1544. Radical-radical reactions on grains surface between species such as $\rm CH_3$, $\rm CH_3O$ and $\rm HCO$ efficiently proceed non-diffusively. COMs are delivered to the gas phase via chemical desorption amplified by the loops of H-addition/abstraction surface reactions. However, gas-phase chemical reactions as well provide a noticeable input to the formation of COMs in the gas, but not to the COMs solid-state abundances. This particularly applies for CH$_3$CHO and CH$_3$OCH$_3$. The simulated abundances of COMs in the ice are in the range 1\%--2\% (for methyl formate ice) or $\sim$~0.1\% (for CH$_3$CHO and CH$_3$OCH$_3$) with respect to the abundance of H$_2$O ice. We stress a similarity between the simulated abundances of icy COMs in L1544 and the abundances of COMs in the gas phase of hot cores/corinos. We compare our non-diffusive model with the diffusive model and provide constraints for the species' diffusion-to-desorption energy ratios.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the radio continuum counterparts to the enigmatic ultra-compact X-ray binaries (UCXBs); a black hole or neutron star accreting from a hydrogen-deficient white dwarf donor star, with short orbital periods ($<$ 80 minutes). For the sample of UCXBs hosted by globular clusters (GCs), we search for whether certain GC properties are more likely to enhance UCXB formation. We determine that GCs which host UCXBs are drawn from a distinct population in terms of cluster concentration, core radius and half-light radius, but are similar to other well-studied GCs in metallicity and cluster mass. In particular, UCXB-hosting GCs tend to be on average more compact, with a higher concentration than other GCs, with significantly higher encounter rates. We investigate whether a correlation exists between radio luminosity and orbital period, using new and archival observations. We determine that there is not a clear connection between the two observable quantities.

 - **Abstract**
 We present Dark from Light (DfL) - a novel method to infer the dark sector in wide-field galaxy surveys, leveraging a machine learning approach trained on contemporary cosmological simulations. The aim of this algorithm is to provide a fast, straightforward, and accurate route to estimating dark matter halo masses and group membership in wide-field spectroscopic galaxy surveys. This approach requires a highly limited number of input parameters and yields full probability distribution functions for the output halo masses. To achieve this, we train a series of Random Forest (RF) regression models on the IllustrisTNG and EAGLE simulations at z=0-3, which provide model-dependent mappings from luminous tracers to dark matter halo properties. We incorporate the individual regression models into a virial group-finding algorithm (DfL), which outputs halo properties for observational-like input data. We test the method at z=0-2 for both the EAGLE and IllustrisTNG models, as well as in a cross-validation mode. We demonstrate that known halo masses can be recovered with a mean systematic bias of $\langle b \rangle = \pm 0.10\,$dex (resulting from simulation choice), a mean statistical uncertainty of $\langle \sigma \rangle = 0.12 \,$dex across epochs, and a central - (core) satellite classification accuracy of 96%. We establish that this approach yields superior halo mass recovery to standard abundance matching applied to groups identified through a friends-of-friends algorithm. Additionally, we compare the outputs of DfL to observational constraints on the $M_* - M_{\rm Halo}$ relation from strong gravitational lensing at $z \sim 0$, demonstrating the promise of this novel approach. Finally, we systematically quantify how DfL performs on observational-like input data with varying stellar mass uncertainty and spectroscopic incompleteness, enabling robust error calibration.

 - **Abstract**
 Among the most fundamental properties of a dark matter halo is its density profile. Motivated by the recent proposal by García et al. [R. García et. al., MNRAS 521, 2464 (2023)] to define a dynamical halo as the collection of orbiting particles in a gravitationally bound structure, we characterize the mean and scatter of the orbiting profile of dynamical halos as a function of their orbiting mass. We demonstrate that the orbiting profile of individual halos at fixed mass depends on a single dynamical variable -- the halo radius $r_{\rm h}$ -- which characterizes the spatial extent of the profile. The scatter in halo radius at fixed orbiting mass is $\approx 16\%$. Only a small fraction of this scatter arises due to differences in halo formation time, with late-forming halos being more compact (smaller halo radii). Accounting for this additional correlation results in an $\approx 11\%$ scatter in halo radius at fixed mass and halo formation time.

 - **Abstract**
 The detection of circumstellar atomic hydrogen (\ion{H}{1}) via the 21\,cm line remains a persistent challenge in planetary nebula (PN) studies, primarily due to contamination from ubiquitous interstellar \ion{H}{1} 21\,cm emission. In this paper, we report the results of a \ion{H}{1} survey of 12 high surface brightness PNe located at Galactic latitudes $|b|\geq10\arcdeg$, performed with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST), which is currently the most sensitive telescope in the $L$ band. Although the contamination from interstellar emission is still severe, we detect or tentatively detect circumstellar \ion{H}{1} 21\,cm absorption associated with two PNe: NGC\,6905 and NGC\,7662. \ion{H}{1} exhibits a comparatively high detection frequency in bipolar PNe. We estimate the \ion{H}{1} masses of the two PNe to range from 0.01 to 0.14 $M_{\sun}$, resulting in atomic-to-ionized hydrogen ratios of 0.02--0.3. The \ion{H}{1} shells have dynamical ages of 2100--2400 years. Our measurements confirm previous findings that the optical depth of \ion{H}{1} decreases with increasing linear radius of the nebula. The mass loss rates traced by the \ion{H}{1} absorption are larger than 10$^{-5}$\,M$_\sun$ yr$^{-1}$, indicating that they originate from the superwind phase at the tip of the asymptotic giant branch.

 - **Abstract**
 IRC+10216 is the brightest infrared source in the northern sky, known for its rich chemical composition. It is often used as a standard reference for studying the circumstellar envelope (CSE) of carbon-rich stars. While pioneering 3\,mm spectral surveys have laid foundational datasets, their system temperature limitations rendered spectral line detection thresholds inadequate for probing the source's complex organic molecule inventory at this band, which made superseding observations necessary. We aim to gain an unbiased view regarding circumstellar chemistry and investigate whether IRC+10216 is typical or anomalous in terms of its chemical composition. We carried out an in-depth spectral line survey of the circumstellar envelope of IRC+10216 utilizing the Arizona Radio Observatory 12\,m telescope. We achieved complete spectral sampling across the 90--116 GHz atmospheric window ($\lambda=2.6$--3.3\,mm). A total of 214 emission lines belonging to 43 molecular species are identified in the CSE of IRC+10216, among which 28 lines are newly detected in this object and four emission lines remain unidentified. The excitation temperatures and column densities of 16 molecules are determined through rotation diagrams. We estimate the isotopic ratios of carbon, oxygen, and silicon elements. For the majority of the molecular species, the line intensity ratios between IRC+10216 and CIT\,6 are inversely proportional to the square of their distance, which suggests that the chemical processes occurring within them are similar. Nevertheless, there is evidence suggesting that the emission of C$_{4}$H and C$_{3}$N in IRC+10216 is unusually strong. These observations stand as the most sensitive and unbiased line survey of IRC+10216 within the $\lambda=3$ window carried out by a single-dish telescope. They offer a valuable reference for the astronomical community. (Abridged)

 - **Abstract**
 This study investigates the potential of a cosmological model termed $\Lambda w$DM, in which a cosmological constant play the role of dark energy and dark matter is barotropic and has a constant equation of state parameter ($w_{\rm dm}$), to address the $S_8$ tension between early- and late- universe observations. By incorporating the latest cosmological datasets -- including Planck Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO), Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), Redshift Space Distortions (RSD), and weak lensing (WL) -- we constrain the $\Lambda w$DM compared to $\Lambda$CDM. Our analysis reveals a marginal preference for a non-zero $w_{\rm dm}=2.7^{+2.0}_{-1.9}\times10^{-7}$( at 95\% confidence level) when combining CMB, SDSS BAO, SNe Ia, RSD, and WL data, and a marginal preference for a non-zero $w_{\rm dm} = 2.29^{+1.9}_{-2.0} \times 10^{-7}$( at 95\% confidence level) when combining CMB, DESI Y1 BAO, SNe Ia, RSD, and WL data. In addition, we find that, compared to $\Lambda$CDM, $\Lambda w$DM can alleviate the $S_8$ tension from $>3\sigma$ to $<1\sigma$. Furthermore, we find that, for CMB+SDSS+PP+RSD+WL datasets, the $\Lambda w$DM model is close to being positively preferred over the $\Lambda$CDM model.

          Diversity of rocky planet atmospheres in the C-H-O-N-S-Cl system with interior dissolution, non-ideality, and condensation: Application to TRAPPIST-1e and sub-Neptunes

 - **Abstract**
 A quantitative understanding of the nature and composition of low-mass rocky exo(planet) atmospheres during their evolution is needed to interpret observations. The magma ocean stage of terrestrial- and sub-Neptune planets permits mass exchange between their interiors and atmospheres, during which the mass and speciation of the atmosphere is dictated by the planet's volatile budget, chemical equilibria, and gas/fluid solubility in molten rock. As the atmosphere cools, it is modified by gas-phase reactions and condensation. We combine these processes into an open-source Python package built using JAX called Atmodeller, and perform calculations for planet sizes and conditions analogous to TRAPPIST-1e and K2-18b. For TRAPPIST-1e-like planets, our simulations indicate that CO-dominated atmospheres are prevalent during the magma ocean stage, which, upon isochemical cooling, predominantly evolve into CO2-rich atmospheres of a few hundred bar at 280 K. Around 40% of our simulations predict the coexistence of liquid water, graphite, sulfur, and ammonium chloride-key ingredients for surface habitability. For sub-Neptune gas dwarfs, pressures are sufficiently high (few GPa) to deviate the fugacities of gases from ideality, thereby drastically enhancing their solubilities. This buffers the total atmospheric pressure to lower values than for the ideal case. These effects conspire to produce CH4-rich sub-Neptune atmospheres for total pressures exceeding around 3.5 GPa, provided H/C is approximately 100x solar and fO2 moderately reducing (3 log10 units below the iron-wüstite buffer). Otherwise, molecular hydrogen remains the predominant species at lower total pressures and/or higher H/C. For all planets at high temperature, solubility enriches C/H in the atmosphere relative to the initial composition.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the 2018-2019 main outburst and the subsequent mini-outbursts of the black hole low-mass X-ray binary MAXI J1820+070 using optical/ultraviolet data from the Las Cumbres Observatory (LCO), the American Association of Variable Star Observers (AAVSO), and $\textit{Swift}$/UVOT, as well as X-ray data from $\textit{Insight}$-HXMT and $\textit{Swift}$/XRT. Given the high-cadence observations, we identify a broad dip-like feature in both the optical and X-ray light curves preceding the transition to the soft state, with the X-ray dip lagging the optical dip by approximately 10 days. We propose that the dip is caused by a brief decrease followed by an increase in the mass accretion rate as it propagates through the disc, ultimately triggering the transition to the soft state. This might be a potential tool to predict impending hard-to-soft state transitions, although such a dip has not yet been observed in many sources. Additionally, we find that optical colour ($g^{\prime}-i^{\prime}$) becomes bluer and less variable before the transition to the intermediate state, preceding a dramatic change in the hardness ratio. This appears to be an unusual case, differing from the typical scenario where the optical colour changes usually along with the transition to the soft state. Finally, we explore the implications of the complex evolution of optical/X-ray correlation during both main outbursts and mini-outbursts. In particular, we find a loop-like evolutionary track before the transition to the soft state, which is linked to the optical/X-ray dips in the light curves.

 - **Abstract**
 We conducted a comprehensive study of daily delays using multi-wavelength data from a sample of well-studied black hole X-ray binaries, specifically focusing on the sources GX 339-4, 4U 1543-47, and XTE J1550-564. The Interpolated-Correlation Function method was employed to investigate the temporal relationship between the X-ray (Compton component) and optical-infrared (OIR) emissions. Our results show that during the rising hard state, the Compton emission consistently lags behind OIR emission for several days. In contrast, during the decaying hard state, the OIR emission lags behind the Compton emission by approximately 6 to 35 days. This measurement can potentially be used in models of accretion physics and disk instability. We explore the underlying mechanisms responsible for these time delays, highlighting the critical role of viscous heating in the accretion disk in generating OIR luminosity for these sources. The observed time delays during both the rising and decaying hard states are well explained by the disk instability model.

 - **Abstract**
 [Abridged] The physical conditions in stellar atmospheres can be obtained from the interpretation of solar spectro-polarimetric observations. However, traditional inversion codes are computationally demanding, especially for lines whose formation is complex. The necessity of faster alternatives has motivated the emergence of machine learning solutions. This paper introduces an approach to the inversion and synthesis of Stokes profiles inspired by neural machine translation. Our aim is to develop a generative model that treats Stokes profiles and atmospheric models as two distinct ``languages'' encoding the same physical reality. We build a model that learns how to translate between them, also providing estimates of the uncertainty. We employ a tokenization strategy for both Stokes parameters and model atmospheres, which is learned using a VQ-VAE, a neural model used to compress the data into a lower dimensionality form. The core of our inversion code utilizes a transformer encoder-decoder architecture to perform the translation between these tokenized representations. The model is trained on a database of synthetic Stokes profiles derived from perturbations to various semi-empirical solar atmospheric models, ensuring a wide range of expected solar physical conditions. The method effectively reconstructs atmospheric models from observed Stokes profiles, showing better constrained models within the region of sensitivity of the considered spectral lines. The latent representation induced by the VQ-VAE helps accelerate the inversion by compressing the length of the Stokes profiles and model atmospheres. Additionally, it helps regularize the solution by reducing the chances of obtaining unphysical models. As a final advantage, the method provides the generative nature of our model, which naturally yields an estimate of the uncertainty in the solution.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we performed an energy-dependent study of low-frequency oscillations observed in GX 13+1 using \textit{AstroSat} (Large Area X-ray Proportional Counter and Soft X-ray Telescope). The hardness-intensity diagram (HID) of the observation resembles a `$\nu$'-shaped track, while the color-color diagram exhibits a `$<$'-shaped track, similar to the horizontal and normal branches of the Z source. We conducted flux-resolved temporal studies focusing on low-frequency variability and divided the HID into five regions: A, B, C, D, and E. Low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) were detected in Regions A, B, and C. The QPO in Region A has a frequency of $5.06^{+0.54}_{-0.48}$ Hz with a quality factor (Q-factor) of 2.80. In Region B, the QPO was detected at $4.52^{+0.14}_{-0.13}$ Hz with a Q-factor of 5.79, while in Region C, it was observed at $4.70^{+0.62}_{-0.42}$ Hz with a Q-factor of 4.35. The QPO frequencies, Q-factors, and low root-mean-square (rms) values (1.32\%, 1.34\%, and 0.7\%) suggest that these oscillations are Normal Branch Oscillations, similar to those reported in GX 340+0. We modeled the rms and lag of the QPOs using a propagative model, considering variations in blackbody temperature, coronal heating rate, and optical depth. Our findings indicate that the observed QPOs are likely driven by interactions between the corona and variations in the blackbody temperature.

 The precise calculation of gravitational wave (GW) and particle emissions from cosmic string networks is of significant theoretical and experimental interest. In this Letter, we perform numerical simulations of near-global and local string networks, comparing the GW spectra predictions from both lattice field simulation and the Nambu-Goto (NG) approximation methods. We find the discrepancy between the GW spectra computed via the NG approximation and the lattice field simulation is negligible for near-global string and grow with increasing gauge coupling. Additionally, we confirm that particle emission significantly dominates energy emission, with the ratio of GW energy to particle energy approximately $10^{-3}$ to $10^{-2}$ for both near-global and local string scenarios.

 - **Abstract**
 Ultralight dark matter refers to the lightest potential dark matter candidates. We will focus on the mass range that has been studied using astrophysical and cosmological observations, corresponding to a mass $10^{-24} \, \mathrm{eV} \lesssim m \lesssim 10^{-18} \, \mathrm{eV}$. We will discuss the motivations for this mass range. The most studied model in this range corresponds to a minimally coupled, single, classical, spin-0 field comprising all dark matter. However, the work exploring extensions of this model (for example, higher spin, self-coupled, multiple field, and mixed models) will be one of the focuses of this review. The phenomenology associated with ultralight dark matter is rich and includes linear effects on the primordial power spectrum, core structures forming at the center of halos, nonlinear effects resulting in heating of stellar distributions, and non-relativistic effects relating to pulsar signals and black hole superradiance, to name a few. This set of effects has been studied using an equally extensive set of numerical tools. We will summarize the most common ones and discuss their applications and limitations. Ultralight dark matter also has a wide variety of observational constraints, including halo mass functions, the Lyman-alpha forest, halo density profiles, stellar dynamics, and black hole spins. We will review them focusing on the observations made, the method of study, and the major systematics. We will end with a discussion of the current status of the field and future work needed.

 - **Abstract**
 A bombardment of comets is thought to have occurred in the inner solar system as a result of a dynamical instability among the giant planets after gas disk dispersal. Vesta, the second largest asteroid in the main asteroid belt, likely differentiated before gas disk dispersal, implying its crust witnessed the cometary bombardment. The composition of HED meteorites, which represent fragments of Vesta's crust, could therefore have been altered by cometary impacts. Here we combine noble gas mass spectrometry measurements, N-body simulations, collision rate calculations, and impact simulations to estimate the cometary contribution to Vesta. While our dynamical simulations indicate that Vesta likely underwent a significant number of collisions with large comets, we find no xenon cometary signature in HED meteorites. This apparent contradiction arises due to the fact that cometary impacts were at high speeds and Vesta's weak gravitational attraction made it incapable of retaining cometary material. Smaller asteroids are even less likely to retain such material. Therefore, if a cometary xenon signature is ever detected in an asteroid belt object, it must have been acquired during formation, within the same source region as comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, and have been implanted later into the asteroid belt.

 - **Abstract**
 I identified a point-symmetric morphology in the core-collapse supernova (CCSN) remnant (CCSNR) N132D, composed of two symmetry axes: the short symmetry axis extending from the northwest ear and through the center of the iron-rich emission on the other side, and the second along the long dimension of N132D and coincides with the extension of the central oxygen-rich gas to the northeast. Namely, the point-symmetry of the outer zones of CCSNR N132D correlates with that of the oxygen-rich gas near the center. The surrounding gas cannot shape the inner oxygen-rich material, implying that the point-symmetric morphology is a property of the explosion mechanism, as predicted by the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM). The oxygen-rich material is known to be in a torus. According to the JJEM, an energetic pair of opposite jets, more or less perpendicular to the plane of the torus, has shaped the torus; this pair is along the short symmetry axis. Another energetic pair, perpendicular to the first one, shaped the elongated, large-scale structure of CCSNR N132D. I discuss how the JJEM accounts for two perpendicular pairs of jets and the unequal jets in each pair. CCSNR N132D is the fifteenth CCSNR with an identified point-symmetric morphology attributed to the JJEM. Because the neutrino-driven mechanism cannot explain such morphologies, this study further strengthens the claim that the JJEM is the primary explosion mechanism of CCSNe.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent claims of biosignature gases in sub-Neptune atmospheres have renewed interest in water-rich sub-Neptunes with surface oceans, often referred to as Hycean planets. These planets are hypothesized to form beyond the snow line, accreting large amounts of H$_2$O >10 wt%) before migrating inward. However, current interior models often neglect chemical equilibration between primordial atmospheres and molten interiors. Here, we compute global chemical equilibrium states for a synthetic population of sub-Neptunes with magma oceans. Although many initially accrete 5-30 wt% water, interior-atmosphere interactions destroy most of it, reducing final H$_2$O mass fractions to below 1.5 wt%. As a result, none meet the threshold for Hycean planets. Despite that, we find H$_2$O-dominated atmospheres exclusively on planets that accreted the least ice. These planets form inside the snow line, are depleted in carbon and hydrogen, and develop small envelopes with envelope mass fractions below 1%, dominated by endogenic water. In contrast, planets formed beyond the snow line accrete more volatiles, but their water is largely converted to H$_2$ gas or sequestered into the interior, resulting in low atmospheric H$_2$O mass fractions. Most H$_2$O-rich envelopes are also fully miscible with H$_2$, making a separate water layer unlikely. Our results topple the conventional link between ice accretion and water-rich atmospheres, showing instead that H$_2$O-dominated envelopes emerge through chemical equilibration in hydrogen-poor planets formed inside the snow line.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate constraints on the abundance of primordial black holes (PBHs) as dark matter (DM) candidates using five years of microlensing data from the OGLE survey. While the majority of OGLE's $\sim 2000$ microlensing events are well-explained by stellar populations such as brown dwarfs, main-sequence stars, and compact remnants, a subset of six ultrashort-timescale events ($t_E \sim 0.1 - 0.3$ days) may signal the presence of PBHs. Building upon prior work that adopted the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) DM profile, we examine how alternative DM halo models -- specifically the Einasto and Burkert profiles -- affect microlensing predictions and the constraints on PBH abundance. We computed differential microlensing event rates for both profiles, using the main-sequence star rate as an observational benchmark. Our results show that neither the Einasto nor Burkert profiles reproduce the distribution of main-sequence star events, yet both allow for viable explanations of the ultrashort-timescale events with PBH masses $M_{\mathrm{PBH}} \sim 10^{-5} M_\odot$. Using a Poisson likelihood analysis under the null hypothesis that no PBH is observed in OGLE dataset, we derive 95\% C.L. upper bounds on $f_{\mathrm{PBH}}$, finding that the constraints are significantly relaxed under the Einasto and Burkert profiles compared to the NFW case. These results underscore the sensitivity of PBH constraints to the assumed DM halo structure and highlight the importance of accurately modeling the inner Galactic density profile to robustly assess PBH dark matter scenarios.

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the possibility of phase transitions between different quark matter phases occurring within quark stars, giving rise to the hybrid quark stars (HybQSs). Utilizing a well-established general parameterization of interacting quark matter, we construct quark star models featuring sharp first-order quark-quark phase transitions of various types, in contrast to the hadron-quark transition in conventional hybrid stars. We systematically investigate how recent observations, such as the pulsar mass measurements $M_{\rm TOV}\gtrsim2M_{\odot}$ and the GW170817's tidal deformability bound $\Lambda_{1.4M_{\odot}}<800$, constrain the viable parameter space. We also identified twin stars in some of the HybQS parameter space. This work unveils new possibilities of phase transitions and the resulting new types of compact stars in realistic astrophysical scenarios.

 - **Abstract**
 The DESI collaboration just obtained a set of precise BAO measurements, that combined with CMB and SNIa datasets show that the $\omega_0 \omega_a$CDM model is preferred over $\Lambda$CDM, at more than $4\,\sigma$, to describe the dynamics of the expanding Universe. This raises the question whether this model also suitably describes the clumpy Universe. Also lately, detailed analyses of diverse cosmic tracers resulted in a new dataset of measurements of an observable from the clumpy Universe: $\sigma_8(z)$, spanning a high-redshift data $z \in [0.013, 3.8]$. In this work we use this dataset of 15 $\sigma_8(z_i)$ measurements to study the viability of the $\omega_0 \omega_a$CDM cosmological model to explain the clustered Universe. Our analyses compare the $\omega_0 \omega_a$CDM model with the $\sigma_8(z)$ function reconstructed from the data points using Gaussian Process. Moreover, we perform a similar evaluation of the $\Lambda$CDM model considering Planck and~DESI best-fit parameters. In addition, we implemented robustness tests regarding Gaussian Process reconstruction to support our results.

 - **Abstract**
 SRGA J144459.2$-$604207 is a newly confirmed accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar and type I X-ray burster. We present the broadband X-ray timing and spectral behaviors of SRGA J144459.2$-$604207 during its 2024 outburst. The data were collected from NICER, Einstein Probe, IXPE, Insight-HXMT, NuSTAR and INTEGRAL observations. X-ray pulsations have been detected for the 1.5$-$90 keV energy range throughout the `ON' phase of the outburst from MJD $\sim 60355-60385$. We refined the orbital and spin ephemerides assuming a circular orbit, and found that the pulsar was in a spin-up state during MJD $\sim$ 60361--60377 showing a significant spin-up rate $\dot{\nu}$ of $(3.15\pm 0.36)\times10^{-13}~{\rm Hz~s^{-1}}$. Around MJD $\sim 60377$ a swing was detected in the spin evolution accompanied by significantly enhanced pulsed emission. We studied the pulse profile morphology during the X-ray bursts as observed by Insight-HXMT, IXPE and NuSTAR. During the bursts, pulsations were detected across the 2$-$60 keV with shapes broadly consistent with those observed for the persistent emission. We found, however, that the `burst' pulse profiles exhibit significant phase offsets relative to the pre- and post-burst profiles. These offsets systematically decrease with increasing energy, $\Delta \phi\approx0.15$, 0.11 and 0.02 for IXPE, Insight-HXMT ME and HE in 2$-$8, 5$-$30 and 20$-$60 keV, respectively, and $\Delta \phi\approx0.21$, 0.10 and 0.07 for NuSTAR in 3$-$10, 20$-$35 and 35$-$60 keV, respectively, compared to the pre- and post-burst profiles. We performed a joint spectral analysis of quasi-simultaneous NICER, NuSTAR, and Insight-HXMT data for two epochs. The resulting spectra from both observations were consistent and well-described by an absorbed thermal Comptonization model, nthcomp, plus relativistic reflection, relxillCp.

 - **Abstract**
 The Carina Nebula is an active star-forming region with several open clusters rich in massive OB stars, thus making it an optimal target for studying stellar properties such as rotation for large samples of these early-type stars. We studied a sample of early-type stars probable members of the 8 open clusters in the Carina Complex. The observational data consist of high-resolution spectra from the Gaia-ESO public Spectroscopic Survey. Astrometric and photometric data from Gaia EDR3 and radial velocities measured from the observed spectra are used to confirm the cluster members. The projected rotational velocities of 330 early-type stars of Carina are derived from the widths of \ion{He}{i} lines at 4388 and 4471 Å. The reported \Vsini\ values are the first estimates for 222 early-type stars. The \Vsini\ distribution for the Carina clusters peaks at $\sim$100-150 \kms, consistent with the distributions for B stars in Galactic clusters. \Vsini\ estimates for stars members of the clusters Trumpler 15, Collinder 228, Collinder 232, and Bochum 11 are presented for the first time in the literature. For a subsample of stars with earlier spectral types from B0 to B3, we find a bimodal distribution, with a third, small peak towards the upper values of \Vsini. When the full sample is split according to the parent cluster, we find that the oldest cluster in our sample, NGC 3293, presents a higher concentration of rapidly rotating stars. In contrast, Collinder 228 presents a larger number of stars with lower \Vsini.

 - **Abstract**
 High-resolution optical spectra of sixteen red giants, two early asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, and two supergiants, having no/minimal to super lithium (Li)-rich abundances, are analyzed to investigate the helium (He)-enhancement. The spectra of eight giants were obtained from the Himalayan Chandra Telescope, and for the rest of the program stars the spectral data were collected from various public archives. Our detailed abundance analyses of the program stars involve the determination of stellar parameters and abundances for about 20 elements among the key abundances of He, Li, C, N, O and the 12C/13C ratios. The difference in the Mg-abundance derived from Mg I lines and the MgH band, and the difference in carbon abundance from C I and the CH-band, are used as a clue to the mild hydrogen-deficiency/helium-enhancement. From this analysis, four red giants, an early-AGB star and a supergiant star were found to be enhanced in helium. All these He-enhanced stars are also found to be super Li-rich except for the supergiant. Since the He-rich red giants are Li-rich as well, this implies, that He-enrichment is accompanied by Li-enrichment but not vice-versa. This is the first spectroscopic measurement of photospheric He-abundance in normal and Li-rich field giants. The Li-enrichment is observed across the giant branch from RGB-bump (KIC 9821622) to AGB phase, unlike that expected from the RGB-tip to RC-phase. A plausible scenario for the enrichment of He and as well as Li in giants is the fresh synthesis of Li in the interiors of giants and dredging up along with He to the surface, from deeper layers. However, there could be multiple scenarios operating in tandem. This analysis of He- and Li-enrichment along with other key elements provides more insights to decipher the mystery of Li-enrichment in giants.

 - **Abstract**
 As an update on the initial findings of DESI, the new results provide the first hint of potential deviations from a cosmological constant ($w=-1$), which, if confirmed with significance $>5\sigma$, will falsify the $\Lambda$CDM model. We consider a novel generalised form of an emergent dark energy model and confront this through various data sets (Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data from Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Data Release (DESI DR2), Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) compilation, and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) distance priors) and simultaneously constrain the dark energy (DE) equation of state and energy density $f_{DE}(z)$. The results for the joint posteriors of cosmological parameters and the reconstructed dark energy EoS $w(z)$ with the energy density $f_{DE}(z)$ for various combinations of data sets are discussed, which favors quintessence nature. Specifically, $w(0) = -0.820$ with DESI DR2 + CMB, $-0.845$ with DESI DR2 + CMB + PP$^+$, $-0.828$ with DESI DR2 + CMB + Union3, and $-0.804$ with DESI DR2 + CMB + DESY5. We adopted a novel method to probe shifts in the generalized emergent dark energy (GEDE) parameter ($\Delta$) by mapping 2D marginalized posterior distributions in the $\Delta-\Omega_{m0}$ plane. Our analysis consistently reveals a preference for negative $\Delta$ across multiple combinations of observational datasets. Incorporating these values into the matter power spectrum further supports the GEDE framework's viability. We quantify the model's performance using the Bayes factor.

 - **Abstract**
 Carbon dioxide is one of the three most abundant species within the ice mantles around dust grains inside molecular clouds. Since a substantial amount of interstellar grains is made of siliceous materials, we have studied the infrared profile of CO2 deposited on top of a bare and ice-coated amorphous silicate (MgFeSiO4) film using reflection absorption infrared spectroscopy (RAIRS). In contrast to a metal surface, the CO2 IR profile shows a relaxation of the metal surface selection rule in the presence of the bare MgFeSiO4 dust grain analog, which brings the IR profile closer to the observational spectra while maintaining the sensitivity of RAIRS. Experiments with the underlying CO and CH4 ices show that their presence facilitates structural changes toward crystalline ice for the deposited CO2 at much lower temperatures than on the polar ice layers. Warming-up experiments of CO2 showed that it tends to stay on the silicate surface for much longer than on the gold surface without the silicate layer. We noticed for the first time a split in the 13CO2 IR feature on the pure or ice-covered silicate grain as a marker for the onset of diffusion. The laboratory 13CO2 profile then closely resembles recent JWST observations of this feature around young and embedded protostars, suggesting that it can be linked to the observed feature.

 - **Abstract**
 In star-forming regions, molecular cloud history and dynamics set the trend in the chemical composition. Ice formation, in particular, is affected by the evolution of physical conditions, which can lead to different ice compositions within the same cloud. In cold cores with medium densities >1e4 cm-3, low temperatures <15 K, and low UV radiation <G0, most COMs are formed on dust grain surfaces and are released back into the gas phase through non-thermal mechanisms. Studying both gas- and solid-phases can help observers to add constraints on the chemical and dynamical evolution of cold cores. We present a study of the cold core L694, observed with the IRAM 30m telescope. Observed species include CO (and its isotopologues) and CH3OH. We applied an inverted non-LTE radiative transfer code in order to obtain gas-phase abundances by deriving the column densities of the detected species from the spectroscopic parameters of the targeted molecular transitions, and from physical parameters derived from archival observations. This allowed us to probe the molecular abundances as a function of density and visual extinction. In parallel, we ran chemical models (both static and dynamic) to constrain the evolution time of the core by directly comparing the observations with the model outputs. We then compared the compositions of the cold cores L429-C and L694. The gas-phase abundances in L694 all exhibit a common depletion profile (with high variability in the depletion factor), as the core is identified to be in a more advanced (infalling) state compared to L429-C. The physical parameters of the two cores are, however, very similar, leading to close evolutionary timescales in our static models. The dynamical model fails to reproduce the CO gas-phase abundances at high density, predicting an evolutionary timescale that is too short compared to static models.

 - **Abstract**
 The existence of billion-solar-mass quasars at redshifts $z \gtrsim 7$ poses a formidable challenge to theories of black hole formation, requiring pathways for the rapid growth of massive seeds. Population III.1 stars, forming in pristine, dense dark matter (DM) minihalos, are compelling progenitors. This study presents a suite of stellar evolution models for accreting Pop III.1 protostars, calculated with the \textsc{GENEC} code. We systematically explore a wide parameter space, spanning ambient WIMP densities of $\rho_\chi \sim 10^{12}\mbox{-}10^{16}\,\mathrm{GeV\,cm^{-3}}$ and gas accretion rates of $10^{-3}\mbox{-}10^{-1}\,M_\odot\,\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$, to quantify the effects of DM annihilation. A central finding is that for a protostar to grow to supermassive scales ($\gtrsim 10^5 \, M_{\odot}$), the ambient DM density in the immediate vicinity of the star must exceed a critical threshold of $\rho_{\chi} \gtrsim 5 \times 10^{14} \, \text{GeV cm}^{-3}$. The energy injected by WIMP annihilation inflates the protostar, lowering its surface temperature, which suppresses the ionizing feedback that would otherwise halt accretion and significantly delays the onset of hydrogen fusion. This heating also governs the star's final fate: in dense halos ($\rho_\chi \gtrsim 10^{15}\,\mathrm{GeV\,cm^{-3}}$), stars remain stable against general relativistic instability beyond $10^6 \, M_{\odot}$, whereas at lower densities ($\rho_\chi \lesssim 10^{13}\,\mathrm{GeV\,cm^{-3}}$), they collapse at masses of $\sim 5 \times 10^5 \, M_{\odot}$. Once the DM fuel is exhausted and core burning commences, the protostar contracts and its ionising photon output can reach very high levels $\sim 10^{53} s^{-1}$. These distinct evolutionary phases offer clear observational signatures for the JWST, providing a robust, physically-grounded pathway for forming heavy black hole seeds in the early universe.

 - **Abstract**
 Titan, with its thick and hazy atmosphere, is a key world in our solar system for understanding light scattering processes. NASA's Cassini mission monitored Titan between 2004 and 2017, where the derived dataset includes a large number of whole disk observations. Once spatially integrated, these whole disk observations reveal Titan's phase-dependent brightness which can serve as an analog for how hazy worlds might appear around other stars. To explore Titan's phase curve, we present a pipeline for whole disk Titan observations acquired by the Cassini Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) spanning 0.9--5.1 $\mu$m. Application of the pipeline finds over 4,400 quality spatially- and spectrally-resolved datacubes that were then integrated over Titan's disk to yield phase curves spanning 2--165\degree{} in phase angle. Spectra at near-full phase provide a useful approximation for Titan's geometric albedo, thus extending the spectral coverage of previous work. Crescent phase brightness enhancements in the Cassini VIMS phase curves are often more extreme than analogous results seen at optical wavelengths, which can be explained by atmospheric transparency and haze scattering processes. These results provide validation opportunities for exoplanet-focused spectral models and also shed light on how extreme aerosol forward scattering could influence exoplanet observations and interpretations.

 - **Abstract**
 Rocky exoplanet characterization has been a top priority for early James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) science operations. Several milestones have been achieved, including the most precise rocky planet transmission spectra measured to date, and the first detection of thermal emission for rocky worlds below 800 Kelvin. Despite these advances, no atmospheres have been definitively detected. Several transmission spectra show tentative evidence for molecular absorption features, but these hints are marginally significant and the spectra may be affected by stellar contamination. Features from many plausible atmospheres, including those dominated by oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide, are below the current noise level. Meanwhile, the emerging picture from thermal emission spectra is that the planets have hot daysides, consistent with either a bare rock composition or low surface pressure atmospheres (< 10 bar). Higher surface pressures and high carbon dioxide abundances are generally ruled out, assuming cloud-free atmosphere models. The absence of strong CO$_2$ features hints at a limited initial volatile inventory or rapid atmospheric escape during the planets' early lifetimes. Taken together, these results motivate a push towards higher precision data, as well as observations of cooler planets that may be more likely to retain atmospheres. As a goal for future transmission spectroscopy, we suggest a "five scale height challenge," to achieve the precision necessary to detect CO$_2$ features in nitrogen-rich atmospheres. Detecting rocky planet atmospheres remains challenging, but with JWST's excellent performance and a continuing investment of telescope time, we are optimistic these uncharted atmospheres will be detected in coming years.

          A binary origin of ultra-long period radio pulsars

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a possible binary evolution model for the formation of ultra-long period pulsars (ULPPs). The model involves two key stages: first, a neutron star (NS) in wide binaries undergoes an effective spin-down phase through wind-fed accretion from its massive stellar companion; second, the supernova explosion of the companion leads to the disruption of the binary system, and produces two isolated compact stars. One of the them is the first-born, slowly rotating NSs, and our binary and spin evolution calculations show that the spin periods range from $\lesssim 0.1$ s to $\gtrsim 10^8$ s. This offers a possible formation channel for some of the long-period radio transients. We estimate that the formation rate of such systems in the Milky Way is approximately about $10^{-6}$ $\rm yr^{-1}$.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the consequences of non-ideal mixing between silicate, iron metal, and hydrogen for the structures of the cores of sub-Neptunes with implications for super-Earths, warm Neptunes, and ice giants. A method of extrapolating what we know about the miscibility in the three bounding binary systems MgSiO$_3$-H$_2$, MgSiO$_3$-Fe, and Fe-H$_2$ to the ternary composition space is used to deduce the phase equilibria of this system at relevant temperature and pressure conditions. We find that while separate silicate and metal phases can exist at shallow depths, the phases become entirely miscible deeper in the cores, thus altering the density structure of the cores. The assumption that the interiors of large rocky planets, either with extant magma oceans beneath H$_2$-rich envelopes, or evolved from such bodies, are composed of a differentiated metal core overlain by a silicate mantle is inconsistent with our understanding of the phase equilibria of these bodies.

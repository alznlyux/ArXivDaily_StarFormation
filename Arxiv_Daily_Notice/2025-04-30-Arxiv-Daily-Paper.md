 - **Abstract**
 Icy satellites host topography at many length scales, from rifts and craters on the small end to equatorial-pole shell thickness differences that are comparable to these bodies' circumference. The rate of topographic evolution depends on the rheology of the ice shell, the difference in density between the shell and potential global subsurface oceans, the ice shell thickness distribution, as well as the rate of tidal heat dissipation in the shell. Here we analyze relaxation of topography starting from the Stokes equations for viscous fluid flow. We write out the shallow-shell models (with and without a rigid crust) and compare the resulting time scales to previous work. Using three-dimensional linearized flow for small-amplitude topographic perturbations, we recover the time scales of relaxation from the shallow models as well as shells that are not shallow. For a shell of constant viscosity, we find that the topographic relaxation time scale is constant for wavelengths larger than the ice thickness, an idea that runs contrary to the existing paradigm. For a shell with a viscosity that decreases exponentially with depth, we show numerically that there is a regime where the larger viscosity outer crust acts as a nearly rigid boundary. In this case, the relaxation time scale depends on the wavelength. For the largest spatial scales, the time scale becomes independent of wavelength again and the value is set by the average shell viscosity. However, the spatial scale that this transition occurs at becomes larger as the viscosity contrast increases, limiting the applicability of the scale-independent relaxation rate. These results for the relaxation of topography have implications for interpreting relaxed crater profiles, inferences of ice shell thickness from topography, and upcoming observations from missions to the outer solar system.

 - **Abstract**
 At the Galactic Centre, we can expect a population of a few tens of early extreme-mass ratio inspirals (E-EMRIs) and extremely large mass ratio inspirals (XMRIs). Depending on their evolutionary stage, they can be highly eccentric, with moderate signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of tens or hundreds, or nearly circular, with SNRs as large as a few thousand. Their individual signals combine into a common signal, which can complicate the resolution of other types of sources. We have calculated the foreground signal of continuous E-EMRIs and XMRIs using a catalog based on the expected number of sources and a realistic phase-space distribution. The forest of E-EMRIs will cover a large portion of the LISA sensitivity curve, obscuring the signals of some massive black hole binaries, verification binaries, and harmonics of EMRIs in their polychromatic phase. The combined signal from XMRIs will be much weaker but still affect intermediate-mass black hole binaries. Due to the large SNR, this forest can be also found in other galactic nuclei, such as that of the Andromeda galaxy. Even under conservative assumptions, the forest created by E-EMRIs and XMRIs in our Galactic Centre will likely pose a challenge for resolving other types of sources, as their contribution is non-coherent and exhibits large SNRs.

          A Time-Dependent Solution for GSN 069 Disk Evolution: The Nature of 'Long-Lived' TDEs and Implications for QPE Models

 - **Abstract**
 We present the implementation of a fully time-dependent relativistic disk model - based on the light curve fitting package FitTeD - into the X-ray spectral fitting environment, pyXspec. This implementation enables simultaneous fitting of multi-epoch and multi-wavelength spectral data, where the only free parameters are those describing the black hole and the initial conditions, while the subsequent evolution is fully governed by the dynamical equations of an evolving accretion flow. We apply the model to fit seven epochs of X-ray spectra and two epochs of UV spectra of the 'long-lived' tidal disruption event (TDE) and quasi-periodic eruption (QPE) source GSN 069, spanning from its discovery in 2010 through late-2019. Our results show that such 'long-lived', X-ray-bright TDEs - of which GSN 069 is a prime, but not unique, example-can be naturally explained within the same framework as events with shorter-lived X-ray emission, such as ASASSN-14li and AT2019dsg. Their key distinction lies in the 'viscous' timescale parameter - tied to the disk's stress and angular momentum transport efficiency - which should be treated as a free parameter when modeling the disk evolution of transient events. We examine the implications for QPE models by tracking the time evolution of disk properties such as mass surface density and accretion rate. We show that existing QPE models cannot reproduce the observed connection between the presence (e.g., 2018) or absence (e.g., 2014) of eruptions and disk properties. In the context of orbiter-disk collision models, the change in mass surface density appears insufficient to explain the needed variation in the eruption's temperature. The absence of eruptions in GSN 069 in 2014 remains a major challenge for QPE models.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the analysis of four unambiguous planets and one possible planet from the subprime fields ($\Gamma \leq 1~{\rm hr}^{-1}$) of the 2017 Korea Microlensing Telescope Network (KMTNet) microlensing survey, to complete the KMTNet AnomalyFinder planetary sample for the 2017 subprime fields. They are KMT-2017-BLG-0849, KMT-2017-BLG-1057, OGLE-2017-BLG-0364, and KMT-2017-BLG-2331 (unambiguous), as well as KMT-2017-BLG-0958 (possible). For the four unambiguous planets, the mean planet-host mass ratios, $q$, are $(1.0, 1.2, 4.6, 13) \times 10^{-4}$, the median planetary masses are $(6.4, 24, 76, 171)~M_{\oplus}$ and the median host masses are $(0.19, 0.57, 0.49, 0.40)~M_{\odot}$ from a Bayesian analysis. We have completed the AnomalyFinder planetary sample from the first 4-year KMTNet data (2016--2019), with 112 unambiguous planets in total, which nearly tripled the microlensing planetary sample. The ``sub-Saturn desert'' ($\log q = \left[-3.6, -3.0\right]$) found in the 2018 and 2019 KMTNet samples is confirmed by the 2016 and 2017 KMTNet samples.

 - **Abstract**
 Exoplanets classified as super-Earths are commonly observed on short period orbits, close to their host stars, but their abundance on wider orbits is poorly constrained. Gravitational microlensing is sensitive to exoplanets on wide orbits. We observed the microlensing event OGLE-2016-BLG-0007, which indicates an exoplanet with a planet-to-star mass ratio roughly double the Earth-Sun mass-ratio, on an orbit longer than Saturn's. We combine this event with a larger sample from a microlensing survey to determine the distribution of mass ratios for planets on wide orbits. We infer there are $\sim 0.35$ super-Earth planets per star on Jupiter-like orbits. The observations are most consistent with a bimodal distribution, with separate peaks for super-Earths and gas giants. We suggest that this reflects differences in their formation processes.

          The chemical enrichment histories across the Milky Way disk

 - **Abstract**
 The variation of metal production over time and its dilution in the interstellar medium depend on the star formation and gas accretion rates. Measuring age-chemistry relations across the Milky Way disk provides key constraints on the gas accretion and star formation histories, and offers insight into the birth locations of stars. We present a study based on a sample of nearly 30000 dwarf stars from the APOGEE DR17 survey within 2 kpc of the Sun, for which we measure accurate ages. Various parameter combinations are tested to optimize stellar age determination from isochrones. The resulting age-chemistry relations for a selected subsample of 12000 stars are interpreted with the aid of a chemical evolution model. The data reveal a well-defined, tight thick disk sequence, characterized by high [alpha/Fe], subsolar metallicities, and ages older than 8 Gyr. The thin disk, with lower [alpha/Fe] and younger ages, exhibits a wide spread in metallicity at all ages, with apparent structures. Dividing the sample by guiding radius into inner, intermediate, and outer disks shows distinct chemical evolution patterns. The inner disk displays a monotonic, homogeneous chemical evolution with little dispersion, while the outer disk shows little metallicity increase over the past 8 Gyr. The solar neighborhood appears as a mixture, not only due to stellar migration but also because the chemical evolution of the ISM in this intermediate region results from the mixing of gas from the inner and outer disks. In particular, we demonstrate that the solar vicinity experienced a decrease in the mean ISM metallicity 7-9 Gyr ago. A plausible explanation involves a radial inflow of lower-metallicity gas from the outer disk at that time, which diluted the gas leftover by the thick disk formation, contributing to the observed metallicity gradient in the intermediate region.

          The H2 Glow of a Quiescent Molecular Cloud Observed with JWST

 - **Abstract**
 We report JWST MIRI/MRS observations of the H2 S(1) 17.04 micron transition in two regions in the boundary of the Taurus Molecular Cloud. The two regions, denoted Edge (near the relatively sharp boundary of the 13CO J=1-0 emission) and Peak (the location of the strongest H2 emission observed with Spitzer), have average intensities of 14.5 MJy/sr and 32.1 MJy/sr, respectively. We find small scale structures of characteristic size 1.0 to 2.5 arcseconds, corresponding to 140 AU to 350 AU, with characteristic intensity above the extended background of 10 MJy/sr, corresponding to a J = 3 column density of 1.6x1017/cm2. The most plausible explanation for the observed intensities from level 845 K above the J = 1 ortho-H2 ground state level is excitation by collisions with H2 molecules (the hydrogen in this region being predominantly molecular). Two mechanisms, turbulent dissipation and shocks, have been proposed for heating of localized regions of the ISM to temperatures ~1000 K to explain abundances of and emission from particular molecules. While we cannot determine unique values of density and kinetic temperature, the solutions in best agreement with predictions of shock models are H2 density = 370 /cm3 and kinetic temperature = 1000 K. The total H2 column density of the small-scale structures under these conditions is ~8x1017/cm2. This first direct detection of heated tiny scale structure in the quiescent molecular interstellar medium has significant implications for the physical structure of this phase of the ISM and maintaining supersonic motions within it.

 - **Abstract**
 The COSMOS HI Large Extragalactic Survey (CHILES) Continuum & Polarization (CHILES Con Pol) survey is an ultra-deep continuum imaging study of the COSMOS field conducted using the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array. We obtained 1000 hours of L-band ($\lambda = 20$ cm) observations across four spectral windows (1.063-1.831 GHz) on a single pointing and produced a confusion limited image with an apparent RMS noise of 1.67 $\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$ with a synthesized beam of 5$.\!\!^{\prime\prime}$5$\times$5$.\!\!^{\prime\prime}$0. This paper reports a 1.4 GHz radio continuum source catalog containing 1678 sources detected above 7$\sigma$ (flux densities greater than 11.7 $\mu$Jy), identified using two independent source extraction programs applied to the Stokes $I$ image. Resolved sources dominate at flux density S$_{1.4GHz} \ge 42 $\mu$Jy. Radio spectral index for each source was derived using a power-law fit across the four spectral windows, and we found that a robust spectral index measurement requires a total signal-to-noise ratio of at least 20. Comparisons with previous 1.4 GHz radio continuum surveys show good overall consistency, but evidence for a high degree of catalog incompleteness and the effects of source confusion are evident for some of the earlier studies.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an X-ray/UV reverberation analysis of NGC 7469 across 210 days, using daily NICER observations with contemporaneous monitoring by Swift UVOT+XRT. We model the X-ray spectrum with a power law continuum and a soft excess during each NICER epoch. These emission sources demonstrate correlated flux variability with a lag consistent with zero days. We find that the power law emission is consistent with a compact X-ray corona, and that the soft excess can be explainedby reflected coronal emission from the inner accretion disk. We test the relationship between changes in the flux of the X-ray corona and the UVW2 continuum, finding strong correlation and a negative X-ray lag of less than one day. This is consistent with a scenario in which the X-ray corona drives the UVW2 light curve through thermal reprocessing

 We introduce and describe the CHILES Continuum \& Polarization (CHILES Con Pol) Survey, a 1000 hour 1.4 GHz wideband full polarization radio continuum deepfield with the Very Large Array (VLA), commensurate with the CHILES HI deepfield. We describe the observational configuration, outline the calibration of the data, and discuss the effect of Radio Frequency Interference on different observing epochs. In addition, we present a novel radio continuum imaging strategy, using well known baseline subtraction techniques in radio spectral data, and discuss the applications to the removal of artifacts from sources far from the field center. Additionally, we discuss the nature of a low-level image-wide offset, the so-called ``negative bowl" and simulate our observations in order that we may both properly understand and correct for this artifact. Using these techniques, we present the first total intensity image of the data which achieves an r.m.s. noise of 1.3 $\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$ with a synthesized beam of 4.5\arcsec x 4.0\arcsec, the most sensitive L-band image ever taken at this resolution. We then place this image into the broader context of 1.4 GHz radio continuum surveys in the literature, in terms of image sensitivity and fidelity, and $\mu$Jy level source counts and P(D) analysis.

 - **Abstract**
 Metal-poor M subdwarfs are among the oldest stellar populations and carry valuable information about the chemical enrichment history of the Milky Way. The measurements of chemical abundances of these stars therefore provide essential insights into the nucleosynthesis in the early stages of the Galaxy's formation. We present the detailed spectroscopic analysis of a nearby metal-poor M subdwarf, LHS 174 from its high-resolution optical spectrum, and apply our previously developed spectral fitting code, \texttt{AutoSpecFit}, to measure the abundances of five elements:[O/H]=$-$0.519$\pm$0.081, [Ca/H]=$-$0.753$\pm$0.177, [Ti/H]=$-$0.711$\pm$0.144, [V/H]=$-$1.026$\pm$0.077, and [Fe/H]=$-$1.170$\pm$0.135. We compare the abundances of O, Ti, and Fe derived from this work and those from previous studies and demonstrate the observed data is clearly better matched with the synthetic model generated based on our abundances than those from the other analyses. The accuracy of inferred stellar abundances strongly depends on the accuracy of physical parameters, which motivates us to develop a reliable technique to determine the parameters of low-mass M dwarfs more accurately ever than before and infer abundances with smaller uncertainties.

 - **Abstract**
 Two classes of Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), corresponding to the short/hard and the long/soft events, with a putative intermediate class, are typically considered in the observer frame. However, when considering GRB characteristics in the cosmological rest frame, the boundary between the classes becomes blurred. The goal of this research is to check for the evidences of a third "intermediate" class of GRBs and investigate how the transformation from the observer to the rest frame affects the hardness-duration-based classification. We applied fits with skewed and non-skewed (symmetric) Gaussian and Student distributions to the sample of 409 GRBs with reliably measured redshifts to cluster the bursts on the hardness (Ep) - duration (T90) plane. We found that, based on AIC/BIC criteria, the statistically preferred number of clusters on the GRB rest-frame hardnesses-duration plane does not exceed two. We also assess the robustness of the clustering technique. We did not find any solid evidence of an intermediate GRB class on the rest-frame hardness-duration plane.

 - **Abstract**
 Time-domain surveys have advanced astronomical research by revealing diverse variable phenomena, from stellar flares to transient events. The scale and complexity of survey data, along with the demand for rapid classification, present significant challenges for analysis. While machine learning offers solutions, most existing models are tailored to single tasks, struggle to generalize, and depend heavily on large, accurately labeled datasets. We introduce FALCO, a foundation model for astronomical light curve analysis in time-domain astronomy. This work presents the initial version of FALCO trained via self-supervised learning on unlabeled Kepler light curves using a Transformer-based architecture. The model has been evaluated on three distinct tasks and demonstrates strong generalization: achieving 95 percent accuracy in stellar variability classification across eight classes, an overall RMSE of 0.1305 dex in surface gravity estimation (notably improved to below 0.08 dex when log g is less than 1, and approximately 0.02 dex near log g equals 3), and 87 percent precision in flare identification. These results highlight the model's versatility and ability to learn generalizable representations from light curves, enabling straightforward adaptation to diverse tasks. We further analyze the impact of model scaling and sequence length, finding performance improves with larger models and longer input sequences. We also apply FALCO to derive surface gravity (log g) measurements for 179,732 Kepler stars from their light curves.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the largest catalog to \modify{date} of triply ionized carbon (CIV) absorbers detected in quasar spectra from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument. Using an automated matched-kernel convolution method with adaptive signal-to-noise thresholds, we identify $101,487$ CIV systems in the redshift range $ 1.4 < z < 4.8 $ from $300,637$ quasar spectra. Completeness is estimated via Monte Carlo simulations and catalog is $50\%$ complete at $\mathrm{EW}_{\mathrm{CIV}} \geq 0.4$ Angstrom. The differential equivalent width frequency distribution declines exponentially and shows weak redshift evolution. The absorber incidence per unit comoving path increases by a factor of $2-5$ from $ z \approx 4.5 $ to $ z \approx 1.4 $, with stronger redshift evolution for strong systems. Using column densities derived from the apparent optical depth method, we constrain the cosmic mass density of CIV, $\Omega_{\mathrm{CIV}}$, which increases by a factor of $\sim 3.6$ from $ (0.46 \pm 0.01) \times 10^{-8} $ at $ z \approx 4.5 $ to $ (1.65 \pm 0.04) \times 10^{-8} $ at $ z \approx 1.4 $. From $ \Omega_{\rm CIV} $, we estimate a lower limit on intergalactic medium metallicity $ \log(Z_{\rm IGM}/Z_{\odot}) \gtrsim -3.5 $ at $ z \sim 2.3 $, with a smooth decline at higher redshifts. These trends trace the cosmic star formation history and HeII photoheating rate, suggesting a link between CIV enrichment, star formation, and UV background over $\sim 3$ Gyr. The catalog also provides a critical resource for future studies connecting circumgalactic metals to galaxy evolution, especially near cosmic noon.

 - **Abstract**
 We present optical observations of Halley type comet 12P/Pons-Brooks on its approach to perihelion. The comet was active even in the first observations at about 8 au. Starting at 4 au, 12P exhibited an extraordinary series of outbursts, in which the brightness changed by a factor up to 100 and the coma morphology transformed under the action of radiation pressure into a distinctive ``horned'' appearance. Individual outburst dust masses are several x 1e9 kg, with kinetic energies 1e14 J, release times 1e4 s and effective power 1e10 W. These properties are most consistent with, although do not definitively establish, an origin by the crystallization of amorphous water ice with the related release of trapped supervolatile gases. This interpretation is supported by the observation that the specific outburst energy and the specific crystallization energy are comparable (both near 1e5 J kg/s.

 We report five nearby ($d_{\mathrm{helio}} < 5$ kpc) stellar substructures in the Galactic halo from a subset of 138,661 stars in the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Milky Way Survey Year 1 Data Release. With an unsupervised clustering algorithm, HDBSCAN*, these substructures are independently identified in Integrals of Motion ($E_{\mathrm{tot}}$, $L_{\mathrm z}$, $\log{J_r}$, $\log{J_z}$) space and Galactocentric cylindrical velocity space ($V_{R}$, $V_{\phi}$, $V_{z}$). We associate all identified clusters with known nearby substructures (Helmi streams, M18-Cand10/MMH-1, Sequoia, Antaeus, and ED-2) previously reported in various studies. With metallicities precisely measured by DESI, we confirm that the Helmi streams, M18-Cand10, and ED-2 are chemically distinct from local halo stars. We have characterised the chemodynamic properties of each dynamic group, including their metallicity dispersions, to associate them with their progenitor types (globular cluster or dwarf galaxy). Our approach for searching substructures with HDBSCAN* reliably detects real substructures in the Galactic halo, suggesting that applying the same method can lead to the discovery of new substructures in future DESI data. With more stars from future DESI data releases and improved astrometry from the upcoming {\it Gaia} Data Release 4, we will have a more detailed blueprint of the Galactic halo, offering a significant improvement in our understanding of the formation and evolutionary history of the Milky Way Galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) is a massively parallel spectroscopic survey on the Mayall telescope at Kitt Peak, which has released measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations determined from over 14 million extragalactic targets. We combine DESI Data Release 2 with CMB datasets to search for evidence of matter conversion to dark energy (DE), focusing on a scenario mediated by stellar collapse to cosmologically-coupled black holes (CCBH). In this physical model, which has the same number of free parameters as $\Lambda$CDM, DE production is determined by the cosmic star formation rate density (SFRD), allowing for distinct early- and late-time cosmologies. Using two SFRDs to bracket current observations, we find that the CCBH model: accurately recovers the cosmological expansion history, agrees with early-time baryon abundance measured by BBN, reduces tension with the local distance ladder, and relaxes constraints on the summed neutrino mass $\sum m_\nu$. For these SFRDs, we find a peaked positive $\sum m_\nu < 0.149\,\rm eV$ (95\% confidence) and $\sum m_\nu = 0.106^{+0.050}_{-0.069}\,\rm eV$ respectively, in good agreement with lower limits from neutrino oscillation experiments. A peak in $\sum m_\nu > 0$ results from late-time baryon consumption in the CCBH scenario and is expected to be a general feature of any model that converts sufficient matter to dark energy during and after reionization.

 - **Abstract**
 The detection of the gravitational wave (GW) event GW190521 raises questions about the formation of black holes within the pair-instability mass gap (PIBHs). We propose that Population III (Pop III) star clusters significantly contribute to events similar to GW190521. We perform $N$-body simulations and find that PIBHs can form from stellar collisions or binary black hole (BBH) mergers, with the latter accounting for 90\% of the contributions. Due to GW recoil during BBH mergers, approximately 10-50% of PIBHs formed via BBH mergers escape from clusters, depending on black hole spins and cluster escape velocities. The remaining PIBHs can participate in secondary and multiple BBH formation events, contributing to GW events. Assuming Pop III stars form in massive clusters (initially 100,000 $M_\odot$) with a top-heavy initial mass function, the average merger rates for GW events involving PIBHs with 0% and 100% primordial binaries are $0.005$ and $0.017$ $\text{yr}^{-1} \text{Gpc}^{-3}$, respectively, with maximum values of $0.030$ and $0.106$ $\text{yr}^{-1} \text{Gpc}^{-3}$. If Pop III stars form in low-mass clusters (initial mass of $1000M_\odot$ and $10000 M_\odot$), the merger rate is comparable with a 100% primordial binary fraction but significantly lower without primordial binaries. We also calculate the characteristic strains of the GW events in our simulations and find that about 43.4% (LISA) 97.8% (Taiji) and 66.4% (Tianqin) of these events could potentially be detected by space-borne detectors, including LISA, Taiji, and TianQin. The next-generation GW detectors such as DECIGO, ET, and CE can nearly cover all these signals.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of a progenitor candidate for the Type IIb SN 2024abfo using multi-epoch pre-explosion images from the Hubble Space Telescope and the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey. The progenitor exhibited a ~0.7 mag decline in F814W from 2001 to 2013, followed by significant brightness and color fluctuations in the g, r and z bands. This is the first time that a variable progenitor has been found for a SN IIb. We suggest that the variability is caused by intrinsic changes in the progenitor star instead of varying obscuration by circumstellar dust. Our results show that the progenitor of SN 2024abfo was likely a yellow supergiant star with an initial mass of 12--14, 14--15 and 15--18 Msun for different assumed values of circumstellar reddening of E(B-V)_CSM = 0, 0.1 and 0.2 mag. Our study underscores the critical role of multi-epoch imaging surveys in revealing the final stages of core-collapse supernovae progenitors.

 - **Abstract**
 Sub-Neptunes, the most common planet type, remain poorly understood. Their atmospheres are expected to be diverse, but their compositions are challenging to determine, even with JWST. Here, we present the first JWST spectroscopic study of the warm sub-Neptune GJ3090b (2.13R$_\oplus$, Teq~700 K) which orbits an M2V star, making it a favourable target for atmosphere characterization. We observed four transits of GJ3090b; two each using JWST NIRISS/SOSS and NIRSpec/G395H, yielding wavelength coverage from 0.6-5.2 $\mu$m. We detect the signature of the 10833 Å metastable Helium triplet at a statistical significance of 5.5$\sigma$ with an amplitude of 434$\pm$79 ppm, marking the first such detection in a sub-Neptune with JWST. This amplitude is significantly smaller than predicted by solar-metallicity forward models, suggesting a metal-enriched atmosphere which decreases the mass-loss rate and attenuates the Helium feature amplitude. Moreover, we find that stellar contamination, in the form of the transit light source effect, dominates the NIRISS transmission spectra, with unocculted spot and faculae properties varying across the two visits separated in time by approximately six months. Free retrieval analyses on the NIRSpec/G395H spectrum find tentative evidence for highly muted features and a lack of CH4. These findings are best explained by a high metallicity atmosphere (>100x solar at 3$\sigma$ confidence, for clouds at $\sim \mu$bar pressures) using chemically-consistent retrievals and self-consistent model grids. Further observations of GJ3090b are needed for tighter constraints on the atmospheric abundances, and to gain a deeper understanding of the processes that led to its potential metal enrichment.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper describes the identification of Gaia counterparts of a sample of oxygen-rich AGB stars with OH maser emission as a first step towards the compilation of a general Gaia Catalogue of Galactic AGB stars. With this catalogue, tests of evolutionary models for the AGB star population in the solar neighbourhood will become feasible. We cross-matched AGB star candidates showing OH maser emission with Gaia DR3 using a cross-match with AllWISE and 2MASS as intermediate steps to avoid ambiguities. With the help of the Virtual Observatory, we retrieved photometric data from the near-ultraviolet to the far-infrared and built spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of the sources. The SEDs were fitted with theoretical models. The fit results, together with information from the literature, allowed us to clean the sample from non-AGB stars and to obtain bolometric fluxes for the AGB stars. Distances based on Gaia parallaxes were used to derive the stellar luminosities. We identified unique Gaia counterparts for 1487 OH masers. Of these, 1172 had an unambiguous classification as AGB stars; they make up the Gaia OH/IR star sample. Parallaxes with relative errors $<$20\% and astrometric excess noise $<$1.5 mas were available for 222 OH/IR stars. We conclude that the study of the AGB population in the solar neighbourhood is limited by the obscuration by circumstellar dust, as \G\ DR3 only provides parallaxes for a few of our candidates. The location of the OH/IR stars matches that of LPV discovered by \G\ in the (BP$-$RP; G$_{abs}$) diagram, but the OH/IR star sample is biased towards redder colours (BP$-$RP$>$4) mag and larger amplitudes ($>$1 mag in the G-band), which are typical for periodic large-amplitude Mira variables.

 - **Abstract**
 The tomographic Alcock-Paczynski (AP) method, developed over the past decade, exploits redshift evolution for cosmological determination, aiming to mitigate contamination from redshift distortions and capture nonlinear scale information. Marked Correlation Functions (MCFs) extend information beyond the two-point correlation. For the first time, this study integrated the tomographic AP test with MCFs to constrain the flat $w$CDM cosmology model. Our findings show that multiple density weights in MCFs outperform the traditional two-point correlation function, reducing the uncertainties of the matter density parameter $\Omega_m$ and dark energy equation of state $w$ by 48\% and 45\%, respectively. Furthermore, we introduce a novel principal component analysis (PCA) compression scheme that efficiently projects high-dimensional statistical measurements into a compact set of eigenmodes while preserving most of the cosmological information. This approach retains significantly more information than traditional coarse binning methods, which simply average adjacent bins in a lossy manner. Applying PCA compression also enables the effective use of marked correlation functions in 2D $(s,\mu)$ space, yielding an additional $\sim 50\%$ reduction in error margins. To assess robustness, we incorporate realistic redshift errors expected in future spectroscopic surveys. While these errors modestly degrade cosmological constraints, our combined framework, which utiizes MCFs and PCA compression within tomographic AP tests, is less affected and always yield to tight cosmological constraints. This scheme remains highly promising for upcoming slitless spectroscopic surveys, such as the Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST).

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive investigation into the properties of 1H 0323+342, a prominent jetted narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy. The primary objective is to understand the interplay between the relativistic jet, the hot corona, and the accretion disk around the supermassive black hole. This study spans the years 2006 to 2023, incorporating a rich dataset with 172 Swift observations, including the optical, UV, and X-ray bands, integrated with Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) observations. Spectral analysis was conducted on the X-ray observations using the XSPEC software, and the results were compared with optical, UV, and gamma-ray flux measurements and photon index values. Our key findings include the identification of three distinct zones in the X-ray photon index-flux plot, characterized by high flux and a hard photon index (zone 1), high flux and a soft photon index (zone 2), and low flux and a soft photon index (zone 3). Before 2017, 1H 0323+342 moved back and forth between zones 1 and 2; after that epoch, it transitioned to zones 2 and 3. Correspondingly, we observed a decreasing jet activity in the Fermi/LAT data and a reduction in the accretion rate in optical/UV data from Swift/UVOT. We interpret these observations in the framework of an intermittent jet scenario, driven by radiation-pressure instability in the accretion disk.

 - **Abstract**
 The evolution of dust in core-collapse supernovae (SNe), in general, is poorly constrained owing to a lack of infrared observations after a few years from explosion. Most theories of dust formation in SNe heavily rely only on SN 1987A. In the last two years, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has enabled us to probe the dust evolution in decades-old SNe, such as SN 2004et, SN 2005ip, and SN 1980K. In this paper, we present two decades of dust evolution in SN 2005af, combining early-time infrared observations with Spitzer Space Telescope and recent detections by JWST. We have used a chemical kinetic model of dust synthesis in SN ejecta to develop a template of dust evolution in SN 2005af. Moreover, using this approach, for the first time, we have separately quantified the dust formed in the pre-explosion wind that survived after the explosion, and the dust formed in the metal-rich SN ejecta post-explosion. We report that in SN 2005af, predominantly carbon-rich dust is formed in the ejecta, where the total mass of ejecta dust is about 0.02-0.03 Msun, while in the circumstellar medium the amount of surviving oxygen-rich dust is 0.001-0.004 Msun.

 - **Abstract**
 T CrB is a symbiotic recurrent nova that last erupted in 1946. Given its recurrence timescale of approximately 80 years, the next outburst is eagerly anticipated by the astronomical community. In this work, we analyse the optical light curves of T CrB, comparing recent photometric evolution with historical data to evaluate potential predictive indicators of nova eruptions. Although the "super-active" phases preceding both the 1946 and anticipated eruptions are strikingly similar, the subsequent photometric behaviour differs. We find that the decline in brightness observed in 2023, interpreted by some as a "pre-eruption dip", deviates from the deep minimum recorded prior to the 1946 event and does not reliably predict the eruption timing. Recent photometric and spectroscopic observations indicate that the system is returning to a high-accretion state. Given this, an eruption may be imminent, even without distinct precursors. While the next eruption of T CrB will be a major scientific event, its expected peak brightness of $V \sim 2$ mag highlights the importance of setting realistic public expectations for what will be a visually modest, yet astrophysically very significant, celestial event.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a timing analysis of observations with the Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope of the black hole X-ray transient Swift J1727.8-1613 during its 2023 outburst. We detect, for the first time in a black hole X-ray binary, a prominent dip at ~ 3-15 Hz in the real part of the cross spectrum between high-energy (>25 keV) and low-energy (<10 keV) photons in the Low Hard and Hard Intermediate States, during which the QPO frequency rapidly increases and then stabilizes at ~ 1.0-1.5 Hz. Remarkably, the real part of the cross spectrum reaches negative values at the frequencies around the minimum of the dip, indicative of a phase lag ranging between ${\pi}/2$ and ${\pi}$ in this frequency range. We fit the power spectra and the real and imaginary parts of the cross spectra simultaneously using a multi-Lorentzian model. Among the lag models, the Gaussian phase-lag model provides a slightly better reduced ${\chi}^2$ than the constant phase-lag and constant time-lag models, while it also alleviates the degeneracy associated with those models. From the parameters of the Lorentzian that fits the dip, we estimate the size of the accretion flow, which consistently exceeds 10,000 km as the QPO frequency increases from 0.13 Hz to 2.0 Hz. Furthermore, both the energy-dependent phase-lag and fractional-rms spectra of the dip exhibit a change in trend around 15 keV, with the phase lag dropping and rms reaching a local minimum. These spectra closely resemble the shapes predicted by the time-dependent Comptonization model, vKompth, for a low feedback factor, offering a pathway to explain the radiative properties of the corona. Additionally, the coherence function suggests a diversity of variability components, potentially arising from different parts of the corona.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the statistical distribution of source counts-in-cells in the second data release of the LOFAR Two-Metre Sky Survey (LoTSS-DR2) and we test a computationally cheap method based on the counts-in-cells to estimate the two-point correlation function. We compare three stochastic models for the counts-in-cells which result in a Poisson distribution, a compound Poisson distribution, and a negative binomial distribution. By analysing the variance of counts-in-cells for various cell sizes, we fit the reduced normalised variance to a single power-law model representing the angular two-point correlation function. Our analysis confirms that radio sources are not Poisson distributed, which is most likely due to multiple physical components of radio sources. Employing instead a Cox process, we show that there is strong evidence in favour of the negative binomial distribution above a flux density threshold of 2 mJy. Additionally, the mean number of radio components derived from the negative binomial distribution is in good agreement with corresponding estimates based on the value-added catalogue of LoTSS-DR2. The scaling of the counts-in-cells normalised variance with cell size is in good agreement with a power-law model for the angular two-point correlation. At a flux density threshold of 2 mJy and a signal-to-noise ratio of 7.5 for individual radio sources, we find that for a range of angular scales large enough to not be affected by the multi-component nature of radio sources, the value of the exponent of the power law ranges from -0.8 to -1.05. This closely aligns with findings from previous optical, infrared, and radio surveys of the large scale structure. The scaling of the counts-in-cells statistics with cell size provides a computationally efficient method to estimate the two-point correlation properties, offering a valuable tool for future large-scale structure studies.

 - **Abstract**
 Correlations between various multiwavelength (MWL) bands are an intermittent feature in blazar light curves; that is, they are observed in some instances but not in others. With the CTAO we will obtain detailed very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray light curves for many sources also during their low states, enabling detailed MWL correlation studies. For two blazars, the HBL Mrk\,421 and the FSRQ PKS\,1510-089, the long-term X-ray and optical light curves are used to induce variations in input parameters of the lepto-hadronic one-zone code OneHaLe. We show light curves in the CTA energy range for three different energy thresholds. The results are: 1) the presence of relativistic protons has a significant effect on the correlation of the light curves as the emerging pair cascade prolongs flaring states at the highest energies; and 2) comparison of the theoretical light curves with existing VHE gamma-ray data shows that both leptonic and hadronic models can only partially reproduce the data.

 - **Abstract**
 A new method for determining the nature of the orbital motion (chaotic or regular) of globular clusters in the central region of the Galaxy with a radius of 3.5 kpc, which are most affected by the bar, is proposed. The method is based on calculating the orbital power spectrum as a function of time and calculating the entropy of the power spectrum as a measure of orbital chaos. The sample includes 45 globular clusters. To form the 6D phase space required for integrating the orbits, the most accurate astrometric data to date from the Gaia satellite (Vasiliev \& Baumgardt, 2021) were used, as well as new refined average distances (Baumgardt \& Vasiliev, 2021). Orbits of globular clusters are obtained in a non-axisymmetric potential with a bar in the form of a triaxial ellipsoid embedded in an axisymmetric potential, traditionally used by us to construct orbits of globular clusters, described in detail in the paper by Bajkova et al. (2023a). The following, most realistic, bar parameters are adopted: mass $10^{10} M_\odot$, length of the major semi-axis 5 kpc, angle of rotation of the bar axis 25$^o$, angular velocity of rotation 40 km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$. A list of 23 globular clusters with regular dynamics and 22 globular clusters with chaotic dynamics is determined. The correlation of the obtained classification of globular clusters with the classification obtained by us using other methods in the work of Bajkova et al. (2024a) was determined.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent measurements from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), combined with Planck and DESI data, suggest a higher value for the spectral index $n_s$. This places Starobinsky inflation at the edge of the $2\sigma$ constraints for a number of e-folds $N_\star$ around $60$ when using the usual analytical approximations. We present refined predictions for Starobinsky inflation that go beyond the commonly used analytical approximations. By evaluating the model with these improved expressions, we show that for $N_\star \gtrsim 60$ it remains consistent with current observational constraints at the $2\sigma$ level. Additionally, we examine the implications of the ACT results for post-inflationary reheating parameters. Specifically, we find a lower bound on the effective equation of state parameter during reheating of approximately $\omega \gtrsim 0.462$; this excludes purely perturbative reheating, which leads to $\omega \simeq 0$. We also show that the reheating temperature is constrained to be $T_{\text{rh}} \lesssim 2 \times 10^{12}~\text{GeV}$, assuming $\omega \leq 1$. Furthermore, we find that the predictions for the spectral index and tensor-to-scalar ratio can lie within $1\sigma$ of the recent ACT constraints if the reheating temperature satisfies $4~\text{MeV} \lesssim T_{\text{rh}} \lesssim 10~\text{GeV}$ for $0.8 \lesssim \omega \leq 1$.

 WZ Sge-type dwarf novae (DNe) form a subclass in cataclysmic variables, characterized by short-period variations called superhumps during an outburst. Here we present optical ground-based and TESS observations of ASASSN-24hd in its 2024-2025 outburst. ASASSN-24hd is the first reported WZ Sge-type DN outburst fully covered by TESS, providing a great opportunity to study the evolution of superhumps. Our observations establish its early and stage-A ordinary superhumps as 0.05711(4) and 0.05919(5) d, respectively, resulting in its mass ratio of 0.098(4). The TESS observations confirm that the evolution of its superhump period, amplitude, and profile after the appearance of ordinary superhumps is generally consistent with those of SU UMa-type DNe observed with Kepler and TESS. Furthermore, we find that ASASSN-24hd in outburst shares a great similarity to the 2010 superoutburst of an SU UMa-type DN V585 Lyr, observed by Kepler, particularly including the superhump evolution and the long waiting time ($\gtrsimeq$ 5 d) before the stage A--B transition of ordinary superhumps. The shorter superoutburst cycles and smaller outburst amplitude in V585 Lyr than those of ASASSN-24hd disfavor the interpretation that V585 Lyr is, in fact, a face-on WZ Sge-type DN where early superhumps are undetectable. Instead, one possibility of their critical differences is either low quiescence viscosity or inner disk truncation, which has been invoked to explain the extreme nature of WZ Sge-type DNe, but future observations in quiescence are vital to conclude. These findings emphasize the borderline between SU UMa-type and WZ Sge-type DNe.

 - **Abstract**
 Binary neutron star mergers provide insight into strong-field gravity and the properties of ultra-dense nuclear matter. These events offer the potential to search for signatures of physics beyond the standard model, including dark matter. We present the first numerical-relativity simulations of binary neutron star mergers admixed with dark matter, based on constraint-solved initial data. Modeling dark matter as a non-interacting fermionic gas, we investigate the impact of varying dark matter fractions and particle masses on the merger dynamics, ejecta mass, post-merger remnant properties, and the emitted gravitational waves. Our simulations suggest that the dark matter morphology - a dense core or a diluted halo - may alter the merger outcome. Scenarios with a dark matter core tend to exhibit a higher probability of prompt collapse, while those with a dark matter halo develop a common envelope, embedding the whole binary. Furthermore, gravitational wave signals from mergers with dark matter halo configurations exhibit significant deviations from standard models when the tidal deformability is calculated in a two-fluid framework. This highlights the need for refined models in calculating the tidal deformability when considering mergers with extended dark matter structures. These initial results provide a basis for further exploration of dark matter's role in binary neutron star mergers and their associated gravitational wave emission and can serve as a benchmark for future observations from advanced detectors and multi-messenger astrophysics.

 - **Abstract**
 After decades of uncertainty about the origin of lithium, recent evidence suggests Galactic novae as its main astrophysical source. In this work, we present possible evidence for the first detection of the $^7$Be line at 478 keV, observed with the INTEGRAL satellite. The emission is temporally and spatially coincident with the outburst of the bright nova V1369 Cen, and line significance ranges from 2.5$\sigma$ to $\sim$1.9$\sigma$, depending on the detection methodology. A bootstrap analysis, assuming a fixed FWHM of 8 keV, provides a flux of $(4.9 \pm 2.0) \times 10^{-4}$ ph/cm$^2$/s centered at 479.0 $\pm$ 2.5 keV, with a 2.5$\sigma$ significant excess. This flux implies a total $^7$Be mass of $M_{^7Be} = (1.2^{+2.0}_{-0.6})$ $\times 10^{-8}$ M$_{\odot}$ at the distance determined using several indicators including the {\em Gaia} satellite. For a nova ejected mass estimated from radio observations, this result implies a $^7$Be=Li yield corresponding to $A(Li) = 7.1^{+0.7}_{-0.3}$. This value is comparable to those measured in a dozen novae through optical observations. Crucially, we confirm optically derived $^7$Li yields and demonstrate the groundbreaking potential of using gamma-ray data to measure Li abundances.

 - **Abstract**
 In our Bayesian and Statistical Analysis investigation of the open cluster NGC 6416, we utilized Gaia EDR3 astrometry data and ensemble-based unsupervised machine learning techniques to identify 406 cluster members. Using the MESA Isochrones and Stellar Tracks (MIST) with Gaia EDR3 data, we determined the following parameters for NGC 6416: a distance of approximately 1021pc, an age of about $12.58\pm 0.1$ Myr, a metallicity (z) of roughly $0.032\pm0.0015$, a binarity fraction near $0.419\pm0.021$, and an extinction ($A_V$) of approximately $0.995\pm0.058$ mag for an $R_V$ value of around $3.064\pm0.102$. We also fitted the radial surface density profile and conducted orbit analysis of the cluster using galpy. And finally found that the star formation scenarios are not observed in the open star cluster NGC 6416.

 - **Abstract**
 We present numerical simulations of discrete relativistic ejecta from an X-ray binary (XRB) with initial conditions directly informed by observations. XRBs have been observed to launch powerful discrete plasma ejecta during state transitions, which can propagate up to parsec distances. Understanding these ejection events unveils new understanding of jet-launching, jet power, and jet-ISM interaction among other implications. Multi-frequency quasi-simultaneous radio observations of ejecta from the black hole XRB MAXI J1820+070 produced both size and calorimetry constraints, which we use as initial conditions of a relativistic hydrodynamic simulation. We qualitatively reproduce the observed deceleration of the ejecta in a homogeneous interstellar medium (ISM). Our simulations demonstrate that the ejecta must be denser than the ISM, the ISM be significantly low-density, and the launch be extremely powerful, in order to propagate to the observed distances. The blob propagates and clears out a high-pressure low-density cavity in its wake, providing an explanation for this pre-existing low-density environment, as well as 'bubble-like' environments in the vicinity of XRBs inferred from other studies. As the blob decelerates, we observe the onset of instabilities and a long-lived reverse shock -- these mechanisms convert kinetic to internal energy in the blob, responsible for in-situ particle acceleration. We transform the outputs of our simulation into pseudo-radio images, incorporating the u,v coverage of the MeerKAT and e-MERLIN telescopes from the original observations with real-sky background. Through this, we maximize the interpretability of the results and provide direct comparison to current data, as well as provide prediction capabilities.

          Characterizing CMB noise anisotropies from CMB delensing

 - **Abstract**
 Un-doing the effect of gravitational lensing on the Cosmic Microwave Background ('de-lensing') is essential in shaping constraints on weak signals limited by lensing effects on the CMB, for example on a background of primordial gravitational waves. Removing these anisotropies induced by large-scale structures from the CMB maps also generally helps our view of the primordial Universe, by sharpening the acoustic peaks and the damping tail. However, delensing does transfer parts of these anisotropies to the noise maps. This will induce a new large scale 'mean-field' bias to any anisotropy estimator applied to the delensed CMB, and this bias directly traces large-scale structures. This paper analytically quantifies this delensed noise mean-field and its impact on quadratic (QE) and likelihood-based lensing estimators. We show that for Simons-Observatory-like surveys, this mean-field bias can reach 15% in cross-correlation with large-scale structures if unaccounted for. We further demonstrate that this delensed noise mean-field can be safely neglected in likelihood-based estimators without compromising the quality of lensing reconstruction or $B$-mode delensing, provided the resulting lensing map is properly renormalized.

 - **Abstract**
 Between the 4th and 6th of September 2024, the Astronomy & Astrophysics group at the University of Warwick held a meeting to celebrate 21 years of astronomy at Warwick and the scientific legacy of the late Prof. Tom Marsh, the group founder. More than a hundred people attended the meeting, with about half of the attendees being external delegates and coming from as far afield as the USA and South Africa. Tom Marsh moved to the University of Warwick from Southampton in 2003, after the Department of Physics decided to expand the scope of its research. From its humble beginnings with only two staff members, Tom himself and Boris Gänsicke, one postdoc and a couple of PhD students, the group has now grown to more than 95 members, including 25 staff. Tom pioneered the development of Doppler tomography, led key discoveries in the field of double-degenerate binary systems and made extensive contributions to instrumentation, primarily to developing the high-speed imaging photometers ULTRACAM, ULTRASPEC and HiPERCAM. This article provides a summary of Tom's legacy and Warwick's history as presented in the 21 years of Astronomy at Warwick meeting.

          Planets Across Space and Time (PAST). VI. Age Dependence of the Occurrence and Architecture of Ultra-Short-Period Planet Systems

 - **Abstract**
 Ultra-short-period (USP) planets, with orbital periods shorter than one day, represent a unique class of exoplanets whose origin remains puzzling. Determining their age distribution and temporal evolution is vital for uncovering their formation and evolutionary pathways. Using a sample of over 1,000 short-period planets around Sun-like stars, we find that the host stars of USP planets are relatively older and have a higher prevalence in the Galactic thick disk compared to stars hosting other short-period planets. Furthermore, we find that the occurrence of USP planets increases with stellar age and uncover evidence indicating that USP planetary system architectures evolve on Gyr timescales. This includes a distinct dip-pileup in period distributions around ~1 day and an expansion of orbital spacings with time. In addition, younger USP planet systems are observed to have fewer multiple transiting planets, implying fewer nearby companions and/or larger mutual orbital inclinations. Our findings suggest that USP planets continuously form through inward migration driven by tidal dissipation over Gyr timescales, and that younger and older USP planets may have originated via different specific tidal migration pathways.

          Constraints on primordial non-Gaussianity from Quaia

 - **Abstract**
 We analyse the large-scale angular clustering of quasars in the Gaia-unWISE quasar catalog, Quaia, and their cross-correlation with maps of the lensing convergence of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), to constrain the level of primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG). Specifically, we target the scale-dependent bias that would be induced by PNG on biased tracers of the matter inhomogeneities on large scales. The Quaia sample is particularly well suited for this analysis, given the large effective volume covered, and our ability to map out the main potential sources of systematic contamination and mitigate their impact. Using the universality relation to characterise the response of the quasar overdensity to PNG ($p_\phi=1$), we report constraints on the local-type PNG parameter $f_{\rm NL}$ of $f_{\rm NL}=-20.5^{+19.0}_{-18.1}$ (68\% C.L.) by combining the quasar auto-correlation and its cross-correlation with CMB lensing in two tomographic redshift bins (or $f_{\rm NL}=-28.7^{+26.1}_{-24.6}$ if assuming a lower response for quasars, $p_\phi=1.6$). Using the CMB lensing cross-correlations alone, we find $f_{\rm NL}=-13.8^{+26.7}_{-25.0}$. These are the tightest constraints on $f_{\rm NL}$ to date from angular clustering statistics and cross-correlations with CMB lensing.

 - **Abstract**
 The formation and evolution of ultra-short-period (USP) planets is poorly understood. However, it is widely thought that these planets migrated inwards through interactions with outer neighbours. We aimed to confirm and characterize the USP Earth-sized planet K2-157 b ($P_{\rm orb}$ = 8.8 h). To do so, We measured 49 radial velocities (RVs) with the ESPRESSO spectrograph and derived the properties of the system through a RV and transit model. We detect two additional super-Neptune-mass planets within the warm Neptunian savanna, K2-157 c ($P_{\rm orb, c}$ = $25.942^{+0.045}_{-0.044}$ d, $M_{\rm p, c} \, \textrm{sin} \, i$ = $30.8 \pm 1.9$ $\rm M_{\oplus}$), and K2-157 d ($P_{\rm orb, d}$ = $66.50^{+0.71}_{-0.59}$ d, $M_{\rm p,d} \, \textrm{sin}\,i$ = $23.3 \pm 2.5$ $\rm M_{\oplus}$). The mass of K2-157 b, $M_{\rm p,b}$ = $1.14^{+0.39}_{-0.41}$ $\rm M_{\oplus}$ ($<$ 2.3 $\rm M_{\oplus}$ at 3$\sigma$), together with its radius, $R_{\rm p}$ = 0.935 $\pm$ 0.090 $\rm R_{\oplus}$, make the planet compatible with a rocky composition. K2 data discard non-grazing transit configurations for K2-157 c ($i_{\rm c}$ $<$ 88.4$^{\circ}$ at 3$\sigma$), and ESPRESSO data constrain the eccentricities of K2-157 c and K2-157 d to $e_{\rm c}$ $<$ 0.2 and $e_{\rm d}$ $<$ 0.5 at 3$\sigma$. At a population level, we find that the trend that the closest USP planets tend to orbit late-type stars does not hold when scaling the orbital separation to the Roche limit, which suggests that the orbital distribution of the closest planets across spectral types is determined by tidal disruption. The orbital architecture of K2-157 is unusual, with only one similar case reported to date: 55 Cnc. The USP planets of these systems, being accompanied by massive, long-period, relatively spaced, and possibly misaligned neighbours, could have migrated inwards through eccentricity-based mechanisms triggered by secular interactions.

 - **Abstract**
 In addition to planets and other small bodies, stellar systems will likely also host exozodiacal dust, or exozodi. This warm dust primarily resides in or near the habitable zone of a star, and scatters stellar light in visible to NIR wavelengths, possibly acting as a spatially inhomogeneous fog that can impede our ability to detect and characterize Earth-like exoplanets. By improving our knowledge of exozodi in the near term with strategic precursor observations and model development, we may be able to mitigate these effects to support a future search for signs of habitability and life with a direct imaging mission. This white paper introduces exozodi, summarizes its impact on directly imaging Earth-like exoplanets, and outlines several key knowledge gaps and near-term solutions to maximize the science return of future observations.

 - **Abstract**
 As discussed in a number of recent papers, cosmological stasis is a phenomenon wherein the abundances of multiple cosmological energy components with different equations of state remain constant for an extended period despite the expansion of the universe. One of the most intriguing aspects of the stasis phenomenon is that it can give rise to cosmological epochs in which the effective equation-of-state parameter $\langle w \rangle$ for the universe is constant, but differs from the canonical values associated with matter, radiation, vacuum energy, etc. Indeed, during such a stasis epoch, the spatial average of the energy density of the universe evolves in precisely the same manner as it would have evolved if the universe were instead dominated by a perfect fluid with an equation-of-state parameter equal to $\langle w \rangle$. However, as we shall demonstrate, this equivalence is broken at the level of the perturbations of the energy density. To illustrate this point, we consider a stasis epoch involving matter and radiation and demonstrate that within this stasis background the density perturbations associated with a spectator matter component with exceedingly small energy density exhibit a power-law growth that persists across the entire duration of the stasis epoch. This growth can potentially lead to significant enhancements of structure at small scales. Such enhancements are not only interesting in their own right, but may also provide a way of observationally distinguishing between a stasis epoch and an epoch of perfect-fluid domination -- even if the universe has the same equation of state in both cases.

          HD 144812: A transition-phase massive star in a binary system
 - **Authors:** Michalis Kourniotis, Michaela Kraus, Maria Laura Arias, Lydia S. Cidale

 - **Abstract**
 In this Letter, we shed light on the evolutionary phase of HD 144812, a Galactic yellow supergiant showing infrared excess that is typically expected for evolved stars undergoing enhanced mass-loss activity. We present high-resolution spectroscopy of the star in the $H-$ and $K-$band acquired with the GRating INfrared Spectrometer (IGRINS) and further explore multi-band imaging of the wider field of view from the ultraviolet to the radio regime. The IGRINS data reveal several lines from the hydrogen series and iron in a double-peaked emission and we here suggest, that HD 144812 is orbited by a disk-hosting companion. Furthermore, we report emission in the CO band heads of the star that is modeled to arise from a circum-stellar/binary disk (or ring) of ejected gas. The latter consists of material that is expected to have been dredged up from the core of the star to its surface during a prior phase as a red supergiant (RSG). These findings together suggest that HD 144812 is a rare, post-RSG star in a binary system, encouraging further investigation on the effect that the stellar encounters have on triggering instabilities and driving the evolution of the primary star shortly prior to the supernova event.
#### Title:
          The importance of Berry phase in solar acoustic modes

 - **Abstract**
 An analytic expression for the frequencies of standing waves in stars, applicable to any radial order n, is derived from ray-tracing equations by the mean of Wigner-Weyl calculus. A correction to previous formulas currently employed in asteroseismology is identified as the Berry phase, which accounts for the vectorial nature of wave propagation in stars. Accounting for this quantity significantly improves upon previous laws for low n modes of the Sun, and we show that the Berry phase is indeed present in the available observational data of solar modes. This phase is due to inhomogeneities of the medium.

          Kozai Lidov Cycles = Simple Pendulum

 - **Abstract**
 The quadrupole Kozai mechanism, which describes the hierarchical three-body problem in the leading order, is shown to be equivalent to a simple pendulum where the change in the eccentricity squared equals the height of the pendulum from its lowest point: $e_{\text{max}}^2-e^2=h=l\left(1-\cos{\theta}\right)$. In particular, this results in useful expressions for the KLC period, and the maximal and minimal eccentricities in terms of orbital constants. We derive the equivalence using the vector coordinates $\boldsymbol{\alpha}=\textbf{j}+\textbf{e}, \boldsymbol{\beta}=\textbf{j}-\textbf{e}$ for the inner Keplerian orbit, where $\textbf{j}$ is the normalized specific angular momentum, and $\textbf{e}$ is the eccentricity vector. The equations of motion for $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$ and $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ simplify to $\dot{\boldsymbol{\alpha}}=2\partial_{\boldsymbol{\alpha}} \phi \times \boldsymbol{\alpha}$ and $\dot{\boldsymbol{\beta}}=2\partial_{\boldsymbol{\beta}} \phi \times \boldsymbol{\beta}$, where $\phi$ is the normalized averaged interaction potential and are symmetric to replacing $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$ and $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ for the KLC quadratic potential. Their constraints simplify to $\boldsymbol{\alpha}^2=\boldsymbol{\beta}^2=1$, and they are distributed uniformly and independently on the unit sphere for a uniform distribution in phase space (with a fixed energy).

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitationally lensed Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) offer critical advantages over other lensed sources. They can be detected via continuously operating detectors covering most of the sky. They offer extremely high time resolution to determine lensing delays and find short-time delays accurately. They are detectable across most of the visible Universe. However, they are also rare and frequently poorly localized. In this paper, we review searches for gravitational lensing in GRBs and comment on promising avenues for the future. We note that the highly structured jets in GRBs can show variations on sufficiently small scales that, unlike lensing of most transient sources, gravitational lensing in gamma-ray bursts may not be achromatic. Such behavior would weaken the stringent requirements for identifying lensed bursts but would also make robust identification of lensing more challenging. A continuously running search that could identify candidate lensed events in near real-time would enable afterglow searches with current and near-future wide-field optical/IR surveys that could yield the first unambiguous detection of a lensed GRB. The new generation of sensitive X-ray and gamma-ray detectors, such as the Einstein Probe and SVOM, will complement Swift and significantly enhance the number of well-localized gamma-ray and X-ray transients. Tuned strategies could dramatically improve the probability of observing a lensed GRB.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper outlines the Radio Science Experiment (RSE) proposed for the RAMSES mission to asteroid (99942) Apophis, which will undergo a close Earth encounter in April 2029. This event provides a unique opportunity to study the asteroid's physical and dynamical changes under strong tidal forces. The experiment leverages a combination of Earth-based radiometric measurements, optical imaging, and inter-satellite links between the RAMSES mothercraft and deployable subcraft in proximity to Apophis. Using high-precision Doppler and optical navigation data, the RSE aims to estimate the asteroid's mass, gravity field, and spin state with unparalleled accuracy, furthering our understanding of near-Earth asteroid evolution and internal structure. Simulation results show the robustness of the proposed mission scenario, highlighting the critical role of multi-probe configurations and novel inter-satellite link technologies in achieving accurate gravity science results.

          Predictions for new physics in the CMB damping tail

 - **Abstract**
 Ever since the Planck satellite measured the the cosmic microwave background (CMB) down to arcminute angular scales the mismatch between the CMB-inferred value of the Hubble constant and the value inferred from the distance ladder (i.e., the Hubble tension) has been a growing concern and is currently at the $\sim 6 \sigma$ level. There are a handful of proposed mechanisms operating in the early universe which have shown some promise in resolving the Hubble tension. These mechanisms are expected to leave a measurable impact on the smallest scale CMB anisotropy, deep in the damping tail. Using current CMB data, baryonic acoustic oscillation data, and the luminosities of type Ia supernovae as a baseline, we compute the predicted small-scale CMB power spectra for a characteristic set of these models. We find that near-future CMB data should be able to detect some but not all of the investigated models.

 - **Abstract**
 Increasing data volumes from scientific simulations and instruments (supercomputers, accelerators, telescopes) often exceed network, storage, and analysis capabilities. The scientific community's response to this challenge is scientific data reduction. Reduction can take many forms, such as triggering, sampling, filtering, quantization, and dimensionality reduction. This report focuses on a specific technique: lossy compression. Lossy compression retains all data points, leveraging correlations and controlled reduced accuracy. Quality constraints, especially for quantities of interest, are crucial for preserving scientific discoveries. User requirements also include compression ratio and speed. While many papers have been published on lossy compression techniques and reference datasets are shared by the community, there is a lack of detailed specifications of application needs that can guide lossy compression researchers and developers. This report fills this gap by reporting on the requirements and constraints of nine scientific applications covering a large spectrum of domains (climate, combustion, cosmology, fusion, light sources, molecular dynamics, quantum circuit simulation, seismology, and system logs). The report also details key lossy compression technologies (SZ, ZFP, MGARD, LC, SPERR, DCTZ, TEZip, LibPressio), discussing their history, principles, error control, hardware support, features, and impact. By presenting both application needs and compression technologies, the report aims to inspire new research to fill existing gaps.

 - **Abstract**
 We have created a new image analysis pipeline to reprocess images taken by the Near Earth Asteroid Tracking survey and have applied it to ten nights of observations. This work is the first large-scale reprocessing of images from an asteroid discovery survey in which thousands of archived images are re-calibrated, searched for minor planets, and resulting observations are reported to the Minor Planet Center. We describe the software used to extract, calibrate, and clean sources from the images, including specific techniques that accommodate the unique features of these archival images. This pipeline is able to find fainter asteroids than the original pipeline.

          Saturnian Irregular Satellites as a Probe of Kuiper Belt Surface Evolution

 - **Abstract**
 We present the JWST NIRSpec PRISM 0.7-5.3 micron spectra of Albiorix and Siarnaq and the NIRSpec G235H/G395M 1.7-5.3 micron spectra of Phoebe, the three largest Saturnian irregular satellites. The irregular satellites of the giant planets are thought to be captured planetesimals from the same population as Kuiper belt objects. They are emplaced inside Saturn's Hill sphere during the giant-planet instability described by the Nice Model, and are thus valuable tracers of Kuiper belt surface evolution. Phoebe's JWST spectrum matches the global average from Cassini VIMS, and by comparing the spectrum to the library of Kuiper belt object spectra from JWST, we demonstrate Phoebe's compositional similarity to water-rich KBOs. On the smaller Albiorix and Siarnaq, we observe a broad 3 micron O-H band but do not see a Fresnel peak or the 1.5/2.0 micron features characteristic of H$_2$O ice. We posit that after capture, the frequent high-velocity collisions between smaller irregular satellites sublimate the water ice, while the much larger Phoebe is resistant to disruption and retains its water ice. We suggest that the presence of CO$_2$ on the smaller satellites, despite the lack of water ice, indicates later formation of CO$_2$ on these surfaces through irradiation of organic compounds.

 - **Abstract**
 The Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) enables detailed high-energy X-ray observations from 3--79 keV, but its performance can be constrained by telemetry saturation when observing bright sources, leading to reduced effective exposure times. In this study, we investigate the use of serendipitous stray light (SL) observations to infer properties of an X-ray bright source in comparison to focused data. Our case study is performed on the neutron star (NS) low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) GX 340+0, a prominent Z source, where we execute a spectral analysis comparing 25 SL and 7 focused NuSTAR observations. Our findings demonstrate that SL observations can significantly enhance long-term temporal coverage; detecting variations in the thermal components of the system across the baseline of the mission, which could not be inferred from focused observations alone.

 - **Abstract**
 This work presents the first optical imaging catalogue of resolved Galactic nova remnants. It compiles images from proprietary observations carried out at the Nordic Optical Telescope and public archives using different telescopes and instruments. The catalogue includes images spanning from 1950 to 2024 of 66 novae out of the more than 550 novae detected to date. Diffuse emission from a nova shell is detected in 45 sources, with another 16 sources been stellar and five more been barely resolved. We used the catalogue to introduce a main morphological classification of the nova remnants (R - round, E - elliptical, B - bipolar, A - asymmetric, I - irregular, S - stellar, and G - barely resolved) with secondary features (s - smooth, c - clumpy, m - mixed, f - filaments, t - tails, m - multiple shells, e - equatorial brightness enhancement). Resolved nova remnants are mostly round (27%) or elliptical (56%), with very few bipolar or with equatorial brightness enhancement (13%). Most nova remnants are younger than 150 yr, with about 80% of nova remnant detection rate among those younger than 60 yr. The physical size of nova remnants increases with age at a rate of 0.0725 pc per century up to a median value of 0.03 pc. This relationship seems to apply even to the few known ancient nova shells with ages up to a few millennia. The aspect ratio of nova remnants can be described by a Gaussian distribution with a standard deviation $\sigma$ of 0.18 from round morphologies (major to minor axes ratio of unity).

          Abrupt Pulsation Resumptions in Deneb: An Update

 - **Abstract**
 Deneb, the prototype Alpha Cygni variable, is a bright A2 Ia supergiant which shows irregular variability with a 12-day quasi-period, presumed to be caused by pulsations. At the 2023 AAVSO Annual Meeting we discussed radial velocity and photometry data from several sources showing that the 12-day variations begin abruptly at an arbitrary phase, damp out after several cycles, and resume at intervals of around 75 days. Additional data with more frequent time sampling and longer time series were needed to verify the existence and precision of the 75-day interval. We have identified additional data sets and have intensified ground-based observing programs. Here we present analysis of 1) an 8.6-year photometric data set from the Solar Mass Ejection Imager; 2) BRITE Constellation light curves from six observing seasons of 60 to 180 days each, 2014-2021; 3) 4.6 years of radial velocity data from Morrison; 4) 1.4 years of radial velocity data from Eaton; and 5) additional V-band photometry from the AAVSO Photoelectric Photometry (PEP) section. Examining the SMEI data set, we find a most common 100 to 125 day interval between `pulsation' resumptions. These resumptions sometimes skip intervals. We also find sudden large excursions in brightness and radial velocity which are distinct from the `pulsation' resumptions and may or may not be data artifacts. We point out changes in the average level of Deneb's radial velocity which appear to be real given the accuracy of the measurements but are not explained.

 We report the discovery and characterization of TOI-2005b, a warm Jupiter on an eccentric (e~0.59), 17.3-day orbit around a V_mag = 9.867 rapidly rotating F-star. The object was detected as a candidate by TESS and the planetary nature of TOI-2005b was then confirmed via a series of ground-based photometric, spectroscopic, and diffraction-limited imaging observations. The planet was found to reside in a low sky-projected stellar obliquity orbit (lambda = 4.8 degrees) via a transit spectroscopic observation using the Magellan MIKE this http URL-2005b is one of a few planets known to have a low-obliquity, high-eccentricity orbit, which may be the result of high-eccentricity coplanar migration. The planet has a periastron equilibrium temperature of ~ 2100 K, similar to some highly irradiated hot Jupiters where atomic metal species have been detected in transmission spectroscopy, and varies by almost 1000 K during its orbit. Future observations of the atmosphere of TOI-2005b can inform us about its radiative timescales thanks to the rapid heating and cooling of the planet.

 - **Abstract**
 The planned NASA Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) flagship mission aims to image and spectroscopically characterise 25 Earth-size planets in the habitable zones of their stars. However, one giant planet in the habitable zone can ruin your whole day. Recent work has examined the current state of our knowledge on the presence or absence of such objects in samples of likely HWO targets, and that knowledge has been found wanting; even Saturn-mass planets remain undetectable in many of these systems. In this work, we present simulations assessing the degree to which new campaigns of high-cadence radial velocity observations can ameliorate this woeful state of affairs. In particular, we highlight the value of moderate-precision but highly flexibly-scheduled RV facilities in aiding this necessary HWO precursor science. We find that for a subset of Southern HWO stars, 6 years of new RVs from the Minerva-Australis telescope array in Australia can improve the median detection sensitivity in the habitable zones of 13 likely HWO targets to $\sim$50 Earth masses, an improvement of $\sim$44%.

 - **Abstract**
 HD~163296 is a Herbig Ae/Be star with multiple signposts of on-going planet formation on its disk, such as prominent rings and gaps, as well as kinematic features as identified by previous ALMA observations. We carried out JWST/NIRCam coronagraphic imaging using the F410M and F200W NIRCam filters, with the goal of detecting the emission from the putative young planets in this system. Our F410M observations did not detect the putative planets at the predicted locations of the ALMA velocity kinks, but detected a point-like source candidate at a separation of $\approx0\farcs75$ and a position angle of $\approx231\fdg4$ that is unlikely a background star because of the measured flux in the F410M filter and the detection limit in the F200W filter. These data achieved unprecedented contrast levels at $\sim4~\micron$ at stellocentric separations $\rho\gtrsim0\farcs8$. This allowed us to derive stringent constraints at the outer velocity kink ($\Delta {\rm F410M}=15.2~{\rm mag}$) on the mass of the putative planet with or without a circumplanetary disk, and considering different possible initial entropies for the planet.

 - **Abstract**
 As the only moon in the solar system with a thick atmosphere, Titan is a compelling and enigmatic world containing a complex organic haze. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules are believed to play an essential role in the formation of Titan's aerosols and haze layers. The existence of PAHs in Titan's upper atmosphere has been revealed by the detection of the 3.28-micron emission band with Cassini's Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS). However, there is little knowledge about the identity, composition, size and abundance of PAH molecules in Titan's atmosphere. Due to its unprecedented sensitivity and spectral coverage and resolution, the advent of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) could possibly enable a full characterization of the chemical makeups of Titan's aerosols. In particular, with a much better spectral resolution than Cassini's VIMS, JWST's Near Infrared Spectrograph (and Mid Infrared Instrument) could enable the spectral bands to be better resolved, potentially providing crucial information about which PAHs are really present in Titan's upper atmosphere. To facilitate JWST to search for and identify Titan's PAH molecules, we are performing a systematic study of the photophysics of PAHs in Titan's upper atmosphere. As a pilot study, here we report the infrared emission spectra of vibrationally excited cyanonapthalenes and their ions which are composed of two fused benzene rings and one nitrile (-CN) group. The calculated emission spectra will help JWST to quantitatively determine or place an upper limit on the abundances of cyanonapthalenes in Titan's upper atmosphere.

 - **Abstract**
 Utilizing the PHOENIX synthetic spectra, we investigated the impact of spectral resolution on the calculation of $S$-indices. We found that for spectra with a resolution lower than $\approx$30,000, it is crucial to calibrate $S$-indices for accurate estimations. This is especially essential for low-resolution spectral observations. We provided calibrations for several ongoing or upcoming spectroscopic surveys such as the LAMOST low-resolution survey, the SEGUE survey, the SDSS-V/BOSS survey, the DESI survey, the MSE survey, and the MUST survey. Using common targets between the HARPS and MWO observations, we established conversions from spectral $S$-indices to the well-known $S_{\rm MWO}$ values, applicable to stars with [Fe/H] values greater than $-$1. These calibrations offer a reliable approach to convert $S$-indices obtained from various spectroscopic surveys into $S_{\rm{MWO}}$ values and can be widely applied in studies on chromospheric activity.

          The influence of stellar activity on detecting Earth-like planets via nulling interferometry

 - **Abstract**
 The direct imaging of Earth-like planets in solar neighbors is challenging. Both transit and radial velocity (RV) methods suffer from noise due to stellar activity. By choosing a typical configuration of an X array interferometer, we used theoretical formulas to calculate the intrinsic Poisson noise and the noise of stellar activities. Assuming a fixed array with no rotation and ignoring other systematic and astrophysical noises, we considered a single active region on a stellar disk, including both spots and flares with different parameters, for instance, the position, size, and temperature of the active regions. Then we simulated the S/N of Earth-like planets in HZ around G dwarf stars (solar-like) and M dwarfs (Proxima-like), with different stellar activities in the mid-infrared (MIR) band ( 7-12 $\mu$m). The noise attributed to stellar activity has much less influence than the Transit and RV method when detecting Earth-like planets around both G and M dwarfs. I.e. Stellar activity can hardly influence the detection of Earth-like planets around G dwarf stars. However, detecting Earth-like planets around M dwarfs, which are usually more active, can be significantly hindered. We also analyzed the uncertainty of the planet's location due to the deduced S/N. Consequently, we have determined the possibility of mistaking a planet in the HZ as being outside the HZ based on an erroneous S/N measurement. Selecting quiescent target stars or monitoring the light curves of stars would be a helpful way to get rid of contaminates associated with violent stellar activities.

 - **Abstract**
 We present updated constraints on the parameters of an axion dark energy model, for which we took into account the properties of its characteristic potential and its full cosmological evolution. We show that the values of the axion parameters appear sufficiently constrained by the data, including the latest DESI DR1, and are consistent with the theoretical expectations of a field mass $m_a$ in the ultralight regime $\log (m_a c^2/\mathrm{eV}) \simeq -32.6$, and an effective energy scale $f_a$ close to the reduced Planck energy $\log (f_a/M_\mathrm{Pl}) \simeq -0.22$. Our results also support the idea of dynamical dark energy, although Bayesian evidence still favors the phenomenological dark energy model $w_0w_a$ over the axion dark energy, with the Bayes factor indicating moderate and weak strength of the evidence, respectively, when the models are compared to the cosmological constant $\Lambda$. However, the results suggest that axion dark energy remains a well-motivated model and may even become more competitive compared to other options with the help of upcoming DESI data.

 - **Abstract**
 The neutral hydrogen (HI) signal is a crucial probe for astrophysics and cosmology, but it is quite challenging to measure from raw data because of bright foreground contaminants at radio wavelengths. Cross-correlating the radio observations with large-scale structure tracers (LSS) could detect faint cosmological signals since they are not correlated with the foreground, but exquisite component separation procedures must be performed to reduce the variance induced by the foreground. In this work, we adopt the lensing of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) as the LSS tracer and investigate the cross-correlation of CMB lensing and HI observations at the post-reionization epoch. We use simulations to study lensing and HI cross-correlations in the context of next-generation CMB and intensity mapping experiments. We investigate the impact of the component separation based on linear combinations of the HI observations at different frequencies and estimate the signal-to-noise ratios for the cross-correlation measurements in different scenarios.

 - **Abstract**
 Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) provides the finest angular resolution of all astronomical observation techniques. However, observations with Earth-based instruments are approaching fundamental limits on angular resolution. These can only be overcome by placing at least one interferometric element in space. In this paper, several concepts of spaceborne VLBI systems are discussed, including TeraHertz Exploration and Zooming-in for Astrophysics (THEZA) and the Black Hole Explorer (BHEX). Spaceborne VLBI telescopes have some of the most demanding requirements of any space science mission. The VLBI system as a whole includes globally distributed elements, each with their own functional constraints, limiting when observations can be performed. This necessitates optimisation of the system parameters in order to maximise the scientific return of the mission. Presented is an investigation into how the impact of the functional constraints of a spaceborne VLBI telescope affect the overall system performance. A preliminary analysis of how these constraints can be minimised through optimisation of the spacecraft configuration and operation is also provided. A space-based VLBI simulation tool (spacevlbi) has been developed to model such missions and its capabilities are demonstrated throughout the paper. It is imperative that the functional constraints are considered early in the design of the future space-based VLBI systems in order to generate feasible mission concepts and to identify the key technology developments required to mitigate these limitations.

 - **Abstract**
 A search for $\gamma$-ray emission from SNRs in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) based on the detection of concentrations in the arrival direction Fermi-LAT images of photons at energies higher than 10 GeV found significant evidence for 9 of these sources. This analysis was based on data collected in the time window since August 4 2008 to August, 4 2020 (12 years). In the present contribution, we report results of a new search extended using a 15-year long (up to August, 4 2023) data set and to a broad energy range (higher than 4 GeV). The longer baseline and the softer energy lower limit are required to further understand the relation between the X-ray and gamma ray SNRs in the LMC, and to investigate the completness of the sample at low luminosities. Two different methods of clustering analysis were applied: Minimum Spanning Tree (MST), and the combination of Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) and DENsity-based CLUstEring (DENCLUE) algorithms. We confirm all previous detections and found positive indications for at least 8 new clusters with a spatial correspondence with other SNRs, increasing thus the number of remnants in LMC candidate or detected in the high energy $\gamma$-rays to 16 sources. This study extends previous analyses of $\gamma$-ray emission from SNRs in the LMC by incorporating a longer observational baseline and a broader energy range. The improved dataset and advanced clustering techniques enhance our understanding of the connection between X-ray and $\gamma$-ray SNRs, providing new insights into their high-energy properties, and contributing to assessing the completeness of the sample at lower luminosities.

 - **Abstract**
 We examine the eccentricity distribution(s) of radial velocity detected exoplanets. Previously, the eccentricity distribution was found to be described well by a Beta distribution with shape parameters $a=0.867, b=3.03$. Increasing the sample size by a factor of 2.25, we find that the CDF regression method now prefers a mixture model of Rayleigh + Exponential distributions over the Beta distribution, with an increase in Bayesian evidence of $\Delta\ln{Z}\sim 77$ ($12.6\,\sigma$). Using PDF regression, the eccentricity distribution is best described by a Gamma distribution, with a Rayleigh + Exponential mixture a close second. The mixture model parameters, $\alpha = 0.68\pm0.05, \lambda=3.32\pm0.25, \sigma =0.11\pm0.01$, are consistent between methods. We corroborate findings that exoplanet eccentricities are drawn from independent parent distributions when splitting the sample by period, mass, and multiplicity. Systems with a known outer massive companion provide no positive evidence for an eccentricity distribution distinct from those without. We quantitatively show M-dwarf hosted planets share a common eccentricity distribution with those orbiting FGK-type stars. We release our python code, eccentriciPy, which allows bespoke tailoring of the input archive to create more relevant priors for particular problems in RV planet discovery and characterisation. We re-characterised example planets using either traditional Beta, or updated priors, finding differences for recovery of low-amplitude multi-signal systems. We explore the effects of a variety of prior choices. The accurate determination of small but non-zero eccentricity values has wide-ranging implications for modelling the structure and evolution of planets and their atmospheres due to the energy dissipated by tidal flexing.

 - **Abstract**
 Different cosmological probes, such as primary cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies, CMB lensing, and cosmic shear, are sensitive to the primordial power spectrum (PPS) over different ranges of wavenumbers. In this paper, we combine the cosmic shear two-point correlation functions measured from the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) Year 3 data with the Planck CMB data, and the ACT DR6 CMB lensing data to test modified shapes of the PPS at small scales, while fixing the background cosmology to the flat $\Lambda$CDM model. We consider various types of modifications to the PPS shape: the model with a running spectral index, the tanh-shaped model, the Starobinsky-type modification due to a sharp change in the inflaton potential, the broken power-law model, and the multiple broken power-law model. Although the HSC cosmic shear data is sensitive to the PPS at small scales, we find that the combined data remains consistent with the standard power-law PPS, i.e., the single power-law model, for the flat $\Lambda$CDM background. In other words, we conclude that the $S_8$ tension cannot be easily resolved by modifying the PPS within the $\Lambda$CDM background.

 On December 27, 2024, Juno's JIRAM infrared experiment observed an unprecedented volcanic event on Io's southern hemisphere, covering a vast region of ~ 65,000 square km, near 73°S, 140°E. The total power output is estimated between 140 and 260 TW, potentially the most intense ever recorded, surpassing the brightest eruption at Surt in 2001 (~80 TW). Within that region, only one hot spot was previously known (Pfd454). This feature was earlier estimated to cover an area of 300 square km with a total power output of 34 GW. JIRAM results show that the region produces a power output of 140-260 TW, over 1,000 times higher than earlier estimates. Three adjacent hot spots also exhibited dramatic power increases: P139, PV18, and an unnamed feature south of the main one that surged to ~1 TW, placing all of them among the top 10 most powerful hot spots observed on Io. A temperature analysis of the features supports a simultaneous onset of these brightenings and suggests a single eruptive event propagating beneath the surface across hundreds of kilometers, the first time this has been observed on Io. This implies a connection among the hotspots' magma reservoirs, while other nearby hotspots that have been known to be active in the recent past, such as Kurdalagon Patera, appear unaffected. The simultaneity supports models of massive, interconnected magma reservoirs. The global scale of this event involving multiple hotspots and covering several hundred thousand square km should be considered in the future models of the lithosphere and interior of Io.

 - **Abstract**
 We present 3D radiation hydrodynamics simulations of common-envelope (CE) evolution involving a 12 solar mass red supergiant donor and a 3 solar mass companion. Existing 3D simulations are predominantly adiabatic, focusing strongly on low-mass donors on the red giant and asymptotic giant branches. However, the adiabatic assumption breaks down once the perturbed CE material becomes optically thin or when entering a longer-timescale evolutionary phase after the dynamical plunge-in. This is especially important for high-mass red supergiant donors, which have short thermal timescales, adding significant uncertainty in understanding how massive binary stars evolve into gravitational-wave sources, X-ray binaries, stripped-envelope supernovae, and more. We compare our radiation hydrodynamics simulations with an adiabatic simulation from Paper I that is otherwise identical, finding that radiative diffusion strongly inhibits CE ejection. The fraction of ejected mass is roughly half that of the adiabatic case when recombination energy release is not included. Almost no material is ejected during the dynamical plunge-in, and longer-timescale ejection during the slow spiral-in is suppressed. However, the orbital separation reached at the end of the dynamical plunge-in does not differ significantly. The large amount of remaining bound mass tentatively supports the emerging view that the dynamical plunge-in is followed by a non-adiabatic phase, during which a substantial fraction of the envelope is ejected and the binary orbit may continue to evolve.

 - **Abstract**
 I present the results of echelle spectroscopy of a bright HII region in the irregular galaxy IC4662 and their comparison with results from long-slit spectroscopy of the same region. All observations were obtained with the standard spectrographs of the SALT telescope: (1) low and medium spectral resolution spectrograph RSS (R~800) and (2) echelle spectrograph HRS (R=16000-17000). In both types of data the intensities of most of the emission lines were measured and abundances of oxygen and N, Ne, S, Ar, Cl and Fe were determined as well as physical parameters of the \ion{H}{ii} region. The chemical abundances were obtained from both types of data with the Te-method. Abundances calculated from both types of data agree to within the cited uncertainties. The analysis of the echelle data revealed three distinct kinematic subsystems within the studied \ion{H}{ii} region: a narrow component (NC, $\sigma ~ 12$~km/s), a broad component (BC, $\sigma ~ 40$~km/s), and a very broad component (VBC, $\sigma ~ 60-110$~km/s, detected only in the brightest emission lines). The velocity dispersion dependence on the ionisation potential of elements showed no correlation for the NC, indicating a well-mixed turbulent medium, while the BC exhibited pronounced stratification, characteristic of an expanding shell. Based on a detailed analysis of the kinematics and chemical composition, it was concluded that the BC is associated with the region surrounding a Wolf-Rayet star of spectral type WN7-8. The stellar wind from this WR star interacts with a shell ejected during an earlier evolutionary stage (either as a red supergiant or a luminous blue variable, LBV), which is enriched in nitrogen. These findings highlight the importance of high spectral resolution for detecting small-scale (~25 pc) chemical inhomogeneities and for understanding the feedback mechanisms of massive stars in low-metallicity environments.

          Period--Luminosity Relations for Double-mode $δ$ Sct Stars

 - **Abstract**
 Previous studies of the Period--Luminosity relations (PLRs) of Delta Scuti ($\delta$ Sct) stars have focused on those with a single pulsation mode. However, for $\delta$ Sct stars with many different pulsation modes, classifying a single mode is difficult. In this study, an all-sky dataset is constructed using double-mode $\delta$ Sct stars from ZTF and OGLE, and is used to determine F-mode and 1O-mode PLRs for eight single bands and six Wesenheit bands. In the $W1$ band, the PLR dispersion is about 0.171 mag and the total zero point error is 1\%. Our results show that to accurately classify the 1O modes of $\delta$ Sct stars requires authentication based on multiple modes. Classification based on amplitude alone leads to impure 1O-mode $\delta$ Sct stars and significant deviations in the PLRs. We compare the PLRs of the different sequences in the Petersen diagram and find that they are consistent after a strict criterion filtering, suggesting that their evolutionary state is similar. In addition, we find a weak period--metallicity relation for double-mode $\delta$ Sct stars, unlike double-mode RR Lyrae stars. As distance tracers, large-amplitude F-mode $\delta$ Sct and double-mode $\delta$ Sct stars are the most suitable of the $\delta$ Sct family.

 - **Abstract**
 There remains debate over whether the accretion disk survives or is entirely disrupted after the nova eruption. In our previous paper, Muraoka et al. (2024, PASJ, 76, 293) have photometrically demonstrated that the surviving accretion disk was expanded close to the L1 point during the optical plateau stage and then drastically shrank to the tidal truncation radius after the optical plateau stage ended. To approach the clarification of the physical mechanism that drives these structural changes, we have then conducted systematic analyses of the spectral evolution of the narrow emission line components in optical over 22 d following the optical peak during the 2022 nova eruption of U Scorpii (U Sco). Additionally, we present its optical spectrum in quiescence 794 d after the 2022 nova eruption. We find that the single-peaked narrow components of H$\alpha$ and He II 4686 appeared almost simultaneously between roughly days 6 and 8, preceding the onset of the disk eclipses observed after day 11. This finding suggests that the nova wind near the binary system may be the primary origin of these narrow components and even remained active several days after the nova eruption with a velocity of approximately 1000 km s$^{-1}$, likely driving the expansion of the accretion disk until the end of the optical plateau stage. While the contribution of the rotating accretion disk might be dominated by that of the nova wind in the H$\alpha$ line profile, the outward surface flow from the expanded disk might also contribute to these narrow features during the optical plateau stage, making the single-peaked narrow line profiles more pronounced.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we investigate a joint fitting approach based on theoretical models of power spectra associated with density-field reconstruction. Specifically, we consider the matter auto-power spectra before and after baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) reconstruction, as well as the cross-power spectrum between the pre- and post-reconstructed density fields. We present redshift-space models for these three power spectra at the one-loop level within the framework of standard perturbation theory (SPT), and perform a joint analysis using three types of power spectra, and quantify their impact on parameter constraints. When restricting the analysis to wavenumbers $k \leq 0.2\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ and adopting a smoothing scale of $R_{\mathrm{s}} = 15\,h^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}$, we find that incorporating all three power spectra improves parameter constraints by approximately $11\%\text{--}16\%$ compared to using only the post-reconstruction power spectrum, with the Figure of Merit (FoM) increasing by $10.5\%$. These results highlight the advantages of leveraging multiple power spectra in BAO reconstruction, ultimately enabling more precise cosmological parameter estimation.

          Misalignment of the Lense-Thirring precession by an accretion torque

 - **Abstract**
 Context: Orbiting matter misaligned with a spinning black hole undergoes Lense-Thirring precession, due to the frame-dragging effect. This phenomenon is particularly relevant for type-C QPOs observed in the hard states of low-mass X-ray binaries. However, the accretion flow in these hard states is complex, consisting of a geometrically thick, hot corona surrounded by a geometrically thin, cold disk. Recent simulations have demonstrated that, in such a truncated disk scenario, the precession of the inner hot corona slows due to its interaction with the outer cold disk. Aims: This paper aims to provide an analytical description of the precession of an inner (hot) torus in the presence of accretion torques exerted by the outer (cold) disk. Methods. Using the angular momentum conservation equation, we investigate the evolution of the torus angular momentum vector for various models of accretion torque. Results: We find that, in general, an accretion torque tilts the axis of precession away from the black hole spin axis. In all models, if the accretion torque is sufficiently strong, it can halt the precession; any perturbation from this stalled state will cause the torus to precess around an axis that is misaligned with the black hole spin axis. Conclusions: The accretion torque exerted by the outer thin disk can cause precession around an axis that is neither aligned with the black hole spin axis nor perpendicular to the plane of the disk. This finding may have significant observational implications, as the jet direction, if aligned with the angular momentum axis of the torus, may no longer reliably indicate the black hole spin axis or the orientation of the outer accretion disk.

 - **Abstract**
 This article discusses strong nuggets (SNs) which means strong interaction condensed matter clusters with a mass of about $10^6\,$g. They may originate from the early universe, supernova, pulsar merger event, and so on. Depending on the equation of state, the SNs could be stable and even be one of the candidates for dark matter. In order to detect SNs which hitting the Earth or the Moon at a non-relativistic velocity, a new messenger, the acoustic array, is analysed. The results of the calculations show that the impact signal of an SN can be detected at a distance of about 30 kilometers from the nugget's trajectory. By using microphone boxes, hydrophones or seismographs to construct an array in the bedrock, ocean or on the Moon, it is possible to reconstruct the velocity, mass, and interacting cross section of SNs, and then constrain also the nature of supra-nuclear matter. The acoustic array can also be used for distributed acoustic sensing of meteorites or earthquakes. The sonar localisation system on the proposed High-energy Underwater Neutrino Telescope (HUNT) is suggested as a pathfinder for acoustic array detection.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a detailed 3D photoionization model of the planetary nebula NGC 3132, constrained by the latest observations. Using the MOCASSIN code, the model incorporates integrated and spatially resolved spectroscopy, velocity-resolved line profiles, emission line maps, and photometry, including recent high-quality data from MUSE (VLT) and JWST among others. Based on new data from the SAMFP instrument at SOAR, the three-dimensional density structure of the nebula was obtained by assuming homologous expansion of the surrounding nebular gas. The final fitted model successfully reproduces all key observational constraints available, particularly in terms of the detailed emission line integrated fluxes and ionization structures across different ionic stages. The results of the model show that the progenitor star had a mass of $(2.7 \pm 0.2)M_{\odot}$ and is surrounded by a He poor shell of dust and gas. The abundances of He, C, N, O, and S determined by the model show that the nebula has C/O=$(2.02 \pm 0.28)$ and N/O=$(0.39 \pm 0.38)$ consistent with the progenitor mass found.

 - **Abstract**
 The Pierre Auger Observatory, located near the town Malargüe in the province of Mendoza, Argentina, is the largest cosmic-ray detector in existence, covering an area of 3000 km2. The upgraded Observatory, in Phase II of operations, consists of a surface array of 1660 stations combining water Cherenkov, scintillator, and radio detectors. A subset of stations also includes underground muon detectors. Additionally, fluorescence detectors located at four sites overlook the array. The science goals for the enhanced Observatory include the measurement of the properties of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays with large statistics and high sensitivity to the primary composition. The Observatory is also sensitive to photons and neutrinos at the highest energies, allowing it to participate in multi-messenger studies. The Auger Offline Framework provides the tools to perform detailed simulations, using the Geant 4 toolkit, of all components of the Observatory and the analysis of both data and simulated events. It proved to have the flexibility needed to evolve during the lifetime of the Observatory, to accommodate new sub-detectors and, recently, changes to the station readout electronics. A new challenge is interfacing the framework with Machine Learning tools for both the development and execution of neural-network-based algorithms. Independent of the framework, CORSIKA 7 is used to simulate particles, fluorescence light, and radio signals produced by air showers. The production of simulations is coordinated centrally to provide standard libraries for analyses and to optimize the use of computing resources. We will describe the evolution and status of the Offline Framework and the tools used to coordinate the simulation efforts. We will also discuss the challenges of the massive simulation efforts and the resources consumed to provide the simulation libraries required by the Collaboration.

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce a comprehensive, custom-developed neural network, the PUREPath-B, that yields a posterior predictive distribution of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) B-mode signal conditioned on the foreground contaminated CMB data and informed by the training dataset. Our network employs nested probabilistic multi-modal U-Net framework, enhanced with probabilistic ResNets at skip connections and seamlessly integrates Bayesian statistics and variational methods to minimize the foreground and noise contaminations. During training, the initial prior distribution over network parameters evolves into approximate posterior distributions through Bayesian inference, constrained by the training data. From the approximate joint full posterior of the model parameters, our network infers a predictive CMB posterior during inference and yields summary statistics such as predictive mean, variance of the cleaned map. The predictive standard deviation provides an interpretable measure of per-pixel uncertainty in the predicted mean CMB map. For loss function, we use a linear combination of KL-Divergence loss and weighted MAE-which ensures that maps with higher amplitudes do not dominate the loss disproportionately. Furthermore, the results from the cosmological parameter estimation using the cleaned B-mode power spectrum, along with its error estimates demonstrates our network minimizes the foreground contaminations effectively, enabling accurate recovery of tensor-to-scalar ratio and lensing amplitude.

 - **Abstract**
 The chiral gravitational wave background (GWB) can be produced by axion-like fields in the early universe. We perform parameter estimation for two types of chiral GWB with the LISA-Taiji network: axion-dark photon coupling and axion-Nieh-Yan coupling. We estimate the spectral parameters of these two mechanisms induced by axion and determine the normalized model parameters using the Fisher information matrix. For highly chiral GWB signals that we choose to analyze in the mHz band, the normalized model parameters are constrained with a relative error less than $6.7\%$ (dark photon coupling) and $2.2\%$ (Nieh-Yan coupling) at the one-sigma confidence level. The circular polarization parameters are constrained with a relative error around $21\%$ (dark photon coupling) and $6.2\%$ (Nieh-Yan coupling) at the one-sigma confidence level.

 - **Abstract**
 Lensed quasars are key to many areas of study in astronomy, offering a unique probe into the intermediate and far universe. However, finding lensed quasars has proved difficult despite significant efforts from large collaborations. These challenges have limited catalogues of confirmed lensed quasars to the hundreds, despite theoretical predictions that they should be many times more numerous. We train machine learning classifiers to discover lensed quasar candidates. By using semi-supervised learning techniques we leverage the large number of potential candidates as unlabelled training data alongside the small number of known objects, greatly improving model performance. We present our two most successful models: (1) a variational autoencoder trained on millions of quasars to reduce the dimensionality of images for input to a gradient boosting classifier that can make accurate predictions and (2) a convolutional neural network trained on a mix of labelled and unlabelled data via virtual adversarial training. These models are both capable of producing high-quality candidates, as evidenced by our discovery of GRALJ140833.73+042229.98. The success of our classifier, which uses only images, is particularly exciting as it can be combined with existing classifiers, which use other data than images, to improve the classifications of both models and discover more lensed quasars.

 - **Abstract**
 The field of astronomy evolves rapidly, and it is essential to keep up with these changes in order to effectively communicate with the broader community. However, communication itself also changes as new words, phrases, and slang terms enter the common vernacular. This is especially true for the current youngest generations, who are capable of efficiently communicating via the Internet. In order to maintain effective communication, we explore the possibility of expanding the language used in scientific communication to include recently coined slang. This attempt at outreach, while potentially very difficult, could provide a means to expand the field and capture the attention of early-career scientists, improving retention within the field. However, our results indicate that, while possible, this method of communication is, like, probably not really worth it, no cap.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at high redshifts challenge standard seeding scenarios. We examine a dissipative self-interacting dark matter (dSIDM) model in which gravothermal collapse leads to the formation of massive BH seeds ab initio. We utilize a semi-analytical framework to predict properties of the dSIDM-seeded SMBH population. Billion solar mass quasars are reproduced along with low-mass faint active galactic nuclei (known as little red dots) with SMBH-to-galaxy stellar mass ratios consistent with recent James Webb Space Telescope observations. To match the abundance of the observed bright quasars, a percent-level duty-cycle is suggested, implying a large population of dormant SMBHs. The gravitational wave (GW) signals from mergers of these massive SMBHs can be detected by LISA while remaining within the NANOGrav constraints on the GW background. These results provide testable signatures of DM-driven SMBH formation, offering a pathway to probe hidden-sector physics through SMBH and GW observables.

          A generalized method to measure the Lorentz factor from gamma-ray burst photospheric emission

 - **Abstract**
 The properties of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) that are inferred from observations depend on the value of the bulk Lorentz factor, $\Gamma$. Consequently, accurately estimating it is an important aim. In this work, we present a method of measuring $\Gamma$ based on observed photospheric emission, which can also be used for highly dissipative flows that may lead to non-thermal spectral shapes. For the method to be applicable, two conditions need to be met: the photon number should be conserved in the later stages of the jet, and the original photon temperature must be inferred from the data. The case of dissipation via subphotospheric shocks is discussed in detail, and we show that the method is particularly efficient when a low-energy spectral break is identified. We demonstrate the capabilities of the method by applying it to two different GRB spectra. From one of the spectra, we obtain a value for $\Gamma$ with statistical uncertainties of only $\sim 15$\%, while for the other spectrum we only obtain an upper limit.

          The MeerKAT Absorption Line Survey (MALS) data release 3: Cold atomic gas associated with the Milky Way

 - **Abstract**
 We present results of a blind search for Galactic HI 21-cm absorption lines toward 19130 radio sources, using 390 pointings of MALS, each pointing centered on a source brighter than 200 mJy. We detected 3640 HI absorption features. This represents the largest Galactic HI absorption line catalog to date. Based on the strong correlation between the HI 21-cm emission line column densities ($N_{HI}$) and the visual extinction ($A_V$) measured toward the pointing center, along with the confinement of the absorption features to a narrow range in radial velocities (-25$<v_{\rm LSR}$[kms$^{-1}$]$<$+25), we infer that the detected absorption lines form a homogeneous sample of HI clouds in the local interstellar medium (LISM). The HI 21-cm absorption optical depth is linearly correlated to $N_{HI}$ and $A_V$, up to $A_V$ of about 1 mag. Above this threshold, $A_V$ traces the total hydrogen content, and consequently, $A_V$ and $N_{HI}$ scale, differently. The slopes of $N_{HI}$ distributions of central sight lines with HI 21-cm absorption detections and non-detection differ at $>2\sigma$. A similar difference is observed for H$_2$ detections and non-detections in damped Lyman-alpha systems at $z$ > 1.8, implying that turbulence-driven WNM-to-CNM conversion is the common governing factor for the presence of HI 21-cm and H$_2$ absorption. Through a comparison of central and off-axis absorption features, we find that the slope of rms fluctuations in the optical depth variations in the quiescent gas associated with LISM is shallower than the earlier measurements in the disk. The densities (20-30 cm$^{-3}$) inferred from the optical depth variations are typical of the CNM values. The negligible velocity shifts between central and off-axis absorbers are in line with the hypothesis that the CNM and LNM clouds freeze out of the extended WNM phase.

          The Optical to X-ray Luminosity and Spectrum of Supernova Wind Breakouts

 - **Abstract**
 Observations indicate that optically thick circum-stellar medium (CSM) at radii of $10^{14}-10^{15}$ cm around core-collapse supernovae (SN) progenitors is common. The breakout of the SN radiation-mediated shock (RMS) through such CSM leads to the formation of a collisionless shock (CLS). We analyze the evolution of the shock structure and associated radiation field during and after the RMS-CLS transition for non-relativistic breakouts (breakout shock velocity $v_{\rm bo}=10^9v_9~{\rm cm/s}<0.1c$) through a hydrogen-rich CSM "wind" density profile, $\rho\propto r^{-2}$, with breakout radius $R_{\rm bo}=10^{14}R_{14}$ cm much larger than the progenitor radius. An analytic description of the key properties of the emitted optical to X-ray radiation is provided, supported by numeric radiation-hydrodynamics calculations that self-consistently describe the time-dependent spatial distribution of the plasma and radiation, governed by the interplay between Bremsstrahlung emission/absorption and inelastic Compton scattering. We show that the characteristic energy of the photons carrying most of the luminosity, $\approx10^{43}R_{14}v_9^2$ erg/s, shifts from UV to X-ray, reaching 1 keV as the shock reaches $\approx3R_{\rm bo}$. The X-ray signal is not suppressed by propagation through the upstream wind, and its absence may suggest that the dense CSM does not extend much beyond $R_{\rm bo}$. Our results provide the basis for a quantitative calculation of the high energy $\gamma$-ray and neutrino emission that is expected from particles accelerated at the CLS, and will allow using data from upcoming surveys that will systematically detect large numbers of young SNe, particularly ULTRASAT, to infer the pre-explosion mass loss history of the SN progenitor population.

 - **Abstract**
 Polymeric wavelength shifters are of particular interest for large liquid argon detectors. Inspired by the success of polyethylene naphthalate (PEN), other new polymers exhibiting a similar type of excimer fluorescence were investigated. We report on the preliminary results of the first cryogenic wavelength shifting test of a solution-cast film of PVN, poly(2-vinyl naphthalene). Significant brittleness was identified as a factor potentially limiting the use of PVN. However, clear signs of wavelength shifting were observed, with the overall efficiency and time response comparable to those of PEN.

 - **Abstract**
 The Aguas Zarcas (Costa Rica) CM2 carbonaceous chondrite fell during night time in April 2019. Security and dashboard camera video of the meteor were analyzed to provide a trajectory, lightcurve, and orbit of the meteoroid. The trajectory was near vertical, 81° steep, arriving from an ~109° (WNW) direction with apparent entry speed of 14.6 +/- 0.6 km/s. The meteoroid penetrated to ~25 km altitude (5 MPa dynamic pressure), where the surviving mass shattered, producing a flare that was detected by the Geostationary Lightning Mappers on GOES-16 and GOES-17. The cosmogenic radionuclides were analyzed in three recovered meteorites by either gamma-ray spectroscopy or accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS), while noble gas concentrations and isotopic compositions were measured in the same fragment that was analyzed by AMS. From this, the pre-atmospheric size of the meteoroid and its cosmic-ray exposure age were determined. The studied samples came from a few cm up to 30 cm deep in an object with an original diameter of ~60 cm, that was ejected from its parent body 2.0 +/- 0.2 Ma ago. The ejected material had an argon retention age of 2.9 Ga. The object was delivered most likely by the 3:1 or 5:2 mean motion resonances and, without subsequent fragmentation, approached Earth from a low i < 2.8° inclined orbit with perihelion distance q = 0.98 AU close to Earth orbit. The steep entry trajectory and high strength resulted in deep penetration in the atmosphere and a relatively large fraction of surviving mass.

          Jupiter's Interior with an Inverted Helium Gradient

 - **Abstract**
 Jupiter's gravity field observed by NASA's Juno spacecraft indicates that the density in the 10--100 GPa region is lower than one would expect from a H/He adiabat with 0.5-5x solar water abundance as has been observationally inferred in Jupiter's atmosphere, supported by the 2--4$\times$ solar enrichment in the heavy noble gases and other volatiles observed by the Galileo entry probe. Here, we assume that Jupiter's envelope harbors a radiative window at ~0.975-0.99 RJ. This outer stable layer (OSL) delays particle exchange and accelerates the cooling of the deep interior. Consequently, the He-depletion at the Mbar-level where H/He phase separation occurs would be stronger than seen in the atmosphere. We find that the inverted He-gradient across the OSL leads to atmospheric heavy element abundances that are up to dZatm=0.03 (+2x solar) higher than for adiabatic models. With an additional inverted Z-gradient, Zatm up to 3x solar is possible. Models with 1x solar Zatm have a dilute core confined to the inner 0.2-0.3 MJ (0.4-0.5 RJ), smaller than in adiabatic models. Models with 3x solar Zatm have a largely homogeneous-Z interior at 1x solar. The low observed atmospheric Ne/He ratio suggests that Ne is transported through the OSL as efficiently as He is and at an enhanced diffusivity as is characteristic of double diffusive convection. Better knowledge of the H/He-EOS in the 10--100 GPa region and of the H/He phase diagram is needed to understand Jupiter's interior structure.

 - **Abstract**
 By consideration of the Compact object HESS J1731-347 as a hybrid twin compact star, i.e., a more compact star than its hadronic twin of the same mass, its stellar properties are derived. Besides showing that the properties of compact stars in this work are in good agreement with state-of-the-art constraints both from measurements carried out in laboratory experiments as well as by multi-messenger astronomy observations, the realization of an early strong hadron-quark first order phase transition as implied by the twins is discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 Hot exozodiacal dust is dust in the innermost regions of planetary systems, at temperatures around 1000K to 2000K, and commonly detected by near-infrared interferometry. The phenomenon is poorly understood and has received renewed attention as a potential risk to a planned future space mission to image potentially habitable exoplanets and characterize their atmospheres (exo-Earth imaging) such as the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO). In this article, we review the current understanding of hot exozodiacal dust and its implications for HWO. We argue that the observational evidence suggests that the phenomenon is most likely real and indeed caused by hot dust, although conclusive proof in particular of the latter statement is still missing. Furthermore, we find that there exists as of yet no single model that is able to successfully explain the presence of the dust. We find that it is plausible and not unlikely that large amounts of hot exozodiacal dust in a system will critically limit the sensitivity of exo-Earth imaging observations around that star. It is thus crucial to better understood the phenomenon in order to be able to evaluate the actual impact on such a mission, and current and near-future observational opportunities for acquiring the required data exist. At the same time, hot exozodiacal dust (and warm exozodiacal dust closer to a system's habitable zone) has the potential to provide important context for HWO observations of rocky, HZ planets, constraining the environment in which these planets exist and hence to determine why a detected planet may be capable to sustain life or not.

          Dependence of Planet populations on Stellar Mass and Metallicity: A Pebble Accretion-based Planet Population Synthesis

 - **Abstract**
 The formation and evolution of planetary systems are linked to their host stellar environment. In this study, we employ a pebble accretion-based planet population synthesis model to explore the correlation between planetary properties and stellar mass/metallicity. Our numerical results reproduce several main aspects of exoplanetary observations. First, we find that the occurrence rate of super-Earths $\eta_{\rm SE}$ follows an inverted V-shape in relation to stellar mass: it increases with stellar mass among lower-mass dwarfs, peaks at early-M dwarfs, and declines toward higher-mass GK stars. Second, super-Earths grow ubiquitously around stars with various metallicities, exhibiting a flat or weak $\eta_{\rm SE}$ dependence on $Z_{\star}$. Third, giant planets, in contrast, form more frequently around stars with higher-mass/metallicity. Lastly, we extend a subset of simulations to $1$ Gyr to investigate the long-term evolution of the systems' architecture. By converting our simulated systems into synthetic observations, we find that the eccentricities and inclinations of single-transit systems increase with stellar metallicity, while these dependencies in multi-planet systems remains relatively weak. The alignment between our results and observations provides key insights into the connection between planet populations and stellar properties.

 - **Abstract**
 Karabo is a versatile Python-based software framework simplifying research with radio astronomy data. It bundles existing software packages into a coherent whole to improve the ease of use of its components. Karabo includes useful abstractions, like strategies to scale and parallelize typical workloads or science-specific Python modules. The framework includes functionality to access datasets and mock observations to study the Square Kilometer Array (SKA) instruments and their expected accuracy. SKA will address problems in a wide range of fields of astronomy. We demonstrate the application of Karabo to some of the SKA science cases from HI intensity mapping, mock radio surveys, radio source detection, the epoch of re-ionisation and heliophysics. We discuss the capabilities and challenges of simulating large radio datasets in the context of SKA.

          The Impact of Triangular-Toothed Gears on the Functionality of the Antikythera Mechanism

Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/
 - **Abstract**
 The Antikythera Mechanism is based on a complex system of interconnected gears. Recent analyses have highlighted the influence of triangular tooth profiles and manufacturing inaccuracies on its performance. This study combines Alan Thorndike's analytical solution for the non-uniform motion caused by triangular teeth with Mike Edmunds' error model accounting for manufacturing imprecisions. We developed a computational program to simulate the behavior of the mechanism's pointers, integrating variables from both models. Since the impact of these variables is speculative, our results must be interpreted with caution. Our findings indicate that while the triangular shape of the teeth alone produces negligible errors, manufacturing inaccuracies significantly increase the likelihood of gear jamming or disengagement. Under our assumptions, the errors identified by Edmunds exceed the tolerable limits required to prevent failures. Consequently, either the mechanism never functioned or its actual errors were smaller than those reported by Edmunds. Although it seems unlikely that someone would build such a complex yet non-functional device, there are strong reasons to question whether Edmunds' values accurately reflect the mechanism's original errors.

 - **Abstract**
 The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) is a wide-field all-sky survey mission designed to detect Earth-sized exoplanets. After over four years photometric surveys, data from sectors 1-57, including approximately 1,050,000 light curves with a 2-minute cadence, were collected. By cross-matching the data with Gaia's variable star catalogue, we obtained labeled datasets for further analysis. Using a random forest classifier, we performed classification of variable stars and designed distinct classification processes for each subclass, 6770 EA, 2971 EW, 980 CEP, 8347 DSCT, 457 RRab, 404 RRc and 12348 ROT were identified. Each variable star was visually inspected to ensure the reliability and accuracy of the compiled catalog. Subsequently, we ultimately obtained 6046 EA, 3859 EW, 2058 CEP, 8434 DSCT, 482 RRab, 416 RRc, and 9694 ROT, and a total of 14092 new variable stars were discovered.

          Advancing Cosmological Parameter Estimation and Hubble Parameter Reconstruction with Long Short-Term Memory and Efficient-Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we propose a novel approach for cosmological parameter estimation and Hubble parameter reconstruction using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Efficient-Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (Ef-KAN). LSTM networks are employed to extract features from observational data, enabling accurate parameter inference and posterior distribution estimation without relying on solvable likelihood functions. This method achieves performance comparable to traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques, offering a computationally efficient alternative for high-dimensional parameter spaces. By sampling from the reconstructed data and comparing it with mock data, our designed LSTM constraint procedure demonstrates the superior performance of this method in terms of constraint accuracy, and effectively captures the degeneracies and correlations between the cosmological parameters. Additionally, the Ef-KAN model is introduced to reconstruct the Hubble parameter H(z) from both observational and mock data. Ef-KAN is entirely data-driven approach, free from prior assumptions, and demonstrates superior capability in modeling complex, non-linear data distributions. We validate the Ef-KAN method by reconstructing the Hubble parameter, demonstrating that H(z) can be reconstructed with high accuracy. By combining LSTM and Ef-KAN, we provide a robust framework for cosmological parameter inference and Hubble parameter reconstruction, paving the way for future research in cosmology, especially when dealing with complex datasets and high-dimensional parameter spaces.

 - **Abstract**
 The dark count rate is one of the key properties of avalanche photodiodes (APDs) and silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs). Previous studies have reported discrete shifts in the dark count rate on short timescales ~10 ms to ~100 s with small increases (up to ~1 kHz per APD). In this study, we report a similar yet distinct phenomenon in the dark current of SiPMs designed for gamma-ray telescopes. Long-term stability tests (>100 days) revealed bimodal or multimodal dark current shifts of the order of 0.1 uA on timescales of days in 48 out of 128 SiPM channels. In addition, optical emission was observed from an APD surface when the dark current was in a high state. These findings suggest that multimodal dark current behavior is a common property of SiPMs, which may be due to defects in the silicon.

 - **Abstract**
 Transmission spectroscopy has provided unprecedented insight into the makeup of exoplanet atmospheres. A transmission spectrum contains contributions from a planet's morning and evening limbs, which can differ in temperature, composition and aerosol properties due to atmospheric circulation. While high-resolution ground-based observations have identified limb asymmetry in several ultra-hot/hot exoplanets, space-based studies of limb asymmetry are still in their early stages. The prevalence of limb asymmetry across a broad range of exoplanets remains largely unexplored. We conduct a comparative analysis of retrievals on transmission spectra, including traditional 1D approaches and four 2D models that account for limb asymmetry. Two of these 2D models include our newly proposed dynamical constraints derived from shallow-water simulations to provide physically-motivated temperature differences between limbs. Our analysis of WASP-39 b using JWST observations and previous combined datasets (HST, VLT, and Spitzer) strongly favors 2D retrievals over traditional 1D approaches, confirming significant limb asymmetry in this hot Jupiter. Within our 2D framework, unconstrained models recover larger temperature contrasts than dynamically-constrained models, with improved fits to specific spectral features, although Bayesian evidence cannot definitively distinguish between these 2D approaches. Our results support the presence of homogeneous C/O in both the morning and evening atmospheres, but with temperature differences leading to variations in clouds and hazes. Using this treatment, we can study a larger sample of hot Jupiters to gain insights into atmospheric limb asymmetries on these planets.

 - **Abstract**
 The combined timing analysis of data from the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope (FAST) and the Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT) confirmed that PSR J0002+6216 is not a hyper-velocity (exceeding 1000 km s$^{-1}$) pulsar. From this analysis, we determined the total proper motion of PSR J0002+6216 to be $\mu_{\rm tot}=39.05\pm15.79$ mas yr$^{-1}$, which is consistent with Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) measurements to within 0.24$\sigma$. Moreover, two glitches were detected for the first time, which occurred on MJD 58850(17) and MJD 60421(6), respectively. The second glitch exhibited an exponential recovery process, with $Q = 0.0090(3)$ and $\tau_{\rm d} = 45(3)$ days. Additionally, with FAST high-sensitivity observations, we measured the interstellar rotation measure (RM) and the three-dimensional (3D) orientation of the spin axis for the first time, and updated the dispersion measure (DM) of PSR J0002+6216. Currently, no variations in RM or DM have been detected. By combining the measured RM with the observed position angle of the spin axis, we determined that the intrinsic position angle of the pulsar's spin axis is $\psi_{0}(\text{intrinsic}) = 89.9^{\circ} \pm 4.6^{\circ}$. When we compared this with the proper motion position angle obtained from VLBI, we found a misalignment of approximately 23$^{\circ}$ between the spin and velocity angles of PSR J0002+6216. At present, pulsars with 2D spin-velocity angle measurements are unable to fully test the Janka et al.(2022) model. However, with more high-precision observational data in the future, we will be able to further test models related to pulsar birth.

 - **Abstract**
 Astroseismology in eclipsing binaries with Delta ($\delta$) Scuti components offers a powerful means to derive stellar parameters and probe internal structures. To enable accurate frequency analysis, binary characteristics must be disentangled from the observed light curves. This study utilizes the LC2015 light curve modeling method, followed by the DC2015 differential correction process, integrated into the Wilson-Devinney (WD) eclipsing binary modeling code. The analysis focuses on two $\delta$ Scuti binary systems, KIC 8504570 and SX DRACONIS (Dra), using Kepler and TESS photometric data, supplemented by literature-derived initial stellar parameters. The DC2015 process employs the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm to minimize the difference between observed and modeled light curves. The refined models provide highly accurate stellar parameters, including primary and secondary star temperatures ($T_{eff},1$ and $T_{eff},2$), mass ratio (q), and primary star luminosity (L1) with associated errors. For KIC 8504570: $T_{eff},1$ (7400.9 $\pm$ 1.6) K, $T_{eff},2$ (5450.0 $\pm$ 1.0) K, q (0.5208 $\pm$ 0.0002), and L1 (11.8043 $\pm$ 0.0006)$L_\odot$. For SX Dra: $T_{eff},1$ (7729.7 $\pm$ 1.1) K , $T_{eff},2$ (4927.5 $\pm$ 0.5) K, q (0.4772 $\pm$ 0.0006), and L1 (7.0474 $\pm$ 0.0015)$L_\odot$.

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxy morphology classification plays a crucial role in understanding the structure and evolution of the universe. With galaxy observation data growing exponentially, machine learning has become a core technology for this classification task. However, traditional machine learning methods predominantly rely on supervised learning frameworks, and their dependence on large of labeled samples limits practical applications. To address this challenge, we propose an innovative hybrid semi-supervised model, GC-SWGAN, designed to tackle galaxy morphology classification under conditions of limited labeled data. This model integrates semi-supervised generative adversarial networks (SGAN) with Wasserstein GAN with gradient penalty (WGAN-GP), establishing a multi-task learning framework. Within this framework, the discriminator and classifier are designed independently while sharing part of the architecture. By collaborating with the generator, the model significantly enhances both classification performance and sample generation capabilities, while also improving convergence and stability during training. Experimental results demonstrate that, on the Galaxy10 DECals dataset, GC-SWGAN achieves comparable or even superior classification accuracy (exceeding 75%) using only one-fifth of the labeled samples typically required by conventional fully supervised methods. Under identical labeled conditions, the model displays excellent generalization performance, attaining approximately 84% classification accuracy. Notably, in extreme scenarios where only 10\% of the data is labeled, GC-SWGAN still achieves high classification accuracy (over 68%), fully demonstrating its stability and effectiveness in low-labeled data environments. Furthermore, galaxy images generated by GC-SWGAN are visually similar to real samples.

 - **Abstract**
 Cen X-3 is an archetypical X-ray pulsar with strong flux variations and alternating torque reversals, both of which are similar to those of recently discovered pulsating ultra-luminous X-ray sources. We study a low state of Cen X-3 occurred in 2023 lasting for $\sim100$ days with Chandra and Insight-HXMT observations, supplemented with MAXI and Fermi/GBM data. The Chandra spectrum during the eclipse of Cen X-3 in the low state is very similar to that in the high state, especially, the Fe lines. The HXMT spectrum in the low state shows an enhanced Fe line, so do the MAXI data. The spin-up/spin-down trends of Cen X-3 are not affected by the low states. All these results indicate that the intrinsic emission in the low states is high, and the low states are just apparently low and are dominated by reprocessed emission. We found that the spin-up to spin-down reversals of Cen X-3 take longer time than the spin-down to spin-up reversals, which provides a definite observation test of any possible torque-reversal models. We discuss insights of these results for understanding the pulsating ultra-luminous X-ray sources.

 - **Abstract**
 The spherical cow approximation is widely used in the literature, but is rarely justified. Here, I propose several schemes for extending the spherical cow approximation to a full multipole expansion, in which the spherical cow is simply the first term. This allows for the computation of bovine potentials and interactions beyond spherical symmetry, and also provides a scheme for defining the geometry of the cow itself at higher multipole moments. This is especially important for the treatment of physical processes that are suppressed by spherical symmetry, such as the spindown of a rotating cow due to the emission of gravitational waves. I demonstrate the computation of multipole coefficients for a benchmark cow, and illustrate the applicability of the multipolar cow to several important problems.

 - **Abstract**
 Low- and intermediate-mass stars on the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) account for a significant portion of the dust and chemical enrichment in their host galaxy. Here we present ALMA observations of the continuum emission at 1.24 mm around a sample of 17 stars from the ATOMIUM survey. From our analysis of the stellar contributions to the continuum flux, we find that the semi-regular variables all have smaller physical radii and fainter monochromatic luminosities than the Mira variables. Comparing these properties with pulsation periods, we find a positive trend between stellar radius and period only for the Mira variables with periods above 300 days and a positive trend between the period and the monochromatic luminosity only for the red supergiants and the most extreme AGB stars with periods above 500 days. We find that the continuum emission at 1.24 mm can be classified into four groups. "Featureless" continuum emission is confined to the (unresolved) regions close to the star for five stars in our sample, relatively uniform extended flux is seen for four stars, tentative bipolar features are seen for three stars, and the remaining five stars have unique or unusual morphological features in their continuum maps. These features can be explained by binary companions to 10 out of the 14 AGB stars in our sample. Based on our results we conclude that there are two modes of dust formation: well established pulsation-enhanced dust formation and our newly proposed companion-enhanced dust formation. If the companion is located close to the AGB star, in the wind acceleration region, then additional dust formed in the wake of the companion can increase the mass lost through the dust driven wind. This explains the different dust morphologies seen around our stars and partly accounts for a large scatter in literature mass-loss rates, especially among semiregular stars with small pulsation periods.

 - **Abstract**
 The first generation of stars, known as Population III (Pop III), played a crucial role in the early Universe through their unique formation environment and metal-free composition. These stars can undergo chemically homogeneous evolution (CHE) due to fast rotation, becoming more compact and hotter/bluer than their (commonly assumed) non-rotating counterparts. In this study, we investigate the impact of Pop III CHE on the 21-cm signal and cosmic reionization under various assumptions on Pop III star formation, such as their formation efficiency, initial mass function, and transition to metal-enriched star formation. We combine stellar spectra computed by detailed atmosphere models with semi-numerical simulations of Cosmic Dawn and the Epoch of Reionization ($z\sim 6-30$). The key effect of CHE arises from the boosted ionizing power of Pop III stars, which reduces the Pop III stellar mass density required to reproduce the observed Thomson scattering optical depth by a factor of $\sim 2$. Meanwhile, the maximum 21-cm global absorption signal is shallower by up to $\sim 15$ mK (11%), partly due to the reduced Lyman-band emission from CHE, and the large-scale ($k\sim 0.2\ \rm cMpc^{-1}$) power drops by a factor of a few at $z\gtrsim 25$. In general, the effects of CHE are comparable to those of Pop III star formation parameters, showing an interesting interplay with distinct features in different epochs. These results highlight the importance of metal-free/poor stellar evolution in understanding the early Universe and suggest that future studies should consider joint constraints on the physics of star/galaxy formation and stellar evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 The standard paradigm of cosmology assumes two distinct dark components, namely the dark energy driving the late-universe acceleration and the dark matter that is responsible for the structure formation. However, the necessity of splitting the dark-side world into two sectors has not been experimentally or theoretically proven. It is shown in Wang et al. 2024 that cosmology with one unified dark fluid can also explain the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and late-universe data, with the fitting quality not much worse than the standard Lambda cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model. The present work aims to provide a clearer physical interpretation of the Wang et al. 2024 results. We show that the unified dark fluid model can produce primary CMB temperature and polarization power spectra that are very close to the $\Lambda$CDM prediction (relative difference $\lesssim 10^{-4}$). The model can also mimic the $\Lambda$CDM background expansion history and linear growth factor on sub-horizon scales with percent-level accuracy. With better physical understanding of the model, we make precision tests and find a minor error in the Boltzmann code used in Wang et al. 2024. We correct the error and update the model comparison between $\Lambda$CDM and the unified dark fluid model.

 - **Abstract**
 As planetary nebulae (PNe) evolve, they develop slow and strong dust-driven stellar winds, making the joint study of dust and gas essential for understanding their nature. As a pilot investigation, we selected PN K 3-54 as our target, the only known PN in the Milky Way to exhibit infrared emission from both graphene (C$_{24}$) and fullerene (C$_{60}$). The gas is traced via molecular line emissions from $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, and C$^{18}$O ($J = 1 \rightarrow 0$), observed using the 13.7 m telescope of the Purple Mountain Observatory. We investigate the dynamics of this PN and identify a bipolar outflow. Preliminary results suggest that the large dynamical timescale of the outflow and the weak shock environment may account for the simultaneous survival of C$_{24}$ and C$_{60}$ within and around PN K 3-54.

 Binary stars are dynamical systems formed by two stars that are physically bound by the gravitational force. Binary stars are privileged laboratories, allowing one to measure the fundamental properties of stars but also potentially changing the way stars live and die. Because of this, binary stars have continuously played a central role in astrophysics. In this chapter, we focus on the observational properties of binary stars. What are the fundamental quantities that describe binaries? How do we detect and classify them? Which parameters can we constrain for different type of objects?

 - **Abstract**
 Theoretical computation of cosmological observables is an intensive process, restricting the speed at which cosmological data can be analysed and cosmological models constrained, and therefore limiting research access to those with high performance computing infrastructure. Whilst the use of machine learning to emulate these computations has been studied, most existing emulators are specialised and not suitable for emulating a wide range of observables with changing physical models. Here, we investigate the Model-adaptive Meta-Learning algorithm (MAML) for training a cosmological emulator. MAML attempts to train a set of network parameters for rapid fine-tuning to new tasks within some distribution of tasks. Specifically, we consider a simple case where the galaxy sample changes, resulting in a different redshift distribution and lensing kernel. Using MAML, we train a cosmic-shear angular power spectrum emulator for rapid adaptation to new redshift distributions with only $O(100)$ fine-tuning samples, whilst not requiring any parametrisation of the redshift distributions. We compare the performance of the MAML emulator to two standard emulators, one pre-trained on a single redshift distribution and the other with no pre-training, both in terms of accuracy on test data, and the constraints produced when using the emulators for cosmological inference. We observe that within an MCMC analysis, the MAML emulator is able to better reproduce the fully-theoretical posterior, achieving a Battacharrya distance from the fully-theoretical posterior in the $S_8$ -- $\Omega_m$ plane of 0.008, compared to 0.038 from the single-task pre-trained emulator and 0.243 for the emulator with no pre-training.

          Study of Ultra-High-Energy Gamma-Ray Source 1LHAASO J0056+6346u and Its Possible Origins

 - **Abstract**
 We report a dedicated study of the newly discovered extended UHE $\gamma$-ray source 1LHAASO J0056+6346u. Analyzing 979 days of LHAASO-WCDA data and 1389 days of LHAASO-KM2A data, we observed a significant excess of $\gamma$-ray events with both WCDA and KM2A. Assuming a point power-law source with a fixed spectral index, the significance maps reveal excesses of ${\sim}12.65\,\sigma$, ${\sim}22.18\,\sigma$, and ${\sim}10.24\,\sigma$ in the energy ranges of 1--25 TeV, 25--100 TeV, and $> 100$ TeV, respectively. We use a 3D likelihood algorithm to derive the morphological and spectral parameters, and the source is detected with significances of $12.65\,\sigma$ by WCDA and $25.27\,\sigma$ by KM2A. The best-fit positions derived from WCDA and KM2A data are (R.A. = $13.96^\circ\pm0.09^\circ$, Decl. = $63.92^\circ\pm0.05^\circ$) and (R.A. = $14.00^\circ\pm0.05^\circ$, Decl. = $63.79^\circ\pm0.02^\circ$), respectively. The angular size ($r_{39}$) of 1LHAASO J0056+6346u is $0.34^\circ\pm0.04^\circ$ at 1--25 TeV and $0.24^\circ\pm0.02^\circ$ at $> 25$ TeV. The differential flux of this UHE $\gamma$-ray source can be described by an exponential cutoff power-law function: $(2.67\pm0.25) \times 10^{-15} (E/20\,\text{TeV})^{-1.97\pm0.10} e^{-E/(55.1\pm7.2)\,\text{TeV}} \,\text{TeV}^{-1}\,\text{cm}^{-2}\,\text{s}^{-1}$. To explore potential sources of $\gamma$-ray emission, we investigated the gas distribution around 1LHAASO J0056+6346u. 1LHAASO J0056+6346u is likely to be a TeV PWN powered by an unknown pulsar, which would naturally explain both its spatial and spectral properties. Another explanation is that this UHE $\gamma$-ray source might be associated with gas content illuminated by a nearby CR accelerator, possibly the SNR candidate G124.0+1.4.

 - **Abstract**
 White-light observations from the WISPR instrument on NASA's Parker Solar Probe recently revealed the presence of a narrow, dense dust trail close to the orbit of asteroid 3200 Phaethon. Although Geminid-related, it aligns imperfectly with Phaethon's orbit and known Geminid meteoroid orbits. To address the nature of this dust trail, we performed a detailed comparison between the WISPR trail observations and several well-developed Geminid models. Simulating these models in the WISPR field of view visually demonstrates that the WISPR trail almost certainly represents the true ``density core'' of the Geminid stream. Trends in model trail width and offset from Phaethon's orbit, both as functions of true anomaly, agree with observations to varying extents. All the models, however, place their apparent core interior to the parent orbit due to Poynting-Robertson forces, contradictory to the WISPR trail which is exterior to Phaethon's orbit. Therefore, Phaethon's current orbit likely does not represent the orbit of the system parent, which most probably had a larger semi-major axis. These findings provide new initial conditions for future Geminid models, with WISPR identifying the Geminid core's position.

 This study examines the shock speed and source height of coronal shock waves using Type II solar radio bursts. The solar radio burst data from January 2022 to October 2023 were obtained from eCALLISTO archive. The type II radio bursts were isolated from the spectra through a rigorous noise reduction process by taking the maximum intensity of each time channel. Using plasma oscillations and electron density models for the solar corona, explicit expressions for shock speed and source height were obtained. From the dynamic spectra, the starting frequency of a burst was obtained and using these parameters shock speed and source height were calculated. Results confirmed shock speeds ranging from 343 to 1032 kms$^{-1}$ with average speed of 650$\pm$226 kms$^{-1}$ and source heights 1.317-1.724 R$_\odot$, with high precision in formula predictions. The study highlights the need for broader burst type inclusion in future research and underscores the efficacy of the developed methodologies to improve space weather forecasts.

 - **Abstract**
 Strong gravitational lenses with two background sources at widely separated redshifts are a powerful and independent probe of cosmological parameters. We can use these systems, known as Double-Source-Plane Lenses (DSPLs), to measure the ratio ($\beta$) of angular-diameter distances of the sources, which is sensitive to the matter density ($\Omega_m$) and the equation-of-state parameter for dark-energy ($w$). However, DSPLs are rare and require high-resolution imaging and spectroscopy for detection, lens modeling, and measuring $\beta$. Here we report only the second DSPL ever used to measure cosmological parameters. We model the DSPL AGEL150745+052256 from the ASTRO 3D Galaxy Evolution with Lenses (AGEL) survey using HST/WFC3 imaging and Keck/KCWI spectroscopy. The spectroscopic redshifts for the deflector and two sources in AGEL1507 are $z_{\rm defl}=0.594$, $z_{\rm S1}=2.163$, and $z_{\rm S2}=2.591$. We measure a stellar velocity dispersion of $\sigma_{\rm obs}=109 \pm 27$ km s$^{-1}$ for the nearer source. Using $\sigma_{\rm obs}$ for the main deflector (from literature) and S1, we test the robustness of our DSPL model. We measure $\beta=0.953^{+0.008}_{-0.010}$ for AGEL1507 and infer $\Omega_{\rm m}=0.33^{+0.38}_{-0.23}$ for $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Combining AGEL1507 with the published model of the Jackpot lens improves the precision on $\Omega_{\rm m}$ ($\Lambda$CDM) and w (wCDM) by $\sim 10 \%$. The inclusion of DSPLs significantly improves the constraints when combined with Plancks cosmic microwave background observations, enhancing precision on w by $30 \%$. This paper demonstrates the constraining power of DSPLs and their complementarity to other standard cosmological probes. Tighter future constraints from larger DSPL samples discovered from ongoing and forthcoming large-area sky surveys would provide insights into the nature of dark energy.

These tools are especially valuable in astrobiology applications, where models must distinguish biotic patterns from complex abiotic backgrounds. Advancing the integration of autonomy through AI and ML into space missions is a complex challenge, and we believe that by focusing on key areas, we can make significant progress and offer practical recommendations for tackling these obstacles.

 - **Abstract**
 Context: The paradigm of convection in solar-like stars is questioned based on recent solar observations. Aims: The primary aim is to study the effects of surface-driven entropy rain on convection zone structure and flows. Methods: Simulations of compressible convection in Cartesian geometry with non-uniform surface cooling are used. The cooling profile includes localized cool patches that drive deeply penetrating plumes. Results are compared with cases with uniform cooling. Results: Sufficiently strong surface driving leads to strong non-locality and a largely subadiabatic convectively mixed layer. In such cases the net convective energy transport is done almost solely by the downflows. The spatial scale of flows decreases with increasing number of cooling patches for the vertical flows whereas the horizontal flows still peak at large scales. Conclusions: To reach the plume-dominated regime with a predominantly subadiabatic bulk of the convection zone requires significantly more efficient entropy rain than what is realized in simulations with uniform cooling. It is plausible that this regime is realized in the Sun but that it occurs on scales smaller than those resolved currently. Current results show that entropy rain can lead to largely mildly subadiabatic convection zone, whereas its effects for the scale of convection are more subtle.

 - **Abstract**
 There is mounting evidence from multiple cosmological probes that dark energy may be dynamical, with an equation of state that evolves over cosmic time. While this evidence is typically quantified using the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization, based on a linear expansion of $w(a)$ in the scale factor, non-parametric reconstructions frequently suggest non-linear features, particularly at late times. In this work, we investigate four minimal one-parameter models of dark energy with non-linear dependence on the scale factor. These models are constrained using Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data from Planck, lensing reconstruction from ACT-DR6, Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements from DESI-DR2, and three Type-Ia supernovae (SNe) samples (PantheonPlus, DESY5, and Union3), considered independently. Although our conclusions depend on the choice of SNe sample, we consistently find a preference, as measured by the chi-squared statistic and the Bayesian evidence, for these dynamical dark energy models over the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Notably, with the PantheonPlus dataset, one model shows strong Bayesian evidence ($\Delta \ln B \simeq 4.5$) against CPL, favoring an equation of state that peaks near $a \simeq 0.7$ and oscillates near the present day. These results highlight the impact of SNe selection and contribute to the growing collection of evidence for late-time deviations from $\Lambda$CDM.

 - **Abstract**
 Unveiling the physical structure of protoplanetary disk is crucial for interpreting the diversity of the exoplanet population. Until recently, the census of the physical properties of protoplanetary disks probed by mid-infrared observations was limited to the solar neighborhood ($d \lesssim 250$ pc); however, nearby star-forming regions (SFRs) such as Taurus -- where no O-type stars reside -- are not representative of the environments where the majority of the planet formation occurs in the Galaxy. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) now enables observations of disks in distant high-mass SFRs, where strong external Far-Ultraviolet (FUV) radiation is expected to impact those disks. Nevertheless, a detailed characterization of externally irradiated disks is still lacking. We use the thermochemical code ProDiMo to model JWST/MIRI spectroscopy and archival visual/near-infrared photometry aiming to constrain the physical structure of the irradiated disk around the solar-mass star XUE 1 in NGC 6357 ($d \approx 1690$ pc). Our findings are: (1) Mid-infrared dust emission features are explained by amorphous and crystalline silicates with compositions similar to nearby disks. (2) The molecular features detected with MIRI originate within the first $\sim 1$ au, consistent with slab models' results. (3) Our model favors a disk truncated at $10$ au with a gas-to-dust ratio of unity in the outskirts. (4) Comparing models of the same disk structure under different irradiation levels, we find that strong external irradiation raises gas temperature tenfold and boosts water abundance beyond $10$ au by a factor of $100$. Our findings suggest the inner disk resists external irradiation, retaining the elements necessary for planet formation.

 - **Abstract**
 We perform the first bispectrum analysis of the final Planck release temperature and E-polarization CMB data, called PR4. We use the binned bispectrum estimator pipeline that was also used for the previous Planck releases as well as the integrated bispectrum estimator. We test the standard primordial (local, equilateral and orthogonal) and secondary (lensing, unclustered point sources and CIB) bispectrum shapes. The final primordial results of the full T+E analysis are $f_\mathrm{NL}^\mathrm{local} = -0.1 \pm 5.0$, $f_\mathrm{NL}^\mathrm{equil} = 6 \pm 46$ and $f_\mathrm{NL}^\mathrm{ortho} = -8 \pm 21$. These results are consistent with previous Planck releases, but have slightly smaller error bars than in PR3, up to $12\%$ smaller for orthogonal. They represent the best Planck constraints on primordial non-Gaussianity. The lensing and point source bispectra are also detected, consistent with PR3. We perform several validation tests and find in particular that the 600 simulations, used to determine the linear correction term and the error bars, have a systematically low lensing bispectrum. We show however that this has no impact on our results.

 - **Abstract**
 Highly variable Black Hole X-ray Binary (BHXB) GRS~1915+105 has shown many flaring classes when the source oscillates between the High Soft state (HS) and the Hard Intermediate state (HIMS) with a transition time of less than 10 s. The X-ray flux is anti-correlated with hardness ratio (HR2) during these X-ray flaring classes. We have analyzed Astrosat/LAXPC \& SXT data and report here a new X-ray flaring class named $\eta$ class when the source oscillates between two HS states (the power-law index is always greater than 4) with transition time around 50 s. The X-ray flux is correlated with hardness ratio. This class is quasi-regular, and we have detected High Frequency Quasi Periodic Oscillations (HFQPOs) around 70 Hz during this new flaring class. The accretion rate changes by a factor of three over the burst cycle. We report here the results of our extensive study of spectral and timing characteristics of this new class.

 - **Abstract**
 In this study we investigate potential large-angle anisotropies in the angular distribution of the cosmological parameters $H_0$ (the Hubble constant) and $\Omega_m$ (the matter density) in the flat-$\Lambda$CDM framework, using the Pantheon+SH0ES supernovae catalog. For this we perform a directional analysis by dividing the celestial sphere into a set of directions, and estimate the best-fit cosmological parameters across the sky using a MCMC approach. Our results show a dominant dipolar pattern for both parameters in study, suggesting a preferred axis in the universe expansion and in the distribution of matter. However, we also found that for $z \gtrsim 0.015$, this dipolar behavior is not statistically significant, confirming the expectation -- in the $\Lambda$CDM scenario -- of an isotropic expansion and a uniform angular distribution of matter (both results at $1\,\sigma$ confidence level). Nevertheless, for nearby supernovae, at distances $\lesssim 60$ Mpc or $z \lesssim 0.015$, the peculiar velocities introduce a highly significant dipole in the angular distribution of $H_0$. Furthermore, we perform various robustness tests that support our findings, and consistency tests of our methodology.

 - **Abstract**
 The Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer and NEOWISE missions are a key source of thermal data for near-Earth asteroids (NEAs). These missions, which utilized a space-based platform in Earth orbit, produced thermal images across four different wavelength bands, W1 - W4, with effective wavelengths of 3.4, 4.6, 12, and 22 {\mu}m respectively. Despite its use for NEA observations though, the mission architecture was originally designed to observe stars. Thus, careful data analysis methods are crucial when working with NEA data to account for the differences between these objects. However, detailed information on how to work with these data can be difficult to find for users unfamiliar with the mission. The required information is well documented, but locating it can be challenging, and many details, such as specifics about color corrections, are not fully explained. Therefore, in this work, we provide a set of "lessons learned" for working with NEOWISE data, outline the basics of how to retrieve and process NEOWISE data for NEA investigations, and present an empirical method for color correction determination. We highlight the importance of this process by processing data for three NEAs, finding that nearly half of all available observations should be discarded. Finally, we present simple thermal model results based on different levels of data analysis to highlight how data processing can affect model results.

 - **Abstract**
 Lorentz invariance violation (LV) is examined through the time delay between high-energy and low-energy photons in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Previous studies determined the LV energy scale as $E_{\rm LV} \simeq 3.60 \times 10^{17}$~GeV using Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (FGST) data. This study updates the time-delay model and reaffirms these findings with new observations. High-energy photons from GRBs at GeV and TeV bands are analyzed, including the 99.3 GeV photon from GRB 221009A (FGST), the 1.07 TeV photon from GRB 190114C (MAGIC), and the 12.2 TeV photon from GRB 221009A (LHAASO). Our analysis, in conjunction with previous data, consistently shows that high-energy photons are emitted earlier than low-energy photons at the source. By evaluating 17 high-energy photons from 10 GRBs observed by FGST, MAGIC, and LHAASO, we estimate the LV energy scale to be $E_{\rm LV} \simeq 3.00 \times 10^{17}$ GeV. The null hypothesis of dispersion-free vacuum $E=pc$ (or, equivalently, the constant light-speed $v_{\gamma}=c$) is rejected at a significance level of 3.1$\sigma$ or higher.

          An on-the-fly line-driven-wind iterative mass-loss estimator (LIME) for hot, massive stars of arbitrary chemical compositions

 - **Abstract**
 Mass-loss rates from hot, massive stars are important for a range of astrophysical applications. We present a fast, efficient, and trivial-to-use real-time mass-loss calculator for line-driven winds from hot, massive stars with given stellar parameters and arbitrary chemical compositions, and make it available for public use via the world wide web (this https URL). The line-force is computed on-the-fly from excitation and ionisation balance calculations using a large atomic data base consisting of more than 4 million spectral lines. Mass-loss rates are then derived from line-driven wind theory including effects of a finite stellar disk and gas sound speed. For a given set of stellar parameters and chemical composition, we obtain predictions for the mass-loss rate and the three line-force parameters Qbar, Q0, and alpha at the wind critical point. Comparison of our predictions to a large sample of recent state-of-the-art, homogeneously derived empirical mass-loss rates obtained from the XshootU collaboration project (Vink et al. 2023) demonstrates that the super-simple calculator provided in this paper on average performs even better than the mass-loss recipes by Vink et al. (2001), Bjorklund et al. (2023), and Krticka et al. (2024) (which are all fits to restricted model grids based on more sophisticated, but also more intricate and much less flexible, methods). In addition to its speed and simplicity, a strength of our mass-loss calculator is that it avoids uncertainties related to applying fit-formulae to underlying model-grids calculated for more restricted parameter ranges. In particular, individual chemical abundances can here be trivially modified and their effects upon predicted mass-loss rates readily explored. This thus allows also for direct applications toward stars that are significantly chemically modified at the surface.

 - **Abstract**
 Cold neutral hydrogen (HI) is a crucial precursor for molecular gas formation and can be studied via HI absorption. This study investigates HI absorption in low column density regions of the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds (SMC and LMC) using the Galactic-ASKAP HI (GASKAP-HI) survey, conducted by the Australian Square Kilometer Array Pathfinder (ASKAP). We select 10 SMC directions in the outer regions and 18 LMC directions, with 4 in the outskirts and 14 within the main disk. Using the radiative transfer method, we decompose the emission and absorption spectra into individual cold neutral medium (CNM) and warm neutral medium (WNM) components. In the SMC, we find HI peak optical depths of 0.09-1.16, spin temperatures of ~20-50 K, and CNM fractions of 1-11%. In the LMC, optical depths range from 0.03 to 3.55, spin temperatures from ~10 to 100 K, and CNM fractions from 1% to 100%. The SMC's low CNM fractions likely result from its low metallicity and large line-of-sight depth. Additionally, the SMC's outskirts show lower CNM fractions than the main body, potentially due to increased CNM evaporation influenced by the hot Magellanic Corona. Shell motions dominate the kinematics of the majority of CNM clouds in this study and likely supply cold HI to the Magellanic Stream. In the LMC, high CNM fraction clouds are found near supergiant shells, where thermal instability induced by stellar feedback promotes WNM-to-CNM transition. Although no carbon monoxide (CO) has been detected, enhanced dust shielding in these areas helps maintain the cold HI.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new Python pipeline for processing data from astronomical long-slit spectroscopy observations recorded with CCD detectors. The pipeline is designed to aim for simplicity, manual execution, transparency and robustness. The goal for the pipeline is to provide a manual and simple counterpart to the well-established semi-automated and automated pipelines. The intended use-cases are teaching and cases where automated pipelines fail. From raw data, the pipeline can produce the following output: * A calibrated 2D spectrum in counts and wavelength for every detector pixel. * A 1D spectrum extracted from the 2D spectrum in counts per wavelength (for point-like objects). * A flux-calibrated 1D spectrum (for point-like objects). The products are obtained by performing standard procedures for detector calibrations (Howell, 2006; Richard Berry, 2005), cosmic-ray subtraction (McCully et al., 2018; van Dokkum, 2001), and 1D spectrum extraction (Bradley et al., 2024; Horne, 1986).

 - **Abstract**
 Over the course of the past decade, advances in the radial velocity and transit techniques have enabled the detection of rocky exoplanets in the habitable zones of nearby stars. Future observations with novel methods are required to characterize this sample of planets, especially those that are non-transiting. One proposed method is the Planetary Infrared Excess (PIE) technique, which would enable the characterization of non-transiting planets by measuring the excess infrared flux from the planet relative to the star's spectral energy distribution. In this work, we predict the efficacy of future observations using the PIE technique by potential future observatories such as the MIRECLE mission concept. To do so, we conduct a broad suite of 21 General Circulation Model (GCM) simulations with ExoCAM of seven nearby habitable zone targets for three choices of atmospheric composition with varying partial pressure of CO$_2$. We then construct thermal phase curves and emission spectra by post-processing our ExoCAM GCM simulations with the Planetary Spectrum Generator (PSG). We find that all cases have distinguishable carbon dioxide and water features assuming a 90$^\circ$ orbital inclination. Notably, we predict that CO$_2$ is potentially detectable at 15 $\mu\mathrm{m}$ with MIRECLE for at least four nearby known non-transiting rocky planet candidate targets in the habitable zone: Proxima Cenaturi b, GJ 1061 d, GJ 1002 b, and Teegarden's Star c. Our ExoCAM GCMs and PSG post-processing demonstrate the potential to observationally characterize nearby non-transiting rocky planets and better constrain the potential for habitability in our Solar neighborhood.

 - **Abstract**
 The Ultra-Violet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) on board AstroSat is an active telescope capable of high-resolution far-ultraviolet imaging (<1.5'') and low resolution (${\lambda}/{\delta}{\lambda}$ $\approx$ 100) slitless spectroscopy with a field of view as large as ~0.5 degrees. Now almost a decade old, UVIT continues to be operational and generates valuable data for the scientific community. UVIT is also capable of near-ultraviolet imaging (<1.5''); however, the near-ultraviolet channel stopped working in August 2018 after providing data for nearly three years. This article gives an overview of the latest version (7.0.1) of the UVIT pipeline and UVIT Data Release version 7. The high-level products generated using pipeline versions having a major version number of seven will be called "UVIT Data Release version 7". The latest pipeline version overcomes the two limitations of the previous version (6.3), namely (a) the inability to combine all episode-wise images and (b) the failure of the astrometry module in a large fraction of the observations. The procedures adopted to overcome these two limitations, as well as a comparison of the performance of this new version over the previous one, are presented in this paper. The UVIT Data Release version 7 products are available at the Indian Space Science Data Center of the Indian Space Research Organisation for archival and dissemination from 01 June 2024. The new pipeline version is open source and made available on GitHub.

          Dynamical Dark Energy Implies a Coupled Dark Sector: Insights from DESI DR2 via a Data-Driven Approach

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 2 (DR2) have revealed compelling evidence for dynamical dark energy, challenging the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. In this work, we adopt a data-driven, model-independent approach to reconstruct the dark energy equation of state (EoS) and its potential interaction with dark matter using combined background cosmological datasets, including DESI DR2, cosmic chronometers, observational Hubble data, and Type Ia supernovae. Using Gaussian Process regression and a non-parametric formalism, we first confirm a $\sim 2\sigma$ indication of dynamical dark energy, featuring a phantom crossing around redshift $z \sim 0.4$, consistent with DESI results. We then explore the implications of dynamical EoS from DESI DR2 for dark sector coupling. Incorporating priors on the EoS from DESI DR2, we find a $2.2\sigma$ signal for non-zero interactions between dark energy and dark matter at low redshift. Our results suggest that if DESI's evidence for time-varying dark energy is confirmed, a coupled dark sector may be a necessary extension beyond $\Lambda$CDM.

 - **Abstract**
 Highly ionized X-ray wind signatures have been found in the soft states of high-inclination Black Hole Low Mass X-ray Binaries (BHLMXBs) for more than two decades. Yet signs of a systematic evolution of the outflow itself along the outburst remain elusive, due to the limited sampling of individual sources and the necessity to consider the broad-band evolution of the Spectral Energy Distribution (SED). We perform an holistic analysis of archival X-ray wind signatures in the most observed wind-emitting transient BHLMXB to date, 4U 1630-47 . The combination of Chandra, NICER, NuSTAR, Suzaku, and XMM-Newton, complemented in hard X-rays by Swift/BAT and INTEGRAL, spans more than 200 individual days over 9 individual outbursts, and provides a near complete broad-band coverage of the brighter portion of the outburst. Our results show that the hard X-rays allow to define "soft" states with ubiquitous wind detections, and their contribution is strongly correlated with the Equivalent Width (EW) of the lines. We then constrain the evolution of the outflow in a set of representative observations, using thermal stability curves and photoionization modeling. The former confirms that the switch to unstable SEDs occurs well after the wind signatures disappear, to the point where the last canonical hard states are thermally stable. The latter shows that intrinsic changes in the outflow are required to explain the main correlations of the line EWs, be it with luminosity or the hard X-rays. These behaviors are seen systematically over all outbursts and confirm individual links between the wind properties, the thermal disk, and the corona.

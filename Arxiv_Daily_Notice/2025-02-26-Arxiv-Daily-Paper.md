 - **Abstract**
 Rotating black holes are the most powerful source of energy in the known universe, and are the cause of some of the most spectacular and extreme astronomical phenomena. The goal of this article is to analyze in simple terms the physics of energy extraction in rotating black holes. Specifically, the source of said energy, the efficiency of the energy extraction process, and some specific mechanisms that allow said extraction are analyzed. The article is intended primarily for undergraduate students of physics, astronomy and related fields.

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxy formation is a complex problem that connects large scale cosmology with small scale astrophysics over cosmic timescales. Hydrodynamical simulations are the most principled approach to model galaxy formation, but have large computational costs. Recently, emulation techniques based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been proposed to predict baryonic properties directly from dark matter simulations. The advantage of these emulators is their ability to capture relevant correlations, but at a fraction of the computational cost compared to simulations. However, training basic CNNs over large redshift ranges is challenging, due to the increasing non-linear interplay between dark matter and baryons paired with the memory inefficiency of CNNs. This work introduces EMBER-2, an improved version of the EMBER (EMulating Baryonic EnRichment) framework, to simultaneously emulate multiple baryon channels including gas density, velocity, temperature and HI density over a large redshift range, from z=6 to z=0. EMBER-2 incorporates a context-based styling network paired with Modulated Convolutions for fast, accurate and memory efficient emulation capable of interpolating the entire redshift range with a single CNN. Although EMBER-2 uses fewer than 1/6 the number of trainable parameters than the previous version, the model improves in every tested summary metric including gas mass conservation and cross-correlation coefficients. The EMBER-2 framework builds the foundation to produce mock catalogues of field level data and derived summary statistics that can directly be incorporated in future analysis pipelines.

 - **Abstract**
 Dark matter (DM) halos simulated via N-body techniques are known to exhibit nearly universal profiles at equilibrium; however, their origin remains uncertain despite thorough investigation. This work aims to probe the origin of simulated DM halo structure by testing DARKexp, a first-principles approach that describes the maximum entropy state of collisionless, self-gravitating systems in equilibrium via their energy distributions, and proposes an entropy functional that is expected to increase during evolution. We fit the DARKexp energy distribution to a set of massive equilibrium halos from the cosmological simulation IllustrisTNG. For the first time, we calculate the entropy of these halos as a function of cosmological time by tracking halos that are in equilibrium at z = 0.0, to z = 3.0 and calculating their entropy at various epochs between. We find that DARKexp provides an excellent fit to the energy distributions of equilibrium DM halos and that such halos exhibit an overall increase in entropy during evolution. Our results indicate that DM halos evolve to become their maximum entropy state at equilibrium and that this state is described by DARKexp.

          Sub-Millimeter Variability in the Envelope & Warped Protostellar Disk of the Class 0 Protostar HOPS 358

 - **Abstract**
 The JCMT Transient Survey recently discovered that the Class 0 protostar HOPS 358 decreased in 350 GHz continuum brightness by $\sim25$% over the course of four years before brightening again for the next four. The JCMT lightcurve can be fit by a long timescale dip lasting roughly eight years. A shorter timescale periodicity is also apparent with a period of 1.75 years and a small 3% amplitude. NEOWise monitoring reveals that the mid-IR wavelength brightness of HOPS 358 follows a similar long-term pattern in time. Here, we present a study of nine epochs of ALMA observations of HOPS 358 taken over the course of the decline and subsequent rise in brightness seen with the JCMT to test whether the variation seen on $\sim15"$ scales, covering both disk and envelope, is also observed on smaller, $<1"$ scales that primarily probe HOPS 358's protostellar disk. We detect both HOPS 358 and its southern companion, HOPS 358B, in our ALMA observations, and find that at least one of the two is varying. Assuming that HOPS 358 is the variable, the light curve has the same shape as that found by the JCMT. Additionally, our high resolution ALMA imaging of HOPS 358 reveals that the disk is warped, with a $16^{\circ}$ warp at a disk radius of 35 au, about halfway through the extent of the disk. The physical origin of the warp along with how it relates to the variability seen towards HOPS 358, however, remain unclear.

          Modeling the emission lines from r-process elements in Supernova nebulae

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of heavy r-process elements in the universe is still a matter of great debate, with a confirmed scenario being neutron star (NS) mergers. Additional relevant sites could be specific classes of events, such as gamma-ray burst (GRB) Supernovae (SNe), where a central engine could push neutron-rich material outwards, contributing to the ejecta of the massive exploding star. Here, we investigate our ability to infer the production of heavy elements in such scenarios, on the basis of the observed nebular emission. We solve the steady-state ionization, level population, and thermal balance, for optically thin ejecta in non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE), in order to explore the role of heavy elements in cooling the gas, and their imprint in the emergent spectrum a few hundreds days post-explosion. We find that heavy elements would be relevant in the cooling process of the nebula only if they account for at least $\sim1\%$ of the total ejected mass, at the typical kinetic temperatures of a few thousands K. However, even in the absence of such amount, a few $0.1\%$ of the total ejected mass could be instead sufficient to leave a detectable imprint around $\sim1-10~\mathrm{\mu m}$. This wavelength range, which would be relatively clean from features due to light elements, would be instead robustly populated by lines from heavy elements arising from forbidden transitions in their atomic fine structures. Hence, the new generation of telescopes, represented by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), will most likely allow for their detection.

          New Stellar Parameters, Metallicities, and Elemental Abundance Ratios for 311 Metal-Poor Stars

 - **Abstract**
 We present equivalent widths, improved model atmosphere parameters, and revised abundances for 14 species of 11 elements derived from high resolution optical spectroscopy of 311 metal-poor stars. All of these stars had their parameters previously published by Roederer et al. We use color-Teff relationships calibrated for Gaia and 2MASS photometry to calculate improved effective temperatures. We calculate log of surface gravity values using measurements derived from Gaia parallaxes and other fundamental stellar properties. We perform a standard LTE abundance analysis using MARCS model atmospheres and the MOOG line analysis software to rederive microturbulence velocity parameters, metallicities, and abundances based on O I, Na I, Mg I, Si I, K I, Ca I, Ti I, Ti II, Cr I, Cr II, Fe I, Fe II, Ni I, and Zn I lines using the previously measured equivalent widths. On average, the new Teff values are 310 K warmer, the new log g values are higher by 0.64 dex, and the new [Fe/H] values are higher by 0.26 dex. We apply NLTE corrections to the abundances derived from O I, Na I, Mg I, Si I, K I, Fe I, and Fe II lines. Our sample contains 6 stars with [Fe/H] < -3.5, 28 stars with [Fe/H] < -3.0, and 113 stars with [Fe/H] < -2.5. Our revised abundances for these 311 stars are now in better agreement with those derived by previous studies of smaller samples of metal-poor stars in the Milky Way.

          Chemistry and ro-vibrational excitation of HeH$^+$ in the Planetary Nebula NGC 7027

 - **Abstract**
 HeH$^+$ belongs to the class of "reactive" ions that can be destroyed so quickly that chemical formation and destruction rates may compete with inelastic rates and should be considered when solving the statistical equilibrium equations. This so-called chemical "pumping" or "excitation" effect is investigated here for the first time in HeH$^+$. The chemical evolution of HeH$^+$ in NGC 7027 is modeled with the CLOUDY photoionization code using updated reaction rate coefficients. The non-LTE analysis of the three observed HeH$^+$ emission lines is then performed with the CLOUDY and RADEX codes using an extensive set of spectroscopic and inelastic collisional data suitable for the specific high-temperature environment of NGC 7027. In a second approach, chemical formation and destruction rates of HeH$^+$ are implemented in RADEX. This code is combined with MCMC sampling (performed on the RADEX-parameters space) to extract the best-fit HeH$^+$ column density and physical conditions from the observed line fluxes. The CLOUDY and RADEX non-LTE results are found to be in good agreement, and the $\upsilon=1-0 \ P(2)/P(1)$ line ratio is better than 20%. Agreement to better than a factor of 2.3 is obtained when including the reaction between He($2^3S$) and H as an additional source of HeH$^+$. The RADEX/MCMC model with chemical pumping is found to reproduce both the observed line fluxes and the line ratio to 20%. Our results suggest that additional HeH$^+$ lines must be detected in NGC 7027 to better constrain the physical conditions via non-LTE models. Uncertainties in collisional (reactive and inelastic) data of HeH$^+$ have been largely reduced in this work. The three observed lines are not sensitive to chemical pumping while excited "short-lived" levels are significantly overpopulated with respect to a non-LTE model neglecting chemical excitation.

 - **Abstract**
 Pulsar timing arrays recently found evidence for a gravitational wave background (GWB), likely the stochastic overlap of GWs from many supermassive black hole binaries. Anticipating a continuous gravitational wave (CW) detection from a single binary soon to follow, we examine how well current Bayesian methods can detect CWs and characterize their binary properties by modeling the response of the NANOGrav 15-year pulsar timing array to simulated binary populations. We run Markov Chain Monte Carlo searches for CWs in these datasets and compare them to quicker detection statistics including the optimal signal-to-noise ratio, matched filter detection statistic, and reduced log-likelihood ratio between the signal and noise models calculated at the injected parameters. The latter is the best proxy for Bayesian detection fractions, corresponding to a 50% detection fraction (by Bayes factors >10 favoring a CW detection over noise-only model) at a signal-to-noise ratio of 4.6. Source confusion between the GWB and a CW, or between multiple CWs, can cause false detections and unexpected dismissals. 53% of realistic binary populations consistent with the recently observed GWB have successful CW detections. 82% of these CWs are in the 4th or 5th frequency bin of the 16.03 yr dataset (6.9 nHz and 10.8 nHz), with 95 percentile regions spanning 4nHz-12nHz frequencies, $7-20\times10^9 M_\odot$ chirp masses, 60Mpc-8Gpc luminosity distances, and 18-13,000 sq. deg 68% confidence localization areas. These successful detections often poorly recover the chirp mass, with only 29% identifying the chirp mass accurately to within 1 dex with a 68% posterior width also narrower than 1 dex.

          Multiple stellar populations at less evolved stages. IV. evidence of helium enrichments in four Magellanic globular clusters

 - **Abstract**
 Most globular clusters in the local group show multiple stellar populations, a pattern defined by variations of several light elements, with some also displaying dispersions in heavy elements. Since helium is the most immediate product of hydrogen burning, almost all models suggest that second-generation stars should show different levels of helium enrichment than first-generation stars. Therefore, investigating helium enrichment in stellar populations of globular clusters can constrain different theoretical models. Using the deep photometry carried out by the {\sl Hubble} Space Telescope, we have analyzed the morphologies of the main sequences of four Large Magellanic Cloud globular clusters, Hodge 11, NGC 1841, NGC 2210, and NGC 2257. We aim to constrain the helium distributions among their main sequence stars. We found a clear broadening of main sequences in all four clusters. After excluding the effects of photometric errors, differential reddening, unresolved binaries, and metallicity dispersions, this broadening would suggest a substantial helium enrichment in their star populations, ranging from $\delta{Y}=0.08$ to $\delta{Y}\geq0.12$, depending on the presumed helium distributions. Helium-enriched stars are comparable in number to normal stars within these clusters, and may even dominate, comprising approximately $\sim$40\% to over 80\% of the total stellar population. However, given the great distance of the Large Magellanic Cloud, it is difficult to rule out the significant impact of crowding, so our results may only represent an upper limit.

 - **Abstract**
 The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations of Sgr A* resolved the photon ring at the galactic centre, revealing a diameter of $51.8~\mu \text{as}$. The ring-like structure is consistent with that of a Kerr black hole. However, the source of the high bright regions in the image and the time variability remain an open question. Besides the plasma properties and emission models, the spacetime geometry also holds an important role. We present an image depicting the bright hot spots consistent with Sgr A* observations at a wavelength $ \lambda $ = 1.3mm. The image is the result of an eclipsing Schwarzschild black hole situated along the line of sight between the galactic centre and Earth. The separation from both, primary (Sgr A*) and secondary (eclipsing) black holes is $10233\, {\rm AU}$. The central supermassive black hole located at the centre of the galaxy has an observational mass of $4.14\times10^6\,M_{\odot}$ and the secondary eclipsing black hole has an inferred mass of $1035\,M_{\odot}$.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the confirmation of TOI-6324 b, an Earth-sized (1.059 $\pm$ 0.041 R$_\oplus$) ultra-short-period (USP) planet orbiting a nearby ($\sim$20 pc) M dwarf. Using the newly commissioned Keck Planet Finder (KPF) spectrograph, we have measured the mass of TOI-6324 b 1.17 $\pm$ 0.22 M$_\oplus$. Because of its extremely short orbit of just $\sim$6.7 hours, TOI-6324 b is intensely irradiated by its M dwarf host, and is expected to be stripped of any thick, H/He envelope. We were able to constrain its interior composition and found an iron core mass fraction (CMF = 27$\pm$37%) consistent with that of Earth ($\sim$33%) and other confirmed USPs. TOI-6324 b is the closest to Earth-sized USP confirmed to date. TOI-6324 b is a promising target for JWST phase curve and secondary eclipse observations (Emission Spectroscopy Metric = 25) which may reveal its surface mineralogy, day-night temperature contrast, and possible tidal deformation. From 7 sectors of TESS data, we report a tentative detection of the optical phase curve variation with an amplitude of 42$\pm$28 ppm.

 - **Abstract**
 We performed variability analysis of the multiwavelength light curves for the flat-spectrum radio quasar PKS 0727-11. Using the generalized Lomb-Scargle periodogram, we identified a possible quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) of $\sim$ 168.6 days (persisted for 6 cycles, with a significance of $3.8\sigma$) in the gamma-ray light curve during the flare period (MJD 54687-55738). It is the first time that periodic variations have been detected in this source, and further supported by other methods: weighted wavelet $z$-transform, phase dispersion minimization, REDFIT, autoregressive integrated moving average model, and structure function analysis. Cross-correlation analysis shows that there is a strong correlation between multi-band light variations, indicating that gamma-ray and radio flares may originate from the same disturbance, and the distance between the emission regions of gamma-ray and radio flares is calculated based on the time lag. We demonstrate that QPO arising from the non-ballistic helical jet motion driven by the orbital motion in a supermassive binary black hole is a plausible physical explanation. In this scenario, the estimated mass of the primary black hole is $M\sim3.66\times10^8-5.79\times10^{9}M_\odot$.

          Physical parameters of 12201 ASAS-SN contact binaries determined by the Neural Network

 - **Abstract**
 In the era of astronomical big data, more than one million contact binaries have been discovered. Traditional approaches of light curve analysis are inadequate for investigating such an extensive number of systems. This paper builds on prior research to present an advanced Neural Network model combined with the Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm and including spot parameters. This model was applied to 12785 contact binaries selected from All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae. By removing those with goodness of fit less than 0.8, we obtained the physical parameters of 12201 contact binaries. Among these binaries, 4332 are A-subtype systems, while 7869 are W-type systems, and 1594 systems have mass ratios larger than 0.72 (H-subtype system). A statistical study of the physical parameters was carried out, and we found that there are two peaks in the mass ratio distribution and that the probability of the presence of spot is about 50%. In addition, the differences in flux between the two light maxima are from $-$0.1 to 0.1. As the orbital period and the temperature of the primary component decrease, the difference between the two light maxima becomes more pronounced. Based on the relationships between transfer parameter and luminosity ratio, as well as between luminosity ratio and mass ratio, we found that A-, W-, and H-type contact binaries are distributed in distinct regions.

          Observational Constraints on Dark Energy Models with $Λ$ as an Equilibrium Point

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate a dynamical reconstruction of the dark energy equation of state parameter by assuming that it satisfies a law of motion described by an autonomous second-order differential equation, with the limit of the cosmological constant as an equilibrium point. We determine the asymptotic solutions of this equation and use them to construct two families of parametric dark energy models, employing both linear and logarithmic parametrizations with respect to the scale factor. We perform observational constraints by using the Supernova, the Cosmic Chronometers and the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations. The constraint parameters are directly related with the initial value problem for the law of motion and its algebraic properties. The analysis shows that most of the models fit the observational data well with a preference to the models of the logarithmic parametrization. Furthermore, we introduce a new class of models as generalizations of the CPL model, for which the equilibrium point is a constant value rather than the cosmological constant. These models fit the data in a similar or better way to the CPL and the $\Lambda$CDM cosmological models.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. As the Solar System orbits the Milky Way, it encounters various Galactic environments, including dense regions of the interstellar medium (ISM). These encounters can compress the heliosphere, exposing parts of the Solar System to the ISM, while also increasing the influx of interstellar dust into the Solar System and Earth's atmosphere. The discovery of new Galactic structures, such as the Radcliffe wave, raises the question of whether the Sun has encountered any of them. Aims. The present study investigates the potential passage of the Solar System through the Radcliffe wave gas structure over the past 30 million years (Myr). Methods. We used a sample of 56 high-quality, young ($\leq$ 30 Myr) open clusters associated with a region of interest of the Radcliffe wave to trace its motion back and investigate a potential crossing with the Solar System's past orbit. Results. We find that the Solar System's trajectory intersected the Radcliffe wave in the Orion region. We have constrained the timing of this event to between 18.2 and 11.5 Myr ago, with the closest approach occurring between 14.8 and 12.4 Myr ago. Notably, this period coincides with the Middle Miocene climate transition on Earth, providing an interdisciplinary link with paleoclimatology. The potential impact of the crossing of the Radcliffe wave on the climate on Earth is estimated. This crossing could also lead to anomalies in radionuclide abundances, which is an important research topic in the field of geology and nuclear astrophysics.

 - **Abstract**
 Dense cores in massive, parsec-scale molecular clumps are sites that harbor protocluster formation. We present results from observations towards a hub-filament structure of a massive Infrared Dark Cloud (IRDC) G14.225-0.506 using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). The dense cores are revealed by the 1.3 mm dust continuum emission at an angular resolution of $\sim$ 1.5'' and are identified through the hierarchical Dendrogram technique. Combining with the N$_2$D$^+$ 3-2 spectral line emission and gas temperatures derived from a previous NH$_3$ study, we analyze the thermodynamic properties of the dense cores. The results show transonic and supersonic-dominated turbulent motions. There is an inverse correlation between the virial parameter and the column density, which implies that denser regions may undergo stronger gravitational collapse. Molecular outflows are identified in the CO 2-1 and SiO 5-4 emission, indicating active protostellar activities in some cores. Besides these star formation signatures revealed by molecular outflows in the dense cores, previous studies in the infrared, X-ray, and radio wavelengths also found a rich and wide-spread population of young stellar objects (YSOs), showing active star formation both inside and outside of the dense cloud.

 - **Abstract**
 Storms are emerging as key drivers in shaping hydrogen-dominated atmospheres. Trace gas condensation can suppress convection and disrupt the distribution of energy and material in hydrogen atmospheres. On Jupiter, the presence of water has been invoked to control the occurrence of large-scale storms; however, the impact of storms on the ammonia and temperature distribution is unknown. We use Juno Microwave Radiometer observations of a large-scale storm in 2017 to study the aftermath of such a storm on the atmosphere. Anomalies in the retrieved ammonia abundance and atmospheric temperature show how storms deplete and heat the upper atmosphere while simultaneously depositing material well below the layers they were triggered at. These observations, aided by simulations, show that the water and ammonia cycles are coupled and that their combined effect plays a key role in explaining the depletion of ammonia in the tropospheres of Jupiter and Saturn.

 - **Abstract**
 Asteroid shape inversion using photometric data has been a key area of study in planetary science and astronomical this http URL, the current methods for asteroid shape inversion require extensive iterative calculations, making the process time-consuming and prone to becoming stuck in local optima. We directly established a mapping between photometric data and shape distribution through deep neural networks. In addition, we used 3D point clouds to represent asteroid shapes and utilized the deviation between the light curves of non-convex asteroids and their convex hulls to predict the concave areas of non-convex asteroids. We compared the results of different shape models using the Chamfer distance between traditional methods and ours and found that our method performs better, especially when handling special shapes. For the detection of concave areas on the convex hull, the intersection over union (IoU) of our predictions reached 0.89. We further validated this method using observational data from the Lowell Observatory to predict the convex shapes of the asteroids 3337 Milo and 1289 Kuta, and conducted light curve fitting experiments. The experimental results demonstrated the robustness and adaptability of the method

 - **Abstract**
 China plans to launch a probe (Tianwen-2) around 2025, mainly for exploring the near-Earth asteroid 2016 HO3 . The mission involves close-range exploration, landing, and mining operations that require three-dimensional modeling of the asteroid, which requires prior knowledge of its material composition and uniformity. This information is crucial in progressive or ground exploration processes. Our research focuses on high-precision intelligent inversion of complex physical properties of asteroids based on spectral data, providing support for further analysis of aster oid materials, density, and structure. We have developed a platform for asteroid spectral classification, albedo estimation, and composition analysis, which includes three types of neural networks based on Transformer attention mechanism: One for spectral classification, achieving a four-class classification accuracy of 97.28% and an eleven-class classification accuracy of 95.69%; second one for albedo estimation, with an average absolute error of 0.0308 in S-type asteroid albedo estimation, and the third one for composition analysis, with a predicted spectral angular distance of only 0.0340 and a root mean square error of 0.1759 for the abundance of end members. These results indicate that our network can provide high-precision asteroid spectral classification, albedo estimation, and composition analysis results. In addition, we utilized the platform to analyze and provide results for six asteroids.

 - **Abstract**
 This research paper has light curve modelling, spectroscopy, and detailed asteroseismic studies for five detached eclipsing binaries with a $\gamma$ Dor component that have been found so far by the sky surveys. The objective is to study the pulsational characteristics of the oscillating stars of the systems, as well as to estimate their absolute parameters and their relation to the pulsational frequencies and enrich the sample size of this kind of system, which has been relatively poor up to today. The physical properties of these systems are compared with other similar cases and the locations of their components are plotted in the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagrams. In order to discover the pulsation frequencies, the photometric data are analysed using eclipsing binary modelling methods and their residuals are subjected to Fourier analysis. Finally, we evaluated that there is a possible relationship between the pulsation periods of the primaries and the orbital period ($P_{\rm orb}$), the force exerted per gram on the surface of the pulsating star ($f$/M$_{\rm puls}$), and the fractional radius of the pulsating star ($r_{\rm puls}$) of the systems, using a sample of 39 eclipsing binary systems with $\gamma$ Dor type primaries. We utilised them to construct a unique observational $\gamma$ Dor instability strip, delineated by a lower limit of 6,850 K at the red edge and an upper limit of 7,360 K at the blue edge on the zero-age main sequence. The majority of 39 pure $\gamma$ Dor stars are located within the region that is covered by this observational strip.

 - **Abstract**
 This thesis investigates the impact of dark matter on neutron star properties, focusing on mass, radius, and tidal deformability. Using two-fluid and single-fluid models, dark matter is incorporated into the equation of state (EOS) via a Relativistic Mean Field (RMF) approach. The study finds that increasing dark matter content reduces the maximum mass, radius, and tidal deformability. Bayesian inference, supported by LIGO-Virgo gravitational wave data and NICER mass-radius measurements, refines these models. Despite dark matter's influence, the semi-universal C-Love relation remains valid. Machine learning techniques effectively classify dark matter-admixed neutron stars. The thesis also explores a sigma-cut potential in the EOS, which stiffens the EOS at high densities, favoring larger radii and lower f-mode frequencies. The study of non-radial oscillations, particularly f- and p-modes, highlights their sensitivity to neutron star composition and EOS. These findings enhance our understanding of neutron star interiors and dark matter's role, emphasizing the need for further observational and theoretical advancements.

          Arecibo Multi-frequency IPS Observations: Solar Wind Density Turbulence Scale Sizes and their Anisotropy

 - **Abstract**
 We present an analysis of interplanetary scintillation (IPS) observations conducted with the Arecibo 305-m radio telescope during the minimum phase at the end of solar cycle 24 and the onset of solar cycle 25. These observations span a broad frequency range of ~300 to 3100 MHz, encompassing the P-, L-, and S-bands, and covered heliocentric distances from ~5 to 200 solar radii. The dynamic spectrum of the scintillations obtained at L-band shows a systematic decrease in the scintillation index from the lowest to the highest frequency, offering valuable insight into the influence of the solar wind density microstructures responsible for scintillation. Analyses of the scintillation index ($m$) for multiple sources at L-band, along with near-simultaneous observations of selected sources covering the P-, L-, and S-bands, clearly demonstrate a wavelength dependence of $m \propto \lambda^\omega$, which inherently leads to a dependence of $m$ on the Fresnel scale, when considering the effective distance to the scattering screen, $z$. The index $\omega$ ranges between $\sim$1 and 1.8. The average $\omega$ value of a source, determined from observations made on different days, exhibits variability across sources. The results on the radial dependence of scintillation agree with earlier IPS measurements. The temporal power spectra obtained over the wide frequency range exhibit a power-level evolution in accordance with the wavelength dependence, and a broadening with increasing observation frequency. Furthermore, the increased temporal-frequency rounding of the `Fresnel knee' in the spectrum with the observing frequency suggests a novel phenomenon: an increase in anisotropy as the scale size of the density-turbulence structure decreases.

 In astrochemical exploration, infrared (IR) spectroscopy is vital for understanding the composition and structure of ice in various space environments. This article explores the impact of incident angles on IR spectroscopy, focusing on molecular components present in interstellar and circumstellar ice mantles such as CO, CO$_2$, H$_2$O, CH$_3$OH, NH$_3$, CH$_4$, H$_2$S. The experiment involves changing the angle at which the infrared beam hits the surface used for ice deposition. It is important to measure the density of the ice layer accurately, especially for experiments that involve using different angles in infrared spectroscopy. Furthermore, the experimental methodology allowed us to derive the {\it effective} refraction index values in the infrared range for each ice component. Existing corrections typically consider geometric configurations but overlook the refractive index of the ice ($n$), a factor dependent on ice composition. The study reveals that the incident angle and the refractive index, determine the pathlength of the IR beam across the ice sample. This insight challenges conventional corrections, impacting the integrated absorption values of the IR bands and column densities. In addition, for certain ice components, variations in the incidence angle affect the longitudinal (LO) and transverse (TO) optical modes of the ice, leading to observable changes in the IR band profiles that provide information on the amorphous or crystalline structure of the ice. The practical implications of this work apply to experimental setups where normal IR measurements are unfeasible. Researchers using, for example, the standard 45$^{\circ}$ angle for IR spectroscopy, will benefit from a more accurate estimation of ice column density.

 - **Abstract**
 With a new probabilistic technique for sampling interstellar object (ISO) orbits with high efficiency, we assess the observability of ISOs under a realistic cadence for the upcoming Vera Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). Using the Ōtautahi-Oxford population model, we show that there will be complex on-sky structure in the pattern of direction and velocity revealed by the detected ISO population, with the expected enhanced northern flux complicating efforts to derive population parameters from the LSST's predominately southern footprint. For luminosity functions with slopes of $2.5\leq q_s\leq 4.0$, the most discoverable ISOs have $H_r\simeq 14.6-20.7$; for previously estimated spatial densities, between 6 and 51 total ISOs are expected. The slope of the luminosity function of ISOs will be relatively quickly constrained. Discoveries are evenly split around their perihelion passage and are biased to lower velocities. After their discovery by LSST, it will be rare for ISOs to be visible for less than a month; most will have $m_r \leq 23$ for months, and the window for spectroscopic characterization could be as long as two years. These probabilistic assessments are robust against model or spatial density refinements that change the absolute numbers of ISO discoveries.

 - **Abstract**
 We use FUV spectra of 36 T Tauri stars, predominately from $\textit{Hubble Space Telescope}$'s ULLYSES program, to examine the kinematic properties of fluorescent H$_2$ emission lines for evidence of disk outflows. Leveraging improvements to the $\textit{HST}$-COS wavelength solution, we co-add isolated lines within four fluorescent progressions ([$\textit{v'}$,$\textit{J'}$] = [1,4], [1,7], [0,2], and [3,16]) to improve signal-to-noise, and we fit each co-added line profile with one or two Gaussian components. Of the high S/N line profiles (S/N $\geq$ 12 at the peak of the profile), over half are best fit with a combination of a broad and narrow Gaussian component. For profiles of the [1,4] and [1,7] progressions, we find a systematic blue-shift of a few km s$^{-1}$ between the broad and narrow centroid velocities and stellar radial velocities. For the [0,2] progression, we find centroid velocities consistently blueshifted with respect to stellar radial velocities on the order of -5 km s$^{-1}$ for the single and narrow components, and -10 km s$^{-1}$ for the broad components. Overall, the blueshifts observed in our sample suggest that the molecular gas traces an outflow from a disk wind in some sources, and not solely disk gas in Keplerian rotation. The low-velocity systematic blue-shifts, and emitting radii as inferred from line FWHMs, observed in our sample are similar to those observed with optical [O I] surveys of T Tauri stars. We estimate H$_2$ mass-loss rates of 10$^{-9}$ to 10$^{-11}$ $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, but incomplete knowledge of wind parameters limits comparisons to global models.

          Stochastic description of UHECR interactions

 - **Abstract**
 Photointeractions of ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) in astro-physical scenarios are in general of stochastic nature and are often modeled with Monte Carlo methods to obtain the form of the distributions resulting from a sequence of interactions. These distributions are non trivial because the products resulting from each interaction as well as the number and distances covered by the secondary nuclear species are all random. In this work, a stochastic approach based on the theory of matrix exponential distributions is employed to describe the cascade distributions analytically and illustrate their potential for tracing the individual history of UHECRs, including inside the source. This analytic description has the advantage of better precision and considerably reduced computational cost in contrast to Monte Carlo codes, while requiring the same inputs: the interaction rates, the multiplicity, and the energy distributions of secondaries from a single interaction. The description of the composition evolution from in-source to extragalactic propagation (currently performed in separate simulations in the literature) is achieved here as a continuous distribution, using a gamma-ray burst scenario inspired by the event GRB170817A. Finally, the potential for locating a source based on the reconstructed UHECR origin employing this description is discussed under simplified general assumptions.

 We present TESSELLATE, a dedicated pipeline for performing an untargeted search documenting all variable phenomena captured by the TESS space telescope. Building on the TESSreduce difference imaging pipeline, TESSELLATE extracts calibrated and reduced photometric data for every full frame image in the TESS archive. Using this data, we systematically identify transient, variable and non-sidereal signals across timescales ranging from minutes to weeks. The high cadence and wide field of view of TESS enables us to conduct a comprehensive search of the entire sky to a depth of ~17 $m_i$. Based on the volumetric rates for known fast transients, we expect there to be numerous Fast Blue Optical Transients and Gamma Ray Burst afterglows present in the existing TESS dataset. Beyond transients, TESSELLATE can also identify new variable stars and exoplanet candidates, and recover known asteroids. We classify events using machine learning techniques and the work of citizen scientists via the Zooniverse Cosmic Cataclysms project. Finally, we introduce the TESSELLATE Sky Survey: a complete, open catalog of the variable sky observed by TESS.

 Sunspot engravings and measurements in 1660-1676 are analyzed to retrieve sunspot area and heliocoordinates. Based on these data, we revise the Hoyt and Schatten (The role of the sun in climate change, 1997) hypothesis of long-lived sunspots during the Maunder minimum as a sign of weakened convection. Historical reports also clarify what each observer defined as a sunspot and the purpose of the observations. The reconstructed longitudes of sunspots allow us to evaluate the rotation rate, revealing that the historical rotation profile resembles that of long-lived sunspot groups in the modern era.

 - **Abstract**
 Collisionless shocks are one of the most powerful particle accelerators in the Universe. In the heliosphere, type II solar radio bursts are signatures of electrons accelerated by collisionless shocks launched at the Sun. Spectral observations of these bursts show a variety of fine structures often composing multiple type II lanes. The origin of these lanes and structures is not well understood and has been attributed to the inhomogeneous environment around the propagating shock. Here, we aim to determine the large-scale local structures near a coronal shock wave using high-resolution radio imaging observations of a complex type II radio burst observed on 3 October 2023. By using inteferometric imaging from the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR), combined with extreme ultraviolet observations, we investigate the origin of multiple type II lanes at low frequencies (30--80~MHz) relative to the propagating shock wave. We identify at least three radio sources at metric wavelengths corresponding to a multi-lane type II burst. The type II burst sources propagate outwards with a shock driven by a coronal mass ejection. We find a double radio source that exhibits increasing separation over time, consistent with the expansion rate of the global coronal shock. This suggests that the overall shock expansion is nearly self-similar, with acceleration hotspots forming at various times and splitting at a rate proportional to the shock's expansion. Our results show the importance of increased spatial resolution in determining either the small-scale spatial properties in coronal shocks or the structuring of the ambient medium. Possible shock corrugations or structuring of the upstream plasma at the scale of 10$^5$~km can act as hotspots for the acceleration of suprathermal electrons.

          High Energy Jet Emission from GRS 1758-258 & 1E 1740.7-2942 with INTEGRAL?

 - **Abstract**
 GRS 1758-258 and 1E 1740.7-2942 are two long-known persistent black hole binaries in the Galactic Center region. Using INTEGRAL's extensive monitoring of the Galactic Center and Bulge, we studied their temporal and spectral evolutions in the 30-610 keV energy range from March 2003 through April 2022 with the IBIS/ISGRI gamma-ray telescope. Our analyses found that the sources typically had Comptonized spectra, though not always with the same parameters. The spectral states with more than 8 Ms of observation time show deviations from a Comptonized spectrum above ~200 keV or a "hard tail" that extends up to at least 600 keV. The origin of this component remains debated with the most popular scenarios being synchrotron emission from the jet or Comptonization in a hybrid thermal/non-thermal plasma. Anyway, the GRS 1758-258 and 1E 1740.7-2942 spectra are acceptably described by CompTT+po (jet) and Eqpair (hybrid Comptonization) scenarios. To differentiate between the two scenarios, we calculated the Spearman correlation coefficient comparing 30-50 keV count rates with those in higher energy bands (50-100, 100-300, and 300-600 keV). The count rates below 300 keV are strongly correlated, indicating those photons arise from the same physical process. Above 300 keV the count rates are either anti-correlated or not correlated with the 30-50 keV count rates for GRS 1758-258, which suggests that the photons originate from a different physical process. For 1E 1740.7-2942, the level of correlation is unclear due to scatter in the data points. However, the 300-600 keV count rates are consistent with a constant value. This disfavors the hybrid Comptonization scenario for both sources.

 - **Abstract**
 IceCube measures a diffuse neutrino flux comparable to the Waxman-Bahcall bound, which suggests the possibility that the ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) have a common origin with diffuse high energy neutrinos. We propose high energy gamma-ray and/or neutrino observations toward the arrival directions of UHECRs to search for the sources and test this possibility. We calculate the detection probability of gamma-ray/neutrino sources, and find that the average probability per UHECR of >10 EeV is $\sim$10% if the sensitivity of the gamma-ray or neutrino telescope is $\sim$10$^{-12}$ erg cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ and the source number density is $\sim$10$^{-5}$ Mpc$^{-3}$. Future gamma-ray and neutrino observations toward UHECRs, e.g., by LHAASO-WCDA, CTA, IceCube/Gen2, are encouraged to constrain the density of UHECR sources or even identify the sources of UHECRs.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of a kpc-scale lacy filamentary structure in low surface-brightness H$\alpha$ and [OIII]$\lambda5007$ emission around the low-redshift, extremely metal-poor, and compact reionisation-era analogue SDSS J1044+0535. We identify seven elliptical arcs in H$\alpha$ emission at $\mathrm{SB}_\mathrm{H\alpha} \sim 1 - 2 \times 10^{-18}$erg\,s$^{-1}$cm$^{-2}$arcsec$^{-2}$. These arcs extent 6-9 kpc outwards from the star-forming complexes. We interpret these features as limb-brightened giant-shells that bound egg-shaped kpc-scale bubbles. These shells are five to eight times larger than the known giant-shells around nearby star-forming dwarfs. Kinematic maps reveal a gradient perpendicular to the major-axis and line broadening in the outskirts. The latter, when interpreted due to line-splitting of the expanding shells, provides an estimate of the kinetic energy of the bubbles that can be well reconciled with them being blown by the mass dominating 15-20 Myr old stellar population.

 Next-generation galaxy surveys promise unprecedented precision in testing gravity at cosmological scales. However, realising this potential requires accurately modelling the non-linear cosmic web. We address this challenge by exploring conditional generative modelling to create 3D dark matter density fields via score-based (diffusion) and flow-based methods. Our results demonstrate the power of diffusion models to accurately reproduce the matter power spectra and bispectra, even for unseen configurations. They also offer a significant speed-up with slightly reduced accuracy, when flow-based reconstructing the probability distribution function, but they struggle with higher-order statistics. To improve conditional generation, we introduce a novel multi-output model to develop feature representations of the cosmological parameters. Our findings offer a powerful tool for exploring deviations from standard gravity, combining high precision with reduced computational cost, thus paving the way for more comprehensive and efficient cosmological analyses

 - **Abstract**
 As the closest known active galactic nucleus, Centaurus A (Cen A) provides a rich environment for astrophysical exploration. It has been observed across wavelengths from radio to gamma rays, and indications of ongoing particle acceleration have been found on different scales. Recent measurements of very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-rays ($>240$ GeV) by the HESS observatory have inferred the presence of ultra-relativistic electrons along Cen A's jet, yet the underlying acceleration mechanism remains uncertain. Various authors have proposed that jet substructures, known as knots, may serve as efficient particle accelerators. In this study, we investigate the hypothesis that knots are the particle acceleration sites along Cen A's jets. We focus on stationary knots, and assume that they result from interactions between the jet and the stellar winds of powerful stars. By combining relativistic hydrodynamic simulations and shock acceleration theory with the radio and X-ray data, we compare theoretical predictions with morphological and spectral data from different knots. We estimate the maximum electron energy and the resulting VHE gamma-ray emission. Our findings suggest that electrons accelerated at the knots are responsible for the gamma-ray spectrum detected in the VHE band.

          Multiple stellar populations in MOCCA globular cluster models: Transient spatial over-concentration of pristine red giant stars driven by strong dynamical encounters

 - **Abstract**
 Recently, Leitinger et al. (2023) and Cadelano et al (2024}) have shown that, in some Milky Way globular clusters (GCs), pristine red giant branch (RGB) stars are more centrally concentrated than enriched RGB stars. This contradicts most multiple-population formation scenarios, which predict that the enriched population 2p should initially be more concentrated than the pristine population 1P. We analyze a MOCCA GC model that exhibits a higher spatial concentration of 1P RGB stars than 2P RGB stars at 13 Gyr. The MOCCA models assume the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) pollution scenario, where 2P stars are initially more concentrated than 1P stars. Our results indicate that the observed spatial distributions of multiple populations, and possibly their kinematics, are significantly shaped by dynamical interactions. These interactions preferentially eject 2P RGB progenitors from the central regions, leading to a transient over-concentration of 1P RGB stars at late times. This effect is particularly relevant for GCs with present-day of a few $10^5 M_{\odot}$, which have retained only about 10 - 20 percent of their initial mass. Such clusters may appear dynamically young due to heating from a black hole subsystem, even if they have undergone significant mass loss and dynamical evolution. Additionally, the relatively small number of RGB stars in these clusters suggests that interpreting the spatial distributions of multiple populations solely from RGB stars may lead to biased conclusions about the overall distribution of 2P and 1P. The apparent over-concentration of the 1P relative to the 2P is likely a transient effect driven by the preferential removal of 2P RGB progenitors via strong dynamical encounters. MOCCA models of multiple stellar populations based on the AGB scenario may explain anomalous features observed in some Galactic GCs, such as NGC 3201 and NGC 6101.

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of the cluster of S-stars located in the Galactic Centre is tied to the supermassive black hole Sagittarius A*, but exactly how is still debated. In this paper, we investigate whether the Hills mechanism can simultaneously reproduce both the S-star cluster's properties and the observed number of hypervelocity stars. To do so, we forward-model the capture and disruption of binary stars originating from the nuclear star cluster (NSC) and the clockwise disk (CWD). We find that the ratio of evolved to main-sequence S-stars is highly sensitive to the origin of the binaries, and that neither the injection of binaries from the CWD nor from the NSC exclusively can reproduce all observations. However, when considering the injection of binaries from both locations, we are able to reproduce all the observations simultaneously, including the number of observed hypervelocity stars, the evolutionary stage of the S-stars, their luminosity function and the distribution of their semi-major axes. The implications of our findings include that ~90% of hypervelocity stars ejected over the past ~10 Myr should originate from the CWD, that the main-sequence S-stars originated in the CWD, and that the evolved S-stars originated in an old stellar population such as the NSC.

 - **Abstract**
 With the advent of surveys like $Euclid$ and $Vera$ $C.$ $Rubin$, astrophysicists will have access to both deep, high-resolution images, and multi-band images. However, these two conditions are not simultaneously available in any single dataset. It is therefore vital to devise image deconvolution algorithms that exploit the best of the two worlds and that can jointly analyze datasets spanning a range of resolutions and wavelengths. In this work, we introduce a novel multi-band deconvolution technique aimed at improving the resolution of ground-based astronomical images by leveraging higher-resolution space-based observations. The method capitalizes on the fortunate fact that the $Vera$ $C.$ $Rubin$ $r$-, $i$-, and $z$-bands lie within the $Euclid$ $VIS$ band. The algorithm jointly deconvolves all the data to turn the $r$-, $i$-, and $z$-band $Vera$ $C.$ $Rubin$ images to the resolution of $Euclid$ by enabling us to leverage the correlations between the different bands. We also investigate the performance of deep learning-based denoising with DRUNet to further improve the results. We illustrate the effectiveness of our method in terms of resolution and morphology recovery, flux preservation, and generalization to different noise levels. This approach extends beyond the specific $Euclid$-$Rubin$ combination, offering a versatile solution to improve the resolution of ground-based images in multiple photometric bands by jointly using any space-based images with overlapping filters.

 - **Abstract**
 Providing a detailed picture of the Sagittarius (Sgr) stream offers important constraints on the build-up of the Galactic halo as well as its gravitational potential at large radii. While several attempts have been made to model the structure of the Sgr stream, no model has yet been able to match all the features observed for the stream. Moreover, for several of these features, observational characterisation of their properties is rather limited, particularly at large distances. The aim of this work is to investigate the kinematics of the Sgr stream outermost spur feature using blue horizontal branch (BHB) stars. Candidate BHB stars were selected by combining two approaches; one capitalising on Pan-STARRS1 3$\Pi$ griz and u photometry taken as part of UNIONS, the other using Pristine Survey CaHK and SDSS ugr photometry. Follow-up optical spectra are obtained using ESO/VLT/FORS2 to confirm their BHB nature and obtain line-of-sight (LOS) velocities. Of our 25 candidates, 20 stars can be confirmed as bona fide BHB stars. Their LOS velocities, together with the 3D positions of these stars qualitatively match well with Sgr model predictions and trace the outer apocentre of the trailing arm and its spur feature very nicely. The quantitative offsets that are found between our data and the different models can be used to provide information about the Galactic gravitational potential at large distances. We present a first, tentative, analysis in this direction, showing that the model of Vasiliev et al. (2021) would provide better agreement with our observations if the enclosed mass of the Milky Way within 100 kpc were lowered to $(5.3\!\pm\!0.4)\!\times\!10^{11}$ M$_\odot$ (versus $(5.6\!\pm\!0.4)\!\times\!10^{11}$ M$_\odot$). Our selection of BHB stars provides a new view on the outermost structure in 3D positions and LOS velocities of the Sgr debris.

 - **Abstract**
 Standard cosmological weak lensing analyses using cosmic shear are inevitably sensitive to small-scale, non-linear clustering from low-redshift structures. The need to adequately model the clustering of matter on this non-linear regime, accounting for both gravitational and baryonic effects, adds significant uncertainty to weak lensing studies, particularly in the context of near-future Stage-IV datasets. In this paper, inspired by previous work on so-called ``nulling'' techniques, we present a general method that selects the linear combinations of a given tomographic cosmic shear dataset that are least sensitive to small-scale non-linearities, by essentially suppressing the contribution from low-redshift structures. We apply this method to the latest public cosmic shear data from the Dark Energy Survey, DES-Y3, that corresponds to 3 years of observation, and show: a) that a large fraction of the signal is dominated by the single mode that is most affected by non-linear scales, and b) that removing this mode leads to a $\sim1\sigma$ upwards shift in the preferred value of $S_8\equiv\sigma_8\sqrt{\Omega_M/0.3}$, alleviating the tension with current CMB data. However, the removal of the most contaminated mode also results in a significant increase in the statistical uncertainties. Taking this into account, we find this shift to be compatible with a random fluctuation caused by removing this most-contaminated mode at the $\sim1.4\sigma$ level. We also show that this technique may be used by future Stage-IV surveys to mitigate the sensitivity of the final constraints to baryonic effects, trading precision for robustness.

          Back-Reaction of Super-Hubble Fluctuations, Late Time Tracking and Recent Observational Results

 - **Abstract**
 Previous studies suggested that the back-reaction of super-Hubble cosmological fluctuations could lead to a dynamical relaxation of the cosmological constant. Moreover, this mechanism appears to be self-regulatory, potentially leading to an oscillatory behavior in the effective dark energy. Such an effect would occur in any cosmological model with super-Hubble matter fluctuations, including the standard $\Lambda\text{CDM}$ model, without the need for additional mechanisms. The recent DESI data, which supports the possibility of dynamical dark energy, has renewed interest in exploring scenarios leading to such oscillatory behavior. In this work we propose a parametrization to account for the impact of super-Hubble fluctuations on the background energy density of the Universe. We model the total effective cosmological constant as the sum of a constant piece and an oscillating contribution. We perform a preliminary comparison of the background dynamics of this model with the recent radial BAO data from DESI. We also discuss the status of the $H_0$ tension problem in this model. While this analysis serves as a first step in testing the scenario, we emphasize the importance of considering this effect, as it is naturally expected to be present and could offer valuable insights in light of the recent observational data.

          A JWST Panchromatic Thermal Emission Spectrum of the Warm Neptune Archetype GJ 436b

 - **Abstract**
 GJ 436b is the archetype warm Neptune exoplanet. The planet's thermal emission spectrum was previously observed via intensive secondary eclipse campaigns with Spitzer. The atmosphere has long been interpreted to be extremely metal-rich, out of chemical equilibrium, and potentially tidally heated. We present the first panchromatic emission spectrum of GJ 436b observed with JWST's NIRCAM (F322W2 and F444W) and MIRI (LRS) instruments between 2.4 and 11.9 $\mu$m. Surprisingly, the JWST spectrum appears significantly fainter around 3.6 $\mu$m than that implied by Spitzer photometry. The molecular absorption features in the spectrum are relatively weak, and we only find tentative evidence of CO$_2$ absorption at 2$\sigma$ significance. Under the assumption of a day-side blackbody, we find $T_{\rm day}$=662.8$\pm$5.0 K, which is similar to the zero Bond albedo equilibrium temperature. We use it to obtain a 3$\sigma$ upper limit on the Bond albedo of $A_B{\le}$0.66. To understand the spectrum we employ 1D radiative-convective models but find that atmospheric constraints depend strongly on model assumptions. If thermochemical equilibrium is assumed, we find a cloudy metal-enriched atmosphere (metallicity $\ge$ 300$\times$solar). We employ 1D photochemical modeling to show that the observed spectrum is also consistent with a cloud-free, relatively lower-metallicity atmosphere (metallicity $\ge$ 80$\times$solar) with a cold internal temperature ($T_{\rm int}$$\sim$60 K). These are much lower metallicities and internal temperatures than inferences from Spitzer photometry. The low $T_{\rm day}$ and non-detection of transmission features at high spectral resolution does suggest a role for cloud opacity, but this is not definitive.

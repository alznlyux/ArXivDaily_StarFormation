 - **Abstract**
 The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope is poised to revolutionize our scientific understanding of exoplanets, dark matter, dark energy, and general astrophysics, including through an innovative community approach to defining and executing sky surveys. The Roman Observations Time Allocation Committee (ROTAC) was convened to recommend time allocations for the three Core Community Surveys (CCS) using the Wide Field Instrument (WFI): the High Latitude Wide Area Survey, the High Latitude Time Domain Survey, and the Galactic Bulge Time Domain Survey, as well as balance the time allocation for the General Astrophysics Surveys. Each CCS had a corresponding Definition Committee that collected community input and designed proposals for a nominal (in-guide) survey, as well as underguide and overguide options with smaller and larger time allocations, respectively. These options explored different ways of fulfilling the mission science requirements while maximizing general astrophysics science goals enabled by the surveys. In this report, the ROTAC lays out its recommendations for the three CCS observing designs and the WFI time allotment for CCS (74.5%) and the General Astrophysics Surveys (25.5%).

 - **Abstract**
 As of December 2023, the Swift satellite has detected more than 1600 gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). We select 307 Type II GRBs for constructing the luminosity function (LF) based on the following criteria: (1) duration $T_{90} \geq 2 s$; (2) conformity with the Amati relation for Type II GRBs; and (3) peak flux $P \geq 1 \, \text{ph} \, \text{cm}^{-2} \, \text{s}^{-1}$. We explore two general forms of the GRB LF: a broken power-law (BPL) LF and a triple power-law (TPL) LF. We consider three evolutionary scenarios: no evolution, luminosity evolution, and density evolution. We find that the no evolution model can be excluded, while both luminosity and density evolution models effectively account for the observations. This result is consistent with previous studies on long GRBs (LGRBs). However, our Type II GRB sample favors a BPL LF, in contrast to the preference for a TPL function discovered in Long GRBs.

          The DESI Y1 RR Lyrae catalog II: The metallicity dependency of pulsational properties, the shape of the RR Lyrae instability strip, and metal rich RR Lyrae

 - **Abstract**
 RR Lyrae stars (RRLs) are valuable probes of both Milky Way assembly and stellar-evolution physics. Using a sample 6,240 RRLs obtained in the first year of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey, we investigate the metallicity of RRLs and its correlation with their pulsation properties. We find that (1) a clear correlation between period and [Fe/H] reinforces the view that the longstanding Oosterhoff dichotomy arises from the scarcity of intermediate-metallicity Galactic globular clusters hosting sizeable RRL samples; (2) high-amplitude short-period and small-amplitude short-period variables are comparatively metal-rich, with mean [Fe/H] = $-1.39 \pm 0.27$ and $-1.30 \pm 0.28$, respectively; (3) in double-mode pulsators (RRd) the metallicity declines smoothly with increasing fundamental-mode period, and anomalous RRd stars occupy a remarkably narrow [Fe/H] range relative to classical RRd stars; (4) this spectroscopic sample let us, for the first time, place empirical constraints on the metallicity-dependent topology of the instability strip using phase-corrected effective temperatures and a large number of RRLs, where we observe an instability strip that moves towards cooler Teff with declining [Fe/H] with a width consistent with stellar-evolution models; and (5) a subset of metal-rich RRLs exhibits orbits consistent with disk membership and halo kinematics. Our results confirm the tantalizing potential of DESI for Galactic and stellar astrophysics and highlight the importance of the even larger samples of RRLs and data-processing improvements forthcoming in future DESI data releases.

          On the effects of radiation on mass transfer in binary stars

 - **Abstract**
 Mass transfer (MT) in binary systems is a common evolutionary process that can significantly affect the structure, evolution, and final fate of both stars. In modeling MT hydrodynamics, it is usually assumed that the critical point of the flow, where the velocity exceeds the local sound speed, coincides with the inner Lagrange point (L1). However, in massive donors, radiative pressure dominates over gas pressure and the Eddington factor $\Gamma_\text{Edd}$ can reach or exceed unity. If there is significant momentum and/or energy exchange between gas and radiation, the critical point of the flow can shift away from L1, affecting the MT rate ($\dot{M}_\text{d}$). Here, we investigate the effects of radiation on MT using time-steady radiative hydrodynamic equations and the assumption of the von Zeipel theorem. We provide analytical expressions that closely approximate $\dot{M}_\text{d}$ and numerical solutions using a realistic equation of state. We find two main differences with respect to the traditional expressions for $\dot{M}_\text{d}$. First, for Roche-lobe-underfilling donors with $\Gamma_\text{Edd} \lesssim 1$, radiative momentum exchange leads to an exponential increase of $\dot{M}_\text{d}$ as a function of $1-\Gamma_\text{Edd}$. We provide a simple modification of existing prescriptions that takes this effect into account. Second, we find that the photon tiring limit for super-Eddington outflows is much less restrictive near L1 than in spherical stars. We suggest that donors with super-Eddington convectively inefficient subsurface layers are able to drive MT with $-\dot{M}_\text{d} \gtrsim 10^{-2}\,\text{M}_\odot\,\text{yr}^{-1}$ even before overfilling their Roche lobes. We characterize the conditions for this new mode of super-Eddington-boosted MT and discuss the implications for binary evolution including the potential link to nonterminal outbursts of Luminous Blue Variables.

          commensurability: a Python package for classifying astronomical orbits based on their toroid volume

 - **Abstract**
 As a star orbits the center of its host galaxy, the trajectory is encompassed within a 3D toroid. The orbit probes all points in this toroid, unless its orbital frequencies exhibit integer ratios (commensurate frequencies), in which case a small sub-volume is traversed. commensurability is a Python package that implements a tessellation-based algorithm for identifying orbital families that satisfy commensurabilities by measuring the toroid volume traversed over orbit integration. Compared to standard orbit classification methods such as frequency analysis, tessellation analysis relies on configuration space properties alone, making classification results more robust to frequency instabilities or limited integration times. The package provides a framework for analyzing phase-space coordinates using tessellation analysis, including a subpackage for the implementation of the general tessellation algorithm. The package is to be used with a galactic dynamics library; it currently supports AGAMA, gala, and galpy.

          X-ray Study on Propagation of Non-thermal Particles in Microquasar SS 433/W 50 Extended Jets

 - **Abstract**
 SS 433, located at the center of the W 50 radio nebula, is a binary system that ejects jets oriented east-west with precessional motion. X-ray lobes, containing compact "knots" labeled as head (e1), lenticular (e2), and ring (e3) in the east, as well as w1, w1.5, and w2 in the west, have been detected along the jets directions. Very-high-energy {\gamma}-ray emission has also been detected from regions containing these X-ray knots, suggesting highly efficient particle acceleration in the jets. In our previous study, we performed X-ray imaging spectroscopy of the western lobe of W 50 to investigate spectral variations. In this work, we extend our study to the eastern region using XMM-Newton observations to provide a more comprehensive picture of the X-ray emission from the SS 433 jets. Our results show no detectable synchrotron emission between SS 433 and the innermost knot (head). We also found that the X-ray spectrum of the eastern jet gradually steepens as one moves away from SS 433. While a similar spectral evolution is observed in the western jet, there are also noticeable differences. In the western lobe, the spectrum initially gradually steepens and then undergoes an abrupt softening outside the knot w2. However, in the eastern jet, no such rapid steepening is observed at the lenticular knot, which corresponds to w2 in the west. Furthermore, the observed brightening and spectral variations in the eastern jet cannot be explained by simply adjusting the parameters of the model used for the western side, suggesting the involvement of additional physical processes such as particle re-acceleration.

 - **Abstract**
 Microlensing is the method of exoplanet detection that discovers solar system analog exoplanets. These are planets low in mass located in wide orbits around their host stars. Even though thousands of exoplanets are discovered, they are mostly hot planets close to their hosts. There is a dearth of exoplanets discovered beyond the snowline where exoplanets are thought to be formed. This was recognized as a very important science issue; 2010 decadal survey declared detecting exoplanets with microlensing and measuring their masses as one of the three main science goals of NASA's next flagship mission, Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope. Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope is scheduled to launch in late 2026, no later than May 2027. It will observe 6 seasons of galactic bulge to discover and measure masses of 1000+ such wide orbit low mass solar system analog planets.

 - **Abstract**
 Reconstructing the initial density field of the Universe from the late-time matter distribution is a nontrivial task with implications for understanding structure formation in cosmology, offering insights into early Universe conditions. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown promise in tackling this problem by learning the complex mapping from nonlinear evolved fields back to initial conditions. Here we investigate the effect of varying input sub-box size in single-input CNNs. We find that intermediate scales ($L_\mathrm{sub} \sim 152\,h^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}$) strike the best balance between capturing local detail and global context, yielding the lowest validation loss and most accurate recovery across multiple statistical metrics. We then propose a dual-input model that combines two sub-boxes of different sizes from the same simulation volume. This model significantly improves reconstruction performance, especially on small scales over the best single-input case, despite utilizing the same parent simulation box. This demonstrates the advantage of explicitly incorporating multi-scale context into the network. Our results highlight the importance of input scale and network design in reconstruction tasks. The dual-input approach represents a simple yet powerful enhancement that leverages fixed input information more efficiently, paving the way for more accurate cosmological inference from large-scale structure surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 Post-facto image restoration techniques are essential for improving the quality of ground-based astronomical observations, which are affected by atmospheric turbulence. Multi-object multi-frame blind deconvolution (MOMFBD) methods are widely used in solar physics to achieve diffraction-limited imaging. We present torchmfbd, a new open-source code for MOMFBD that leverages the PyTorch library to provide a flexible, GPU-accelerated framework for image restoration. The code is designed to handle spatially variant point spread functions (PSFs) and includes advanced regularization techniques. The code implements the MOMFBD method using a maximum a-posteriori estimation framework. It supports both wavefront-based and data-driven PSF parameterizations, including a novel experimental approach using non-negative matrix factorization. Regularization techniques, such as smoothness and sparsity constraints, can be incorporated to stabilize the solution. The code also supports dividing large fields of view into patches and includes tools for apodization and destretching. The code architecture is designed to become a flexible platform over which new reconstruction and regularization methods can also be implemented straightforwardly. We demonstrate the capabilities of torchmfbd on real solar observations, showing its ability to produce high-quality reconstructions efficiently. The GPU acceleration significantly reduces computation time, making the code suitable for large datasets. The code is publicly available at this https URL.

 - **Abstract**
 As the discovery of exoplanets progresses at a rapid pace, the large number of known planets provides a pathway to assess the stellar and planetary properties that govern the climate evolution of terrestrial planets. Of particular interest are those planetary cases that straddle the radius boundary of being terrestrial or gaseous in nature, such as super-Earth and sub-Neptune exoplanets, respectively. The known exoplanet, TOI-2285 b, is one such case, since it lies at the radius boundary of super-Earth and sub-Neptune ($R_p = 1.74$ $R_\oplus$), and receives a relatively high instellation flux since its orbit exists within both the Habitable Zone (HZ) and Venus Zone (VZ). Here, we present an analysis of the planetary interior and climate to determine possible evolutionary pathways for the planet. We provide volatile inventory estimates in terms of the planet's bulk density and interior composition. We performed climate simulations using ROCKE-3D that provide a suite of possible temperate scenarios for the planet for a range of topographical and initial surface water assumptions. Using the outputs of the climate simulations, we modeled JWST transmission and emission spectroscopy for each scenario. Our results demonstrate that there are temperate scenarios consistent with the known planetary properties, despite the planet's estimated steam atmosphere, and its location relative to the VZ.

 - **Abstract**
 Saturn's moon Titan undergoes a long annual cycle of 29.45 Earth years. Titan's northern winter and spring were investigated in detail by the Cassini-Huygens spacecraft (2004-2017), but the northern summer season remains sparsely studied. Here we present new observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and Keck II telescope made in 2022 and 2023 during Titan's late northern summer. Using JWST's mid-infrared instrument, we spectroscopically detected the methyl radical, the primary product of methane break-up and key to the formation of ethane and heavier molecules. Using the near-infrared spectrograph onboard JWST, we detected several non-local thermodynamic equilibrium CO and CO2 emission bands, which allowed us to measure these species over a wide altitude range. Lastly, using the near-infrared camera onboard JWST and Keck II, we imaged northern hemisphere tropospheric clouds evolving in altitude, which provided new insights and constraints on seasonal convection patterns. These observations pave the way for new observations and modelling of Titan's climate and meteorology as it progresses through the northern fall equinox, when its atmosphere is expected to show notable seasonal changes.

          Suggestions of decreasing dark energy from supernova and BAO data: an update

 - **Abstract**
 In a previous work 2305.04946, we found that supernova and baryon acoustic oscillation data support the hypothesis that late time cosmic acceleration is caused by the potential energy of a scalar field descending its potential, as suggested by holographically defined models of quantum gravity. In this note, we update our analysis using the Dark Energy Survey 5 year supernova data set (DES-SN5YR) and the baryon acoustic oscillation data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Data Release 2 (DESI DR2). Approximating the scalar potential via a first order Taylor series $V \approx V_0 + V_1 \phi$ about the present value, and making use of only recent-time data from DES-SN5YR and DESI DR2, we find that the slope parameter is constrained as $V_1 = 1.49 \pm 0.25$ in a standard likelihood analysis. This is naively a $>5 \sigma$ discrepancy with $\Lambda$CDM (which has $V_1 =0$), though a more detailed analysis not assuming a Gaussian likelihood distribution suggests $4 \sigma$ significance. Based only on the $\Delta \chi^2 = -13.7$ improvement of fit while ignoring parameter space volumes disfavours $\Lambda$CDM at a $3 \sigma$ significance level. These significance measures are substantially improved from our previous analysis using older data sets. We also reproduce the DESI DR2 parameter constraints based on the same combination of data and find that the $\Lambda$CDM is more strongly disfavoured in the context of the linear potential extension (dubbed $V_0V_1$) as compared with the $w_0 w_a$ extension of $\Lambda$CDM. A caveat is that for both $w_0 w_a$ and $V_0 V_1$, much of the significance relies on the historical $z < 0.1$ supernova samples included in the DES-SN5YR data set.

 - **Abstract**
 The astrophysical implications of particle photoproduction interactions involving nuclei is considered here, based on the most recent empirical data on particle photoproduction interactions off protons. The implications of photoproduction with helium nuclei are also discussed and compared with gamma-p interactions. It is found that gamma-He interactions, assuming the cosmological abundance of He, produce approximately 10% of the pions as compared with gamma-p interactions. In addition to the production of pions, we also discuss the relative effect of excited nucleon decay leading to single and double pion production, as well as rho, eta, omega and K meson production and decay channels, all of which produce to neutrinos and gamma-rays. The production of mesons other than pions is found not to be significant for producing gamma-rays and neutrinos from astrophysical sources. It is further shown that, for astrophysical gamma-p interactions that lead to gamma-ray and neutrino production, the decay of the Delta(1232) resonance channel clearly dominates, all other production channels being effectively negligible.

          Primordial black holes as dark matter candidates: Multi-frequency constraints from cosmic radiation backgrounds

 - **Abstract**
 Aims. This study investigates the role of primordial black holes (PBHs) in shaping cosmic radiation backgrounds--the cosmic X-ray background (CXB), the Lyman-Werner background (LWB), and the cosmic radio background (CRB)--and evaluates their viability as dark matter (DM) candidates based on observational constraints and theoretical limits. Methods. PBH accretion is modelled using analytical frameworks that include electron advection-dominated accretion flows (eADAF), standard advection-dominated accretion flows (ADAF), luminous hot accretion flows (LHAF), and thin disks. Emission from PBHs in both dark matter halos and the intergalactic medium (IGM) is computed. We assess the impact of variations in model assumptions, such as halo gas density profiles, gas velocities, and emission models. The results are compared with observational limits and theoretical thresholds to constrain the PBH fraction as DM for masses between 1 and 100 solar masses Results. PBHs may contribute up to 99, 93, 80, and 91 per cent of the unresolved soft X-ray background for masses of 1, 10, 33, and 100 solar masses, respectively, and about 33-39 per cent of the hard X-ray background. These contributions limit the PBH DM fraction to 7e-3, 6e-4, 6e-4, and 7e-4, respectively, in our baseline model. These constraints are consistent with those from the LWB, ensuring molecular cooling and early star formation are preserved. However, explaining the radio background excess and the EDGES signal would require PBH fractions well above these limits. For 1 solar mass, excluding ADAF subregimes relaxes the constraint to 3e-2, highlighting the sensitivity to accretion physics. Variations in model assumptions introduce only minor differences in the predicted backgrounds.

          Was there a (super)nova in 1408?

 - **Abstract**
 The 1408 CE "guest star" recorded in Chinese historical texts presents a compelling case for identifying a historical stellar transient. While previous studies debated its nature as a meteor, comet, or nova, we re-evaluate the event using original Ming Dynasty records, including a newly found memorial from the imperial court. The object, described as stationary for over ten days, yellow, and luminous (resembling a "Zhou Bo virtue star"), is inconsistent with cometary behavior. Positional analysis locates it near the Niandao asterism (modern Cygnus-Vulpecula region) within the Milky Way, with a derived brightness of -4 to 0 mag. Light-curve stability over ten days and color descriptions align with a slow nova or a supernova. We cross-correlated the historical coordinates with modern catalogs and found a few possible counterparts. Among them, CK Vul - a luminous red nova remnant from 1670 to 1672 - is the most interesting candidate. Could its progenitor system have experienced a precursor classical nova eruption circa 1408 prior to the merger ~200 years later? We also examine cataclysmic variables and planetary nebulae within the 100 square-degree search field, though most lack sufficient brightness or age characteristics. This study emphasizes the value of integrating detailed historical records with contemporary astrophysical data to resolve long-standing controversies over ancient transients. The 1408 event likely represents a rare, well-documented nova, offering insights into pre-modern stellar phenomena and their modern counterparts.

 - **Abstract**
 We report an observation of the Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect of the transiting planet HD 93963 Ac, a mini-Neptune planet orbiting a G0-type star with an orbital period of $P_{\rm{c}} = 3.65\,\mathrm{d}$, accompanied by an inner super-Earth planet with $P_{\rm{b}} = 1.04\,\mathrm{d}$. We observed a full transit of planet c on 2024 May 3rd UT with Keck/KPF. The observed RM effect has an amplitude of $\sim 1\,\mathrm{m\,s}^{-1}$ and implies a sky-projected obliquity of $\lambda = 14^{+17}_{-19}$ degrees for HD 93963 Ac. Our dynamical analysis suggests that the two inner planets are likely well aligned with the stellar spin, to within a few degrees, thus allowing both to transit. Along with WASP-47, 55 Cnc, and HD 3167, HD 93963 is the fourth planetary system with an ultra-short-period planet and obliquity measurement(s) of any planet(s) in the system. HD 93963, WASP-47, and 55 Cnc favor largely coplanar orbital architectures, whereas HD 3167 has been reported to have a large mutual inclination ($\sim$100$^\circ$) between its transiting planets b and c. In this configuration, the probability that both planets transit is low. Moreover, one planet would quickly evolve to be non-transiting due to nodal precession. Future missions such as ESO/PLATO should detect the resulting transit duration variations. We encourage additional obliquity measurements of the HD 3167 system to better constrain its orbital architecture.

 - **Abstract**
 Aerosols are common in exoplanet atmospheres, but their formation-whether through gas condensation or photochemical reactions-remains uncertain. We report a 6$\sigma$ detection of limb asymmetry in the transmission spectrum of WASP-94A b, revealing a cloud-covered (11$\sigma$) cooler morning limb and a clear hotter evening limb with strong H$_2$O absorption (10$\sigma$). Models suggest cloud droplets formed near mbar pressures are lofted to 0.01 mbar by strong vertical dynamics in the morning limb. They evaporate when circulated to the hotter evening limb, requiring a minimum 280 K (3$\sigma$) limb-to-limb temperature difference. We confirm that aerosols in hot Jupiters like WASP-94A b can have clouds cycling between day and night sides instead of photochemical hazes. Ignoring these effects severely biases inferred chemical abundances, showing limb-resolved spectroscopy is critical for characterizing the formation mechanisms of transiting exoplanets-from gas giants to terrestrial exoplanets, indicating the need to reassess inferences from a decade's worth of Hubble Space Telescope observations.

 - **Abstract**
 We perform a precise calculation of the EFT conditional likelihood for large-scale structure (LSS) via the saddle-point expansion method in the presence of primordial non-Gaussianities (PNG). The precision is manifested at two levels: one corresponding to the consideration of higher-order noise terms, and the other to the inclusion of contributions around the saddle points. In computing the latter, we encounter the same issue of the negative modes as in the context of false vacuum decay, which necessitates deforming the original integration contour into the combination of the steepest descent contours to ensure a convergent and real result. We demonstrate through detailed calculations that, upon the incorporation of leading-order PNG, both types of extensions introduce irreducible field-dependent contributions to the conditional likelihood. This insight motivates the systematic inclusion of additional effective terms within the forward modeling framework. Our work facilitates Bayesian forward modeling under non-Gaussian initial conditions, thereby enabling more stringent constraints on the parameters describing PNG.

 - **Abstract**
 We report that the formation of the twin-bubble system N65 and N65bis may be caused by the cloud-cloud collision (CCC) from the Bullet Nebula. The blue-shifted $^{13}$CO gas component (N65a [47, 55] km s$^{-1}$) is associated with the twin-bubble system, while the red-shifted $^{13}$CO gas component (N65b [55, 62] km s$^{-1}$) is linked to the Bullet Nebula. The distinct signatures of CCC, such as the bridge feature, the U-shape cavity and the complementary distribution with displacement, are found between N65a and N65b. The collision timescale is estimated to be 1.15 to 2.0 Myr, which is consistent with the dynamical ages of the two \HII regions in N65a (0.73 Myr for N65bis and 1.19 Myr for N65, respectively), indicating their CCC-related origin. A total of 354 young stellar objects (YSOs) are founded, which are clustered into eight MST (Minimum Spinning Tree) groups. The distribution of M1 (at the post-frontal edge) and M2, M3, M4 (at the pre-frontal edge) suggests that the CCC triggers star formation along the collision path of $b=0^{\circ}.35$, with younger YSOs present at the pre-frontal edge. Therefore, the bipolar morphology of the twin-bubble system can be interpreted by the collision of N65a and N65b along $b=0^{\circ}.35$ about 2 Myr ago.

 - **Abstract**
 Surface information derived from exospheric measurements at planetary bodies complements surface mapping provided by dedicated imagers, offering critical insights into surface release processes, interactions within the planetary environment, space weathering, and planetary evolution. This study explores the feasibility of deriving Mercury's regolith elemental composition from in-situ measurements of its neutral exosphere using deep neural networks (DNNs). We present a supervised feed-forward DNN architecture - a multilayer perceptron (MLP) - that, starting from exospheric densities and proton precipitation fluxes, predicts the chemical elements of the surface regolith below. It serves as an estimator for the surface-exosphere interaction and the processes leading to exosphere formation. Because the DNN requires a comprehensive exospheric dataset not available from previous missions, this study uses simulated exosphere components and simulated drivers. Extensive training and testing campaigns demonstrate the MLP's ability to accurately predict and reconstruct surface composition maps from these simulated measurements. Although this initial version does not aim to reproduce Mercury's actual surface composition, it provides a proof of concept, showcasing the algorithm's robustness and capacity for handling complex datasets to create estimators for exospheric generation models. Moreover, our tests reveal substantial potential for further development, suggesting that this method could significantly enhance the analysis of complex surface-exosphere interactions and complement planetary exosphere models. This work anticipates applying the approach to data from the BepiColombo mission, specifically the SERENA package, whose nominal phase begins in 2027.

 - **Abstract**
 The so-called "Giant Arc" is a sparse pattern of MgII absorbers spanning approximately 740 comoving Mpc, whose discovery has been claimed to contradict the large-scale homogeneity inherent to the standard cosmological model. We previously showed that, with the same algorithm and parameters used for its discovery, very similar patterns are abundant in uniform random distributions, and among equivalent halo samples in a cosmological simulation of the standard model. In a response, the original discoverers of the "Giant Arc" have argued that these parameters were only appropriate for their specific observational data, but that a smaller linking length should be used for control studies, in which case far fewer patterns are detected. We briefly review and disprove these arguments, and demonstrate that large patterns like the "Giant Arc" are indeed ubiquitous in a statistically homogeneous universe.

 The special relativistic generalization of isotropic regularized kappa distributions is derived and compared to that of the original Olbertian (or standard) kappa distributions. It is demonstrated that for the latter the kappa parameter is even stronger limited than in the non-relativistic case, while for the former all positive kappa values remain possible. After a derivation of the non-relativistic limits, the pressures of the distributions are studied as a specific case of the moments of both the relativistic standard and regularized kappa distributions.

 - **Abstract**
 We present designs and fabrication of sub-wavelength anti-reflection (AR) structures on alumina for infrared absorptive filters with passbands near 30, 125, and 250 GHz. These bands are widely used by ground-based instruments measuring the cosmic microwave background radiation. The designs are tuned to provide reflectance of 2% or less for fractional bandwidths between 51% and 72%, with each of the three primary bands containing two sub-bands. We make the sub-wavelength structures (SWS), which resemble a two-dimensional array of pyramids, using laser ablation. We measure the shapes of the fabricated pyramids and show that for incidence angles up to 20 degrees the predicted in-band average reflectance is 2% or less, in agreement with the design. The band average instrumental polarization is less than $3\times 10^{-3}$.

 High-resolution spectroscopy (R>50,000) in astronomy typically uses echelle-type spectrographs, which excel for exoplanet detection via radial velocity but compromise throughput for atmospheric characterization. We propose and test a novel method to achieve very high spectral resolution with significantly higher throughput within a limited bandpass using a tuned, high fringe-density volume phase holographic (VPH) grating in double pass. Using a wavelength-tunable laser, we measured the dispersion and diffraction efficiency of this setup, finding that our tested VPH grating reaches a diffraction-limited resolving power >140,000 in double pass with a peak diffraction efficiency of 79% for unpolarized light. Based on current manufacturing capabilities, we estimate double-pass diffraction efficiencies >50% with resolving powers >200,000 are achievable from visible to near-infrared wavelengths, limited only by detector size.

 - **Abstract**
 Climate transitions on exoplanets offer valuable insights into the atmospheric processes governing planetary habitability. Previous pure-steam atmospheric models show a thermal limit in outgoing long-wave radiation, which has been used to define the inner edge of the classical habitable zone and guide exoplanet surveys aiming to identify and characterize potentially habitable worlds. We expand upon previous modelling by treating (i) the dissolution of volatiles into a magma ocean underneath the atmosphere, (ii) a broader volatile range of the atmospheric composition including H2O, CO2, CO, H2, CH4 and N2, and (iii) a surface temperature- and mantle redox-dependent equilibrium chemistry. We find that multi-component atmospheres of outgassed composition located above partially or fully-molten mantles do not exhibit the characteristic thermal radiation limit that arises from pure-steam models, thereby undermining the canonical concept of a runaway greenhouse limit, and hence challenging the conventional approach of using it to define an irradiation-based habitable zone. Our results show that atmospheric heat loss to space is strongly dependent on the oxidation and melting state of the underlying planetary mantle, through their significant influence on the atmosphere's equilibrium composition. This suggests an evolutionary hysteresis in climate scenarios: initially molten and cooling planets do not converge to the same climate regime as solidified planets that heat up by external irradiation. Steady-state models cannot recover evolutionary climate transitions, which instead require self-consistent models of the temporal evolution of the coupled feedback processes between interior and atmosphere over geologic time.

 - **Abstract**
 Inflation in cosmology is a specific stage preceding the Big Bang, aimed at solving both old background problems and new perturbation issues. Single-field inflation is a candidate to illustrate the picture of the initial universe, and various potential functions lead to different scenarios during the inflationary stage. This paper introduces two essential parameters: the spectral index and the tensor-to-scalar ratio detected from the initial power spectrum, derived from the action of the scalar field and using approximation that the potential is flat. A brief overview of the origins of Starobinsky Inflation, Chaotic Inflation, Small Field Inflation, and Natural Inflation is also presented, along with their mathematical representations. Finally, the results derived from various inflation models regarding the index and ratio are tested using the Planck data, and the deviations in each model are analyzed.

 - **Abstract**
 The r-process production in the early universe has been well constrained by the extensive studies of metal-poor stars. However, the r-process enrichment in the metal-rich regime is still not well understood. In this study, we examine the abundance ratios of Th and Eu, which represent the actinides and lanthanides, respectively, for a sample of metal-rich disk stars. Our sample covers 89 giant stars in the Kepler field with metallicities $-0.7 \leq \rm{[Fe/H]} \leq 0.4$ and ages from a few hundred Myr to $\sim 14$ Gyr. Age information for this sample is available from stellar seismology, which is essential for studying the radioactive element Th. We derive Th and Eu abundances through $\chi^2$ fitting of high-resolution archival spectra ($R \sim 80,000$) observed with the High Dispersion Spectrograph (HDS) at the Subaru Telescope. We create synthetic spectra for individual stars using a 1D LTE spectral synthesis code, Turbospectrum, adopting MARCS model atmospheres. Our study establishes the use of a less extensively studied Th II line at 5989 angstrom, carefully taking into account the blends of other spectral lines to derive the Th abundance. We successfully determine Eu abundance for 89 stars in our sample and Th for 81 stars. For the remaining 8 stars, we estimate the upper limits of Th abundance. After correcting the Th abundance for the decay, we find no correlation between $\rm{[Th/Eu]}$ and $\rm{[Fe/H]}$, which indicates that actinides production with respect to lanthanides does not depend on metallicity. On the other hand, we find a positive correlation of $\rm{[Th/Eu]}$ with age, with a slope of $0.10 \pm 0.04$. This may hint at the possibility that the dominant r-process sources are different between the early and late universe.

 - **Abstract**
 The discovery of hot Jupiters that orbit very close to their host stars has long challenged traditional models of planetary formation and migration. Characterising their atmospheric composition - mainly in the form of the carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratio and metallicity - can provide insights into their formation locations and evolution pathways. With JWST we can characterise the atmospheres of these types of planets more precisely than previously possible, primarily because it allows us to determine both their atmospheric oxygen and carbon composition. Here, we present a JWST NIRSpec/G395H transmission spectrum from 2.8-5.1$\mu m$ of WASP-94Ab, an inflated hot Jupiter with a retrograde misaligned orbit around its F-type host star. We find a relatively cloud-free atmosphere, with absorption features of H$_2$O and CO$_2$ at detection significances of $\sim 4\sigma$ and $\sim 11\sigma$, respectively. In addition, we detect tentative evidence of CO absorption at $\sim3\sigma$, as well as hints of sulphur with the detection of H$_2$S at a $\sim 2.5\sigma$ confidence level. Our favoured equilibrium chemistry model determines a C/O ratio of $0.49^{+0.08}_{-0.13}$ for WASP-94Ab's atmosphere, which is substellar compared to the star's C/O ratio of $0.68 \pm 0.10$. The retrieved atmospheric metallicity is similar to the star's metallicity as both are $\sim 2\times$ solar. We find that this sub-stellar C/O ratio and stellar metallicity can be best explained by pebble accretion or planetesimal accretion in combination with large-distance migration of the planet.

 An error was detected in the code of one of the components considered to model the optical/UV emission of the Galactic ULX pulsar Swift J0243.6+6124 during its 2017 giant outburst. This led to an overestimation of the contribution from the X-ray heated surface of the Be star. The addition of the X-ray irradiation of a misaligned Be disk to our model is proposed to explain the observations. Preliminary results of the updated model provide good fit to the data.

 The detection and characterization of periodic X-ray signals are crucial for identifying new compact objects and studying the mechanisms powering their emission. We report on the timing and spectral variability of CXOU J204734.8+300105, a proposed eclipsing polar-type cataclysmic variable (CV) candidate. This source has been observed once with Chandra and twice with XMM-Newton, revealing several intriguing and conflicting features in its X-ray emission. The Chandra observation showed a periodicity of $\sim$6000 s with an eclipse-like feature. The X-ray light curve from 2017 XMM-Newton observation showed a period of $\sim$2000 seconds without any apparent eclipse, while the simultaneous optical light curve from OM showed a period of $\sim$6000 seconds. This variability raises questions about the true nature of the source. Spectral analysis indicates a multi-component emission and emission lines due to Fe. The spectral characteristics are consistent with those observed in other CV systems. Additionally, we identified optical and near-infrared counterparts from various catalogues. Our findings suggest a dynamic and evolving accretion environment of CXOU J204734.8+300105.

 - **Abstract**
 We report results on the radial velocity dispersion profile built out to the outskirts of NGC 4147, a Milky Way globular cluster with detected strong tidal tails. The cluster was chosen to probe, from an observational point of view, recent simulations that suggest that rising velocity dispersion profiles at large distance from the clusters' centers would be seen in globular clusters without tidal tails. From GEMINI@GMOS spectra, centered in the infrared CaII triplet region, of selected stars located along the onset of NGC 4147's tidal tails, we measured their radial velocities and overall metallicities. The derived metallicities were used to ultimately assessing on the highly-ranked cluster candidates of 9 stars, located between ~ 7 and 33 pc from the cluster's center, suitable for testing the aforementioned simulations. We complemented the present radial velocities with others available in the literature for cluster's members, and built a cluster velocity dispersion profile which suggests a mostly flat or slightly rising profile at large distances from the cluster's center. This outcome confirms that kinematically hot outermost cluster's stars are seen in NGC 4147, which disproves the recent model predictions. Nevertheless, the mean velocity dispersion of the outermost cluster's stars agrees with NGC 4147 being formed in a 10^8-10^9Mo dwarf galaxy with a cored dark matter profile that later was accreted on to the Milky Way.

          The systemic recoil velocity distribution and the scale height of isolated millisecond pulsar systems: Implications on neutron star retention fractions in star clusters

 - **Abstract**
 The systemic recoil velocity ($v_\mathrm{sys}$) distribution of millisecond pulsars (MSPs) is essential for understanding the MSP formation and estimating the retention fractions of MSPs in star clusters, which can potentially be determined with astrometric studies that take into account MSPs' long-term dynamic evolution and the scarcity of radial velocity measurements. We compiled 65 isolated (or field) MSP systems (including lone MSPs) that are well astrometrically determined, and calculated their transverse peculiar (or space) velocities $\boldsymbol{v}_\perp$ and Galactic heights $z$. We find that the observed Galactic-longitude components $v_\mathrm{l}$ of $\boldsymbol{v}_\perp$ can be well described by a linear combination of three normal distributions. Assuming that 1) $v_\mathrm{l}$ are statistically stable over time (the "stable-$v_\mathrm{l}$" assumption), and 2) $\boldsymbol{v}_\mathrm{sys}$ directions are uniformly distributed (the "isotropic-$\boldsymbol{v}_\mathrm{sys}$" assumption), the MSP $v_\mathrm{sys}$ distribution can be approximated by a linear combination of three Maxwellian components. Our dynamical population synthesis analysis based on the derived $v_\mathrm{sys}$ distribution verified the "stable-$v_\mathrm{l}$" assumption in the parameter space of this work, and estimated the initial and the current Galaxy-wide scale heights of isolated MSP systems to be about 0.32 kpc and 0.66 kpc, respectively. According to the MSP $v_\mathrm{sys}$ distribution, $\sim13$% of all the MSPs born in a globular cluster (GC) with the nominal 50 $\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}$ central escape velocity can be retained. Therefore, the $v_\mathrm{sys}$ distribution of isolated MSP systems may account for the high number of MSPs discovered in GCs, which implies that MSPs in star clusters may follow the same formation channel(s) as isolated MSP systems.

 - **Abstract**
 Chemical modeling and synthetic observations are powerful methods to interpret observations, both requiring a knowledge of the physical conditions. In this paper, we present the Analytical Protostellar Environment (APE) code, which aims at making chemical simulations and synthetic observations accessible. APE contains a physical model of protostellar evolution (including the central object, the envelope, the protoplanetary disk and the outflow) as well as interfaces to publicly available codes to perform chemical simulations, radiative transfer calculations, and synthetic interferometry imaging. APE produces density and temperature maps of protostellar systems. The code can also follow individual particles throughout their journey in a collapsing core. APE includes a treatment of the dust grain size-distribution to compute opacities self-consistently for subsequent radiative transfer. We show an example of application of APE by computing chemical abundance maps of CO, CN, CS, H2CO, and CH3OH in a Class I protostellar system. We also performed synthetic ALMA observations of their molecular emission assuming an edge-on source inclination. The moment 0 maps of CO, CS, and H2CO display an X-shaped emission similar to what is observed toward the Class I source IRAS 04302+2247.

 - **Abstract**
 The advancement in the observational cosmology of the early universe such as Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) observations, puts severe constraints on the inflationary models. Many inflationary models have been ruled out by CMB, nevertheless the models ruled out in standard cold inflationary scenarios can be resurrected in modified gravity models. In this regard we examine the dynamics of inflation within the framework of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (EGB) Gravity using the new slow-roll approximation methods proposed in Pozdeeva et al. (2024). We consider the Mutated Hilltop inflation model (Pal et al., 2010; Pinhero and Pal, 2019) due to its origin from super-gravity, a naturally perfect choice to study the impact of EGB on inflationary observables such as tensor-to-scalar ratio ($r$) and scalar spectral index ($n_s$). The period of reheating following the inflationary phase is also examined, and for the {\it Planck'18} permitted values of $n_s$, constraints on the reheating temperature ($T_{re}$) are computed for various equations of states during reheating ($\omega_{re}$).

 - **Abstract**
 We present a newly appreciated FU Ori outburst event that began in 2019 and reached a peak in early 2021. Suspected young stellar object WISE J054452.25+333009.6 experienced substantial brightening, in excess of $-5$ mag at optical wavelengths and $-2.5$ mag at mid-infrared wavelengths. The time from near-quiescence to peak brightness was approximately 24 months. Optical and near-infrared spectra confirm that the outbursting source (hereby designated FUOr-Aur 0544+3330) shows all the hallmarks of the FU Ori class, including the Li I indicator of stellar youth. The mix of ionized and neutral atomic lines, alongside prominent molecular absorption features, is consistent with the expected change in spectral type from earlier in the optical to later-type in the near-infrared. The closest analog among well-studied FU Ori objects is V1515 Cyg. Both sources have unusually narrow-lined absorption spectra that can be explained by a face-on disk orientation, such that disk-broadening is minimized and wind-induced blueshift (in e.g. H$\alpha$, NaD, Ca II) is maximized. Both the optical through infrared spectral energy distribution and high-resolution spectrum are well-fit by a pure-accretion disk model. Adopting a distance of $d=1.5$ kpc, the accretion and central star parameters are: $\dot{M} = 10^{-5.48}$ $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, $M_* = 0.17 \ M_\odot$, and $R_\mathrm{inner} = 1.04 \ R_\odot$. Other fitted values are disk inclination $i=5.9$ deg and source extinction $A_V=1.83$ mag. These parameters yield accretion luminosity $L_\mathrm{acc} = 8.4\ L_\odot$ and maximum disk temperature $T_{\rm{max}} = 6218$ K.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the evolution of the Vis-NIR reflectance spectrum of salty granular ice analog samples in a simulation chamber under conditions relevant to the surface of Europa. A novel application and custom calibration of a thermopile sensor enabled the measurement of the surface temperature of the samples in far infrared emission. This allows the kinetics of the observed changes to be scaled to equivalent timescales on Europa. We observed significant changes in the depth and shape of the broad water absorption bands for all samples on timescales of a few thousand years of equatorial conditions on Europa. This effect should be taken into account if quantitative predictions about bulk composition are made based on remote-sensing data. A narrow absorption feature attributed to hydrohalite formed during the sublimation of the sodium chloride sample. We used near-infrared spectroscopy in an irradiation chamber to assess the stability of this narrow feature under electron irradiation. We find that the radiation environment present on Europa dehydrates the hydrohalite on short timescales. Therefore, we expect hydrohalite not to be present on the surface, unless erupted very recently (< 10 yr) or located in thermal anomalies (> 145 K). Thus, a detection of hydrohalite would clearly indicate recent activity.

 Active galactic nuclei formation and evolution is currently an open puzzle. Their enormous mass is not explainable via sub-Eddington accretion and the frequent presence of relativistic jets at high-z, commonly linked with spinning black holes, suggest a less effective accretion process. NVSS J151002+570243 is part of this population, being the most distant blazar consistently detected by Fermi/LAT, hence hosting a powerful jet. We tested the hypothesis of a super-Eddington accretion process for this source by modeling its big blue bump with a set of accretion disk emission models. We first tested a standard geometrically thin, optically thick $\alpha$-disk, obtaining a mass of Log$M/M_\odot=8.65\pm0.19$ consistent with virial-based results and a significantly sub-Eddington accretion rate $\lambda=0.02\pm0.01$. We then focused on the analytic approximations of two numerical models that take into account the General Relativity effects of a spinning black hole (reasonable due to the presence of a jet) and a close-to- or super-Eddington accretion rate (KERBB and SLIMBH). Despite the focus on super-critical accretion, these models confirm a surprisingly low Eddington ratio, of the order of 3\%. The hypothesis of a continuous accretion at this measured rate is unrealistic, since it would imply a seed black hole mass of $\sim10^6-10^8M_\odot$ at redshift z=20. Hence we explore the possibility of a continuous super-critical accretion starting from a $\sim10^2M_\odot$ seed, that would spin up the black hole and eventually contribute in launching the relativistic jet. The measured low accretion rate would thus happen only once the jet is active. This idea would reconcile the black holes with large masses accreting at somewhat slow rates that are observed at z>4, with the need of an extremely fast evolution, by allowing the formation of stellar-size black hole seeds even as late as at $z\sim8$.

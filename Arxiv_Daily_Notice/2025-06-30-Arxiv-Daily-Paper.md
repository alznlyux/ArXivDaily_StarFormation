 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents innovative solutions to critical challenges in planetary and deep-space exploration electronics. We synthesize findings across diverse mission profiles, highlighting advances in: (1) MARTIAN positioning systems with dual-frequency transmission to achieve $\pm$1m horizontal accuracy; (2) artificial reef platforms for Titan's hydrocarbon seas utilizing specialized sensor arrays and multi-stage communication chains; (3) precision orbital rendezvous techniques demonstrating novel thermal protection solutions; (4) miniaturized CubeSat architectures for asteroid exploration with optimized power-to-mass ratios; and (5) next-generation power management systems for MARS rovers addressing dust accumulation challenges. These innovations represent promising directions for future space exploration technologies, particularly in environments where traditional Earth-based electronic solutions prove inadequate. The interdisciplinary nature of these developments highlights the critical intersection of aerospace engineering, electrical engineering, and planetary science in advancing human exploration capabilities beyond Earth orbit.

 - **Abstract**
 Spatially resolved stellar kinematics has become a key ingredient in time-delay cosmography to break the mass-sheet degeneracy in the mass profile and, in turn, provide a precise constraint on the Hubble constant and other cosmological parameters. In this paper, we present the first measurements of 2D resolved stellar kinematics for the lens galaxy in the quadruply lensed quasar system \lensname, using integral field spectroscopy from the JWST's Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec), marking the first such measurement conducted with the JWST. In extracting robust kinematic measurements from this first-of-its-kind dataset, we made methodological improvements both in the data reduction and kinematic extraction. In our kinematic extraction procedure, we performed joint modeling of the lens galaxy, the quasar, and its host galaxy's contributions in the spectra to deblend the lens galaxy component and robustly constrain its stellar kinematics. Our improved methodological frameworks are released as software pipelines for future use: \textsc{squirrel} for extracting stellar kinematics, and \textsc{RegalJumper} for JWST-NIRSpec data reduction, incorporating additional artifact cleaning beyond the standard JWST pipeline. We compared our measured stellar kinematics from the JWST NIRSpec with previously obtained ground-based measurements from the Keck Cosmic Web Imager integral field unit and find that the two datasets are statistically consistent at a $\sim$1.1$\sigma$ confidence level. Our measured kinematics will be used in a future study to improve the precision of the Hubble constant measurement.

 - **Abstract**
 As NASA's New Horizons spacecraft exits the Solar System bound for interstellar space, it has traveled so far that the nearest stars have shifted markedly from their positions seen from Earth. We demonstrated this by imaging the Proxima Centauri and Wolf 359 fields from Earth and New Horizons on 2020 April 23, when the spacecraft was 47.1 au distant. The observed parallaxes for Proxima Centauri and Wolf 359 are $32.4''$ and $15.7'',$ respectively. These measurements are not of research grade, but directly seeing large stellar parallaxes between two widely separated simultaneous observers is vividly educational. Using the New Horizons positions of the two stars alone, referenced to the three-dimensional model of the solar neighborhood constructed from Gaia DR3 astrometry, further provides the spacecraft spatial position relative to nearby stars with 0.44 au accuracy. The range to New Horizons from the Solar System barycenter is recovered to 0.27 au accuracy, and its angular direction to $0.4^\circ$ accuracy, when compared to the precise values from NASA Deep Space Network tracking. This is the first time optical stellar astrometry has been used to determine the three-dimensional location of a spacecraft with respect to nearby stars, and the first time any method of interstellar navigation has been demonstrated for a spacecraft on an interstellar trajectory. We conclude that the best astrometric approach to navigating spacecraft on their departures to interstellar space is to use a single pair of the closest stars as references, rather than a large sample of more distant stars.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the spectral evolution of the Z-track source GX 17+2 using AstroSat and NICER observations taken between 2016 and 2020. The AstroSat observations cover the period when the source is in the normal branch (NB) and the flaring branch (FB), while for the NICER ones the variability can be associated with the FB branch. The source spectra at different regions of the branches are well described by accretion disk emission, blackbody surface emission and a thermal Comptonization component. In the NB, the total bolometric unabsorbed flux remains constant and the variation is due to changes in the Comptonization, disk fluxes. In particular, the inferred luminosity ($L_{\rm T}$) and accretion rate ($\dot M$) remain constant, while there is significant variation in the inner disk radii and fraction of disk photons entering the corona, indicating changes in the geometry of the system. On the other hand, in the FB, there is significant variation in luminosity from $\sim 4.0$ to $\sim 7.0 \times 10^{38}$ ergs s$^{-1}$. Despite this significant variation in luminosity and in the inner disk radii, the accretion efficiency defined as $\eta = L_{\rm T}/{\dot M} c^2$, remains nearly constant at $\sim 0.20$ throughout the evolution of the source, as expected for a neutron star system.

 - **Abstract**
 We perform kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) velocity reconstruction on data from ACT DR6 and DESI-LS DR9. To estimate the cross-power between kSZ velocity reconstruction and galaxy density, we make use of a novel quadratic maximum likelihood QML power spectrum estimator implementation in red-shift binned spherical coordinates. We find a detection of the kSZ signal from the cross-correlation between the estimated velocity field and the large-scale galaxy field of $11.7 \sigma$. We estimate an amplitude $A=0.39 \pm 0.04$ of the kSZ signal with respect to a halo model prediction, possibly indicating a high feedback in massive halos, in agreement with previous studies. Our result demonstrates the feasibility of an optimal QML pipeline at the resolution required for this analysis, and will be a powerful tool for kSZ cosmology with upcoming high-resolution surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 Meteoroid bulk density is a critical value required for assessing impact risks to spacecraft, informing shielding and mission design. Direct bulk density measurements for sub-millimeter to millimeter-sized meteoroids are difficult, often relying on forward modeling without robust uncertainty estimates. Methods based solely on select observables can overlook noise-induced biases and non-linear relations between physical parameters. This study aims to automate the inversion of meteoroid physical parameters from optical meteor data, focusing on bulk density and its associated uncertainties. We compare an observables-based selection method (PCA) with an RMSD-based approach used to select among millions of ablation model runs using full light and deceleration curves as constraints. After validating both approaches on six synthetic test cases, we apply them to two Perseid meteors recorded by high sensitivity Electron-Multiplied CCD (EMCCD) cameras and high precision mirror-tracked meteors detected by the Canadian Automated Meteor Observatory (CAMO). Our results show that relying only on observables, as in the PCA approach can converge to wrong solutions and can yield unphysical solutions. In contrast, the RMSD-based method offers more reliable density constraints, particularly for bright and strongly decelerating meteor. Small relative measurement precision in brightness and lag relative to the full range of observed lag and luminosity is the key to tight solution. We provide the first objectively derived uncertainty bounds for the physical properties of meteoroids. Our approach solves the solution degeneracy problem inherent in forward modelling of meteors. This strategy can be generalized to other showers, paving the way for improved meteoroid models and enhanced spacecraft safety.

 - **Abstract**
 Directly imaged substellar companions with well-constrained ages and masses serve as vital empirical benchmarks for planet formation and evolution models. Potential benchmark companions can be identified from astrometric accelerations of their host stars. We use Gaia DR3 and Hipparcos astrometry to identify 166 northern hemisphere stars with astrometric accelerations consistent with a substellar companion between 0.5'' and 1''. For this accelerating sample we identify young stars using APO/ARCES spectra and TESS light curves. From spectroscopic screening of the sample, we measure ages for 24 stars with detectable amounts of lithium, place lower age limits on 135 stars with lithium non-detections, and measure ages from R'HK for 34 stars. 129 stars have TESS light curves from which we measure ages for 20 stars with rotation rates < 15 days, and we identify 3 eclipsing binaries. We present median ages and confidence intervals of age posteriors for the entire sample and discuss how the overall age distribution of our sample compares to a uniform star formation rate in the solar neighborhood. We identify 47 stars with median ages < 2 Gyr, 31 stars with median ages < 1 Gyr, and 14 stars with median ages < 0.5 Gyr, making them high-priority targets for direct imaging follow-up.

 - **Abstract**
 NASA's Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) will be the first space telescope capable of directly imaging Earth-like planets in the habitable zones of Sun-like stars to probe their atmospheres for signs of life. Now in its early stages of design, a list of the 164 most promising targets for HWO has been released to the community to carry out precursor science. Massive companions in these systems--stars, brown dwarfs, or giant planets--could preclude the existence of Earth-sized planets in the habitable zone by impacting their long-term dynamical stability. Here, we use astrometry from Hipparcos and Gaia EDR3 to identify stars in the HWO preliminary target list that exhibit astrometric accelerations and determine joint constraints on the expected mass and separation of these companions. We find that 54 HWO targets have significant astrometric accelerations, 37 of which are accounted for by known giant planets and stellar companions. Follow-up efforts are required to clarify the specific nature of the suspected companions around the remaining 17 accelerating stars. Stars without significant accelerations are used to rule out large regions of companion mass and separation down to planetary masses. We find that with Hipparcos and Gaia EDR3 we are $\sim$85$\%$ sensitive to 2 $M_\mathrm{Jup}$ planets between 4 and 10 AU. Future Gaia releases will provide sensitivity to sub-Jovian mass planets on Solar System scales for provisional HWO targets. Finally, using analytical estimates of dynamical stability, we find that 13 HWO targets have known stellar or planetary companions that are likely to disrupt habitable-zone planets.

          Detecting Land with Reflected Light Spectroscopy to Rule Out Waterworld O2 Biosignature False Positives

 - **Abstract**
 The search for life outside our solar system is at the forefront of modern astronomy, and telescopes such as the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) are being designed to identify biosignatures. Molecular oxygen, O2, is considered a promising indication of life, yet substantial abiotic O2 may accumulate from H2O photolysis and hydrogen escape on a lifeless, fully (100%) ocean-covered terrestrial planet when surface O2 sinks are suppressed. This so-called waterworld false positive scenario could be ruled out with land detection because exposed land precludes extremely deep oceans (~50 Earth oceans) given topographic limits set by the crushing strength of rocks. Land detection is possible because plausible geologic surfaces exhibit increasing reflectance with wavelength in the visible, whereas liquid water and ice/snow have flat or decreasing reflectance, respectively. Here, we present reflected light retrievals to demonstrate that HWO could detect land on an exo-Earth in the disk-averaged spectrum. Given a signal-to-noise ratio of 20 spectrum, Earth-like land fractions can be confidently detected with 0.3-1.1 um spectral coverage (resolution R~140 in the visible, R~7 in the UV, with Earth-like atmosphere and clouds). We emphasize the need for UV spectroscopy down to at least 0.3 um to break an O3-land degeneracy. We find that the SNR and resolution requirements in the visible/UV imply that a larger aperture (~8 m) will be necessary to ensure the observing times required for land detection are feasible for most HWO terrestrial habitable zone targets. These results strongly inform the HWO minimum requirements to corroborate possible oxygen biosignatures.

          Spectroscopic Analysis of Pictor II: a very low metallicity ultra-faint dwarf galaxy bound to the Large Magellanic Cloud

 - **Abstract**
 We present Magellan/IMACS and Magellan/MIKE spectroscopy of the ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) galaxy Pictor~II (Pic~II) that is located only 12 kpc from the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). From the IMACS spectroscopy, we identify 13 member stars and measure a mean heliocentric velocity of $326.9\pm1.1~{\rm km~s^{-1}}$, a velocity dispersion of $3.5_{-0.9}^{+1.1}~{\rm km~s^{-1}}$, a mean metallicity of $\overline{\rm [Fe/H]}=-2.99\pm0.06$, and an upper limit on the metallicity dispersion of $\sigma_{\rm [Fe/H]}<0.18$. We measure detailed elemental abundances for the brightest star, finding $\mbox{[Fe/H]} = -3.3$, high [$\alpha$/Fe] ratios, and no detectable neutron capture elements, similar to stars in other UFDs. However, this star has an unusually high [Sc/Fe] ratio. The dynamical mass-to-light ratio ($M/L=760_{-420}^{+910}~M_{\odot}~L^{-1}_{\odot}$), size, and chemical abundances confirms that Pic~II is a dark matter-dominated dwarf galaxy. We perform detailed orbit modeling of Pic~II in a combined Milky Way (MW) and LMC potential and find that Pic~II is highly likely to be a long-term LMC satellite. Furthermore, we find that Pic II is likely still bound to the LMC today. Pic~II is the seventh LMC-associated UFD and among the most metal-poor UFDs known. We further update the morphological parameters with deeper Dark Energy Camera (DECam) photometry, compute the dark matter properties for dark matter indirect detection searches, verify the extremely low metallicity with narrowband CaHK imaging, and briefly discuss tidal influences of the LMC and MW.

          Probing the peak of star formation with the stochastic background of binary black hole mergers

 - **Abstract**
 Although the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration detects many individually resolvable gravitational-wave events from binary black hole mergers, those that are too weak to be identified individually contribute to a stochastic gravitational-wave background. Unlike the standard cross-correlation search for excess correlated power, a Bayesian search method that models the background as a superposition of an unknown number of mergers enables simultaneous inference of the properties of high-redshift binary black hole populations and accelerated detection of the background. In this work, we apply this templated background search method to one day of simulated data at current LIGO Hanford-Livingston detector network sensitivity to determine whether the weakest mergers contribute information to the detection of the background and to the constraint on the merger redshift distribution at high redshifts. We find that the dominant source of information for the detection of the stochastic background comes from mergers with signal-to-noise ratios just below the individual detection threshold. However, we demonstrate that the weakest mergers do contribute to the constraint on the shape of the redshift distribution not only beyond the peak of star formation, but also beyond the redshifts accessible with individually detectable sources.

          Filters for NIR astronomical photometry: comparison of commercial IRWG filters and designs using OpenFilters

 - **Abstract**
 The photometric accuracy in the near-infrared (NIR) wavelength range (0.9 -2.6 microns) is strongly affected by the variability of atmospheric transmission. The Infrared Working Group (IRWG) has recommended filters that help alleviate this issue and provide a common standard of NIR filtersets across different observatories. However, accurate implementation of these filters are yet to be available to astronomers. In the meantime, InGaAs based detectors have emerged as a viable option for small and medium telescopes. The present work explores the combination of IRWG filtersets with InGaAs detectors. A few commercially available filtersets that approximate the IRWG profile are compared. Design of more accurate IRWG filtersets suitable for the InGaAs sensitivity range is undertaken using an open-source filter design software - OpeFilters. Along with the photometric filters iZ, iJ and iH, design of a few useful narrow band filters is also presented. These filters present opportunities for small and medium telescopes for dedicated long-term observation of interesting infrared sources.

          A search of periodic variable stars in the LMC by JWST photometry

 - **Abstract**
 Based on high-resolution near-infrared photometric data from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) targeting the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), this study attempts to evaluate the feasibility and sensitivity limits of variable star detection in crowded stellar fields. Through light curve analysis, we identified a total of 304 periodic variable stars, including 71 EW-type eclipsing binaries, 7 EA-type eclipsing binaries, 177 rotational variables, 38 $\delta$ Scuti (DSCT) stars, and 12 RR Lyrae stars. Period--luminosity relations (PLRs) were derived for EW-type eclipsing binaries, DSCT stars, and RR Lyrae stars. The PLRs for EW-type and RR Lyrae stars are in good agreement with previous studies, while the PLR zero point for DSCT stars appears systematically fainter by approximately 0.15--0.30 mag. Our PLRs exhibit low dispersion and are minimally affected by crowding. We analyzed the capability of JWST archival data to detect low-amplitude variables and found that only stars with amplitudes greater than approximately 0.05 mag can be reliably detected. Through simulations, we quantified how increasing the number of photometric epochs improves the detectability of low-amplitude, low signal-to-noise ratio variables. Despite current limitations in observational cadence, JWST demonstrates unique advantages in detecting short-period eclipsing binaries, rotational variables, and high-amplitude pulsators. Its exceptional spatial resolution enables high-precision PLR calibrations, offering new opportunities for future studies in variable star astrophysics and extragalactic distance measurements.

          Updated constraints on Regge-Teitelboim gravity

 - **Abstract**
 In the Regge-Teitelboim model, gravity is described by embedding the space-time manifold in a (usually flat) fixed higher-dimensional background, where the embedding coordinates, rather than the metric tensor, are the dynamical degrees of freedom. Stern \& Xu extended the Regge-Teitelboim framework to encompass scenarios where the background embedding space is not flat, noting that when the background is a five-dimensional de Sitter space, the Robertson-Walker manifold undergoes a transition from a decelerating phase to an accelerating one. Previously, we constrained this model using only low-redshift observations. Here we further explore the observational constraints on this scenario, and report significantly more stringent constraints by including high-redshift data, specifically from the cosmic microwave background. Our results are consistent with $\Lambda$CDM, with the putative model-specific energy component responsible for the recent acceleration being constrained to $\Omega_{RT}<0.006$ and the de Sitter curvature radius in units of the Hubble constant being constrained to $LH_0>1.45$, both at the 95 percent confidence level.

          Jet precession in gamma-ray bursts: The roles of fallback accretion and disk dynamics

 - **Abstract**
 The precession phenomenon of the jet in a gamma-ray burst (GRB) is a key probe of the physics of the central engine. Previous studies generally assumed a fixed precession period when analysing the temporal profiles in GRBs; however, the dynamic evolution of the fallback process and accretion disk can significantly affect the precession behaviour. In this work we present a jet precession model that incorporates the co-evolution of fallback accretion and the central black hole (BH). Our model demonstrates that the jet precession period initially decreases rapidly during the early fallback phase and subsequently increases nearly linearly as the disk evolves. We find that a higher accretion disk viscosity and a slower BH spin lead to longer precession periods and faster precession period growth rates, and that the geometric structure of the precession system modulates the pulse amplitude of the light curve. By fitting the model to observational data of GRBs with multi-pulse structures, we show that jet precession can naturally explain the increasing pulse intervals and broadened pulse widths observed in both long and short GRBs.

          Disentangling the growth rate of perturbations from the HI bias using only clustering data from galaxy surveys

 - **Abstract**
 This work serves two-fold purpose. Firstly, we provide an alternative to the traditional method of determining the growth rate of density perturbations $f(z)$. In usual practice, $f(z)$ can not be directly measured from tracer clustering at some redshift without knowledge of the bias. While the bayron acoustic oscillation (BAO) imprint allows the determination of $(D_A(z), H(z))$, redshift space anisotropy (RSD) allows the measurement of a quantity $f_8(z) = f(z) \sigma_{8,0} D_{+}(z)$. To extract $f(z)$ from $f_8(z)$, one usually requires some other data set. We show that precise BAO and RSD measurements in and around some key redshifts themselves can solely reconstruct $f(z)$ without requiring any other data sets. Secondly, we extend this approach to another tracer, namely the post-reionization 21-cm brightness temperature intensity maps. We demonstrate that the measured $f(z)$ from purely redshift space clustering allows us to measure the 21-cm bias, which is a largely unknown quantity. This may help interpret the observed intensity mapping signal in the future.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs) are an inherent feature of solar and stellar flares. However, the mechanism behind them is debated hence it is necessary to further study them to obtain a complete picture of flares and their contribution to coronal heating. Aims. We analyze 20-second cadence TESS light curves from sectors 27 to 80 to detect stellar flares and QPPs. Methods. Stellar flare detection was carried out using an automated detection routine based on autoregressive integrated moving average models. QPPs were detected using a Fourier model comparison test (AFINO). Results. We detected 3878 flares across 1285 flaring stars. Notably, 61.2% of flares had a duration of less than 10 min. 61 QPPs were detected across 57 stars significantly expanding the current stellar QPP catalog. The detected periods of the QPPs were in the range of 42 to 193 seconds. In the diagram showing QPP periods against the flare duration a branch emerges. It shows a positive correlation with the flare duration, meaning longer duration flares host longer period QPPs. Conclusion. Our study detected short-period and sub-minute QPPs in stellar flares that have rarely been explored in other works. We find similar scaling laws between solar and stellar QPPs which indicates that QPPs in stellar flares might be analogous to the ones in solar flares as both show evidence of scaling with flare duration.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we study the impact of an imperfect knowledge of the instrument bandpasses on the estimate of the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ in the context of the next-generation LiteBIRD satellite. We develop a pipeline to include bandpass integration in both the time-ordered data (TOD) and the map-making processing steps. We introduce the systematic effect by having a mismatch between the ``real'', high resolution bandpass $\tau$, entering the TOD, and the estimated one $\tau_s$, used in the map-making. We focus on two aspects: the effect of degrading the $\tau_s$ resolution, and the addition of a Gaussian error $\sigma$ to $\tau_s$. To reduce the computational load of the analysis, the two effects are explored separately, for three representative LiteBIRD channels (40 GHz, 140 GHz and 402 GHz) and for three bandpass shapes. Computing the amount of bias on $r$, $\Delta r$, caused by these effects on a single channel, we find that a resolution $\lesssim 1.5$ GHz and $\sigma \lesssim 0.0089$ do not exceed the LiteBIRD budget allocation per systematic effect, $\Delta r < 6.5 \times 10^{-6}$. We then check that propagating separately the uncertainties due to a resolution of 1 GHz and a measurement error with $\sigma = 0.0089$ in all LiteBIRD frequency channels, for the most pessimistic bandpass shape of the three considered, still produces a $\Delta r < 6.5 \times 10^{-6}$. This is done both with the simple deprojection approach and with a blind component separation technique, the Needlet Internal Linear Combination (NILC). Due to the effectiveness of NILC in cleaning the systematic residuals, we have tested that the requirement on $\sigma$ can be relaxed to $\sigma \lesssim 0.05$. (Abridged)

 - **Abstract**
 Compact binary coalescences (CBCs), such as merging binary black holes (BBHs), binary neutron stars (BNSs), or neutron star black holes (NSBHs), hosted by dense stellar environments, could produce gravitational waves (GWs) that contain signatures of line-of-sight acceleration (LOSA) imparted by the environment's gravitational potential. We calculate the Post-Newtonian (PN) corrections to the $(2,\,2)$ mode GW phase due to a finite LOSA, starting from the leading order at -4 PN below the quadrupole order, up to 3.5 PN above the quadrupole order. We do so for binaries whose component spins are aligned with the orbital angular momentum, as well as for binaries with non-zero tidal deformation. We implement these corrections into the LIGO-Virgo-Kagra (LVK) collaboration's flagship parameter estimation (PE) software \textsc{Bilby\_tgr}. We study the systematics associated with recovering LOSAs. We find that, when the injection and recovery waveform models are identical, LOSAs are recovered as expected. We test the robustness of the pipeline against waveforms with strong higher-mode signatures or signatures of beyond-general-relativistic (beyond-GR) effects, to delimit the range of applicability of our GR-consistent quasi-circular LOSA-corrected waveforms.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we present a kinematic analysis of the Universe's expansion history using cosmography, with a particular emphasis on the jerk parameter $j_0$, which is equal to one in the standard $\Lambda$CDM scenario. We use distance measurements from DESI DR2, both independently and in combination with current Type Ia supernova (SN) samples, to constrain the cosmographic parameters up to the fourth order without relying on a specific cosmological model. Our results show that for the DESI DR2 data alone, the $\Lambda$CDM prediction ($j_0 = 1$) falls within the 2$\sigma$ confidence region. However, when DESI DR2 is combined with the Union3, Pantheon+, and DESY5 SN datasets, the result obtained is discrepant with the $\Lambda$CDM model at about 3.4$\sigma$, 4.1$\sigma$, and 5.4$\sigma$, respectively. These results are consistent with the conclusions based on dark energy parameterizations reported by the DESI Collaboration, which suggest the presence of a dynamic dark energy component in the universe.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the constraining power of future CMB and galaxy surveys on models of quintessential inflation realized within the framework of $\alpha$-attractors. We analyze how these future datasets will probe the parameter space of $\alpha$-attractor quintessential inflation, specifically the inflationary potential parameters. Our results demonstrate that the synergy between CMB-S4, LiteBIRD, and Euclid can significantly tighten the bounds on the model parameters, achieving forecasted $1\sigma$ uncertainties of $\alpha=2\pm 0.17$, $n_s=0.965\pm 0.0014$, $\ln(10^{10}A_s)=3.0447\pm 0.0029$ for the CMB+GC$_{sp}$ case. This level of sensitivity will enable us to discriminate between different realizations of quintessential inflation and test the attractor behavior characteristic of these models.

 - **Abstract**
 Radio astronomy has entered its golden era, with many revolutionary facilities such as SKA, ngVLA, and LOFAR2.0 coming online in the next decade. These facilities are certain to redefine radio astronomy. However, on smaller scales-such as at institutional or amateur levels-radio astronomy is still mostly practiced for educational or personal interest. The primary reason small-scale radio astronomical experiments rarely produce cutting-edge scientific results is the limitation of funding available for procuring or developing components similar to those used in professional-grade facilities. A second major reason is the lack of tools and skills required for simulating components for a complete telescope. In this work, we address the first of these challenges and suggest novel ideas and designs for cost-effective, next-generation radio telescopes that can be built at small scales. We also describe the observational strategies required to produce cutting-edge scientific results with these telescopes-results comparable to those from professional facilities.

          A high stellar multiplicity rate amongst TESS planet candidates in the Neptunian desert using Gaia DR3 astrometry

 - **Abstract**
 We aim to discover whether the stellar multiplicity rate may provide information on the origin of recently discovered planets in the Neptunian Desert. Using Gaia DR3 astrometry, we search for common proper motion companions to 1779 known exoplanet hosts and 2927 exoplanet candidate hosts from the TESS mission, both within 650 pc. We find overall stellar multiplicity rates of $16.6\pm0.9\%$ and $19.8\pm0.6\%$ for confirmed and candidate exoplanets, respectively. We find stellar multiplicity rates of $16.7\pm5.8\%$ and $27.5\pm2.6\%$ for confirmed and candidate exoplanets in the Neptunian Desert, respectively. Hot Jupiter host stars were found to have rates of $25.8\pm2.1\%$ and $22.9\pm1.3\%$. For the sample of candidate exoplanets, we find higher stellar multiplicity rates for stars hosting both Hot Jupiters and Neptunian Desert planets compared to control samples of similar stars not known to host planets. For the sample of confirmed exoplanets an increased multiplicity rate is seen for Hot Jupiter hosts, but cannot be significantly determined for Neptunian Desert planet hosts due to small sample sizes. If the candidates from TESS are indeed planets, the increased multiplicity rate observed could indicate that the Neptunian Desert and Hot Jupiter populations share similar formation mechanisms and environmental conditions. Alternatively, the TESS candidate high multiplicity rate could imply a prevalence of false positives related to binary and triple stars in this parameter space.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a measurement of the amplitude of matter fluctuations over the redshift range 0.8 <= z <= 3.5 from the cross correlation of over 1.2 million spectroscopic quasars selected by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) across 7,200 deg$^2$ (approx 170 quasars/deg$^2$) and Planck PR4 (NPIPE) cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing maps. We perform a tomographic measurement in three bins centered at effective redshifts z=1.44, 2.27 and 2.75, which have ample overlap with the CMB lensing kernel. From a joint fit using the angular clustering of all three redshift bins (auto and cross-spectra), and including an $\Omega_m$ prior from DESI DR1 baryon acoustic oscillations to break the $\Omega_m-\sigma_8$ degeneracy, we constrain the amplitude of matter fluctuations in the matter-dominated regime to be $\sigma_8=0.929^{+0.059}_{-0.074}$ and $S_8\equiv \sigma_8(\Omega_m/0.3)^{0.5} = 0.922^{+0.059}_{-0.073}$. We provide a growth of structure measurement with the largest spectroscopic quasar sample to date at high redshift, which is 1.5$\sigma$ higher than predictions from $\Lambda$CDM fits to measurements of the primary CMB from Planck PR4. The cross-correlation between PR4 lensing maps and DESI DR1 quasars is detected with a signal-to-noise ratio of 21.7 and the quasar auto-correlation at 27.2 for the joint analysis of all redshift bins. We combine our measurement with the CMB lensing auto-spectrum from the ground-based Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT DR6) and Planck PR4 to perform a sound-horizon-free measurement of the Hubble constant, yielding $H_0=69.1^{+2.2}_{-2.6}\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ through its sensitivity to the matter-radiation equality scale.

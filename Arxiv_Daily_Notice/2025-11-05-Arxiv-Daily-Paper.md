#### Title:
          A Milky Way mass model for isolated simulations

- **Abstract**
 This paper presents an equilibrium model of a Milky Way-like spiral galaxy that supports open, mostly 2- and 3-arm spiral patterns but does not form a bar. It is suggested as a more realistic alternative model to that employed by the Agora collaboration; their model has a much lower disk mass and therefore forms only multi-arm spiral patterns. This improved model should enable simulations that test star-formation and feedback models in a more realistic isolated galaxy. Three versions of the same model having $2.1\times 10^5$, $2.1\times 10^6$, and $2.1\times 10^7$ particles are available for download.

          Stellar Loci. IX. Estimation of Stellar Parameters from CSST-like Photometry

- **Abstract**
 The China Space Station Telescope (CSST) will conduct a deep and wide imaging survey in the NUV-, u-, g-, r-, i-, z-, and y-bands. In this work, using theoretical data synthesized from the BOSZ spectra of Bohlin et al. (2017), along with observational data constructed from different sources, we present two methods for estimating stellar parameters from CSST-like photometry. One approach is to estimate metallicity [M/H] and surface gravity log g simultaneously by using the metallicity- and log g-dependent stellar loci. Tests with theoretical data (without photometric errors) result in precisions of 0.088 dex and 0.083 dex for [M/H] and log g, respectively. With 0.01 mag photometric errors, precision is degraded by about a factor of two, due to degeneracy in [M/H] and log g. Tests with observational data, although with larger photometric errors, result in precisions of 0.10 dex and 0.39 dex for [Fe/H] and log g, respectively, thanks to the strong correlation between stellar colors and log g in real data. The other approach is the giant-dwarf loci method to obtain classifications and metallicity estimates. With the same observational data, it achieves a better [Fe/H] precision of 0.084 dex, due to the stronger constraints imposed on log g. The method also performs well in distinguishing giants from dwarfs, particularly for red or metal-poor giants. This work demonstrates the clear potential of the CSST data, paving the way for stellar-parameter estimates for many billions of stars.

- **Abstract**
 Dust dynamics plays a critical role in astrophysical processes and has been modeled in hydrodynamical simulations using various approaches. Among particle-based methods like Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH), the One-Fluid model has proven to be highly effective for simulating gas-dust mixtures. This study presents the implementation of the One-Fluid model in OpenGadget3, introducing improvements to the original formulation. These enhancements include time-dependent artificial viscosity and conductivity, as well as a novel treatment of dust diffusion using a pressure-like term. The improved model is tested using a suite of dust dynamics benchmark problems: DUSTYBOX, DUSTYWAVE, and DUSTYSHOCK, with the latter extended to multidimensional scenarios, as well as a dusty Sedov-Taylor blast wave. Additional tests include simulations of Cold Keplerian Disks, dusty protoplanetary disks, and Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities to evaluate the model's robustness in more complex flows. The implementation successfully passes all standard benchmark tests. It demonstrates stability and accuracy in both simple and complex simulations. The new diffusion term improves the handling of flows with large dust-to-gas ratios and low drag coefficients, although limitations of the One-Fluid model in these regimes remain. The enhanced One-Fluid model is a reliable and robust tool for simulating dust dynamics in OpenGadget3. While it retains some limitations inherent to the original formulation, the introduced improvements expand its applicability and address some challenges in gas-dust dynamics.

          Observational signatures of outside-in accretion bursts in embedded protostars

- **Abstract**
 Optical and infrared surveys have detected increasing numbers of disc accretion outbursts in young stars. Some models of these FU Ori-type events predict that the outburst should start at near- to mid-infrared wavelengths before an optical rise is detected, and this lag between infrared and optical bursts has been observed in at least two systems. Detecting and characterizing infrared precursors can constrain the outburst trigger region, and thus help identify the mechanism producing the outburst. However, because FU Ori objects are generally young and usually embedded in dusty protostellar envelopes, it is not clear whether or how well such infrared precursors can be detected in the presence of strong envelope extinction. To explore this question, we combine time-dependent outburst models of the inner disc with an outer dusty disc and protostellar envelope, and calculate the resulting spectral energy distributions (SEDs) using the radiative transfer code RADMC3D. We find that, for envelope mass infall rates about 10^{-5} Msun/yr (rc/30 au)^{-1/2}, where rc is a characteristic inner radius for the infalling envelope, the infrared precursor is only apparent in the SED when viewed along the outflow cavity. At other inclinations, the precursor is most easily distinguished at infall rates of 10^{-6} Msun/yr (rc/30 au)^{-1/2}. We also show that far-IR and submm/mm monitoring can enable the indirect detection of precursor evolution long before the optical outburst, emphasizing the potential of long-wavelength monitoring for studying the earliest stages of protostar formation.

          The Flocculent Structure of the Inner Milky Way Disk

- **Abstract**
 Observations of HI published in 1957 by Westerhout and Schmidt were presented as showing a global face-on view of spiral structure in the Milky Way. Since then many studies have attempted to improve on the early map, perhaps presupposing our Galaxy to be characterized by a Grand-design pattern of prominent spiral arms. We consider here two approaches to explore the nature of spiral structure of the inner Milky Way disk using the HI4PI survey. The first is to search for shallow shoulders in the high-velocity wings of HI data along the Galactic equatorial disk of the inner Milky Way that would be expected if the lines of sight swept across interarm regions of low HI density. The second is to look for broad dips in the integrated HI brightness temperature over the high-velocity wings, pertaining to gas near the subcentral region, that would be expected for the interarm region of a Grand-design. We find neither shallow shoulders nor broad dips in either the Northern quadrant I or the Southern quadrant IV indicating that the Milky Way seen interior to the Solar orbit is not characterized by a majestic spiral-structure Grand-design; this conclusion is a robust one, in that it does not depend on measures of distance. Taken together with decades of work on the bits and pieces of the quite disorganized shambles of the inner Galaxy, we suggest that the Milky Way belongs to the category of Flocculent spirals.

          Secondary eclipses of two brown dwarfs in the K2 fields: detection by multiple dataset merging

- **Abstract**
 By using various data sources for the stellar fluxes in overlapping campaign fields and employing full time series modeling, we report the detection of the secondary eclipses of two brown dwarfs (CWW 89Ab = EPIC 219388192b and HSHJ 430b = EPIC 211946007b). The detections yielded timings in agreement with the orbital elements derived from the earlier radial velocity measurements and eclipse depths of 70+/-12 ppm (CWW 89Ab) and 852+/-123 ppm (HSHJ 430b). While the high depth in the Kepler waveband for HSHJ 430b is in agreement with the assumption that the emitted flux comes mostly from the internal heat source and the absorbed stellar irradiation, the case of CWW 89Ab suggests very high albedo, because of the lack of sufficient thermal radiation in the Kepler waveband. Assuming completely reflective dayside hemisphere, without circulation, the maximum value of the eclipse depth due to the reflection of the stellar light is 56 ppm. By making the extreme assumption that the true eclipse depth is 3 sigma less than the observed depth, the minimum geometric albedo becomes ~0.6.

- **Abstract**
 The cosmological principle, which asserts a statistically homogeneous and isotropic universe on large scales, is a foundational assumption of the standard cosmological model. A critical test of this principle involves the kinematic interpretation of the Cosmic Microwave Background temperature dipole, conventionally attributed to our peculiar motion relative to the cosmic rest frame. The Ellis-Baldwin test provides a probe of this kinematic interpretation by searching for a matching Doppler-driven dipole in the number counts of extragalactic radio sources. Recent measurements from the CatWISE2020 quasar catalog have reported a dipole amplitude significantly exceeding the kinematic expectation, with a claimed significance of $4.9\sigma$. We present a comprehensive reassessment of this test using the same dataset, incorporating major sources of uncertainty in the statistical inference. We use a simulation framework based on the FLASK package, incorporating lognormal realizations of the large-scale structure, the quasar clustering bias, the survey's radial selection function, and its exact sky coverage. Our simulations account for the kinematic dipole, the intrinsic clustering dipole, shot noise, and survey geometry effects. The analysis yields a revised significance of the kinematic dipole excess of $3.63\sigma$ in the absence of a clustering dipole, and $3.44\sigma$ in the presence of a randomly oriented clustering dipole. When the clustering dipole is aligned with the kinematic dipole direction, the significance decreases further to $3.27\sigma$. Our analysis demonstrates that although the anomaly is reduced in significance, it cannot be explained solely as a result of the clustering dipole or mode coupling arising from the survey mask.

- **Abstract**
 Taking advantage of the near-infrared calcium triplet lines, we determine metallicities for a sample of more than 3,500 red giant stars in the field of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). We find a median metallicity of [Fe/H]=-1.05$\pm$0.01 dex with a negative metallicity gradient of -0.064$\pm$0.007 dex deg$^{-1}$ between 1.2°~to 6.0°consistent with an outside-in evolution scenario. For the first time, we detect hints of a positive metallicity gradient within 1.2°, likely reflecting radial migration or centralised chemical enrichment. Azimuthal metallicity asymmetries are detected, with flatter gradients in the eastern and southern quadrants and steeper ones in the north and west. They are consistent with tidal interaction effects from the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Finally, in spite of a clear distance and velocity bifurcations in the east, they seem to share a common chemical origin, in agreement with other studies.

- **Abstract**
 Astrochemical models are essential to bridge the gap between the timescales of reactions, experiments, and observations. Ice chemistry in these models experiences a large computational complexity as a result of the many parameters required for the modeling of chemistry occurring on these ices, such as binding energies and reaction energy barriers. Many of these parameters are poorly constrained, and accurately determining all would be too costly. We aim to find out which parameters describing ice chemistry have a large effect on the calculated abundances of ices for different prestellar objects. Using Monte Carlo sampled binding energies, diffusion barriers, desorption and diffusion prefactors, and reaction energy barriers, we determined the sensitivity of the abundances of the main ice species calculated with UCLCHEM, an astrochemical modeling code, on each of these parameters. We do this for a large grid of physical conditions across temperature, density, cosmic ray ionization rate and UV field strength. We find that, regardless of the physical conditions, the main sensitivities of abundances of the main ice species are the diffusion barriers of small and relatively mobile reactive species such as H, N, O, HCO, and CH$_3$. Thus, these parameters should be determined more accurately to increase the accuracy of models, paving the way to a better understanding of observations of ices. In many cases, accurate reaction energy barriers are not essential due to the treatment of competition between reactions and diffusion.

- **Abstract**
 We report near-infrared spectral model fits to seven distant L- and T-type dwarfs observed with the JWST Near Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) as part of the Red Unknowns: Bright Infrared Extragalactic Survey (RUBIES). Comparison of 0.9-2.5 $\mu$m near-infrared spectra of these sources to spectral standards indicates spectral types spanning L1 to T8, and spectrophotometric distances spanning 800-3,000 pc. Fits to three grids of spectral models yield atmosphere parameters and spectrophotometric distances largely consistent with our classifications, although fits to L dwarf spectra indicate missing components to the models. Three of our sources have vertical displacements from the Galactic plane exceeding 1 kpc, and have high probabilities of membership in the Galactic thick disk population. Of these, the L dwarf RUBIES-BD-3 (RUBIES-EGS-3081) is well-matched to subdwarf standards, while the early T dwarf RUBIES-BD-5 (RUBIES-UDS-170428) is best fit by metal-poor atmosphere models; both many be a thick disk or halo brown dwarfs. We critically examine the 1-5 $\mu$m spectra of the current sample of 1-2 kpc mid- and late-T dwarfs, finding that temperature, surface gravity, metallicity, and vertical mixing efficiency can all contribute to observed variations in near-infrared spectral structure and the strength of the 4.2 $\mu$m CO band. This work aims to guide ongoing JWST, Euclid, and other space-based spectral surveys that are expected to uncover thousands of low-temperature stars and brown dwarfs throughout the Milky Way.

- **Abstract**
 We present an analysis of the QUARKS survey sample, focusing on protoclusters where Hot Molecular Cores (HMCs, traced by CH3CN(12--11)) and UC HII regions (traced by H30\alpha/H40\alpha) coexist. Using the high-resolution, high-sensitivity 1.3 mm data from the QUARKS survey, we identify 125 Hot Molecular Fragments (HMFs), which represent the substructures of HMCs at higher resolution. From line integrated intensity maps of CH3CN(12--11) and H30\alpha, we resolve the spatial distribution of HMFs and UC HII regions. By combining with observations of CO outflows and 1.3 mm continuum, we classify HMFs into four types: HMFs associated with jet-like outflow, with wide-angle outflow, with non-detectable outflow, and shell-like HMFs near UC HII regions. This diversity possibly indicates that the hot core could be polymorphic and long-standing phenomenon in the evolution of massive protostars. The separation between HMFs and H30\alpha/H40\alpha emission suggests that sequential high-mass star formation within young protoclusters is not likely related to feedback mechanisms.

- **Abstract**
 Substellar companions such as exoplanets and brown dwarfs exhibit changes in brightness arising from top-of-atmosphere inhomogeneities, providing insights into their atmospheric structure and dynamics. This variability can be measured in the light curves of high-contrast companions from the ground by combining differential spectrophotometric monitoring techniques with high-contrast imaging. However, ground-based observations are sensitive to the effects of turbulence in Earth's atmosphere, and while adaptive optics (AO) systems and bespoke data processing techniques help to mitigate these, residual systematics can limit photometric precision. Here, we inject artificial companions to data obtained with an AO system and a vector Apodizing Phase Plate coronagraph to test the level to which telluric and other systematics contaminate such light curves, and thus how well their known variability signals can be recovered. We find that varying companions are distinguishable from non-varying companions, but that variability amplitudes and periods cannot be accurately recovered when observations cover only a small number of periods. Residual systematics remain above the photon noise in the light curves but have not yet reached a noise floor. We also simulate observations to assess how specific systematic sources, such as non-common path aberrations and AO residuals, can impact aperture photometry as a companion moves through pupil-stabilised data. We show that only the lowest-order aberrations are likely to affect flux measurements, but that thermal background noise is the dominant source of scatter in raw companion photometry. Predictive control and focal-plane wavefront sensing techniques will help to further reduce systematics in data of this type.

- **Abstract**
 Plasma flow measurements in solar active region filaments are rare, particularly in the infrared and ultraviolet ranges that probe the chromosphere and transition region. In addition, previous studies generally focused on prominences and filaments near the solar limb. This study presents a multi-wavelength, multi-instrument analysis of an active region filament observed on the solar disk on November 9 and 10, 2020. Our goal is to characterize the plasma flows in the filament using spectroscopic measurements in both the infrared and ultraviolet spectral ranges. This is important for understanding the mechanisms for filament support, mass loading, and energy balance. Furthermore, this also offers observational benchmarks for filament modeling and simulations. Spectra from the IRIS satellite, including the Mg II k, C II and Si IV lines were analyzed alongside ground-based observations from the GREGOR Infrared Spectrograph and High-resolution Fast Imager instruments whose observed spectral ranges include the chromospheric He I and H{\alpha} lines. Persistent blueshifts were measured within the filament structure in both spectral ranges. These can be interpreted as upflow velocities ranging from 0.5 to 15 km s^-1, with the Si IV showing the highest values. Red shifted emission in the He I and Mg II k3 at the footpoints of a newly formed dark bundle suggest chromospheric downflows, likely due to spatial overlap between an arch filament system close to the filament footpoints. The weak redshifted signal in the Si IV emission may suggest confinement to lower atmospheric layers. The observed velocity patterns provide, for the first time, a comprehensive and coherent view of the plasma dynamics from the chromosphere to the transition region, illustrating that the filament emission is consistently blueshifted in all the spectral windows, and thus in different temperature regimes.

- **Abstract**
 In this work, we seek to characterise a large sample of 14377 main sequence eclipsing binaries in terms of their stellar, asteroseismic, and orbital properties. We conduct manual vetting on a 4000-target subset of our full 14377-target sample to identify targets with pressure or gravity modes. We infer stellar properties including the mass, convective core mass, radius, and central H fraction for the primary using Gaia Data Release 3 effective temperature and luminosity estimates and a grid of asteroseismically calibrated stellar models. We use surface brightness ratio and radius ratio estimates from previous eclipse analysis to study the effect of binarity on our results. Our manual vetting identifies 751 candidate g-mode pulsators, 131 p-mode pulsators, and a further 48 hybrid pulsators. The inferred stellar properties of the hybrid and p-mode pulsators are highly correlated, while the orbital properties of the hybrid pulsators align best with the g-mode pulsators. The g-mode pulsators themselves show a distribution that peaks around the classical g dor instability region but extends continuously towards higher masses, with no detectable divide between the classical g dor and SPB instability regions. There is evidence at the population level for a heightened level of tidal efficiency in stars showing g-mode or hybrid variability. Correcting the primary mass inference for binarity based on eclipse measurements of the surface brightness and radius ratios results in a relatively small shift towards lower masses. This work provides a working initial characterisation of this sample from which more detailed analyses folding in asteroseismic information can be built. It also provides a foundational understanding of the limitations and capabilities of this kind of rapid, scalable analysis that will be highly relevant in planning the exploitation of future large-scale binary surveys.

          Apsidal motion in massive binaries

- **Abstract**
 One of the most efficient and reliable observational technique allowing to probe the internal structure of a star is the determination of the apsidal motion in close eccentric binaries. This secular precession of the binary orbit's major axis depends on the tidal interactions occurring between the two stars. Its rate is directly related to the internal structure of the stars, in particular their inner density profile. Combining radial velocity and light curve data over a long timescale, the apsidal motion rate can be constrained, together with the fundamental parameters of the stars. Confrontation of observational parameters to stellar models then allows us to constrain the internal structure of stars. This powerful technique has been known for years but has been seldom applied to massive stars. I highlight its interest and reveal recent results concerning several massive binaries. While standard stellar models predict stars having a smaller internal stellar structure constant, that is to say, stars having a smaller density contrast, than expected from observations, I demonstrate that the addition of mixing inside the models helps to solve, at least partially, this discrepancy. Studies with the non-perturbative code MoBiDICT showed that the perturbative model assumption is not justified in highly distorted stars, in which cases the apsidal motion is underestimated, exacerbating even more the need for enhanced mixing inside the models. But what happens if the binary is a double-line spectroscopic but non-eclipsing binary? In that case, we indeed have no estimate of the masses and radii of the stars. Surprisingly, the apsidal motion equations combined with the binary' spectroscopic observations allow us to derive the masses of the stars, in a model-dependent way. Rodolfo Barbá contributed to the development of this original method that I bring out.

 Horizontally-periodic Boussinesq Rayleigh-Bénard Convection (RBC) is a simple model system to study the formation of large-scale structures in turbulent convective flows. We performed a suite of 2D numerical simulations of RBC between no-slip boundaries at different Prandtl (Pr) and Rayleigh (Ra) numbers, such that their product is representative of the Sun's upper convection zone. When the fluid viscosity is sufficiently low (Pr $\lesssim 0.1$) and turbulence is strong (Ra $> 10^6$) we find that large structures begin to couple in time and space. For Pr = 0.01 we observe long-lived swaying oscillations of the upflows and downflows, which synchronize over multiple convection cells. This new regime of oscillatory convection may offer an interpretation for the wave-like properties of the dominant scale of convection on the Sun (supergranulation).

- **Abstract**
 The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has discovered over 6700 nearby exoplanets candidates using the transit method through its all-sky survey. Characterizing the kinematic properties and identifying variable stars for the TESS stellar sample is crucial for revealing the correlations between the properties of planetary systems and the properties of stars (e.g., Galactic components, age, chemistry, dynamics, radiation). Based on data from TESS, Gaia DR3, and LAMOST DR10, we present a catalog of kinematic properties (i.e., Galactic positions, velocities, orbits, Galactic components, and kinematic age) as well as other basic stellar parameters for $\sim 660,000$ TESS stars. Our analysis of the kinematic catalog reveals that stars belonging to different Galactic components (i.e., thin disk, thick disk, halo and 12 streams in the disk) display distinctive kinematic and chemical properties. We also find that hot planets with period less then 10 days in the TESS sample favor thin disk stars compared to thick disk stars, consistent with previous studies. Furthermore, using the LAMOST multiple-epoch observations, we identify 41,445 stars exhibiting significant radial velocity variations, among which 7,846 are classified as binary stars. By fitting the radial velocity curves, we further derive orbital parameters (e.g., mass ratio, orbital period and eccentricity) for 297 binaries. The observed decreasing orbital eccentricity with shorting period reveals evidence of tidal circularization. The catalogs constructed in this work have laid a solid foundation for future work on the formation and evolution of stellar and planetary systems in different Galactic environments.

- **Abstract**
 We conducted a detailed spectroscopic and photometric characterization of the planet-hosting wide binary HD 202772A/B. No planet has been detected around HD 202772B, whereas HD 202772A, more evolved than its companion and near the end of its main-sequence (MS) phase, hosts a transiting hot Jupiter. The system has one of the hottest components ($T_{\mathrm{eff}; A} \sim 6440$ K) and one of the largest surface gravity differences between components ($\Delta\log g_{A-B} \sim 0.4$ dex) among MS planet-hosting wide binaries. Using a global fit including our stellar parameters, radial velocities, and new TESS data, we derive refined properties of the planet orbiting HD 202772A, finding it to be the most irradiated hot Jupiter known in a wide binary. We also constrain the presence of additional transiting planets around HD 202772A and new transiting planets around HD 202772B using TESS photometry. We derive high-precision, strictly differential abundances for 27 species based on Gemini-GRACES spectra. HD 202772A shows lower lithium abundance (by 0.45 dex) relative to B, consistent with their stellar parameter differences. We also detect a small but significant enhancement in refractory elements in HD 202772A, particularly those with condensation temperatures above 1400 K (+0.018 $\pm$ 0.004 dex). We explored several scenarios to explain the observed chemical anomalies. Our analysis suggests that rocky planet engulfment, primordial inhomogeneities, and $\delta$ Scuti-related effects are unlikely to fully account for the chemical pattern. Instead, the differences observed in certain refractory elements might support atomic diffusion as the most plausible explanation.

- **Abstract**
 We report the first results from observations of the solar corona by the ASPIICS coronagraph aboard the Proba-3 mission. ASPIICS (Association of Spacecraft for Polarimetric and Imaging Investigation of the Corona of the Sun) is a giant coronagraph consisting of the telescope mounted aboard one of the mission's spacecraft and the external occulter placed on the second spacecraft. The two spacecraft separated by around 144 m fly in a precise formation up to 5.5 hours at a time, which allows coronal observations in eclipse-like conditions, i.e. close to the limb (typically down to 1.099 Rs, occasionally down to 1.05 Rs) and with very low straylight. ASPIICS observes quasi-stationary structures, such as coronal loops, streamers, quiescent prominences, and a variety of dynamic phenomena: erupting prominences, coronal mass ejections, jets, slow solar wind outflows, coronal inflows. In particular, weak, widespread and persistent small-scale outflows and inflows between 1.3 and 3 Rs are observed at a high spatial (5.6 arcsec) and temporal (30 s) resolution for the first time, expanding the range of scales at which the variable slow solar wind is observed to form.

- **Abstract**
 The diffuse emission of gamma-rays and neutrinos, produced by interactions of cosmic rays with interstellar matter in the Milky Way, provides valuable insights into cosmic ray propagation and Galactic processes. Emission models incorporating different assumptions about cosmic ray diffusion, source distribution, and target gas density are tested using data from neutrino telescopes. In this study, the final all-flavor neutrino dataset, collected over 15 years (2007--2022) by the ANTARES neutrino telescope, is analyzed. A maximum likelihood ratio method built to handle templates of Galactic emission models is employed to evaluate the compatibility of these models with the observed spatial and energy distributions of neutrino events. The results do not yield stringent constraints on the tested models and upper limits on the diffuse neutrino flux are derived, which are compatible with the results obtained by other experiments.

- **Abstract**
 Over 20 exocometary belts host detectable circumstellar gas, mostly in the form of CO. Two competing theories for its origin have emerged, positing the gas to be primordial or secondary. Primordial gas survives from the belt's parent protoplanetary disk and is therefore H$_2$-rich. Secondary gas is outgassed \textit{in-situ} by exocomets and is relatively H$_2$-poor. Discriminating between these scenarios has not been possible for belts hosting unexpectedly large quantities of CO. We aim to break this gas origin dichotomy \textit{via} direct measurement of H$_2$ column densities in two edge-on CO-rich exocometary belts around $\sim$15 Myr-old A-type stars, constraining the $\frac{\text{CO}}{\text{H}_2}$ ratio and CO gas lifetimes. Observing edge-on belts enables rovibrational absorption spectroscopy against the stellar background. We present near-IR CRIRES+ spectra of HD 110058 and HD 131488 which provide the first direct probe of H$_2$ gas in CO-rich exocometary belts. We target the H$_2$ (v=1-0 S(0)) line at 2223.3 nm and and the $^{12}$CO $v=2\rightarrow0$ rovibrational lines in the range 2333.8-2335.5 nm and derive constraints on column densities along the line-of-sight to the stars. We strongly detect $^{12}$CO but not H$_2$ in the CRIRES+ spectra. This allows us to place $3\sigma$ lower limits on the $\frac{\text{CO}}{\text{H}_2}$ ratios of $> 1.35 \times 10^{-3}$ and $> 3.09 \times 10^{-5}$ for HD 110058 and HD 131488 respectively. These constraints demonstrate that at least for HD 110058, the exocometary gas is compositionally distinct and significantly H$_2$-poor, compared to the $<10^{-4}$ $\frac{\text{CO}}{\text{H}_2}$ ratios typical of protoplanetary disks. We also find H$_2$ alone is unlikely to shield CO over the lifetime of the systems. Overall this suggests that the gas in CO-rich belts is most likely not primordial in origin, supporting the presence of exocometary gas.

- **Abstract**
 We present near-infrared scattered-light observations of the disks around two stars of the Corona Australis star-forming region, V721 CrA, and BN CrA, obtained with VLT/SPHERE, in the H band, as part of the DESTINYS large programme. Our objective is to analyse the morphology of these disks, and highlight their main properties. We adopt an analytical axisymmetric disk model to fit the observations and perform a regression on key disk parameters, namely the dust mass, the height profile, and the inclination. We use RADMC-3D code to produce synthetic observations of the analytical models, with full polarised scattering treatment. Both stars show resolved and extended disks with substructures in the near-IR. The disk of V721 CrA is vertically thicker, radially smaller (120 au), and brighter than BN CrA (190 au). It also shows spiral arms in the inner regions. The disk of BN CrA shows a dark circular lane, which could be either an intrinsic dust gap or a self-cast shadow, and a brightness enhancement along the disk minor axis. Both disks are compatible with the evolutionary stage of their parent subgroup within the CrA region: V721 CrA belongs to the "on-cloud" part of CrA, which is dustier, denser and younger, whereas BN CrA is found on the outskirts of the older "off-cloud" group.

- **Abstract**
 Core-collapse supernovae, occurring at the end of massive star evolution, produce heavy elements, including those in the iron peak. Although the explosion mechanism is not yet fully understood, theoretical models can reproduce optical observations and observed elemental abundances. However, many nuclear reaction rates involved in explosive nucleosynthesis have large uncertainties, impacting the reliability of abundance predictions. To address this, we have previously developed a Monte Carlo-based nucleosynthesis code that accounts for reaction rate uncertainties and has been applied to nucleosynthesis processes beyond iron. Our framework is also well suited for studying explosive nucleosynthesis in supernovae. In this paper, we investigate 1D explosion models using the "PUSH method", focusing on progenitors with varying metallicities and initial masses around $M_\mathrm{ZAMS} = 16 M_{\odot}$. Detailed post-process nucleosynthesis calculations and Monte Carlo analyses are used to explore the effects of reaction rate uncertainties and to identify key reaction rates in explosive nucleosynthesis. We find that many reactions have little impact on the production of iron-group nuclei, as these elements are primarily synthesized in the nuclear statistical equilibrium. However, we identify a few "key reactions" that significantly influence the production of radioactive nuclei, which may affect astrophysical observables. In particular, for the production of ${}^{44}$Ti, we confirm that several traditionally studied nuclear reactions have a strong impact. However, determining a single reaction rate is insufficient to draw a definitive conclusion.

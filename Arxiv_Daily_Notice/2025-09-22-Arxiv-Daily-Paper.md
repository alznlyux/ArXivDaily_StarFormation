          Cold and fuzzy dark sector

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce the Fuzzy Dark Sector (FDS) scenario as a rich, interacting system and candidate for dark matter. This serves as a natural extension of the single-component, non-interacting Fuzzy Dark Matter (FDM) paradigm. Concretely, we consider an ultra-light Abelian-Higgs model, with interacting Higgs and dark photon degrees of freedom. We find that the transfer function, and hence imprint on the CMB and Large-Scale Structure (LSS), is characterized by a single characteristic scale of the interacting fuzzy dark sector, allowing us to recover the LSS signature of single-field FDM, dependent on the FDS parameters. In contrast, galactic halos present a great diversity, unlike with the universality of single-field FDM, owing to the interaction between fields. This interaction introduces an instability that is not otherwise present for the case of four decoupled scalars. Finally, we comment on primordial production and portals to the Standard Model, and introduce another simple realization of the Fuzzy Dark Sector paradigm with a kinetic coupling.

          The Importance of Standardizing Spectra in the Era of Large Spectroscopic Surveys: A Case Study of M Dwarfs in SDSS-V

 - **Abstract**
 SDSS-V will obtain 100,000s of medium-resolution, optical spectra of M dwarfs with the BOSS instrument. M dwarfs have complex atmospheres, and their spectra contain many wide and dense, overlapping molecular features, so determining accurate stellar parameters by fitting models has been difficult. To circumvent this, other surveys have employed machine learning methods to transfer measurements of stellar parameters from high-resolution spectra to their medium-resolution counterparts. These methods provide large catalogs of stellar parameters but, if not addressed properly, are plagued by biases which are, in part, due to the normalization of the spectra. Typical spectral normalization removes the continuum but preserves the relative depths of the absorption features, but optical M dwarf spectra are almost entirely made up of molecular absorption, which makes this difficult. Here, we develop a standardization method that instead defines a pseudo-continuum. We use the spectrum's alpha shape to find the points which lie between the absorption features and apply local polynomial regression to find this pseudo-continuum. To tune the hyperparameters of this method, we create BOSS-like spectra from BT-NextGen models to replicate instrumental, signal-to-noise, and reddening effects. We find that in both this generated set and a validation set of the SDSS-V data, our method performs better than alternative standardizations by producing spectra that are both more uniform for M dwarfs with similar stellar parameters and more easily distinguished compared to M dwarfs of differing parameters. These results from our method will be crucial for better determining stellar parameters of M dwarfs using generative models.

 - **Abstract**
 Young planets with mass measurements are particularly valuable in studying atmospheric mass-loss processes, but these planets are rare and their masses difficult to measure due to stellar activity. We report the discovery of a planetary system around TOI-6109, a young, 75 Myr-old Sun-like star in the Alpha Persei cluster. It hosts at least two transiting Neptune-like planets. Using three TESS sectors, 30 CHEOPS orbits, and photometric follow-up observations from the ground, we confirm the signals of the two planets. TOI-6109 b has an orbital period of P=$5.6904^{+0.0004}_{-0.0004}$ days and a radius of R=$4.87^{+0.16}_{-0.12}$ R$_\oplus$. The outer planet, TOI-6109 c has an orbital period of P=$8.5388^{+0.0006}_{-0.0005}$ days and a radius of R=$4.83^{+0.07}_{-0.06}$ R$_\oplus$. These planets orbit just outside a 3:2 mean motion resonance. The near-resonant configuration presents the opportunity to measure the planet's mass via TTV measurements and to bypass difficult RV measurements. Measuring the masses of the planets in this system will allow us to test theoretical models of atmospheric mass loss.

          Dynamical Analysis of the HD 169142 Planet-Forming Disk: Twelve Years of High-Contrast Polarimetry

 - **Abstract**
 We present a dynamical analysis of the HD 169142 planet-forming disk based on high-contrast polarimetric imaging over a twelve-year observational period, offering insights into its disk evolution and planet-disk interactions. This study explores the evolution of scattered-light features and their relationship with millimeter continuum emission. Archival visible-to-near-infrared scattered-light observations from NACO, SPHERE, and GPI combined with new observations from SCExAO reveal persistent non-axisymmetric structures in both the inner and outer rings of the disk. Through Keplerian image transformations and phase cross-correlation techniques, we show that the azimuthal brightness variations in the inner ring follow the local Keplerian velocity, suggesting these are intrinsic disk features rather than planet-induced spirals or shadows. The motion of the outer ring is weakly detected, requiring a longer observational baseline for further confirmation. Comparing scattered-light features with ALMA 1.3 mm-continuum data, we find that the scattered light traces the edges of dust structures in the inner ring, indicating complex interactions and a leaky dust trap around the water-ice snowline. These findings highlight the capability of long-term monitoring of circumstellar disks to distinguish planetary influences from Keplerian disk dynamics.

          VVV-WIT-13: an eruptive young star with cool molecular features

 - **Abstract**
 Here we investigate an infrared eruptive source, identified from the decade-long VISTA Variables in the Via Lactea survey (VVV). We named this target after a group of variable sources discovered by VVV, as VVV-WIT-13, with WIT standing for "What Is This?", due to its unique photometric variation behaviour and the mysterious origin of the outburst. This target exhibited an outburst with a 5.7 mag amplitude in the Ks-band, remained on its brightness plateau for 3.5 years, and then rapidly faded to its pre-eruptive brightness afterwards. We aim to reveal the variable nature and outburst origin of VVV-WIT-13 by presenting our follow-up photometric and spectroscopic observations along with theoretical models. We gathered photometric time series in both near- and mid-infrared wavelengths. We obtained near-infrared spectra during the outburst and decaying stages on XSHOOTER/VLT and FIRE/Magellan, and then fitted the detected molecular absorption features using models from ExoMol. We applied 2D numerical simulations to re-create the observables of the eruptive phenomenon. We observe deep AlO absorption bands in the infrared spectra of VVV-WIT-13, during the outburst stage, along with other more common absorption bands (e.g. CO). Our best-fit model suggests a 600 K temperature of the AlO absorption band. In the decaying stage, the AlO bands disappeared, whilst broad blue-shifted H2 lines arose, a common indicator of stellar wind and outflow. The observational evidence suggests that the CO and TiO features originate from an outflow or a wind environment. We find that VVV-WIT-13 is an eruptive young star with instability occurring in the accretion disk. One favoured theoretical explanation of this event is a disrupted gas clump at a distance of 3 au from the source. If confirmed, this would be the first such event observed in real time.

          Abundance anomalies in low mass field mergers as evidence of a merger origin for the second generation stars in globular clusters

 - **Abstract**
 The canonical formation of second-generation (G2) stars in globular clusters (GCs) from gas enriched and ejected by G1 (primordial) polluters faces substantial challenges, i.e. (i) a mass-budget problem and (ii) uncertainty in the source(s) of the abundance anomaly of light elements (AALE) in G2 stars. The merger of G1 low-mass main-sequence (MS) binaries can overcome (i), but its ability to result in AALE is omitted. We provide evidence of the merger process to explain AALE by relying on highly probable merger remnants in the Galactic disk. We focus on carbon-deficient red-clump giants with low mass of 1.0 M_{\sun} < M $\lesssim$ 2.0 M_{\sun} and hot He-intermediate subdwarfs of supersolar metallicity, both manifesting G2-like AALE incompatible with GC origin. The origin of such rare core He-burning stars as the mergers of [MS star (MSS)]+[helium white dwarf (HeWD)] binaries, evolved from low-mass high-mass ratio (MSS+MSS) ones, is supported by models evolving to either horizontal branch (HB) stars or He subdwarfs via the red giant branch (RGB). Such binaries in the GC NGC 362 contain very young ($\sim$ 4 Myr) extremely low-mass HeWDs, in contrast to much older ($\sim 100$ times) counterparts in open clusters. This agrees with the impact of GC environment on the lifetime of hard binaries: (MSS+HeWD) systems merge there soon after arising from (MSS+MSS) binaries that underwent the common-envelope stage of evolution. From the number and lifetime of the (MSS+HeWD) binaries uncovered in NGC 362, the expected fraction of their progeny RGB G2 stars is estimated to be $\lesssim$10\%. The field merger remnants with G2-like AALE support the merger nature of at least a fraction of G2 stars in GCs. The specific channel [(MSS+MSS) - (MSS+HeWD) - merger product] supported by observations and models is tentatively identified as the channel of formation of the extreme G2 RGB component in GCs.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we solved the scalar and tensor perturbation equations numerically and using the improved uniform approximation method together with the third-order phase-integral method, for the $\alpha$-attractor inflationary model. This inflationary model has become very important because it allows us to describe the initial accelerated expansion of the universe in the inflationary epoch, and the current accelerated expansion with the same potential that depends on one scalar field $\varphi$. Once the equations for the scalar and tensor power spectra are found, we calculate the observables: the scalar-to-tensor ratio $r$, and the scalar spectral index $n_S$, concluding that semiclassical methods give excellent results compared to numerical integration. We also compare both observables in the $\alpha$-attractor and the Starobinsky inflationary model.

          Sensitivity of seasonal variations of the muon energy spectrum in air showers to hadronic interaction models and the cosmic-ray mass composition

 - **Abstract**
 The energy spectrum of muons produced in air showers depends not only on the properties of the primary particle, but also on the atmosphere. This is because of the competition between decay and interaction of the parent mesons, which depends on the atmospheric density. As a result, the number of muons at ground shows a seasonal variation, with the strength of the variation depending on the primary cosmic-ray energy, mass, as well as the energy of the detected muons. In this contribution, we study the variations of the muon energy spectrum in air showers using MCEq, a numerical solver of the cascade equations. In particular, we show how the amplitude of the seasonal variations of the number of high-energy (O(TeV)) muons in the shower depends on the primary energy, mass, as well as the assumed hadronic interaction model. A measurement of these variations is possible with the combination of a surface air-shower array and a deep underground detector, which provide a simultaneous measurement of the primary energy and the high-energy muon multiplicity, and may provide a new way to probe the cosmic-ray mass composition and hadronic interactions.

 - **Abstract**
 The Hybrid Elevated Radio Observatory for Neutrinos (HERON) is designed to target the astrophysical flux of Earth-skimming tau neutrinos at 100 PeV. HERON consists of multiple compact, phased radio arrays embedded within a larger sparse array of antennas, located on the side of a mountain. This hybrid design provides both excellent sensitivity and a sub-degree pointing resolution. To design HERON, a suite of simulations accounting for tau propagation, shower development, radio emission, and antenna response were used. These simulations were used to discover the array layout which provides maximum sensitivity at 100 PeV, as well to select the optimal antenna design. Additionally, the event reconstruction accuracy has been tested for various designs of the sparse array via simulated interferometry. Here, we present the HERON simulation procedure and its results.

 - **Abstract**
 The standard $\Lambda$CDM paradigm of the physical Universe suffers from well-known conceptual problems and is challenged by observational data. Alternative models exist in the literature, both phenomenological and physically motivated, many of them suffering from similar or new problems. We propose a method to mechanically generate alternative models in a procedure informed by data and tuned to mitigate specific problems. We implement a computational framework, dubbed CosmoGen, that integrates evolutionary algorithms for symbolic regression, with computation of structure formation and background cosmological quantities that are used to guide the evolutionary process. As a proof-of-concept we apply the procedure to the specific case of dark energy fluid models, and ask the framework to generate models capable of alleviating the cosmological tensions $S_8$ and $H_0$. The system generates models with high fitness values, and through a Bayesian analysis of an illustrative model, we show that the model indeed alleviates the tensions.

 - **Abstract**
 $\nu$SpaceSim is a highly-efficient (e.g., fast) module-based, end-to-end simulation package that models the physical processes of cosmic neutrino interactions that leads to detectable signals for sub-orbital and space-based instruments. Starting with an input flux of neutrinos incident on a user-specified geometry in the Earth, the flux of Earth-emergent leptons are calculated followed by their subsequent extensive air showers (EAS). Next, the EAS optical Cherenkov and radio emission, signal attenuation to the detector, and the detector response are modeled to determine the sensitivity to both the diffuse cosmic neutrinos and transient neutrino sources. Using the Earth as a tau neutrino target and the atmosphere as the signal generator effectively forms a detector with a mega-gigaton mass. Furthermore, \taon decays and neutrino neutral-current interactions within the Earth (re)generates a flux of lower energy tau neutrinos that can also interact in the Earth thus enhancing the detection probability. $\nu$SpaceSim provides a tool to both understand the data from recent experiments such as EUSO-SPB2 as well as design/understand the performance the next generation of balloon- and space-based experiments, including POEMMA Balloon with Radio (PBR) and the Payload for Ultrahigh Energy Observations (PUEO). In this paper the $\nu$SpaceSim software, physics modeling, and the cosmic neutrino measurement capabilities of example sub-orbital and space-based experimental configurations are presented as well as status of planned modeling upgrades.

          DiskMINT: Self-Consistent Thermochemical Disk Models with Radially Varying Gas and Dust -- Application to the Massive, CO-Rich Disk of IM Lup

 - **Abstract**
 Disks around young stars are the birthplaces of planets, and the spatial distribution of their gas and dust masses is critical for understanding where and what types of planets can form. We present self-consistent thermochemical disk models built with DiskMINT, which extends its initial framework to allow for spatially decoupled gas and dust distributions. DiskMINT calculates the gas temperature based on thermal equilibrium with dust grains, solves vertical gas hydrostatic equilibrium, and includes key processes for the CO chemistry, specifically selective photodissociation, and freeze-out with conversion CO/CO$_2$ ice. We apply DiskMINT to study the IM Lup disk, a large massive disk, yet with an inferred CO depletion of up to 100 based on earlier thermochemical models. By fitting the multi-wavelength SED along with the millimeter continuum, ${\rm C^{18}O}$ radial emission profiles, we find $0.02-0.08\,{\rm M_\odot}$ for the gas disk mass, which are consistent with the dynamical-based mass within the uncertainties. We further compare the derived surface densities for dust and gas and find that the outer disk is drift-dominated, with a dust-to-gas mass ratio of approximately 0.01-0.02, which is likely insufficient to meet the conditions for the streaming instability to occur. Our results suggest that when interpreted with self-consistent thermochemical models, ${\rm C^{18}O}$ alone can serve as a reliable tracer of both the total gas mass and its radial distribution. This approach enables gas mass estimates in lower-mass disks, where dynamical constraints are not available, and in fainter systems where rare species like ${\rm N_2H^+}$ are too weak to detect.

 We present the end-to-end data reduction pipeline for SCALES (Slicer Combined with Array of Lenslets for Exoplanet Spectroscopy), the upcoming thermal-infrared, diffraction-limited imager, and low and medium-resolution integral field spectrograph (IFS) for the Keck II telescope. The pipeline constructs a ramp from a set of reads and performs optimal extraction and chi-square extraction to reconstruct the 3D IFS datacube. To perform spectral extraction, wavelength calibration, and sky subtraction, the pipeline utilizes rectification matrices produced using position-dependent lenslet point spread functions (PSFs) derived from calibration exposures. The extracted 3D data cubes provide intensity values along with their corresponding uncertainties for each spatial and spectral measurement. The SCALES pipeline is under active development, implemented in Python within the Keck data reduction framework, and is openly available on GitHub along with dedicated documentation.

          Understanding post-RGB binaries through stable mass transfer

 - **Abstract**
 Post-RGB and post-AGB binaries consist of a primary star that has recently evolved off either the RGB or AGB after losing most of its envelope, and a main-sequence companion. They are distinguished by luminosities below and above the RGB tip, respectively. These systems host a stable, dusty circumbinary disc, characterised by a near-infrared excess. Observed Galactic post-AGB and post-RGB binaries have orbital periods and eccentricities inconsistent with binary population synthesis models. Here, we focus on post-RGB binaries, testing whether stable mass transfer can explain their orbital periods by comparing models with the known sample of 38 Galactic post-RGB binaries. We systematically determined luminosities of Galactic post-RGB and post-AGB binaries through SED fitting. We computed evolution models for low- and intermediate-mass binaries with RGB donors at two metallicities using MESA. We selected stable mass transfer models producing primaries with effective temperatures within the observed range. From these models, we find that low-mass post-RGB binaries should follow strict luminosity-orbital period relations. The Galactic post-RGB binaries seem consistent with these relations if their orbits remained eccentric during mass transfer and if the donor filled its Roche lobe at periastron. However, our models are unable to explain the eccentricities themselves. Moreover, post-mass-transfer ages from our models are much longer than predicted dissipation timescales of circumbinary discs. Stable mass transfer seems to explain the orbital periods of Galactic post-RGB binaries. This formation channel can be tested further by obtaining orbits of additional Galactic systems and Magellanic Cloud candidates via long-term radial velocity monitoring. Gaia DR 4 will improve luminosities of Galactic post-RGB binaries, enabling more accurate comparison with luminosity-orbital period relations.

 - **Abstract**
 IGR J17511-3057 was observed in a new outburst phase starting in February 2025 and lasting at least nine days. We investigated the spectral and temporal properties of IGR J17511-3057, aiming to characterise its current status and highlight possible long-term evolution of its properties. We analysed the available NICER and NuSTAR observations performed during the latest outburst of the source. We updated the ephemerides of the neutron star and compared them to previous outbursts to investigate its long-term evolution. We also performed spectral analysis of the broadband energy spectrum in different outburst phases, and investigated the time-resolved spectrum of the type-I X-ray burst event observed with NuSTAR. We detected X-ray pulsations at a frequency of around 245 Hz. The long-term evolution of the neutron star ephemerides suggests a spin-down derivative of about -2.3e-15 Hz/s, compatible with a rotation-powered phase while in quiescence. Moreover, the evolution of the orbital period and the time of the ascending node suggests a fast orbital shrinkage, which challenges the standard evolution scenario for this class of pulsars involving angular momentum loss via gravitational wave emission. The spectral analysis revealed a dominant power-law-like Comptonisation component, along with a thermal blackbody component, consistent with a hard state. Weak broad emission residuals around 6.6 keV suggest the presence of a K-alpha transition of neutral or He-like Fe originating from the inner region of the accretion disc. Self-consistent reflection models confirmed a moderate ionisation of the disc truncated at around (82-370) km from the neutron star. Finally, the study of the type-I X-ray burst revealed no signature of photospheric radius expansion. We found marginally significant burst oscillations during the rise and decay of the event, consistent with the neutron star spin frequency.

 - **Abstract**
 In 2018, the first prototype of the optical calibration system was installed in the Large Sized Telescopes, LST-1 at the Observatorio del Roque de los Muchachos, ORM, in La Palma, Canary Islands. We have almost completed the construction of the three remaining ones that will be mounted by 2026 on LST-2-3-4. The main feature of this system is to ensure a stable and constant photon flux over time with the characteristics of a signal produced by Cherenkov light when a high-energy gamma ray crosses the atmosphere. Test results that show the performance of the optical calibration system have been recently published. In this article, we present in detail the system used to monitor the photon flux.

 - **Abstract**
 We derive models of rotating very massive stellar cores with mass $\approx 10^2$--$10^4M_\odot$ which are marginally stable to the pair-unstable collapse, assuming that the core is isentropic and composed primarily of oxygen. It is shown that the cores with mass $\lesssim 10^3M_\odot$ can form a massive disk with the mass more than 10% of the core mass around the formed black hole if the core is rotating with more than 30% of the Keplerian limit. We also indicate that the formation of rapidly spinning massive black holes such as the black holes of GW231123 naturally accompanies the massive disk formation. By using the result of our previous study which showed that the massive disk is unstable to the non-axisymmetric deformation, we predict the amplitude and frequency of gravitational waves and show that the collapse of rotating very massive stellar cores can be a promising source of gravitational waves for Einstein Telescope. The detection of such gravitational waves will provide us with important information about a formation process of intermediate mass black holes.

 - **Abstract**
 Compact objects evolving in an astrophysical environment experience a gravitational drag force known as dynamical friction. We present a multipole-frequency decomposition to evaluate the orbit-averaged energy and angular momentum dissipation experienced by a point mass on periodic orbits within a homogeneous, fluid-like background. Our focus is on eccentric Keplerian trajectories. Although our approach is currently restricted to linear response theory, it is fully consistent within that framework. We validate our theoretical expressions for the specific case of an ideal fluid, using semi-numerical simulations of the linear response acoustic wake. We demonstrate that, for a finite time perturbation switched on at t=0, a steady dissipation state is reached after a time bounded by twice the sound crossing time of the apocentre distance. We apply our results to model the secular evolution of compact eccentric binaries in a gaseous medium, assuming low-density conditions where the orbital elements evolve adiabatically. For unequal-mass systems with moderate initial eccentricity, the late-time eccentricity growth is significantly delayed compared to the equal-mass case, due to the binary components becoming transonic at different times along their orbital trajectory. Our approach offers a computationally efficient alternative to full simulations of the linear response wake.

 The Southern Hemisphere Asteroid Research Project is an active and informal entity comprising the University of New South Wales, the University of Tasmania, the University of Western Australia, and the Curtin University, which performs asteroid research in collaboration with federal agencies, including the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (JPL). Since 2015, we have used the Australian infrastructure to characterize more than 50 near-Earth asteroids through bistatic radar observations. On 29 June 2024, we used four very long baseline interferometer (VLBI) radio telescopes to follow the close approach of 2024 MK to the Earth. In this paper, we describe the detections and the analysis of VLBI and howthese observations can help to improve the understanding of its composition and orbit characterization.

 - **Abstract**
 Migration of giant planets remains a complex topic. While significant progress has been made for high-viscosity disks, the migration of planets with large planet-star mass ratios in low-viscosity environments is still not fully understood. We study the migration of such planets in disks with $\alpha = 10^{-4}$ and derive analytical prescriptions applicable across stellar masses, from Sun-like stars to M dwarfs. Using hydrodynamical simulations with FARGO3D, we explored planets with mass ratios $10^{-3} < q < 2 \times 10^{-2}$ under different disk conditions, varying gas surface density, scale height, and density slope. Our results show a migration reversal at $ q \approx 0.002$, with outward migration for $ q > 0.002$. For planets undergoing outward migration, the migration speed depends on the unperturbed local gas density. In most cases, outward migration is sustained by a positive torque related to planetary eccentricities below $ e < 0.2$. However, for certain disk parameters, planets with $ q > 0.01$ reach higher eccentricities ($0.2 < e < 0.45$), leading to stalled migration. Our findings suggest that outward migration is a viable mechanism for massive planets in low-viscosity disks, which has implications for the formation and distribution of super-Jupiter planets around Sun-like stars and planets more massive than Neptune around very low-mass stars. Given the challenges in detecting such planets, improving our theoretical understanding of their migration is essential for interpreting exoplanet demographics and guiding future observational efforts.

 - **Abstract**
 The distribution of close-in exoplanets is shaped by the interplay between atmospheric and dynamical processes. The Neptunian Desert, Ridge, and Savanna illustrate the sensitivity of these worlds to such processes, making them ideal to disentangle their roles. Determining how many Neptunes were brought close-in by early disk-driven migration (DDM; maintaining primordial spin-orbit alignment) or late high-eccentricity migration (HEM; generating large misalignments) is essential to understand how much atmosphere they lost. We propose a unified view of the Neptunian landscape to guide its exploration, speculating that the Ridge is a hot spot for evolutionary processes. Low-density Neptunes would mainly undergo DDM, getting fully eroded at shorter periods than the Ridge, while denser Neptunes would be brought to the Ridge and Desert by HEM. We embark on this exploration via ATREIDES, which relies on spectroscopy and photometry of 60 close-in Neptunes, their reduction with robust pipelines, and their interpretation through internal structure, atmospheric, and evolutionary models. We carried out a systematic RM census with VLT/ESPRESSO to measure the distribution of 3D spin-orbit angles, correlate its shape with system properties and thus relate the fraction of aligned-misaligned systems to DDM, HEM, and atmospheric erosion. Our first target, TOI-421c, lies in the Savanna with a neighboring sub-Neptune TOI-421b. We measured their 3D spin-orbit angles (Psib = 57+11-15 deg; Psic = 44.9+4.4-4.1 deg). Together with the eccentricity and possibly large mutual inclination of their orbits, this hints at a chaotic dynamical origin that could result from DDM followed by HEM. ATREIDES will provide the community with a wealth of constraints for formation and evolution models. We welcome collaborations that will contribute to pushing our understanding of the Neptunian landscape forward.

 - **Abstract**
 CORSIKA 8 is a modern, flexible framework for simulating particle cascades in air and dense media, allowing for fully customizable shower simulations. The radio module autonomously handles electric field calculations and propagation to observer locations. It supports simultaneous simulations with both the ``Endpoint formalism'' as implemented in CoREAS and the ``ZHS'' algorithm from ZHAireS. In this contribution, we validate the radio module by comparing air-shower simulations in CORSIKA 8, CORSIKA 7, and ZHAireS. We investigate the impact of simulation parameters, such as the step size of particle tracks, on the resulting radio signals and perform a detailed comparison of the ``Endpoints'' and ``ZHS'' formalisms. For the same underlying showers simulated with CORSIKA 8 with optimized step sizes, both formalisms converge to the same radiation energy within 2%. For CORSIKA 8 and CORSIKA 7, agreement on the radiation energy is better than 10% in the 30-80 MHz band and improves to better than 2% for 50-350 MHz. This consistency provides further confirmation of the accuracy of microscopic air-shower radio emission simulations which is crucial for precise energy scale estimations using radio detection.

 We propose a gravitational wave detector based on ultrastable optical cavities enabling the detection of gravitational wave signals in the mostly unexplored $10^{-5}-1$ Hz frequency band. We illustrate the working principle of the detector and discuss that several classes of gravitational wave sources, both of astrophysical and cosmological origin, may be within the detection range of this instrument. Our work suggests that terrestrial gravitational wave detection in the milli-Hz frequency range is potentially within reach with current technology.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the first detection of gamma-ray emission from the Galactic center in the 150-600 keV band using a linear, imaging-spectroscopy approach used in common telescopes with an electron-tracking Compton camera (ETCC) aboard the SMILE-2+ balloon experiment. A one-day flight over Australia resulted in a significant gamma-ray detection in the light curve and revealed a $7.9\sigma$ excess in the image map from the Galactic center region. These results, obtained through a simple and unambiguous analysis, demonstrate the high reliability and sensitivity of the ETCC and establish its potential for future high-precision MeV gamma-ray observations. The measured intensity and spatial distribution were tested against three emission models: a single point-like source, a multi-component structure, and a symmetric two-dimensional Gaussian. All models were found to be statistically consistent with the data. The positronium-related flux in the multi-component model is $(3.2~\pm~1.4)~\times~10^{-2}$ photons cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$, which is approximately a factor of two higher than the value reported by INTEGRAL, with a discrepancy at the $2\sigma$ level. This difference may arise from unresolved sources or truly diffuse emission, such as exotic processes involving light dark matter or primordial black holes.

 - **Abstract**
 In its Phase I, the Pierre Auger Observatory has led to several observations, driving the field of ultra-high-energy cosmic ray (UHECR) research over the last 20 years. Major achievements obtained so far include the unprecedented precise energy spectrum and its features, the observables linked to the UHECR mass composition and the distribution of arrival directions of the most energetic events. These results, together with the non-observation of high-energy neutrinos and photons, strongly disfavor the pre-Auger pure-proton paradigm. In this talk, we will provide an overview on the main results of the Observatory, and describe possible astrophysical scenarios for their interpretation. The prospects of improving the current understanding about UHECR characteristics during the Phase II of the Observatory will be also shown.

 - **Abstract**
 We present results from the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) follow-up observations of Gamma-ray Bursts (GRBs) between 2004 and 2019. We are focusing on non-detections and providing the most extensive set of very-high-energy (VHE, >100 GeV) upper limits to date. We use this catalogue to constrain the properties of VHE-detected GRBs and compare them to those detected at VHE. Our study finds that VHE-detected GRBs are not a distinct population but are instead associated with bright X-ray afterglows and low redshifts. In addition, we model the multi-wavelength emission of a few of the observed GRBs and discuss the results in the context of their obtained microphysical parameters. The results from this work help put current VHE observations into perspective and highlight the capabilities of next-generation instruments, in detecting fainter and more distant GRBs at VHE.

 - **Abstract**
 We present $100$ full-sky quasar spectrophotometric mock catalogs with smooth redshift evolution from $z=0$ to $z\sim 4$, tailored to analyze the Gaia-unWISE Quasar Catalog (Quaia). In particular, we apply a novel hierarchical nonlocal nonlinear bias scheme (Hicobian) to dark matter fields generated through Augmented Lagrangian Perturbation Theory on the lightcone (WebON code), calibrating the free parameters of the bias model on Abacus quasar HOD mock catalogs tuned to reproduce DESI Early Data Release observations in real and redshift space. After having obtained such accurate spectroscopic catalogs, we inject in the mocks the observational effects characterizing the Quaia catalog: (i) spectrophotometric redshift uncertainties, (ii) the angular selection function, and (iii) the redshift number counts distribution. We assess the accuracy of our catalogs by validating a number of summary statistics: the full-sky QSO maps, the redshift uncertainty distributions as a function of redshift, the redshift $n(z)$ distribution, the angular power spectra and their normalized covariance matrices, and the angular two-point correlation functions. We find excellent agreement between these metrics from the mocks and from the Quaia catalog. We publicly release the mock catalogs to the community.

 - **Abstract**
 I present ExoIris, a user-friendly Python package for exoplanet transmission and emission spectroscopy. Unlike existing tools, ExoIris models two-dimensional spectrophotometric transit time series directly and supports the joint analysis of multiple datasets obtained with different instruments and at different epochs. These features enable a self-consistent estimation of both wavelength-independent and wavelength-dependent parameters. They offer a more robust workflow compared to the commonly used two-step approach, where a "white" light curve is fitted first and the transmission spectrum is then derived from independent fits constrained by the white-light solution. Despite its increased flexibility and robustness, ExoIris remains computationally efficient. A low-resolution transmission spectrum can be estimated from a single JWST NIRISS transit observation in ~5 minutes assuming white noise, and in ~15 minutes when accounting for time-correlated systematics using a Gaussian process noise model, on a standard desktop computer.

 - **Abstract**
 The discovery of a significant number of rapidly rotating low mass stars showing no or few flares in TESS observations was a surprise as rapid rotation has previously been taken as implying high stellar activity. Here we present TESS and HiPERCAM $u_{s}g_{s}r_{s}i_{s}z_{s}$ observations of one of these stars LP 89--187 which has a rotation period of 0.117 d. TESS data covering three sectors (64.6 d) only show three flares which have energies a few $\times10^{33}$ erg, whilst HiPERCAM observations, which cover 0.78 of the rotation period, show no evidence for flares more energetic than $\sim10^{31}$ erg. Intriguingly, other surveys show LP 89--187 has shown weak H$\alpha$ in emission. We compare the flare energy distribution of LP 89--187 with low mass stars in the $\beta$ Pic moving group, which have an age of $\sim$24 Myr. We find LP 89--187 has a lower flare rate than the $\beta$ Pic stars. In addition, we find that TRAPPIST-1 analogue stars, which are likely significantly older than the $\beta$ Pic stars, show fewer flares with energies $>10^{33}$ erg in TESS data. We examine the relationship between amplitude and period for a sample of low mass stars and find that more rapid rotators have a higher amplitude.

          The Thousand-Pulsar-Array programme on MeerKAT -- XVIII. Complex sub-pulse modulation patterns, bi-drifting and mode changing of nine radio pulsars

 - **Abstract**
 We present a detailed analysis of sub-pulse modulations in nine pulsars which show evidence of changes in sub-pulse drift direction as a function of pulse longitude in the Thousand Pulsar Array single pulse survey with MeerKAT. We confirm that all of these are consistent with persistent drift direction changes. These 'bi-drifting' pulsars present a challenge to the classical carousel model for sub-pulse drifting. In general, bi-drifting in this expanded sample is less clear than some of the previously published cases, which we attribute to narrower profile widths ($<20$ degrees) or smaller $P_3$ values (close to 2$P$). However, given the broad variety of pulse shapes and drift behaviours across the pulsar population, it is unsurprising that the phenomenon is not limited to only those where it can most easily be detected. Four of our samples show at least two emission modes with different profile shapes and drift properties, which seems to be a relatively common feature of bi-drifting pulsars. We also find jumps in sub-pulse phase between adjacent components in two pulsars. In addition to our MeerKAT L-band data, we used GMRT observations for four, and MeerKAT UHF observations for two of these pulsars to investigate the frequency dependence of sub-pulse drift. We find subtle changes in the drift as a function of frequency, but no clear overall pattern. Looking at the distribution of bi-drifting pulsars over $P$, $\dot{P}$ and $P_3$ suggests they are consistent with the underlying population of all drifting pulsars.

 - **Abstract**
 The Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) represents the next-generation gamma-ray observatory and will operate for several decades. It will be particularly suited to analyse transients and variable phenomena, which will trigger real-time scientific alerts. To support this, the Science Alert Generation (SAG) pipeline within the Array Control and Data Acquisition (ACADA) system will process data from telescope arrays in real time, using dedicated pipelines for data reconstruction (SAG-RECO), data quality monitoring (SAG-DQ) and science monitoring (SAG-SCI). The Supervisor (SAG-SUP) oversees the dynamic operations of SAG and its integration with other ACADA components. SAG is designed to issue candidate science alerts within 20 s of data availability, processing events on multiple time scales (seconds to hours) and handling trigger rates of tens of kHz. Meeting these requirements necessitates optimised software and hardware architectures. This work presents recent developments in SAG's architecture, aimed at two main challenges: (1) selecting data only from telescopes that have entered a stable tracking state, even when they begin tracking at different times during multi-telescope observations, and (2) incorporating environmental and system monitoring information to ensure high data quality. SAG-SUP can retrieve real-time telescope status and environmental conditions from telescope managers and the weather station through the ACADA Monitoring system, collect them in a database and then use them to filter out data from slewing phases or degraded conditions. These enhancements are crucial to ensure the reliability of science alerts and improve the overall performance and responsiveness of the CTAO real-time analysis framework.

 - **Abstract**
 Disentangling the (co-)evolution of individual galaxy structural components remains a difficult task owing to the inability to cleanly isolate light from spatially overlapping components. In this pilot study of PGC 044931, observed as part of the GECKOS survey, we utilise VIRCAM $H$-band imaging to decompose the galaxy into five photometric components, three of which contribute $>50\%$ of light in given regions: a main disc, a boxy/peanut bulge, and a nuclear disc. When the photometric decompositions are mapped onto MUSE observations, we find remarkably good separation in stellar kinematic space. All three structures occupy unique locations in the parameter space of the ratio of stellar line-of-sight velocity ($\rm{V}_{\star}$) and dispersion, ($\sigma_{\star}$), and high order stellar skew, ($h_{3}$). These clear and distinct kinematic signatures give us confidence to make inferences about the formation history of the individual components from observations of the mean light-weighted stellar age and metallicity of the three components. A clear story emerges: one in which an extended galactic disc hosted continued star formation, possibly with the addition of accreted pristine gas. Within the disc, a bar formed and buckled early, building a nuclear disc that continued to enrich via multiple generations of star formation. These results exemplify how careful photometric decompositions, combined with well-resolved stellar kinematic information, can help separate out age-metallicity relations of different components and therefore disentangle the formation history of the galaxy. The results of this pilot survey are applicable to modern, well-resolved spectroscopic galaxy surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 Disks around very low-mass stars (VLMS) provide environments for the formation of Earth-like planets. Mid-infrared observations have revealed that these disks exhibit weak silicate features and strong hydrocarbon emissions. This study characterizes the dust properties and geometrical structures of VLMS and brown dwarf (BD) disks, observed by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)/Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI), and connects these to gas column density and potential evolutionary stages. We analyze mid-infrared spectra of ten VLMS and BD disks as a part of the MIRI mid-Infrared Disk Survey (MINDS) program. Spectral slopes and silicate band strengths are compared with hydrocarbon emission line ratios, which probe the gas column density. Moreover, the Dust Continuum Kit with Line emission from Gas is used to quantify grain sizes, dust compositions, and crystallinity in the disk surface. The disks are classified into less, more, and fully settled geometries based on their mid-infrared spectral slopes and silicate band strengths. Less-settled disks show a relatively strong silicate band, high spectral slopes, and low crystallinity, and are dominated by 5 $\mu$m-sized grains. More-settled disks have weaker silicate band, low spectral slope, enhanced crystallinity, and higher mass fractions of smaller grains. Fully-settled disks exhibit little or no silicate emission and negative spectral slopes. An overall trend of increasing gas column density with decreasing spectral slope suggests that more molecular gas is exposed when the dust opacity decreases due to dust settling. Our findings may reflect possible evolutionary pathways with dust settling and thermal processing or may point to inner-disk clearing or a collisional cascade. These results highlight the need for broader samples to understand the link between dust and gas appearance in regions where Earth-like planets form.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new method to search for strong gravitational lensing systems by pairing spectra that are close together on the sky in a spectroscopic survey. We visually inspect 26,621 spectra in the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 1 that are selected in this way. We further inspect the 11,848 images corresponding to these spectra in the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys Data Release 10, and obtain 2046 conventional strong gravitational lens candidates, of which 1906 are new. This constitutes the largest sample of lens candidates identified to date in spectroscopic data. Besides the conventional candidates, we identify a new class of systems that we term "dimple lenses". These systems have a low-mass foreground galaxy as a lens, typically smaller in angular extent and fainter compared with the lensed background source galaxy, producing subtle surface brightness indentations in the latter. We report the discovery of 318 of these "dimple-lens" candidates. We suspect that these represent dwarf galaxy lensing. With follow-up observations, they could offer a new avenue to test the cold dark matter model by probing their mass profiles, stellar mass-halo mass relation, and halo mass function for $M_{\textrm{Halo}} \lesssim 10^{13}\,M_\odot$. Thus, in total, we report 2164 new lens candidates. Our method demonstrates the power of pairwise spectroscopic analysis and provides a pathway complementary to imaging-based and single-spectrum lens searches.

 - **Abstract**
 We generalize the analytic formula for the gravitational-wave spectrum from bubble collisions during a cosmological first-order phase transition, under the thin-wall and envelope approximations, by incorporating the effect of cosmic expansion in the FLRW metric. Along with presenting the complete analytic expression and corresponding numerical results, we also derive simplified formulas valid in the large- and small-$k$ limits, as well as in the flat-spacetime limit. The latter expansion reveals that the flat-spacetime approximation breaks down for $\beta / H_* \lesssim 10$, where $\beta$ denotes the inverse duration of the phase transition and $H_*$ the Hubble parameter at its completion. Furthermore, the next-to-leading-order term contributes about a $10\%$ correction for $\beta / H_* \sim 140$, a typical value for the electroweak phase transition.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) transmission spectrum of the exoplanet HAT-P-26 b (18.6 Earth masses, 6.33 Earth radii), based on a single transit observed with the JWST NIRSpec G395H grating. We detect water vapor (ln B = 4.1), carbon dioxide (ln B = 85.6), and sulfur dioxide (ln B = 13.5) with high confidence, along with marginal indications for hydrogen sulfide and carbon monoxide (ln B < 0.5). The detection of SO2 in a warm super-Neptune sized exoplanet (radius about 6 Earth radii) bridges the gap between previous detections in hot Jupiters and sub-Neptunes, highlighting the role of disequilibrium photochemistry across a broad range of exoplanet atmospheres, including those cooler than 1000 K. Our precise measurements of carbon, oxygen, and sulfur indicate an atmospheric metallicity of about 10 times solar and a sub-solar C/O ratio. Retrieved molecular abundances are consistent within 2 sigma with predictions from self-consistent models including photochemistry. The elevated CO2 abundance and possible H2S signal may also reflect sensitivities to the thermal structure, cloud properties, or additional disequilibrium processes such as vertical mixing. We compare the SO2 abundance in HAT-P-26 b with that of ten other JWST-observed giant exoplanets, and find a correlation with atmospheric metallicity. The trend is consistent with the prediction from Crossfield (2023), showing a steep rise in SO2 abundance at low metallicities, and a more gradual increase beyond 30 times solar. This work is part of a series of studies by our JWST Telescope Scientist Team (JWST-TST), in which we use Guaranteed Time Observations to perform Deep Reconnaissance of Exoplanet Atmospheres through Multi-instrument Spectroscopy (DREAMS).

 - **Abstract**
 It was shown that pair luminosity of the newborn strange star with temperature of $10^{11}$ K may be as high as $L_\pm\simeq 10^{52}$ erg/s. The question remains: can a strange star maintain such a high surface temperature for a long time? To answer this question we studied thermal evolution of newborn strange star taking into account thermal conductivity of free quarks and neutrino emission by the URCA process. Our results show that extremely high luminosity due to the Schwinger process and insufficient thermal conductivity of quarks leads to development of steep temperature gradient at the surface of strange star. As a result, the temperature at the surface and hence its luminosity decreases as a power law, reaching $10^{40}$ erg/s already at 10 ms. This result holds even in the presence of neutrinosphere.

 - **Abstract**
 The study of the chemical composition of star-forming regions is key to understand the chemical ingredients available during the formation of planetary systems. Given that the chemical inventory on interstellar dust grains in the prestellar phases might be altered due to the prostostellar warm-up, an alternative to infer the chemical composition on the grains could be to observe regions affected by shocks associated with molecular outflows. Such shocks can desorb the molecules, and might produce less chemical processing due to shorter timescales. We present here a detailed study of the chemical reservoir of a shocked region located in the G31.41+0.31 protocluster using GUAPOS data (G31.41+0.31 Unbiased ALMA sPectral Observational Survey). We report here the detection of 30 molecular species (plus 18 isotopologues). We performed a comparison of the molecular ratios in the shocked region with those derived towards the hot core of G31.41+0.31, finding that they are poorly correlated, excepting N-bearing species. Our results confirm observationally that a different level of chemical alteration is present in hot cores and in shocks. While the former likely alter the molecular ratios due to thermal processing during longer timescales, the latter might represent freshly desorbed material that constitutes a better proxy of the icy mantle composition. The similarity of molecular ratios between the N-bearing species in the G31.41 shock and the hot core suggests that these species are desorbed at early evolutionary stages. Interestingly, we have found that the abundances in the G31.41 shock show better correlations with other shock-dominated regions (two protostellar outflows and a Galactic Center molecular cloud). This suggests a negligible gas-phase chemistry after shock-induced ejection from grains, and that the ice-mantle composition is similar regardless of the Galactic environment.

 - **Abstract**
 Over the past fifteen years, surveys mainly at millimeter wavelengths have led to the discovery of $\sim$20 gas-bearing debris disks, most of them surrounding young intermediate-mass stars. Exploring the properties and origin of this gas could be fundamental to better understanding the transition between the protoplanetary and debris disk phases, the evolution of icy planetesimal belts, and the formation of planetary atmospheres. To expand the list of known CO-bearing debris disks and to improve our knowledge of the environmental conditions under which they can form, we targeted twelve dust-rich debris disks around young ($<$50 Myr) intermediate-mass stars. Using the ALMA 12-m Array we performed millimeter continuum and CO line observations to search for dust and gas and to measure their quantity and spatial distribution. We discovered CO gas in five disks. Two of them have a low CO content of a few times 10$^{-5}$ M$_\oplus$, similar to that of $\beta$ Pic. The other three disks, however, are CO-rich with $M_\mathrm{CO}>10^{-3}$ M$_\oplus$. By combining our results with those of other studies we concluded, in agreement with previous findings, that the detection rate of CO gas is significantly higher for disks around stars with $6.5~L_\odot<L_*<21.9~L_\odot$ ($\sim$A8$-$A0 spectral type) than for disks around less luminous stars ($0.18~L_\odot<L_*<6.4~L_\odot$, K7$-$A9). A comparison of the measured CO masses and the estimated mass loss rates of solids in disks with low CO content ($<$10$^{-4}$ M$_\oplus$) suggests that collisions may play a role in CO gas production in such systems. Interestingly, however, the estimated mass loss rates of CO-rich debris disks are not higher than those of systems with low CO content. In light of this finding, we speculate on what could lead to the formation of CO-rich debris disks.

          Unified dark fluid with null sound speed as an alternative to phantom dark energy

 - **Abstract**
 Recent BAO measurements from DESI, when combined with CMB and supernovae data, suggest evolving dark energy and in particular point to a possible phantom regime, with an equation of state parameter $w<-1$. We explore an alternative phenomenological way to model dark matter and dark energy based on a unified dark fluid (UDF). By construction, our model reproduces the same background expansion history as DESI's best-fit using the CPL parametrization, but assumes a vanishing rest-frame sound speed and no anisotropic stress. This simple prescription ensures a consistent and physical treatment of perturbations, and the use of a unified dark sector avoids phantom behaviour by construction. We model CMB, LSS, and redshift-space distortion observables, and find differences with CPL that are typically at the few-percent level. As a result, we forecast that even stage IV CMB and galaxy surveys will have limited power to discriminate between our UDF and CPL at the linear level. At the non-linear level, we study spherical collapse in the UDF and show that within this framework, structure formation proceeds very similarly to standard scenarios. Using Planck, DESI BAO DR2, and DESY5 supernovae data, we demonstrate that this simple UDF model fits current observations nearly as well as CPL, while treating perturbations consistently. Because most cosmological observations are not sensitive to how the dark sector is split, the unified framework can also approximate the phenomenology of interacting dark energy-dark matter scenarios or evolving dark matter, making it a general way to model the data, at least as long as the dark components have a vanishing sound speed, which is the most distinctive feature of our analysis. This highlights that a unified dark fluid with evolving equation of state and null sound speed is sufficient to pass current constraints without a phantom component.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The CAPOS project aims to obtain accurate mean abundances and radial velocities for many elements, and it explores the multiple population (MP) phenomenon in Galactic bulge globular clusters (BGCs). NGC 6569 is one of the CAPOS targets. Aims. This study provides a detailed high-resolution spectroscopic analysis of NGC 6569 to derive precise abundances for elements of different nucleosynthetic origins and to unveil its MPs by focusing on key spectral features. Methods. We analyzed APOGEE-2 near-infrared spectra of 11 giant members with the BACCHUS code, deriving abundances for 12 elements (C, N, O, Mg, Si, Ca, Ti, Fe, Ni, Al, Ce, Nd). Isochrone fitting with Gaia+2MASS photometry was used to estimate atmospheric parameters, cluster distance, and extinction. Results. We obtained [Fe/H] = -0.91 $\pm$ 0.06, consistent with APOGEE pipeline values; the scatter lies within uncertainties. The cluster shows [$\alpha$/Fe] = 0.36 $\pm$ 0.06 dex, similar to other GCs. Al appears homogeneous, while N is strongly enriched ([N/Fe] = 0.68 $\pm$ 0.34) with a spread of 0.90 dex, yielding two populations anticorrelated in C. The n-capture elements Ce and Nd are overabundant compared to the Sun but consistent with GCs of similar metallicity, with $\langle$[Ce/Nd]$\rangle$ = -0.17 $\pm$ 0.12. We also measure RV = -49.75 $\pm$ 3.68 km s$^{-1}$, consistent with previous works, while d$_\odot$ = 12.4 $\pm$ 1.45 kpc and E(B-V) = 0.68 are both higher than literature values. Conclusions. MPs in NGC 6569 are confirmed through a clear C-N anticorrelation. The cluster shows [$\alpha$/Fe] enhancement from Type II SNe and no Mg-Al-Si anticorrelation, suggesting rapid and homogeneous formation. The $\langle$[Ce/Nd]$\rangle$ ratio points to contributions from r-process events such as neutron star mergers, while overall Ce and Nd abundances are reported here for the first time in this cluster.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational microlensing is a unique method for discovering cold planets across a broad mass range. Reliable statistics of the microlensing planets require accurate sensitivity estimates. However, the impact of the degeneracies in binary-lens single-source (2L1S) models that affect many actual planet detections is often omitted in sensitivity estimates, leading to potential self-inconsistency of the statistics studies. In this work, we evaluate the effect of the 2L1S degeneracies on planetary sensitivity by simulating a series of typical microlensing events and comprehensively replicating a realistic planet detection pipeline, including the anomaly identification, global 2L1S model search, and degenerate model comparison. We find that for a pure-survey statistical sample, the 2L1S degeneracies reduce the overall planetary sensitivity by $5\sim10\%$, with the effect increasing at higher planet-host mass ratios. This bias leads to an underestimation of planet occurrence rates and a flattening of the inferred mass-ratio function slope. This effect will be critical for upcoming space-based microlensing surveys like the Roman or Earth 2.0 missions, which are expected to discover $\mathcal{O}(10^3)$ planets. We also discuss the computational challenges and propose potential approaches for future applications.

 - **Abstract**
 We use deep Echelle spectroscopy of the planetary nebulae Hf 2-2 and M1-42 to study the characteristics of the plasma that gives rise to their high abundance discrepancy factors (70 and 20, respectively). We analyze position-velocity diagrams for forbidden and permitted lines (92 and 93 lines in Hf 2-2 and M 1-42, respectively), to compare their kinematic behaviour and to determine the physical characteristics of the emitting plasma. We confirm that there are two plasma components in both nebulae: a normal nebular plasma that emits both forbidden and permitted lines and an additional plasma component that emits the permitted lines of O I, C II, N II, O II, and Ne II. These plasma components have different spatial distributions, with the additional plasma component being the more centrally concentrated. Their physical conditions are also different, with the additional plasma component being denser and cooler. We find that, in these objects, the additional plasma component contains masses of N$^{2}$ and O$^{2}$ ions that are at least as large as the normal nebular plasma. In both objects, we find strong gradients in the electron temperature in small volumes near the central star. Compared to NGC 6153, we find that the larger ADFs in Hf 2-2 and M 1-42 are due to larger masses of ions that emit only in the permitted lines, and not due to the physical conditions.

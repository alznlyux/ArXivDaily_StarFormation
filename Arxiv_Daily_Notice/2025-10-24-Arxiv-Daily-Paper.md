- **Abstract**
 The removal of gas left over from star formation has long been thought to dominate the dynamical evolution, and dissolution of star-forming regions. Feedback from massive stars from their stellar winds, photoionising radiation and supernovae is postulated to expel significant amounts of gas, altering the gravitational potential energy of the star-forming region and causing a supervirial expansion, which disperses the stars into the Galaxy on rapid timescales (<10Myr). The majority of previous work has utilised N-body simulations with a background potential to model the effects of gas removal. Here, we adopt a different approach where we take the end point of hydrodynamic simulations of star formation in which stars form with and without feedback from massive stars and then evolve the stars as N-body simulations. We also scale the velocities of the stars to various virial ratios, to mimic slower or faster removal of gas, and evolve these as additional N-body simulations. We find that the simulations where the stars inherit the velocities of the sink particles from the hydrodynamic simulations predominantly evolve more like a simulation in virial equilibrium, rather than the supervirial behaviour we would expect after gas removal. We see no significant differences in the dynamical evolution between the simulations where the stars inherit velocities directly from the hydrodynamical simulations and the simulations with (sub)virial velocities. This strongly suggests that gas removal by feedback processes does not lead to rapid expansion of star-forming regions, beyond the expansion caused by dynamical relaxation in star-forming regions.

- **Abstract**
 The orbits of small bodies in the outer solar system are particularly sensitive to gravitational perturbations, including stellar flybys. Stellar clusters, with low velocity dispersions and high number densities, can be the source of strong and frequent flybys. As a result, we can infer what properties of the solar birth environment would be incompatible with the structure of the outer solar system observed today. Here, we explore with $n-$body simulations the implications of the low inclinations ($i < 20^{\circ}$) of the distant sednoids (objects with perihelia $q > 40 \mathrm{\; AU}$ and semimajor axes $a > 400 \mathrm{\; AU}$) for the properties of the solar birth cluster. We find that the existence of these orbits, if they were in place in the Sun's birth cluster phase, would limit the product of the stellar number density and the Sun's residence time in the birth cluster to $\lesssim 5 \times 10^3 \mathrm{\; Myr \; pc^{-3}}$, as compared to the weaker limit $\lesssim 5 \times 10^4 \mathrm{\; Myr \; pc^{-3}}$ implied by the low inclinations of the cold classical Kuiper belt.
#### Title:
          The chemodynamical memory of a major merger in a NIHAO-UHD Milky Way analogue II: Were Splash stars heated or already born hot?

- **Abstract**
 One of the most debated consequences of the Milky Way's last major merger is the so-called $Splash$: stars with disc-like chemistry but halo-like kinematics, often interpreted as evidence for the violent heating of an early protodisc. Using the same high-resolution NIHAO-UHD cosmological simulation analysed in Buder et al. (2025b, hereafter Paper I), we test whether, and if so how, a Splash-like population arises in the Milky Way analogue. By tracing stellar birth positions, ages, and present-day orbits, we find that protodisc stars were already born on dynamically hot orbits, with no evidence for significant additional dynamical $splashing$ of these particular in-situ stars despite a 1:5 stellar mass merger. The observed Splash may therefore reflect the already turbulent early disc, subsequently intermixed with accreted stars and those formed from merger-driven gas inflows, rather than a distinct merger-heated population. When selecting stars with similar chemistry and age as the Splash-like ones, we find their azimuthal velocity distribution to be broad and positively skewed, with $V_\varphi = 73_{-59}^{+74}\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$. The transition to a rotation-supported disc with large azimuthal velocities occurs only during or after the merger. Our results suggest an alternative to the proposed splashing scenario and highlight the need to disentangle the relative contributions of merger-induced heating and intrinsically hot disc formation to clarify the nature of Splash-like stars and their role in shaping the early Milky Way.
#### Title:
          Barium abundances of A--F--G type stars in the Hyades cluster

- **Abstract**
 With an aim of clarifying the extent and parameter-dependence of compositional anomaly of barium in A-type stars, Ba abundances were spectroscopically determined based on BaII 6141/6496 lines for 89 (23 A-type and 66 F--G-type) main-sequence stars belonging to the members of Hyades cluster by taking into account the non-LTE effect and the hyper-fine-structure effect. While the non-LTE effect tends to strengthen lines in G stars, it acts in the direction of line weakening in the regime of A stars due to increasing imortance of overionization. The Ba abundances of G stars turned out almost constant (<A>= 2.33), indicating that the primordial composition of Ba in Hyades is mildly supersolar by ~+0.2dex. In contrast, A-type stars show Ba overabundances of considerably large dispersion (0~<[Ba/H]~<2). Since this Ba excess tends to increase with an increase/decrease in Teff/vsini, these two parameters may be essential for producing or controling the anomaly. Regarding Hyades F-type stars, their Ba abundances are not uniform but show a broad depression (by <~0.3dex) around Teff~6500K, interestingly coinciding with the location of Li-dip.

- **Abstract**
 Solar activity variations strongly impact the modulation of the flux of low-energy Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCRs) reaching the Earth. The secondary particles, which originate from the interaction of GCRs with the atmosphere, can be revealed by an array of ground detectors. We show that the low-threshold rate (scaler) time series recorded over 16 years of operation by the surface detectors of the Pierre Auger Observatory in Malargüe (Argentina) strongly reflects solar activity and can be considered as a new proxy of solar variability. To achieve this result, we apply advanced spectral methods to this time series and to the classical solar sunspot number and sunspot area series. We detect and compare highly significant variations with periods ranging from the decadal to the daily scale and identify the origin of each variability mode. In conclusion, we show that the Auger scaler data, thanks to the very low noise level and high statistical significance related to the very high count rates ($\sim 10^6$ counts per second), allow for a thorough and detailed investigation of the GCR flux variations in the heliosphere.

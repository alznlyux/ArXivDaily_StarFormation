 - **Abstract**
 Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are recurring soft X-ray transients emerging from the vicinity of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in nearby, low-mass galaxy nuclei; about ten QPE hosts have been identified thus far. Here we report the \textit{NICER} discovery of QPEs in the optically-selected Tidal Disruption Event (TDE) and Extreme Coronal Line Emitter (ECLE) AT2022upj, exhibiting a large spread in recurrence times from 0.5-3.5 days, durations from 0.3-1 days, peak luminosities from $10^{42.5-43.0}$ erg s$^{-1}$, and erratic flare profiles. A wealth of evidence now links at least some QPEs to the newly-formed accretion flows emerging from TDEs; AT2022upj is the third QPE reported in an optically discovered TDE. Marginalizing over the uncertain distributions of QPE peak luminosity, recurrence time, delay after TDE peak, and lifetime, we use the burgeoning sample to make a Bayesian estimate that the fraction of optical TDEs resulting in QPEs within 5 years post-disruption is $9^{+9}_{-5}$\%. Along with AT2019qiz, AT2022upj also marks the second of the three optical TDE+X-ray QPEs showing coronal line emission, suggesting ECLEs may represent a subset of TDEs particularly efficient at forming QPEs and/or that sustained QPE X-ray emission contributes to coronal line emission in some galaxy nuclei.

 - **Abstract**
 Impacts are the most ubiquitous processes on planetary bodies in our solar system. During these impact events, shock waves can deposit enough energy to produce shock-induced darkening in the target material, resulting in an alteration of its spectral properties. This spectral alteration can lead to an ambiguous taxonomic classification of asteroids and an incorrect identification of meteorite analogs. In this study, we investigated the effects of shock darkening on the visible and near-infrared spectra of ordinary chondrites and members of the howardites, eucrites, and diogenites clan. A decrease in albedo and suppression of the absorption bands with increasing shock darkening was observed for all the samples. We found that adding $\gtrsim$50\% of shock-darkened material to an unaltered sample was enough to change the taxonomic classification of an ordinary chondrite from S-complex to C- or X-complex. A similar amount was sufficient to change the taxonomic classification of a eucrite from V-type to O-type, whereas a eucrite composed of 100\% shock-darkened material was classified as a Q-type. We discuss the limitations of using just albedo for taxonomic classification of asteroids, which has implications for future space-based infrared surveys. We also investigated if shock darkening is responsible for a bias against the discovery of near-Earth objects (NEOs) with H and L chondrite-like compositions, which could explain the abundance of LL chondrites among NEOs.

          What's kickin' in partial tidal disruption events?

 - **Abstract**
 Stars partially destroyed by a supermassive black hole (SMBH) in a partial tidal disruption event (TDE) can be ejected from the SMBH. Previous investigations attributed this positive-energy/velocity kick to asymmetries in the mass lost by the star near pericenter. We propose that asymmetric mass loss is not predominantly responsible for "kicking" the star, and that these kicks instead arise from the combination of a) the reformation of the core following an initial phase of quasi-ballistic motion, and b) the differential shear between the unbound and marginally bound (to the SMBH) material during this phase. We predict that the kick speed $v_{\rm kick}$ is weakly dependent on the stellar properties, and for SMBH masses $M_{\bullet} \gtrsim 10^{3} M_{\odot}$, $v_{\rm kick}$ is independent of SMBH mass, is not limited to the stellar escape speed $v_{\rm esc}$, and is related to the surviving core mass $M_{\rm c}$ approximately as $v_{\rm kick} \simeq 0.45 \left(M_{\rm c}/M_{\star}\right)^{-1/3}$, where $M_{\star}$ is the original stellar mass. For $M_{\bullet} \lesssim 10^{3} M_{\odot}$, we find that the maximum-attainable kick speed depends on SMBH mass, satisfies $v_{\rm kick, max} \simeq 0.4 \, v_{\rm esc}\left(M_{\bullet}/M_{\star}\right)^{1/6}$, and is reached for core masses that satisfy $M_{\rm c}/M_{\star} \lesssim 1.7\left(M_{\bullet}/M_{\star}\right)^{-1/2}$. This model predicts that massive stars with $M_{\star}\gtrsim few\times 10 M_{\odot}$ could be ejected at speeds $\gtrsim (1-2)\times 10^3$ km s$^{-1}$ if stripped of $\gtrsim 50\%$ of their mass.

 - **Abstract**
 Material arriving at our solar system from the Galaxy may be detected at Earth in the form of meteors ablating in our atmosphere. Here we report on a search for interstellar meteors within the highest-quality events in the Global Meteor Network (GMN) database. No events were detected that were conclusively hyperbolic with respect to the Sun; however, our search was not exhaustive and examined only the top 57% of events, with a deeper examination planned for future work. This study's effective meteoroid mass limit is 6.6 +/- 0.8 x 10^{-5} kg (5 millimeter diameter at a density of 1000 kg m^{-3}). Theoretical rates of interstellar meteors at these sizes range from 3 to 200 events globally per year. The highest rates can already be largely excluded by this study, while at the lowest rates GMN would have to observe for 25 more years to be 50% confident of seeing at least one event. GMN is thus well positioned to provide substantial constraints on the interstellar population at these sizes over the coming years. This study's results are statistically compatible with a rate of interstellar meteors at the Earth at less than 1 per million meteoroid impacts at Earth at millimeter sizes, or a flux rate of less than 8 +/- 2 x 10^{-11} per sq. km per hour at the 95% confidence level.

 - **Abstract**
 Among the blazars whose emission has been detected up to very-high-energy (VHE; 100 GeV < E < 100 TeV) gamma rays, intermediate synchrotron-peaked BL Lacs (IBLs) are quite rare. The IBL B2 1811+31 (z = 0.117) exhibited intense flaring activity in 2020. Detailed characterization of the source emissions from radio to gamma-ray energies was achieved with quasi-simultaneous observations, which led to the first-time detection of VHE gamma-ray emission from the source with the MAGIC telescopes. In this work, we present a comprehensive multi-wavelength view of B2 1811+31 employing data from MAGIC, Fermi-LAT, Swift-XRT, Swift-UVOT and from several optical and radio ground-based telescopes. We investigate the variability, cross-correlations and classification of the source emissions during low and high states. During the 2020 flaring state, the synchrotron peak frequency shifted to higher values and reached the limit of the IBL classification. Variability in timescales of few hours in the high-energy (HE; 100 MeV < E < 100 GeV) gamma-ray band poses an upper limit of 6 x 10^{14} delta_D cm to the size of the emission region responsible for the gamma-ray flare, delta_D being the relativistic Doppler factor of the region. During the 2020 high state, the average spectrum became harder in the X-ray and HE gamma-ray bands compared to the low states. Conversely, during different activity periods, we find harder-when-brighter trends in X rays and a hint of softer-when-brighter trends at HE gamma rays. Gamma-optical correlation indicates the same emission regions dominate the radiative output in both ranges, whereas the levolution at 15 GHz shows no correlation with the flux at higher frequencies. We test one-zone and two-zone synchrotron-self-Compton models for describing the broad-band spectral energy distribution during the 2020 flare and investigate the self-consistency of the proposed scenario.

 - **Abstract**
 Despite the organic molecule inventory detected in Orion KL, acetaldehyde (CH3CHO) -- one of the most ubiquitous interstellar aldehydes -- has not been firmly identified with mm-wave interferometry. We analyze extensive ALMA archival datasets (142-355 GHz) to search for acetaldehyde, revealing two distinct acetaldehyde emission peaks and one component with more complex kinematic structures. One peak aligns with MF10/IRc2, where emissions of other O-bearing complex organic molecules are rarely reported, while the other is coincident with the ethanol peak in the hot core-SW. The MF10/IRc2 detection suggests unique chemistry, possibly influenced by repeated heating events. In contrast, co-detection with ethanol indicates an ice origin and suggests a potential chemical relationship between the two species. We determined acetaldehyde column densities and its kinetic temperatures toward these two peaks under LTE assumptions and compare its distribution with ethanol and other molecules that have an aldehyde (HCO) group, such as methyl formate, glycolaldehyde, and formic acid. Toward the ethanol peak, observed abundance ratios between HCO-containing species are analyzed using a chemical model. The model suggests two key points: 1) the destruction of ethanol to form acetaldehyde in the ice may contribute to the observed correlation between the two species, 2) a long cold-collapse timescale and a methyl formate binding energy similar to or lower than water are needed to explain the observations. The relative abundance ratios obtained from the model are highly sensitive to the assumed kinetic temperature, which accounts for the high spatial variability of the aldehyde ratios observed toward Orion KL.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the capability of constraining the mass and redshift distributions of binary black hole systems jointly with the underlying cosmological model using one year of observations of the Einstein Telescope. We found that as the SNR decreases, the precision on the matter density parameter $\Omega_{m,0}$ and the Hubble constant $H_0$, improves significantly due to the increased number of detectable events at high redshift. However, degeneracies between cosmological and astrophysical parameters exist and evolve with the SNR threshold. Finally, we showed that one year of observations will serve to reconstruct the mass distribution with its features. Conversely, the redshift distribution will be poorly constrained and will need more observations to improve. To reach this result, we fixed the underlying cosmological model to a flat $\Lambda$CDM model, and then we considered the mass distribution given by a smoothed power law and the redshift distributions given by the Madau-Dickinson model. We built mock catalogs with different SNR thresholds and finally inferred astrophysical and cosmological parameters jointly adopting a hierarchical Bayesian framework.

          Bound Dark Energy: a particle's origin of dark energy

 - **Abstract**
 Dark energy, the enigmatic force driving the accelerated cosmic expansion of the universe, is conventionally described as a cosmological constant in the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. However, measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) reports a $> 2.5\sigma$ preference for dynamical dark energy, with baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data favoring a time varying equation of state $w(z)$ over the cosmological constant ($w=-1$). We present the Bound Dark Energy (BDE) model, where dark energy originates from the lightest meson field $\phi$ in a dark SU(3) gauge sector, emerging dynamically via non perturbative interactions. Governed by an inverse-power-law potential $V(\phi)=\Lambda_{c}^{4 + 2/3}\phi^{-2/3}$, BDE has no free parameters, one less than $\Lambda$CDM and three less than $w_{0}w_{a}$CDM models. Combining the DESI BAO measurements, cosmic microwave background data, and Dark Energy Survey SN Ia distance measurements from the fifth year, BDE achieves a $42\%$ and $37\%$ reduction in the reduced $\chi^{2}_{BAO}$ compared to $w_{0}w_{a}$CDM and $\Lambda$CDM, respectively, while having an equivalent fit for type Ia supernovae and the cosmic microwave background data. The model predicts a dark energy equation of state transitioning from radiation like $w=1/3$ at early times ($a < a_{c}$) to $ w_{0}=-0.9301 \pm 0.0004$ at present time. The ($w_{0},w_{a}$) contour is 10,000 times smaller in BDE than in $w_{0}w_{a}$CDM model, while having an equivalent cosmological fit. Key parameters the condensation energy scale $\Lambda_{c}=43.806 \pm 0.19$ eV and epoch $a_{c}=2.4972 \pm 0.011 \times 10^{-6}$ align with high-energy physics predictions. These results, consistent with current observational bounds, establish BDE as a predictive framework that unifies particle physics and cosmology, offering a first-principles resolution to dark energy dynamical nature.

 - **Abstract**
 Omega Centauri ($\omega$ Cen) is one of the most complex star clusters in the Milky Way, and likely the stripped nucleus of an accreted dwarf galaxy. Being the subject of debate between it hosting an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) or a collection of stellar-mass black holes (BHs) in its center, $\omega$ Cen has been intensively studied over the past decades. Our work focuses on characterizing the properties of binary systems in $\omega$ Cen via multi-epoch MUSE spectroscopic observations spanning over eight years and covering much of its central regions (i.e. core radius). We did not detect any stellar-mass BHs candidates orbiting luminous stars, although mock samples indicate a high sensitivity of our survey to such systems. This suggests that BHs orbiting stars may be rare in $\omega$ Cen or in wide orbits around low-mass companions (where our survey is 50% complete) or that the periods of such systems are longer than expected from cluster dynamics. Additionally, we constrained the orbital properties of 19 binary systems in the cluster, with periods ranging from fractions of a day up to several hundred days. We observe an excess of binaries with P $\ge$ 10 d and find evidence that the intrinsic period distribution of binaries in $\omega$ Cen differs from those predicted by cluster evolutionary models.

          Understanding Compositional Evolution of Hollows at Dominici Crater, Mercury

 - **Abstract**
 Hollows on Mercury are small depressions formed by volatile loss, providing important clues about the volatile inventory of the planet's surface and shallow subsurface. We investigate the composition of hollows in various phases of devolatilization at Dominici crater. By applying a machine learning approach to MESSENGER Mercury Dual Imaging System data, we defined surface units within the study area and extracted their reflectance spectra. We applied linear (areal) spectral modeling using laboratory sulfides, chlorides, graphite, and silicate mineral spectra to estimate the composition of hollows and their surrounding terrains. At Dominici, the hollow on the crater rim/wall is interpreted to be active, while that in the center of the crater is interpreted as a waning hollow. We find that the active hollow predominantly comprises silicates (augite and albite), with a trace amount of graphite and CaS. In contrast, waning hollows contain marginally elevated sulfides (MgS and CaS) and graphite, but slightly lower silicates than the active hollow. The spectra of low reflectance terrain surrounding the hollows appear to be dominated by graphite and sulfides, which contribute to its darker appearance. We suggest that hollow at the crater forms due to thermal decomposition of sulfides, primarily MgS possibly mixed with CaS, as well as possible the depletion of graphite. As devolatilization wanes, a mixture of predominantly silicate minerals remains in the hollows - impeding further vertical growth.

 - **Abstract**
 Titan is the only icy satellite in the solar system with a dense atmosphere. This atmosphere is composed primarily of nitrogen with a few percent methane, which supports an active, methane-based hydrological cycle on Titan. The presence of methane, however, is intriguing, as its lifetime is likely much shorter than the age of the solar system due to its irreversible destruction by UV photolysis. To explain Titan's current atmospheric methane abundance, it is hypothesised that a replenishment mechanism is needed. One such mechanism may be crater forming impacts; a methane-clathrate layer potentially covering the surface of Titan may act as a reservoir that releases methane when disrupted by impacts. Here, we perform impact simulations into methane-clathrate layers to investigate the amount of methane released via impacts. Our simulations show that the amount of methane released into the atmosphere depends on both the impactor size and the methane-clathrate layer thickness. A single 20-km-diameter impactor releases up to 1% of Titan's current atmospheric methane mass; the effect of impact obliquity and surface porosity may further increase the released mass by a factor of 2-3. The release rate from impacts is lower than the net loss rate by photolysis, but the released methane mass via impacts can enhance the lifetime of methane in Titan's atmosphere by up to 3%. Menrva-sized (> 400 km diameter) crater-forming impacts directly liberate of $\sim$15% Titan's current atmospheric methane. The direct heating of the atmosphere by the impactor might contribute to additional crustal heating and methane release.

 - **Abstract**
 Almost all globular clusters (GCs) contain multiple populations consisting of stars with varying helium and light-element abundances. These populations include first-population stars, which exhibit similar chemical compositions to halo-field stars with comparable [Fe/H], and second-population stars, characterized by enhanced He and N abundances along with reduced levels of O and C. Nowadays, one of the most intriguing open questions about GCs pertains to the formation and evolution of their multiple populations. Recent works based on N-body simulations of GCs show that the fractions and characteristics of binary stars can serve as dynamic indicators of the formation period of multiple-population in GCs and their subsequent dynamical evolution. Nevertheless, the incidence of binaries among multiple populations is still poorly studied. Moreover, the few available observational studies are focused only on the bright stars of a few GCs. In this work, we use deep images of the GC 47 Tucanae collected with the JWST and HST to investigate the incidence of binaries among multiple populations of M-dwarfs and bright main-sequence stars. To reach this objective, we use UV, optical, and near infrared filters to construct photometric diagrams that allow us to disentangle binary systems and multiple populations. Moreover, we compared these observations with a large sample of simulated binaries. In the cluster central regions, the incidence of binaries among first-population stars is only slightly higher than that of second-population stars. In contrast, in the external regions, the majority (>85%) of the studied binaries are composed of first population stars. Results are consistent with the GC formation scenarios where the second-population stars originate in the cluster's central region, forming a compact and dense stellar group within a more extended system of first-population stars

 - **Abstract**
 The Ophiuchus stellar stream presents a puzzle due to its complicated morphology, with a substructure perpendicular to the main track (spur), a broadened tail (fanning), and a shorter than expected angular extent given its old stellar population and short orbital period. The location of the stream approaches the Galactic center, implying a possible connection between its orbit and its unusual morphology. Here we demonstrate that the morphology of Ophiuchus can be attributed to its interaction with the decelerating Galactic bar, which leads to the flipping or transposition of its tidal tails. The short length of the stream is the result of stars stripped in the ancient past still remaining concentrated, and the spur, as well as the fanning, are composed of either leading or trailing tails built up of stars released at different time intervals. Our new spectroscopic data, obtained as part of the Southern Stellar Stream Spectroscopic Survey $(S^5)$, and modeling of Ophiuchus indicate that, in the presence of the bar, an initial leading tail can be redistributed to the trailing side and vice versa, and the morphology of a stream can be reshaped. This result confirms that the Galactic bar plays a vital role in reconstructing the orbital behavior of streams passing close to the central region of the Milky Way.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we present a novel framework for constructing three-dimensional (3D) objects from two-dimensional (2D) maps, tailored for the analysis of complex structures in the interstellar medium (ISM). The framework extends the Abel transform and the AVIATOR algorithm. By expanding medial-axis trees along the $z$-coordinate and transforming circular components into spheres, we generate 3D objects from 2D flux slices while preserving key structural features such as filament intersections, the spatial distribution of bright cores, and filamentary twists. The framework introduces multiple expansion strategies--random, fiducial, and physical--allowing for different interpretations of the underlying 3D structures. While the column density probability density function (PDF) remains largely invariant across different construction methods, the high degree of freedom in the 3D expansion poses challenges in accurately recovering true spatial configurations in complex regions. Our work provides a flexible, extensible platform for exploring the 3D organization of ISM structures, with potential applications in star formation and molecular cloud analysis.

 - **Abstract**
 Planetary nebulae (PNe) that are physical members of open star clusters (OCs) are valuable for stellar evolution studies. They are extremely rare, with only three such instances confirmed in our Galaxy. Here, we confirm the physical association of PN NGC 2818 with OC NGC 2818A, an association long debated in the literature, adding a fourth object to the sample of rare OC-PN pairs. The physical properties of the PN can then be linked to those of its progenitor star. Using GHOST/Gemini high-resolution nebular spectra, we measured the PN systemic radial velocity to compare it with that of the putative host cluster, determined from Gaia. We estimated the physical parameters of both the OC and the PN using our data, together with estimates from previous studies and theoretical cluster isochrones and evolutionary tracks to show they are compatible. The precise, systemic radial velocity of the PN that was determined, is consistent among the errors with that of the OC and its 1 km/s associated velocity dispersion, a primary requirement for cluster membership. We have determined other physical parameters of the PN and the OC, such as age and distance, which also match within the errors. These results present compelling evidence for the physical association of the PN and the OC. The PN age was found to be 11 kyr and the effective temperature of its central star was estimated as 130 kK. The initial and final masses of the progenitor star were determined to be 2.33$\pm$0.10 Msol and 0.58$\pm$0.10 Msol respectively. We plotted the resulting data point on the latest initial-to-final-mass relation. This new data point agrees with the previously published trends and further delineates the 'kink' found at relatively low initial masses. All four OC-PN associations, identified thus far, share a number of common properties. These rare cases merit detailed OC-PN studies and work to further extend the sample.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new and extended transmission spectrum of the warm Neptune HAT-P-26b spanning wavelengths between 0.29 - 5.0 microns. This spectrum is derived from new HST STIS G430L observations from the PanCET program, a reanalysis of the previously published HST STIS G750L data, along with the previously published HST WFC3 IR G102 and G141 data, and the two Spitzer IRAC photometric points at 3.6 and 4.5 microns. We present this analysis as part of the Sculpting Hubble's Exoplanet Legacy (SHEL) program, where the goals are to analyze all HST archival observations of transiting exoplanets using a uniform and homogeneous reduction technique. With the new wavelength coverage, we identify a scattering slope that is weaker than Rayleigh scattering and is best-matched by models incorporating a haze-only scenario. Our retrieval analysis reveals an atmospheric metallicity of 15(+22/-8) x solar which suggests that HAT-P-26b may have formed further out in the protoplanetary disk, in a region rich in hydrogen and helium but with fewer heavy elements, and later migrated inward. This super-solar metallicity places HAT-P-26b below the mass-metallicity trend of the solar system. Looking ahead, recent observations from JWST NIRISS/SOSS and NIRSpec/G495H will provide critical, high-precision data that extend the spectral coverage into the infrared to further constrain the atmospheric composition and structure of HAT-P-26b. These observations have the potential to confirm or refine the metallicity and haze scenario presented here, offering unprecedented insights into the atmospheric properties of warm Neptunes and the processes governing their formation and migration histories.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a high signal-to-noise (SNR $\sim$ 450), high-dispersion ($R \equiv \lambda / \Delta \lambda \sim 28\,000$) H- and K-band spectroscopic atlas of the L7.5 and T0.5 components of the Luhman 16AB binary (WISE J104915.57$-$531906.1AB): the closest pair of brown dwarfs, and one of the best substellar benchmarks. The spectra were combined from a 70-day spectroscopic monitoring campaign of the binary with IGRINS on Gemini South. We fit model photospheres to the combined high-quality spectra to estimate atmospheric parameters. The model is based on the Sonora model atmosphere further incorporating the effects of clouds and disequilibrium. We detect ammonia (NH3) lines in both binary components, making Luhman 16A the warmest object where individual NH3 lines were identified. We discover hydrogen (H2), hydrogen sulfide (H2S), and hydrogen fluoride (HF) lines in both components, following recent reports of these species in either cooler (H2, H2S in a T6 dwarf) or warmer (HF in young late-M or mid-L dwarfs) objects. Methane (CH4) shows a small contribution, with lines sensitive to the slight temperature difference spanning the L/T transition. Against model expectations, we do not detect FeH lines, implying more efficient iron rainout than incorporated in the models. We find various unidentified features in water-dominated regions, likely the result of residual inaccuracies in the water line lists. We searched for planetary-mass companions by periodogram analysis of radial velocities over 70 days but detected no significant signal. The upper limits of projected planetary mass are $M\sin{i}=$ 0.2 $M_{\mathrm{J}}$ and 0.3 $M_{\mathrm{J}}$ at P $\sim$ 1 day, and 0.4 $M_{\mathrm{J}}$ and 0.7 $M_{\mathrm{J}}$ at P $\sim$ 10 days for Luhman 16A and B, respectively.

 - **Abstract**
 The scattering is crucial for the atmospheric thermal profiles. The energy transport by the vertical mixing plays an essential role for the greenhouse or anti-greenhouse effect. This work explores the interaction between scattering and vertical mixing, specifically whether these processes enhance or mitigate each other's effects on atmospheric temperature. The interaction between mixing flux and scattering is nonlinear. Our calculations indicate that thermal scattering intensifies the greenhouse effects caused by vertical mixing in the middle atmosphere but reduces it in the lower layers. In the middle atmosphere, increased vertical mixing enhances the warming effect of the thermal scattering while diminishing the cooling effect of visible scattering. In the lower atmosphere, it enhances the anti-greenhouse effect linked to visible scattering and diminishes the greenhouse effect produced by thermal scattering. The combined influence of thermal scattering and vertical mixing on the lower atmosphere's greenhouse effect is weaker than their separate impacts, akin to $1+1<2$. It is also interesting to note that the joint effect may also influence chemistry and cloud formation, altering the thermal structure.

          Evolution of clustering in cosmological models with time-varying dark energy

 - **Abstract**
 Observations favor cosmological models with a time-varying dark energy component. But how does dynamical dark energy (DDE) influence the growth of structure in an expanding Universe? We investigate this question using high-resolution $N$-body simulations based on a DDE cosmology constrained by first-year DESI data (DESIY1$+$DDE), characterized by a 4% lower Hubble constant ($H_0$) and 10% higher matter density ($\Omega_0$) than the Planck-2018 $\Lambda$CDM model. We examine the impact on the matter power spectrum, halo abundances, clustering, and Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAO). We find that DESIY1$+$DDE exhibits a 10% excess in power at small scales and a 15% suppression at large scales, driven primarily by its higher $\Omega_0$. This trend is reflected in the halo mass function: DESIY1$+$DDE predicts up to 70% more massive halos at $z = 2$ and a 40% excess at $z = 0.3$. Clustering analysis reveals a 3.71% shift of the BAO peak towards smaller scales in DESIY1$+$DDE, consistent with its reduced sound horizon compared to Planck18 Measurements of the BAO dilation parameter $\alpha$, using halo samples with DESI-like tracer number densities across $0 < z < 1.5$, agree with the expected DESIY1$+$DDE-to-Planck18 sound horizon ratio. After accounting for cosmology-dependent distances, the simulation-based observational dilation parameter closely matches DESI Y1 data. We find that the impact of DDE is severely limited by current observational constraints, which strongly favor cosmological models -- whether including DDE or not -- with a tightly constrained parameter $\Omega_0h^2\approx 0.143$, within 1-2% uncertainty. Indeed, our results demonstrate that variations in cosmological parameters, particularly $\Omega_0$, have a greater influence on structure formation than the DDE component alone.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the redshift calibration methodology and bias estimates for the cosmic shear analysis of the fifth and final data release (DR5) of the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS). KiDS-DR5 includes a greatly expanded compilation of calibrating spectra, drawn from $27$ square degrees of dedicated optical and near-IR imaging taken over deep spectroscopic fields. The redshift distribution calibration leverages a range of new methods and updated simulations to produce the most precise $N(z)$ bias estimates used by KiDS to date. Improvements to our colour-based redshift distribution measurement method (SOM) mean that we are able to use many more sources per tomographic bin for our cosmological analyses, and better estimate the representation of our source sample given the available spec-$z$. We validate our colour-based redshift distribution estimates with spectroscopic cross-correlations (CC). We find that improvements to our cross-correlation redshift distribution measurement methods mean that redshift distribution biases estimated between the SOM and CC methods are fully consistent on simulations, and the data calibration is consistent to better than $2\sigma$ in all tomographic bins.

 - **Abstract**
 We present cosmic shear constraints from the completed Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS), where the cosmological parameter $S_8\equiv\sigma_8\sqrt{\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3} = 0.815^{+0.016}_{-0.021}$, is found to be in agreement ($0.73\sigma$) with results from the Planck Legacy cosmic microwave background experiment. The final KiDS footprint spans $1347$ square degrees of deep nine-band imaging across the optical and near-infrared, along with an extra $23$ square degrees of KiDS-like calibration observations of deep spectroscopic surveys. Improvements in our redshift distribution estimation methodology, combined with our enhanced calibration data and multi-band image simulations, allow us to extend our lensed sample out to a photometric redshift of $z_{\rm B}\leq2.0$. Compared to previous KiDS analyses, the increased survey area and redshift depth results in a $\sim32\%$ improvement in constraining power in terms of $\Sigma_8\equiv\sigma_8\left(\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3\right)^\alpha = 0.821^{+0.014}_{-0.016}$, where $\alpha = 0.58$ has been optimised to match the revised degeneracy direction of $\sigma_8$ and $\Omega_{\rm m}$. We adopt a new physically motivated intrinsic alignment model that depends jointly on the galaxy sample's halo mass and spectral type distributions, and that is informed by previous direct alignment measurements. We also marginalise over our uncertainty on the impact of baryon feedback on the non-linear matter power spectrum. Comparing to previous KiDS analyses, we conclude that the increase seen in $S_8$ primarily results from our improved redshift distribution estimation and calibration, as well as new survey area and improved image reduction. Our companion paper Stölzner et al. (submitted) presents a full suite of internal and external consistency tests, finding the KiDS-Legacy data set to be the most internally robust sample produced by KiDS to date.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a cosmic shear consistency analysis of the final data release from the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS-Legacy). By adopting three tiers of consistency metrics, we compare cosmological constraints between subsets of the KiDS-Legacy dataset split by redshift, angular scale, galaxy colour and spatial region. We also review a range of two-point cosmic shear statistics. With the data passing all our consistency metric tests, we demonstrate that KiDS-Legacy is the most internally consistent KiDS catalogue to date. In a joint cosmological analysis of KiDS-Legacy and DES Y3 cosmic shear, combined with data from the Pantheon+ Type Ia supernovae compilation and baryon acoustic oscillations from DESI Y1, we find constraints consistent with Planck measurements of the cosmic microwave background with $S_8\equiv \sigma_8\sqrt{\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3} = 0.814^{+0.011}_{-0.012}$ and $\sigma_8 = 0.802^{+0.022}_{-0.018}$.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we continue to apply the updated KMTNet tender-love care (TLC) photometric pipeline to historical microlensing events. We apply the pipeline to a subsample of events from the KMTNet database, which we refer to as the giant source sample. Leveraging the improved photometric data, we conduct a systematic search for anomalies within this sample. The search successfully uncovers four new planet-like anomalies and recovers two previously known planetary signals. After detailed analysis, two of the newly discovered anomalies are confirmed as clear planets: KMT-2019-BLG-0578 and KMT-2021-BLG-0736. Their planet-to-host mass ratios are $q\sim4\times10^{-3}$ and $q\sim1\times10^{-4}$, respectively. Another event, OGLE-2018-BLG-0421 (KMT-2018-BLG-0831), remains ambiguous. Both a stellar companion and a giant planet in the lens system could potentially explain the observed anomaly. The anomaly signal of the last event, MOA-2022-BLG-038 (KMT-2022-BLG-2342), is attributed to an extra source star. Within this sample, our procedure doubles the number of confirmed planets, demonstrating a significant enhancement in the survey sensitivity.

 - **Abstract**
 Most of the exoplanets discovered in our galaxy to date orbit low-mass stars, which tend to host small disks in their early stages. To better elucidate the link between planet formation and disk substructures, observational biases should be reduced through observations of these small, faint disks at the highest resolution using the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA). In this work, we present new high-resolution (0.03-0.04") ALMA observations at 1.3 mm of 33 disks located in the Lupus star-forming region. Combining archival data and previously published work, we provide a near-complete high resolution image library of 73 protoplanetary (Class II) disks in Lupus. This enable us to measure dust disk radii down to a limit of 0.6 au and analyze intensity profiles using visibility modeling. We show that 67% of Lupus protoplanetary disks have dust radii smaller than 30 au, with new substructures detected in 11, showing some of the shortest separation gaps. The size-luminosity relation in Lupus aligns well with a drift-dominated dust evolution scenario and, for the most compact disks (< 30 au), we found dust masses ranging from 0.3 to 26.3 Earth masses. Assuming that the detected substructures were dynamical effects of planets, we estimated the planet masses to range from 20 to 2000 Earth masses with separations between 2 to 74 au. Our results indicate that two-thirds of the protoplanetary disks in Lupus are smooth, and compact, with substructures being more prominent in the few larger disks. These compact disks are consistent with drift-dominated evolution, with their masses and optical depths suggesting that they may have already experienced some planet formation, with most of the small solids converted into planetesimals and planets. This makes them prime candidates, for explaining the formation and origin of super-Earths. [Abridged]

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational waves from binary neutron star mergers provide insights into dense matter physics and strong-field gravity, but waveform modeling remains computationally challenging. We develop a deep generative model for gravitational waveforms from BNS mergers, covering the late inspiral, merger, and ringdown, incorporating precession and tidal effects. Using the conditional autoencoder, our model efficiently generates waveforms with high fidelity across a broad parameter space, including component masses $(m_1, m_2)$, spin components $(S_{1x}, S_{1y}, S_{1z}, S_{2x}, S_{2y}, S_{2z})$, and tidal deformability $(\Lambda_1, \Lambda_2)$. Trained on $3 \times 10^5$ waveforms from the IMRPhenomXP\_NRTidalv2 waveform model, it achieves an average overlap accuracy of 99.6\% on the test set. The model significantly accelerates waveform generation. For a single sample, it requires $0.12$ seconds (s), compared to $0.38$ s for IMRPhenomXP\_NRTidalv2 and $0.62$ s for IMRPhenomPv2\_NRTidal, making it approximately 3 to 5 times faster. When generating $10^3$ waveforms, the network completes the task in $0.86$ s, while traditional waveform approximation methods take over $46$--$53$ s. Our model achieves a total time of $7.48$ s to generate $10^4$ such waveforms, making it about 60 to 65 times faster than traditional waveform approximation methods. This speed advantage enables rapid parameter estimation and real-time gravitational wave searches. With higher precision, it will support low-latency detection and broader applications in multi-messenger astrophysics.

 - **Abstract**
 We address Earth formation from an elemental perspective, using a method similar to Rubie et al. (2015) but with updates from Dale et al. (2023) to simulate the chemical evolution of Earth's mantle during metal-silicate equilibration events from accretional collisions. Our model introduces two key differences: (1) Earth forms from a dense ring of planetesimals and planetary embryos near 1 AU, extending into the asteroid belt, and (2) we divide this population into four zones. The innermost zone contains planetesimals enriched in refractory elements relative to Si and depleted in volatiles. The remaining zones represent enstatite, ordinary, and CI chondrites. We fit the Earth's bulk silicate composition by adjusting the boundaries of these zones and the refractory enrichment in the inner zone, giving us four compositional free parameters. A fifth parameter relates to the depth of planetesimal equilibration after a giant impact. We examined twenty-two ring model simulations, expanded to forty-eight based on hot or cold targets during collisions. Seventeen simulations resulted in a mantle chemistry resembling the bulk silicate Earth (BSE), despite differences in growth sequences. These variations lead to different fitting parameter values, altering the proportions of different meteorite types required to match the BSE. However, findings show Earth must accrete 60-80% of material from the innermost refractory-enriched zone. This indicates that, with the right growth sequence, multiple ring model structures can yield an Earth-anaologue composition consistent with the BSE.

 - **Abstract**
 With large-scale surveys such as the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), it has become possible to obtain a well-sampled light curve spanning the full length of the survey for any discovery within the survey footprint. Similarly, any transient within the footprint that was first detected before the start of the survey will likely have a large number of post-transient observations, making them excellent targets to search for the presence of late-time signals, in particular due to interaction with circumstellar material (CSM). We search for late-time signals in a sample of 7718 transients, mainly supernovae (SNe), which were first detected during the 10 years before the start of ZTF, aiming to find objects showing signs of late-time interaction with CSM. We find one candidate whose late-time signal is best explained by late-time CSM interaction, with the signal being around 300 days after transient discovery. A thin, distant shell containing $\lesssim5$ M$_\odot$ of material could explain the recovered signal. We also find five objects whose late-time signal is best explained by faint nuclear transients occurring in host nuclei close to the pre-ZTF transient locations. Finally, we find two objects where it is difficult to determine whether the signal is from a nuclear transient or due to late-time CSM interaction $>5$ years after the SN. This study demonstrates the ability of large-scale surveys to find faint transient signals for a variety of objects, uncovering a population of previously unknown sources. However, the large number of non-detections show that strong late-time CSM interaction occurring years after the SN explosion is extremely rare.

 The annual modulation signal, claimed to be consistent with dark matter as observed by DAMA/LIBRA in a sodium-iodide based detector, has persisted for over two decades. COSINE-100 and ANAIS-112 were designed to test the claim directly using the same target material. COSINE-100, located at Yangyang Underground Laboratory in South Korea, and ANAIS-112, located at Canfranc Underground Laboratory in Spain, have been taking data since 2016 and 2017, respectively. Each experiment published its respective results independently. In this paper, we present the results of an annual modulation search as a test of the signal observed by DAMA/LIBRA with the first three respective years of data from COSINE-100 and ANAIS-112. Using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method, we find best fit values for modulation amplitude of $-0.0002 {\pm} 0.0026$ cpd/kg/keV in the 1-6 keV and $0.0021 {\pm} 0.0028$ cpd/kg/keV in the 2-6 keV energy regions. These results are not compatible with DAMA/LIBRA's assertion for their observation of annual modulation at $3.7{\sigma}$ and $2.6{\sigma}$, respectively. Performing a simple combination of the newly released 6-years datasets from both experiments find values consistent with no modulation at $0.0005 {\pm} 0.0019$ cpd/kg/keV in the 1-6 keV and $0.0027 {\pm} 0.0021$ cpd/kg/keV in the 2-6 keV energy regions with $4.68{\sigma}$ and $3.53{\sigma}$ respective exclusions of the DAMA/LIBRA signal.

          Connections between the cycle-to-cycle light curve and O-C variations of the non-Blazhko RR Lyrae stars

 - **Abstract**
 It has long been known that if the durations of the consecutive cycles of a pulsating star vary randomly, the O-C diagram could show quasi-periodic/irregular variations, even though the actual average period is constant. It is hypothesised that the period variation observed in many RR Lyrae stars, which are much faster and stronger than may be explained by an evolutionary origin, may in fact be caused by this cycle-to-cycle (C2C) variation effect. So far, quantitative studies have not really been performed, and space data have not been used at all. Our primary goal was to quantitatively analyse the O$-$C diagrams of RR Lyrae stars obtained from space photometry and explained by quasi-periodic or irregular periodic variations to see if they can be explained by random fluctuations in pulsation cycle length without assuming real period variations. We fitted statistical models to the O-C diagrams and tested their validity and fit. The necessary analysis of the light curves was performed using standard Fourier methods. We found that the vast majority of the O-C curves can be satisfactorily explained by assuming timing noise and the C2C variation without a real mean period variation. We have shown that the strength of the C2C variation is strongly dependent on the pulsation period and metallicity. These correlations suggests that turbulent convection may be behind the C2C variation. The additional frequencies of some RR Lyrae stars and their variation over time play only a marginal role in O-Cs. We have found new arguments that the phase jump phenomenon in RRc stars is in fact a continuous change, moreover, it could also be caused by the C2C variation.

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce an updated version of our deep learning tool that predicts stellar parameters from the optical spectra of young low-mass stars with intermediate spectral resolution. We adopt a conditional invertible neural network (cINN) architecture to infer the posterior distribution of stellar parameters and train our cINN on two Phoenix stellar atmosphere model libraries (Settl and Dusty). Compared to the cINNs presented in our first study, the updated cINN considers the influence of the relative flux error on the parameter estimation and predicts an additional fourth parameter, veiling. We test the performance of cINN on synthetic test models to quantify the intrinsic error of the cINN as a function of relative flux error and on 36 class III template stars to validate the performance on real spectra. Using our cINN, we estimate the stellar parameters of young stars in Trumpler 14 (Tr14) in the Carina Nebula Complex, observed with VLT-MUSE, and compare them with those derived using the classical template fitting method. We provide Teff, log g, Av, and veiling values measured by our cINN as well as stellar ages and masses derived from the HR diagram. Our parameter estimates generally agree well with those measured by template fitting. However, for K- and G-type stars, the Teff derived from template fitting is, on average, 2-3 subclasses hotter than the cINN estimates, while the corresponding veiling values from template fitting appear to be underestimated compared to the cINN predictions. We obtain an average age of 0.7(+3.2)(-0.6) Myr for the Tr14 stars. By examining the impact of veiling on the equivalent width-based classification, we demonstrate that the main cause of temperature overestimation for K- and G-type stars in the previous study is that veiling and effective temperature are not considered simultaneously in their process.

 - **Abstract**
 ALeRCE (Automatic Learning for the Rapid Classification of Events) processes the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) alert stream in preparation for the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, classifying objects using a broad taxonomy. The ALeRCE light curve classifier is a balanced random forest (BRF) algorithm with a two-level scheme that uses variability features from the ZTF alert stream and colors from AllWISE and ZTF photometry. This work presents an updated version of the ALeRCE broker light curve classifier that includes tidal disruption events (TDEs) as a new subclass. We incorporated 24 new features, including the distance to the nearest source detected in ZTF science images and a parametric model of the power-law decay for transients. The labeled set was expanded to 219792 spectroscopically classified sources, including 60 TDEs. To integrate TDEs into ALeRCE's taxonomy, we identified specific characteristics that distinguish them from other transients: their central position in a galaxy, their typical decay pattern when fully disrupted, and their lack of color variability after disruption. We developed features to separate TDEs from other transient events. The updated classifier improves performance across all classes and integrates the TDE class with 91 percent recall. It also identifies a large number of potential TDE candidates in the ZTF alert stream's unlabeled data.

 - **Abstract**
 We consider models of inflation that contain a transient non-slow-roll stage and investigate the conditions under which a dip appears in the power spectrum of the curvature perturbation. Using the $\delta N$ formalism, we derive a general relation between the comoving curvature perturbation ${\cal{R}}$ and the scalar field perturbation $\delta\varphi$ and its velocity perturbation $\delta\pi$. Compared with the result obtained in linear perturbation theory, it turns out that properly taking account of the $\delta\pi$ contribution is essential to reproduce the dip in the power spectrum. Namely, the curvature perturbation is proportional to a specific linear combination of $\delta\varphi$ and $\delta\pi$ at the linear order. We also investigate the non-linearity at the dip scale and find that models with a bump or an upward step exhibit much larger non-linearity than ultra-slow-roll and Starobinsky's linear potential models. Finally, we demonstrate the importance of non-linearity by computing the probability density functions (PDFs) for the above-mentioned models and show that highly asymmetric PDFs are realised for models with a bump or a step.

 - **Abstract**
 Terrestrial exoplanets orbiting nearby small, cool stars known as M dwarfs are well suited for atmospheric characterisation. Given the strong XUV irradiation from M dwarf host stars, orbiting exoplanets are thought to be unable to retain primordial H/He-dominated atmospheres. However, the survivability of heavier secondary atmospheres is currently unknown. The aim of the Hot Rocks Survey programme is to determine if exoplanets can retain secondary atmospheres in the presence of M dwarf hosts. Among the sample of 9 exoplanets in the programme, here we aim to determine whether TOI-1468 b has a substantial atmosphere or is consistent with a low-albedo bare rock. The James Webb Space Telescope provides an opportunity to characterise the thermal emission with MIRI at 15 $\mu$m. TOI-1468 b's occultation was observed three times. We compare our observations to atmospheric models including varying amounts of CO$_{2}$ and H$_{2}$O. The observed occultation depth for the individual visits are 239$\pm$52 ppm, 341$\pm$53 ppm and 357$\pm$52 ppm. A joint fit yields an occultation depth of 311$\pm$31 ppm. The thermal emission is mostly consistent with no atmosphere and zero Bond albedo at 1.65-$\sigma$ confidence level or a blackbody at a brightness temperature of 1024$\pm$78 K. A pure CO$_{2}$ or H$_{2}$O atmosphere with a surface pressure above 1 bar is ruled out over 3-$\sigma$. Surprisingly, TOI-1468 b presents a surface marginally hotter than expected, hinting at an additional source of energy on the planet. It could originate from a temperature inversion, induction heating or be an instrumental artifact. The results within the Hot Rocks Survey build on the legacy of studying the atmospheres of exoplanets around M dwarfs. The outcome of this survey will prove useful to the large-scale survey on M dwarfs recently approved by the STScI.

 - **Abstract**
 New far ultraviolet imaging of the galaxy NGC 205 is presented, which shows the emission is significantly offset ($\sim5^{\prime\prime}$ NW) from the optical and infrared centers of the galaxy. Spectral energy distribution (SED) modelling is applied to investigate the spatial dependence of the star formation history (SFH) of NGC 205, using data from far ultraviolet to far infrared. The SED model includes young and old stellar populations, gas emission, dust emission and dust absorption. The old stellar population has a total mass of $1.1\times10^8$ M$_{\odot}$ whereas the young population has a much smaller total mass of 3200 M$_{\odot}$. The best forms of SFH for old and young stars are found to be exponentially declining bursts with start times $t_0$ yr ago and e-folding times $\tau$ yr. The old stellar population has uniform $t_0$=9.5 Gyr, with $\tau$ decreasing with radius from 1 Gyr to 500 Myr. The young stellar population has $t_0$=900 Myr and $\tau$=800 Myr, both uniform across NGC 205. The young and old stellar mass surface densities are exponential in radius with scale lengths of 40 and 110 pc, respectively. The dust heating has a $\sim$40\% contribution from young stars and $\sim$60\% from old stars.

 - **Abstract**
 It has been observed that the hint about phantom crossing in the DESI BAO observation might point to non-minimally coupled gravity. We analyzed DESI DR2 BAO together with CMB and Type Ia supernova data to constrain non-minimal coupling of gravity in the effective field theory (EFT) approach. Using a non-parametric method to infer the EFT functions, we found that with DESI BAO, DESY5 SN, and Planck CMB data the signal for non-minimal coupling reaches $\sim3\sigma$. It is found that current data can constrain up to the quadratic order $(n=2)$ if the EFT function representing non-minimal coupling is Taylor expanded as a general function of the dark energy fraction $\Omega_{\rm{DE}}$, i.e. $\Omega^{\text{EFT}}(a)=\sum_{i=0}^{n} c^{\rm{EFT}}_i \Omega^i_{\text{DE}}(a)$. This calls for a more flexible parametrization of the EFT functions than commonly used ones in literature.

          Characterising M dwarf host stars of two candidate Hycean worlds

 - **Abstract**
 Planetary systems orbiting M dwarf host stars are promising targets for atmospheric characterisation of low-mass exoplanets. Accurate characterisation of M dwarf hosts is important for detailed understanding of the planetary properties and physical processes, including potential habitability. Recent studies have identified several candidate Hycean planets orbiting nearby M dwarfs as promising targets in the search for habitability and life on exoplanets. In this study, we characterise two such M dwarf host stars, K2-18 and TOI-732. Using archival photometric and spectroscopic observations, we estimate their effective temperatures (T$_{\mathrm{eff}}$) and metallicities through high-resolution spectral analyses and ages through gyrochronology. We assess the stellar activity of the targets by analysing activity-sensitive chromospheric lines and X-ray luminosities. Additionally, we predict activity cycles based on measured rotation periods and utilise photometric data to estimate the current stellar activity phase. We find K2-18 to be 2.9-3.1 Gyr old with T$_{\mathrm{eff}}$ = 3645$\pm$52 K and metallicity of [Fe/H] = 0.10$\pm$0.12 dex, and TOI-732 to be older (6.7-8.6 Gyr), cooler (3213$\pm$92 K), and more metal-rich ([Fe/H] = 0.22$\pm$0.13 dex). Both stars exhibit relatively low activity making them favourable for atmospheric observations of their planets. The predicted activity cycle and analysis of available high-precision photometry for K2-18 suggest that it might have been near an activity minimum during recent JWST observations, though some residual activity may be expected at such minima. We predict potential activity levels for both targets to aid future observations, and highlight the importance of accurate characterisation of M dwarf host stars for exoplanet characterisation.

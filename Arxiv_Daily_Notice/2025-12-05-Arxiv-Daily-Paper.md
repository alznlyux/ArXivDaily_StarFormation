#### Title:
          Pleiades Binary Fraction Revisited

- **Abstract**
 One of the nearest and best studied open clusters, Pleiades is an important cornerstone of stellar astrophysics. Despite its role as reference coeval stellar population, its multiplicity properties remain vaguely determined. The combined use of Gaia DR3 multiband photometry, astrometric parameter RUWE, non-single star solutions along with available ground-based spectroscopic, high angular resolution, and polarimetric observations enable more robust constraints on the binary star population in the cluster. Several conclusions may have broader implications for other stellar populations. Twin binaries, with mass ratio close to $q\sim 1$, tend to have lower RUWE, increasing their membership selection probability, relative to $q\sim 0.5$ systems that are disfavored. The frequently observed peak in mass ratio distribution for $q\sim 1$ binaries may be partially attributed to this bias. Photometrically fitted mass ratio is underestimated for double-lined spectroscopic binaries in agreement with other authors. Differential extinction photometrically mimics stellar binarity. An area of enlarged absorption is traced by increased polarization south of the Merope star and excluded from the analysis to avoid this bias. The fraction of systems with $q>0.6$ companions is measured to be $f=16.4\%^{+2.6}_{-0.6}$ for $m>0.5~M_\odot$ stars, which is larger than recent Gaia-based estimates, but compatible with the pre-Gaia values for Pleiades and the field population. Binary fraction shows no steady increase with stellar mass in the 0.5 $-$ 1.2 $M_\odot$ range, while mass ratio has a bimodal distribution with a minimum near $q\sim 0.7$.

- **Abstract**
 Giant impacts between planetary embryos are a natural step in the terrestrial planet formation process and are expected to create disks of warm debris in the terrestrial regions of their stars. Understanding the gas and dust debris produced in giant impacts is vital for comprehending and constraining models of planetary collisions. We reveal the distribution of millimeter grains in the giant impact debris disk of HD 172555 for the first time, using new ALMA 0.87 mm observations at $\sim$80 mas (2.3 au) resolution. We modeled the interferometric visibilities to obtain basic spatial properties of the disk, and compared it to the disk's dust and gas distributions at other wavelengths. We detect the star and dust emission from an inclined disk out to $\sim$9 au and down to 2.3 au (on-sky) from the central star, with no significant asymmetry in the dust distribution. Radiative transfer modeling of the visibilities indicates the disk surface density distribution of millimeter grains most likely peaks around $\sim$5 au, while the width inferred remains model-dependent at the S/N of the data. We highlight an outward radial offset of the small grains traced by scattered light observations compared to the millimeter grains, which could be explained by the combined effect of gas drag and radiation pressure in the presence of large enough gas densities. Furthermore, SED modeling implies a size distribution slope for the millimeter grains consistent with the expectation of collisional evolution and flatter than inferred for the micron-sized grains, implying a break in the grain size distribution and confirming an overabundance of small grains.

          Fractal Aggregate Aerosols in the Virga Cloud Code II: Exploring the Effects of Key Cloud Parameters in Warm Neptune, Hot Jupiter and Brown Dwarf Atmospheres

- **Abstract**
 Aerosols and clouds are expected to be ubiquitous in exoplanet and brown dwarf atmospheres, where they can have a significant impact on transmission and emission spectra. The cloud code Virga is capable of quickly modeling cloud particle sizes as a function of altitude, and has recently been updated to include functionality for aggregates (ranging from very fluffy chains to compact fractals). We analyze the effect that these aggregates have on transmission spectra for typical warm Neptune and hot Jupiter environments, as well as their effect on emission spectra for an L-type brown dwarf, over the wavelength range 0.3 - 15 um. We find significant, measurable differences in spectra when particle shape is changed (particularly the shortest wavelengths where particle morphology strongly affects the scattering slope). We provide some intuitive rules for how non-absorbing aggregates impact spectra: when particle sizes are small compared to the wavelength of light, the most elongated and chain-like particles have the highest opacities. When particles are large, the inverse is true (the most compact shapes have the highest opacities). We present an explanation for these effects in terms of the dynamics of how the particles form and move through the atmosphere, as well as in terms of fundamental optics theory. Given the significant impact that particle shape can have on spectra, we strongly encourage the community to include shape as a free parameter in future case studies, atmospheric models, and retrievals.

          Separating flare and secondary atmospheric signals with RADYN modeling of near-infrared JWST transmission spectroscopy observations of TRAPPIST-1

- **Abstract**
 Although TRAPPIST-1's temperate planets have the highest transmission signals of any known system, flares contaminate 50-70% of transits at the 1000 ppm level, far above 100 ppm secondary atmospheres. Efforts to mitigate flare contamination and assess impacts on radiation environments are each hampered by a lack of empirical spectral analysis and physics-based modeling. We present spectrotemporal analysis and radiative-hydrodynamic modeling of 5.5 hr of NIRISS and NIRSpec observations of 6 TRAPPIST-1 flares of 2.2-8.7x10^30 erg. Flare lines and continua are characterized using grid searches of RADYN beam-heating models spanning 10$^4\times$ in electron beam parameters. Best-fit models indicate these flares result from moderate-intensity beams with emergent electron fluxes of 10^12 erg s^-1 cm^-2 and energies $\leq$37 keV, although all models over-predict the Paschen jump. These models predict XUV, FUV, and NUV counterparts to the infrared peak fluxes of 8.9-28.9x10^27, 4.3-13.9x10^26, and 3.4-11.4x10^27 erg s^-1, respectively. Scaling the flare rate into the XUV suggests flaring contributes 1.35$_{-0.15}^{+2.0}\times$ quiescence yr$^{-1}$. We bin integrations of similar flare effective temperature to construct fiducial flare spectra from 2000-4500 K in order to develop separate empirical and RADYN-based mitigation pipelines. Both pipelines are applied to all 5.5 hr of R=10 data, resulting in maximum residuals from 1-2.8$\mu$m of 100-140 ppm and typical residuals of 54$\pm$14 and 65$\pm$17 ppm for the empirical and RADYN-based pipelines, respectively. Injection testing supports 3$\sigma$ detection capability for CO2 atmospheres with features of 150-250 ppm, with weak evidence (BF$\approx$3) still obtained at 130 ppm. Our results motivate multi-wavelength observations to improve model fidelity and test high-energy predictions.

          A distance measurement for blazar TXS 0506+056 using its radio variability and very long baseline images

- **Abstract**
 We present the results of constraining the angular diameter distance to blazar TXS 0506+056. We used data obtained with the 15 GHz VLBA in MJD 54838-60262 and data from the 15 GHz OVRO 40 m single dish telescope in MJD 54474-59023. We used a variability timescale and a causality argument of a linear size to measure the angular diameter distance to the source. To constrain the Doppler factor, we applied the relation between the rest-frame brightness temperature of the emission region and the observed brightness temperature. To calculate the observed brightness temperature, the angular size and flux density variation of the emission region are required. The angular size of the emission region (i.e., the VLBA core) was obtained from a FWHM, which is a circular Gaussian model-fitting parameter that ranges from 0.048-0.228 mas, and its uncertainty is determined to be 1.8-13 %. Using the OVRO SD light curve, we obtained a variability timescale of $128.0_{-0.3}^{+0.2}$ days and a peak flux density of $1.750_{-0.104}^{+0.015}$ Jy for the largest flare that peaked on MJD $58921.7_{-5.5}^{+2.6}$. We assumed a disk brightness geometry, equipartition brightness temperature ($5\times10^{10}$ K), and perfect radius. Using the VLBA core sizes obtained near the flare peaks, we found consistent distance measurement results with the $\Lambda$CDM model within 1$\sigma$ uncertainties. We suggest that the best distance from the source is $941_{-64}^{+59}$ Mpc, which is comparable with the $\Lambda$CDM distance of $948.2\pm13.5$ Mpc. The distance measurement should indeed be taken at the peak of a flare. We found that the decomposed timescale allowed us to obtain consistent distances with the $\Lambda$CDM. We strongly suggest to decompose light curves when the variability timescales are to be obtained properly.

- **Abstract**
 A Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) was detected crossing the radio signals transmitted by the Mars Express (MEX) and Tianwen-1 (TIW) spacecraft at a solar elongation of $4.4^{o}$. The impact of the CME was clearly identifiable in the spacecraft signal SNR, Doppler noise and phase residuals observed at the University of Tasmania's Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) antenna in Ceduna, South Australia. The residual phases observed from the spacecraft were highly correlated with each other during the transit of the CME across the radio ray-path despite the spacecraft signals having substantially different Doppler trends. We analyse the auto- and cross-correlations between the spacecraft phase residuals, finding time-lags ranging between 3.18-14.43 seconds depending on whether the imprinted fluctuations were stronger on the uplink or the downlink radio ray-paths. We also examine the temporal evolution of the phase fluctuations to probe the finer structure of the CME and demonstrate that there was a clear difference in the turbulence regime of the CME leading edge and the background solar wind conditions several hours prior to the CME radio occultation. Finally, autocorrelation of the MEX two-way radio Doppler noise data from Ceduna and closed-loop Doppler data from ESA's New Norcia ground station antenna were used to constrain the location of the CME impact along the radio ray-path \add{to a region 0.2 AU from the Sun, at a heliospheric longitude consistent with CME origin at the Sun. The results presented demonstrate the potential of the multi-spacecraft-in-beam technique for studying CME structures in great detail, and providing measurements that complement the capabilities of future solar monitoring instruments.

          JWST Exoplanetary Worlds and Elemental Survey (JEWELS) I: High-Precision Chemical Abundances of 20 FGK Planet-Hosting Stars from JWST Cycle 2

- **Abstract**
 We present high-precision chemical abundances for 20 FGK stars hosting planets observed in JWST Cycle 2 GO programs. Using high-resolution, high-signal-to-noise ratio spectra from the ESO and Keck archives, we perform a strict line-by-line differential analysis relative to the Sun to derive stellar parameters and abundances of 19 elements from C to Zn. The stars span effective temperatures of 4500-6500 K and metallicities from -0.57 to +0.50 dex. The sample includes hosts of both gas giants and terrestrial planets, allowing direct comparison between stellar composition and planetary properties. Several of the giant planets orbit metal-rich stars. The detailed abundance patterns show clear chemical diversity, including carbon-enhanced but mildly metal-poor stars (TOI-824, TOI-1130, GJ 9827) and $\alpha$-enhanced metal-poor stars (TOI-561, GJ 9827, TOI-824). These variations trace differences in protoplanetary disk composition and may influence planetary interiors and atmospheric chemistry. The planet-hosts show a range of [C/O] ratios, and the diverse [Mg/Si] ratios may suggest varied interior compositions for their rocky planets. This homogeneous stellar abundance, together with future uniform JWST planetary atmosphere measurements, provides a foundation for exploring the planet mass-metallicity relation and the connection between stellar chemistry and planetary formation pathways. These results constitute the first step in a larger survey spanning multiple JWST cycles to systematically examine how host star composition shapes exoplanetary systems.

- **Abstract**
 Stellar streams offer one of the most sensitive probes of the Milky Way`s gravitational potential, as their phase-space morphology encodes both the tidal field of the host galaxy and the internal structure of their progenitors. In this work, we introduce a framework that leverages Flow Matching and Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) to jointly infer the parameters of the GD-1 progenitor and the global properties of the Milky Way potential. Our aim is to move beyond traditional techniques (e.g. orbit-fitting and action-angle methods) by constructing a fully Bayesian, likelihood-free posterior over both host-galaxy parameters and progenitor properties, thereby capturing the intrinsic coupling between tidal stripping dynamics and the underlying potential. To achieve this, we generate a large suite of mock GD-1-like streams using our differentiable N-body code \textsc{\texttt{Odisseo}}, sampling self-consistent initial conditions from a Plummer sphere and evolving them in a flexible Milky Way potential model. We then apply conditional Flow Matching to learn the vector field that transports a base Gaussian distribution into the posterior, enabling efficient, amortized inference directly from stream phase-space data. We demonstrate that our method successfully recovers the true parameters of a fiducial GD-1 simulation, producing well-calibrated posteriors and accurately reproducing parameter degeneracies arising from progenitor-host interactions. Flow Matching provides a powerful, flexible framework for Galactic Archaeology. Our approach enables joint inference on progenitor and Galactic parameters, capturing complex dependencies that are difficult to model with classical likelihood-based methods.

- **Abstract**
 The transition regime between giant planets (GPs) and brown dwarfs (BDs) is still an open subject of study in exoplanetary science. A complete understanding of the population of long-period GPs and BDs would be pivotal in understanding this topic, but the number of such objects with precisely measured orbital and physical parameters is still small. Moreover, their dynamical influence on smaller companions in inner orbits is still unclear. Within the GAPS programme, we aim to confirm and characterize sub-stellar companion candidates from Gaia DR3, and to study the potential presence of additional lower-mass planets in their systems. We present the results of an intensive high-precision RV monitoring of HD 128717, which hosts the astrometric candidate Gaia-ASOI-009. We used the HARPS-N spectrograph at TNG to collect a high-cadence RV time series of the target. We used MCMC analyses to refine the Gaia DR3 orbital solution of the companion and, finally, performed a combined model of RV and proper motion anomaly (PMa) to derive the complete 3-D orbit of the companion. We also ran a suite of numerical simulations to confirm our results. We confirm the sub-stellar nature of Gaia-ASOI-009, i.e. Gaia-6 B: from the combined RV+PMa fit, we confirm that it is a high-eccentricity low-mass brown dwarf with $P_\text{B} = 9.37^{+0.06}_{-0.05}$ yr, $M_\text{B} = 19.8 \pm 0.5$ $M_\text{J}$, $e_\text{B}=0.85$, $i_\text{B} = 130^{\circ}$. The derived orbital solution differs significantly from the one published in Gaia DR3. Through a series of dedicated simulations, we demonstrate that this discrepancy arises from a degeneracy in the Gaia DR3 astrometric solution. Specifically, the combination of Gaia-6 B long orbital period and high eccentricity, both poorly constrained by the limited timespan of DR3, led to an incorrect solution characterized by a shorter period and lower eccentricity.

          Connections between the cycle-to-cycle light curve and O-C variations of the Blazhko RR Lyrae stars

- **Abstract**
 Recent studies have shown that the irregular O-C variations observed in many non-Blazhko RR Lyrae stars may result from random, cycle-to-cycle (C2C) variations in their light curves. However, centuries-long data series reveal that the O-C diagrams of Blazhko stars exhibit particularly large-amplitude, irregular variations. In this Letter, we extend the previous investigation of non-Blazhko stars to Kepler Blazhko stars to explore the role of C2C variations in the O-C diagrams. We derived the O-C diagrams from Kepler space telescope light curves using a precise template-fitting method. Based on their Fourier analyses, we also constructed residual O-C diagrams that were pre-whitened for frequencies associated with the Blazhko effect. We then fitted the same statistical models to both types of O-Cs that we had previously applied to non-Blazhko stars. The optimal statistical model includes the C2C variation for 74% of the O-C curves in our Blazhko sample, and the parameter describing the strength of the C2C variation is significantly larger than that obtained for non-Blazhko stars. This may explain the strong irregular O-C variations previously observed in Blazhko stars. Furthermore, we found a strong positive correlation between the C2C variation strength and the amplitude of the frequency-modulation component of the Blazhko effect, indicating a connection between the two phenomena.

- **Abstract**
 The metallicity of the star-forming environment is a fundamental parameter shaping the evolution of protoplanetary disks and the formation of planetary systems, yet its influence remains poorly constrained. We present a spectroscopic study of low-mass pre-main sequence (PMS) stars ($M < 1 \, M_\odot$) in the exceptionally metal-poor cluster Dolidze~25 ($Z \approx 0.2 \, Z_\odot$), using VLT/MUSE observations to probe accretion processes and disk evolution in a subsolar environment. We identify 132 cluster members using a combination of \textit{Gaia} astrometry and spectroscopic youth indicators, including lithium absorption and Balmer emission. The stellar parameters are derived using low-metallicity BT-Settl models yielding effective temperatures, extinctions, luminosities enabling robust estimates of stellar masses and ages. Mass accretion rates ($\dot{M}_\mathrm{acc}$) derived from H$\alpha$ emission span $10^{-10}$--$10^{-8} \, M_\odot\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ with a median value of \(8 \times 10^{-10}\,M_\odot\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}\). These rates are comparable to those in solar-metallicity regions of similar age, such as Lupus and Orion, indicating minimal metallicity dependence in accretion processes. Our analysis shows that using solar-metallicity templates to fit low-metallicity stars leads to systematic overestimations of \(T_\mathrm{eff}\) (by approximately \(300\,\mathrm{K}\)) and \(A_V\) (by around \(0.5\,\mathrm{mag}\)), underscoring the importance of employing metallicity-matched models for reliable characterization in low-\(Z\) environments. We present flux-calibrated, extinction-corrected spectra of these metal-poor PMS stars as a valuable resource for future investigations of disk evolution in subsolar regimes.

- **Abstract**
 The luminosity of embedded protostars is commonly measured via observations of the dust continuum spectral energy distribution from millimetre to infrared wavelengths. However, this method cannot be applied to embedded protostars in binary or multiple systems, where their components are usually unresolved over this extended wavelength range. We propose a new method, based on the idea that a molecule formed (mainly) on the grain surfaces only emits lines in the region where it thermally sublimates from the grain mantles, heated by the photons emitted by the embedded source. In this respect, carbonyl sulfide (OCS) is an optimal molecule, because of its low binding energy and rotational lines in the millimetre. We apply the method to the protobinary system NGC1333 IRAS4A, using ALMA high-spatial resolution ($\sim$50 au) observations of the OCS(19-18) line as part of the ALMA Large Program FAUST. We also present new quantum mechanics calculations of the OCS binding energy distribution, essential for the application of the method. We found that the two binary components, A1 and A2, have a comparable luminosity within the error bars, 7.5$\pm$2.5 and 7$\pm$1 L$_\odot$, respectively. We discuss the reliability of the estimated luminosities and the potential of this new method for measuring the luminosity of embedded protostars in binary and multiple systems.

- **Abstract**
 Interstellar objects (ISOs) ejected from planetary systems carry kinematic signatures of their formation environments. The properties of these velocity distributions govern the ISOs' propagation and dynamical evolution in the Galactic potential. We investigate how planetary system architecture influences ISO production during post-gas-disc dynamical instabilities using N-body simulations. We explore the ISO production outcomes of 2461 randomly generated systems spanning total system masses of 300-800 Earth masses and multiplicities of 3-7 planets. By integrating planets embedded in a disc of test particles for 10 Myr, we find that evolving systems can be broadly divided into two distinct classes based on their initial architectures. Catastrophic systems are characterized by high multiplicities and orbitally compact configurations, or by high-mass planets in systems with large mass asymmetries. These systems eject a large fraction of their planetesimals (median 59 percent) and, depending on the ejection pathway, produce high-speed ISOs (median 2.9 km/s). In contrast, quiet systems have lower masses and multiplicities and do not undergo significant orbital rearrangement, yet still eject a median of 28 percent of planetesimals at lower velocities (median 1.6 km/s). This dichotomy points to distinct ejection pathways, involving either violent global instabilities or more gradual, diffusive processes. Overall, we find that ISO ejection velocities are typically low, on the order of a few km/s. Although ISOs subsequently experience dynamical heating as they orbit the Galaxy, their velocity distributions retain signatures of their progenitor systems' architectures and histories, underscoring the potential use of ISOs in Galactic archaeology.

- **Abstract**
 High-energy irradiation in X-rays and UV (XUV) can transform the planetary atmospheres through photoevaporation and photochemistry. This is more crucial for M stars, whose habitable zones for Earth-like planets are located within a few percent of an AU. Transiting exoplanets around M dwarfs offer the opportunity to study their characteristics and habitability conditions. L 98-59 is an M3 dwarf hosting six Earth-like planets, with two of them in the habitable zone of the star. X-ray observations made in 2020 and 2021 detected significant flares above a quiescent luminosity of 4-10 x 10^26 erg/s. We present the results from two short XMM-Newton observations of L 98-59, which are part of a monitoring survey to detect long-term X-ray variability and activity cycles. In October 2024 the X-ray quiescent luminosity of the star was about 5.9 x 10^25 erg/s, and it was about 6.3 x 10^26 erg/s in February 2025. We speculate that in late 2024 the star had a minimum of activity; in 2021 the star was near a maximum of an activity cycle, and in 2025 it was at the middle of the cycle. We suggest a coarse estimate of the period of about 2 years and a peak-to-peak amplitude of about 10, which is the highest among the stars with a known X-ray cycle other than the Sun. We also infer that even the outer planet in the habitable zone, L 98-59f, is exposed to an X-ray dose between 100 and 1600 times the X-ray irradiation of the Earth in the XMM band.

- **Abstract**
 The distance to the Vela Junior supernova remnant (RX J0852.0-4622 or G266.2-1.2) has long remained uncertain, limiting our understanding of its physical properties. Using VLT/MUSE integral field spectroscopy, we uncover chemical and kinematic connections between the nebula surrounding its Central Compact Object (CXOU J085201.4-461753) and the nearby Herbig-Haro outflow of Ve 7-27 (Wray 16-30), indicating a shared nitrogen-rich, Fe-peak-enhanced environment. This link ties stellar birth and death, with the young star Ve 7-27 embedded in material expelled by Vela Junior's massive progenitor, and the remnant's blast wave is expanding through the same medium. Adopting the Gaia-based distance to Ve 7-27, we revise Vela Junior's distance to $1.41\pm0.14$ kpc. At this distance, the remnant's physical radius is $23.3\pm2.3$ pc, and X-ray proper motions of the northwestern rim correspond to shock speeds of $(2.8\pm0.7)\times10^3$ to $(5.6\pm1.5)\times10^3$ km s$^{-1}$. These imply an age of $\sim$1.6-3.3 kyr and a very low ambient density, indicating that Vela Junior is expanding within a highly rarefied wind-blown cavity carved by a massive progenitor -- consistent with the non-detection of strong thermal X-ray emission. This distance update also resolves long-standing inconsistencies, with major implications for its energy budget, particle acceleration efficiency, and compact object evolution.

- **Abstract**
 In this work we derive analytic expressions and numerical recipes for finding the effective observed position of sources close enough on sky that their Point Spread Functions (PSF), modelled as Gaussian profiles, overlap. In particularly we derive these for an elongated PSF, with a long and short axis, such as we would see from an instrument with a rectangular or elliptical mirror (relevant, for example, for the Gaia mission). We show that in this case the problem can be reduced to a one dimensional brightness profile with extrema along the line connecting the two sources, with an effective PSF width that depends on the relative orientation of the PSF and its degree of elongation. The problem can then be expressed in units of this effective width to be a function of the relative separation and light ratio alone (thus reducing to a rescaling of the un-elongated case). We derive the minimum light ratio, for a given separation and effective width, above which two sources will be resolved. We map out numerical procedures for finding the positions of these extrema across all possible cases. Finally we derive the positional offset and deviance associated with observing a fixed pair of blended sources from a variety of orientations, showing that this can be a significant source of excess noise.

          Estimating Global Ejecta Mass Ratios in Tycho's SNR

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, as a follow-up to our similar analysis of Kepler's supernova remnant (SNR), we estimate total mass ratios of various ejecta elements in Tycho's SNR using Suzaku X-ray data. In our spectral analysis, we account for uncertainties arising from Suzaku's effective area calibration (5%-15%) and from the unknown filling factors of the various plasma components in our spectral model (1%-10%). We compare our calculated ejecta mass ratios to results from previous X-ray analyses of Tycho's SNR and to the nucleosynthesis results from Type Ia supernova simulations. Our estimated ejecta mass ratios for Tycho's SNR are only consistent with simulations that use a $\sim$90% attenuated $^{12}$C$+^{16}$O reaction rate (as for Kepler's SNR), are inconsistent with simulations involving a double detonation of a thick helium layer, and support a Type Ia explosion of normal luminosity where $\sim$85% of the ejecta has been heated by the reverse shock.

 - **Abstract**
 Supersonic turbulence plays a critical role in shaping astrophysical systems, from molecular clouds to the circumgalactic medium. Key properties of this turbulence include the Mach number, driving scale, and nature of the driving mechanism, which can be solenoidal (divergence-free), compressive (curl-free), or a mix of the two. A less studied property is the correlation time of the driving accelerations, $\tau_{\rm a}.$ While this timescale has a minimal impact on solenoidally-driven turbulence, we show that it has a strong impact on compressively-driven turbulence. Using high-resolution simulations with tracer particles, we analyze the evolution of density fluctuations, focusing on the PDF of the logarithmic density, $s$, and its rate of change, $\frac{ds}{dt},$ and the conditional statistics of $\frac{ds}{dt}$ and $\frac{d^2s}{dt^2}$. When the driving correlation time is comparable to the eddy turnover time, $\tau_{\rm a} \approx \tau_{\rm e},$ compressive driving leads to the formation of large, low-density voids in which the variance of $\frac{ds}{dt}$ is large. These are directly linked to sustained accelerated expansions, which results in a strong correlation between density and the divergence of the driving acceleration field. In contrast, when $\tau_{\rm a} \approx 0.1 \, \tau_{\rm e}$, compressive driving does not produce such voids, resulting in a narrower, less skewed distribution. We show using analytical estimates that $\tau_{\rm a}$ is may be significantly less than $\tau_{\rm e}$ in supernova-driven turbulence, highlighting the need to better understand the role of the driving correlation time in shaping the density structure of turbulent astrophysical systems.

 - **Abstract**
 The superfluid dark matter model offers an elegant solution to reconcile discrepancies between the predictions of the cold dark matter paradigm and observations on galactic scales. In this scenario, dark matter is composed of ultralight bosons with self-interactions that can undergo a superfluid phase transition in galactic environments. In this review, we explore the theoretical foundations of dark matter superfluidity, detailing the conditions required for the formation and stability of superfluid cores of astrophysical size. We examine the phenomenological consequences for galactic dynamics, including the impact on galaxy mergers, the formation of vortices, the behavior near supermassive black holes, modifications to dynamical friction, and the emergence of long-range interactions. By synthesizing theoretical developments with observational constraints, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the current status and future prospects of dark matter superfluidity as a viable extension of the standard cosmological model.

          Bridging Unstratified and Stratified Simulations of the Streaming Instability for $τ_s=0.1$ Grains

 - **Abstract**
 The streaming instability (SI), driven by aerodynamic coupling between solids and the gas under a global radial pressure gradient, concentrates solids and facilitates planetesimal formation. Unstratified simulations are commonly used to study the SI, based on the assumption that they approximate conditions near the disk midplane. However, it remains unclear how accurately these unstratified simulations capture the midplane dust-gas dynamics in stratified disks. To address this, we examine the saturated state of the SI in stratified simulations and compare dust-gas dynamics to those in unstratified simulations across various radial pressure gradients. To this end, we consider a dimensionless dust stopping time ($\tau_s$) of 0.1 and perform 2D axisymmetric, stratified simulations. We find that the formation of dust filaments during dust settling exhibits morphological similarities to those in unstratified simulations. In the saturated state, we find that as the pressure gradient increases, the velocity dispersions of the gas and dust, as well as the strength of dust diffusion, increase. Most importantly, at any given pressure gradient, the velocity dispersions and density distributions of the gas and dust in our stratified simulations closely match those in unstratified simulations. While further exploration across the parameter space is needed, our results suggest that, for $\tau_s=0.1$, unstratified simulations represents well the midplane dust--gas dynamics in stratified disks before any strong clumping occurs. Consequently, our results confirm that in the saturated state, the streaming turbulence in stratified simulations behaves similarly to that in unstratified simulations for the parameter values explored here.

          Cosmology with Topological Deep Learning

 - **Abstract**
 The standard cosmological model with cold dark matter posits a hierarchical formation of structures. We introduce topological neural networks (TNNs), implemented as message-passing neural networks on higher-order structures, to effectively capture the topological information inherent in these hierarchies that traditional graph neural networks (GNNs) fail to account for. Our approach not only considers the vertices and edges that comprise a graph but also extends to higher-order cells such as tetrahedra, clusters, and hyperedges. This enables message-passing between these heterogeneous structures within a combinatorial complex. Furthermore, our TNNs are designed to conserve the $E(3)$-invariance, which refers to the symmetry arising from invariance against translations, reflections, and rotations. When applied to the Quijote suite, our TNNs achieve a significant reduction in the mean squared error. Compared to our GNNs, which lack higher-order message-passing, ClusterTNNs show improvements of up to 22% in $\Omega_{\rm m}$ and 34% in $\sigma_8$ jointly, while the best FullTNN achieves an improvement of up to 60% in $\sigma_8$. In the context of the CAMELS suite, our models yield results comparable to the current GNN benchmark, albeit with a slight decrease in performance. We emphasize that our topology and symmetry-aware neural networks provide enhanced expressive power in modeling the large-scale structures of our universe.

          A tale of dynamical instabilities and giant impacts in the radius valley

 - **Abstract**
 The size distribution of planets with radii between 1 and $4 R_\oplus$ peaks near 1.4 and $2.2R_\oplus$, with a dip around $1.8 R_\oplus$ -- the so-called "radius valley." Recent statistical analyses suggest that planets within this valley ($1.5 < R < 2R_\oplus$) tend to have slightly higher orbital eccentricities than those outside it. The origin of this dynamical signature remains unclear. We revisit the "breaking the chains" formation model and propose that late dynamical instabilities -- occurring after disk dispersal -- may account for the elevated eccentricities observed in the radius valley. Our simulations show that sub-valley planets ($R < 2 R_\oplus$) are generally rocky, while those beyond the valley ($R > 2 R_\oplus$) are typically water-rich. Rocky planets that undergo strong dynamical instabilities and numerous late giant impacts have their orbits excited and their radii increased, ultimately placing them into the radius valley. In contrast, the larger, water-rich planets just beyond the valley experience weaker instabilities and fewer impacts, resulting in lower eccentricities. This contrast leads to a peak in the eccentricity distribution within the valley. The extent to which planets in the radius valley are dynamically excited depends sensitively on the orbital architecture before the orbital instability. Elevated eccentricities among radius valley planets arise primarily in scenarios that form a sufficiently large number of rocky planets within 100 days (typically $\gtrsim 5$) prior to instability, and that also host external perturbers ($P > 100$ days), which further amplify the strength of dynamical instabilities.

          Very-wide-orbit planets from dynamical instabilities during the stellar birth cluster phase

 - **Abstract**
 Gas giant planets have been detected on eccentric orbits several hundreds of astronomical units in size around other stars. It has been proposed that even the Sun hosts a wide-orbit planet of 5-10 Earth masses, often called Planet Nine, which influences the dynamics of distant Trans-Neptunian objects. However, the formation mechanism of such planets remains uncertain. Here we use numerical simulations to show that very wide-orbit planets are a natural byproduct of dynamical instabilities that occur in planetary systems while their host stars are still embedded in natal stellar clusters. A planet is first brought to an eccentric orbit with an apoastron of several hundred au by repeated gravitational scattering by other planets, then perturbations from nearby stellar flybys stabilise the orbit by decoupling the planet from the interaction with the inner system. In our Solar System, the two main events likely conducive to planetary scattering were the growth of Uranus and Neptune, and the giant planets instability. We estimate a 5-10% likelihood of creating a very wide-orbit planet if either happened while the Sun was still in its birth cluster, rising to 40% if both were. In our simulated exoplanetary systems, the trapping efficiency is 1-5\%. Our results imply that planets on wide, eccentric orbits occur at least $10^{-3}$ per star.

          Relationship between prominence eruptions and coronal mass ejections during solar cycle 24

 - **Abstract**
 In this article, we present the relationship between prominence eruptions (PEs) and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) from May 2010 to December 2019 covering most of solar cycle 24. We used data from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) for PEs and the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) for CMEs. We identified 1225 PEs, with 67% being radial, 32% transverse, and 1% failed PEs. The radial, transverse PEs, and the combined set have average speeds of ~53, 9, and 38 km/s, respectively. The PE association with CMEs is examined by assigning a confidence level (CL) from 0 (no association) to 3 (clear association). Out of 1225 PEs, 662 (54%) are found to be associated to CMEs including CL 1, 2, and 3. Our study reveals that the spatial and temporal relationships between PEs and CMEs vary over the solar cycle. During solar minima, CMEs tend to deflect towards the equator, possibly due to a stronger polar field. Temporal offsets are larger during solar maxima and smaller during the minima. This implies that the PEs appear in LASCO C2 FOV earlier during the minima than during the maxima. Among the 662 CMEs associated with PEs, 78% show clear bright core structures. Investigation of the morphological and temporal behavior of these CMEs indicate that the prominences evolves into CME cores at higher altitudes suggesting that PEs and CME cores are the same structure. The average speeds of the PEs, CME core, and CME leading edge are 62, 390, and 525 km/s, respectively. The speed of CME cores are more than the speed of PEs because the former are observed at larger heights where they have accelerated to higher speeds.

 - **Abstract**
 Power-law inflation has stood as a classical model in inflationary cosmology since the early 1980s, prized for its exact analytical solutions and ability to naturally resolve the Big Bang theory's horizon and flatness problems through exponential expansion. However, its simplest form appears incompatible with modern precision observations, motivating increasingly complex alternatives. In this work, we demonstrate previous predictions with Power-law inflation considered only a particular solution of the field equations, and derive the complete set of general analytical solutions that satisfy current theoretical and observational constraints. This finding revitalizes Power-law inflation as a viable framework, offering new possibilities for cosmological model-building while preserving its original mathematical elegance.

 - **Abstract**
 Photoionized gases are prevalent throughout the universe. In such gases, the ion concentration typically exhibits two response modes to radiation: a positive response in the low-ionization state and a negative response in the high-ionization state. Here, we report the discovery of a widespread misalignment at the boundary between the above two response modes, and identify a third mode-the hybrid response-through time-dependent photoionization simulations. This phenomenon arises from the asynchrony among the ionization rate, recombination rate, and ion column density. Among these, only the ionization rate can respond instantaneously to changes in radiation. Consequently, the initial rate of change in the column density of \( N_i \) ion is given by \( -N_i I_i + N_{i-1} I_{i-1} \). However, this quantity is typically nonzero at the peak of \( N_i \), leading to a misalignment between the boundaries of positive and negative responses. Such hybrid effects introduce additional complexity in the interpretation of gas properties, highlighting the need for further investigation.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the chromospheric LOS velocities during the GOES M3.2 flare (SOL2013-05-17T08:43) using simultaneous spectroscopic data of the He I 1083.0 nm triplet and Ca II 854.2 nm line. A filament was present in the flaring area. The observational data were acquired with the VTT (Tenerife, Spain) and covered the pre-flare, flare, and post-flare phases. Spectroscopic inversion techniques (HAZEL and STiC) were applied individually to He I and Ca II lines to recover the atmospheric parameters. Different inversion configurations were tested for Ca II and two families of solutions were found to explain the red asymmetry of the profiles: a redshifted emission feature or a blueshifted absorption feature. These solutions could explain two different flare scenarios (condensation vs. evaporation). The ambiguity was solved by comparing these results to the He I inferred velocities. At the front of the flare ribbon, we observed a thin, short-lived blueshifted layer. This is seen in both spectral regions but is much more pronounced in He I, with velocities of up to -10 km/s. In addition, at the front we found the coexistence of multiple He I profiles within one pixel. The central part of the ribbon is dominated by He I and Ca II redshifted emission profiles. A flare-loop system, visible only in He I absorption and not in Ca II, becomes visible in the post-flare phase and shows strong downflows at the footpoints of up to 39 km/s. In the flare, the Ca II line represents lower heights compared to the quiet Sun, with peak sensitivity shifting from $\log \tau \simeq -5.2$ to $\log \tau \simeq -3.5$. The inferred LOS velocities support a cool-upflow scenario at the leading edge of the flare. The solar filament in the region remained stable. The inclusion of the He I triplet in the analysis helped resolve the ambiguity between two possible solutions for the plasma velocities detected in the Ca II line.

          Minimising the numerical viscosity in Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics simulations of discs

 - **Abstract**
 Simulations using the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) technique typically include numerical viscosity to model shocks and maintain particle order on the kernel scale. This numerical viscosity is composed of linear and quadratic terms, with coefficients $\alpha_{\rm SPH}$ and $\beta_{\rm SPH}$ respectively. Setting these coefficients too high results in excessive numerical dissipation, whereas setting them too low may lead to unwanted effects such as particle penetration, which also leads to excess dissipation. In this study, we simulate accretion discs using the SPH code {\sc phantom} to investigate the effective disc viscosity arising from numerical viscosity. We model steady-state coplanar and circular discs with different values of $\alpha_{\rm SPH}$ and $\beta_{\rm SPH}$, from which we determine the coefficients that lead to minimum levels of numerical viscosity by maximising the steady-state disc surface density for the same mass input rate. We find that, for planar and circular discs, the default values of the numerical viscosity parameters in the {\sc phantom} code can be too high particularly for the quadratic term. As higher values of the coefficients are required to adequately capture strong shocks in the flow, we suggest that the coefficient of the quadratic term should be time-dependent in a similar manner to the presently used ``switches'' on the linear term. This can be simply achieved by setting $\beta_{\rm SPH}$ to be a constant multiple of $\alpha_{\rm SPH}$ with $\alpha_{\rm SPH}$ determined by an appropriate switch, as previously advocated in the literature.

 - **Abstract**
 Matched filtering is a common method for detecting gravitational waves. However, the computational costs of searching large template banks limit the efficiency of classical algorithms when searching for massive black hole binary (MBHB) systems. In this work, a quantum matched filtering algorithm based on Grover's algorithm is applied to the MBHB signals. It is demonstrated that the quantum approach can reduce the computational complexity from $O(N)$ to $O(\sqrt{N})$ theoretically, where $N$ is the size of the template bank. Simulated results indicate that the quantum-enhanced approach significantly reduces computational costs. However, it is also found that the performance can degrade in some cases due to instability of the algorithm. This highlights the need for more robust and stable quantum search strategies.

          JWST NIRISS Transmission Spectroscopy of the Super-Earth GJ 357b, a Favourable Target for Atmospheric Retention

 - **Abstract**
 We present a JWST NIRISS/SOSS transmission spectrum of the super-Earth GJ 357 b: the first atmospheric observation of this exoplanet. Despite missing the first $\sim$40 % of the transit due to using an out-of-date ephemeris, we still recover a transmission spectrum that does not display any clear signs of atmospheric features. We perform a search for Gaussian-shaped absorption features within the data but find that this analysis yields comparable fits to the observations as a flat line. We compare the transmission spectrum to a grid of atmosphere models and reject, to 3-$\sigma$ confidence, atmospheres with metallicities $\lesssim$100$\times$ solar ($\sim$4 g/mol) with clouds at pressures down to 0.01 bar. We analyse how the retention of a secondary atmosphere on GJ 357 b may be possible due to its higher escape velocity compared to an Earth-sized planet and the exceptional inactivity of its host star relative to other M2.5V stars. The star's XUV luminosity decays below the threshold for rapid atmospheric escape early enough that the volcanic revival of an atmosphere of several bars of CO$_2$ is plausible, though subject to considerable uncertainty. Finally, we model the feasibility of detecting an atmosphere on GJ 357 b with MIRI/LRS, MIRI photometry, and NIRSpec/G395H. We find that, with two eclipses, it would be possible to detect features indicative of an atmosphere or surface. Further to this, with 3-4 transits, it would be possible to detect a 1 bar nitrogen-rich atmosphere with 1000 ppm of CO$_2$.

          Structure and dynamics of erupting solar prominences using the Rolling Hough Transform: Toward a feature-oriented classification

 - **Abstract**
 The classification of solar prominences has proven to be challenging due to their diverse morphologies and dynamical behaviour. Complexity is heightened when considering eruptive prominences, where the dynamics demand methods capable of capturing detailed structural information. While there exists a range of line-of-sight (LOS) and plane-of-sky (POS) techniques which have advanced our understanding of prominence motions, they are subject to limitations, emphasising the need for effective methods of extracting structural information from prominence dynamics. We present a proof-ofconcept for the spatial Rolling Hough Transform (RHT) algorithm, which identifies finescale structural orientation in the POS, applied to prominence structure and dynamics. We demonstrate the RHT approach using two contrasting prominence dynamics events using SDO/AIA 304 Å observations: (1) a quiet-Sun eruption, (2) activation (swirl) of a polar-crown prominence. By analysing the light curves and movies from each event, we divide the events into distinct dynamical phases: from slow rise to drainage. The spatial RHT method enables us to extract structural information and localised dynamics for both events and the different evolution phases. We develop a classification to label the prominences as either radially or tangentially oriented structures. The quiet-Sun eruption has a predominately tangential structure in the slow-rise phase, but displays greater radial features during/after the eruption. The polar-swirl activation initially shows a strong radial contribution, which diminishes as more tangential structures appear during/after the activation. Our results demonstrate the successful application of the spatial RHT to prominences, leading to the classification of individual prominences and an insight into their dynamics.

 - **Abstract**
 Scientific CMOS (sCMOS) image sensors are a modern alternative to typical CCD detectors and are rapidly gaining popularity in observational astronomy due to their large sizes, low read-out noise, high frame rates, and cheap manufacturing. However, numerous challenges remain in using them due to fundamental differences between CCD and CMOS architectures, especially concerning the pixel-dependent and non-Gaussian nature of their read-out noise. One of the main components of the latter is the random telegraph noise (RTN) caused by the charge traps introduced by the defects close to the oxide-silicon interface in sCMOS image sensors, which manifests itself as discrete jumps in a pixel's output signal, degrading the overall image fidelity. In this work, we present a statistical method to detect and characterize RTN-affected pixels using a series of dark frames. Identifying RTN contaminated pixels enables post-processing strategies that mitigate their impact and the development of manufacturing quality metrics.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we perform a statistical inference of the classical background law governing the evolution of the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB), given by $T_{\rm CMB}(z) = T_0(1 + z)$. To this end, we employ Gaussian Process (GP) regression techniques to reconstruct the temperature evolution based on two observational datasets: (i) CMB-Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) cluster measurements and (ii) CMB-interstellar medium (ISM) interaction data. Our analysis reveals interesting results that may suggest potential deviations from the standard temperature-redshift relation, particularly at low redshifts ($z < 0.5$), where discrepancies up to $\sim$2$\sigma$ are observed. Additionally, we identify a mild but noteworthy tension, also at the $\sim$2$\sigma$ level, between our GP inferred value of the present-day CMB temperature, $T_{\rm CMB}(z=0)$, and the precise direct measurement from the COBE/FIRAS experiment. We also explore possible phenomenological implications of our findings, including interpretations associated with possible variations in fundamental constants, such as the fine-structure constant $\alpha$, which could provide a physical explanation for the observed deviations at low redshift.

 - **Abstract**
 The binarity of red supergiants (RSGs) influences their evolution and the fate of supernovae. We investigate the binary fraction of RSGs in the Andromeda Galaxy (M31) and Triangulum Galaxy (M33) using photometry from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), which offers high spatial resolution to resolve more RSGs. A preliminary step involves identifying a reliable and complete RSG sample using the F110W $-$ F160W versus F160W diagram, yielding 2,612 RSGs from the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury (PHAT) survey of M31 3,294 RSGs from the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury: Triangulum Extended Region (PHATTER) survey of M33. These samples suggest total RSG populations in M31 and M33 of 6,563 and 7,572, respectively. These estimates significantly exceed previous ones from the ground-based observations, an increase attributed to the superior spatial resolution of the HST. The stellar parameters of these RSGs, including effective temperature ($T_{\mathrm{eff}}$), radius ($R$), and luminosity ($L$), are derived by fitting their spectral energy distribution (SED) across optical and near-infrared bands. Binary candidates are identified by detecting ultraviolet (UV) excesses in their SEDs compared to the single-star RSG model prediction. The binary fraction is determined to be 33.4% $\pm$ 0.9% for M31 and 30.9% $\pm$ 0.8% for M33. For more luminous RSGs with log $L/L_{\odot} > 4.0$, the binary fraction decreases to 31.6% $\pm$ 1.9% in M31 and increases to 34.7% $\pm$ 1.8% in M33, respectively. These results are in good agreement with predictions from the BPASS binary evolution model.

 - **Abstract**
 Benchmark brown dwarfs in wide binary systems are crucial for characterizing substellar objects and calibrating atmospheric and evolutionary models. However, brown dwarf benchmarks with subsolar metallicity, very cool temperatures, or suitability for dynamical mass measurements are rare, limiting our understanding across the full range of mass, age, and metallicity. We present the discovery of two new multiple systems containing T dwarf companions, identified through a targeted search using CatWISE and Gaia databases. L 122-88 AB is a wide binary comprising a mildly metal-poor M2 dwarf and a T5 dwarf, separated by 215.6 arcsec at a distance of 33.106+/-0.014 pc. Atmospheric model fitting to the near infrared spectrum of L 122-88 A suggests a mildly metal-poor composition ([Fe/H] = -0.2). UPM J1040-3551 AB is a candidate hierarchical triple system at 25.283+/-0.013 pc, consisting of an M4 dwarf and a probable unresolved spectral binary of T7 and T8 dwarfs, separated by 65.48 arcsec from the primary. The H-alpha emission detected in UPM J1040-3551 A indicates an age range of 0.3-2.0 Gyr. This age estimate suggests that the T8 component has a mass between 9 and 28 Jupiter masses, potentially classifying it as a planetary-mass object. These systems augment the sample of benchmark brown dwarfs, particularly in the underexplored regime of cool temperature, providing valuable opportunities for refining our understanding of substellar objects.

 - **Abstract**
 High-spatial-resolution observations of disks around young stars suggest planetary systems begin forming early, during the protostellar phase (< 1 Myr) when stars accrete most of their mass via infall from the surrounding cloud. During this era shocks are expected to be ubiquitous around the gaseous accretion disk due to supersonic infall that strikes the disk. We investigate the role of shocks using a theoretical and modeling framework we call the shock twist-angle Keplerian (STAK) disk, connecting the disk and infalling envelope gas via a shock using general physical principles. Briefly, at the shock, energy is dissipated while angular momentum is conserved, so that the infalling gas must change direction sharply, yielding a bend or twist in the streamlines. The model's pre-shock gas follows free-fall parabolic trajectories, while the post-shock gas is on lower-energy, elliptical orbits. We construct synthetic observations and find that the deviations from circular Keplerian orbits are detectable in Doppler-shifted molecular spectral lines using radio interferometers such as ALMA. Specifically, the STAK model leads to line emission intensity and velocity-moment maps that are asymmetric and offset with respect to the disk structure traced by the dust continuum. We examine archival ALMA data for the class 0/I protostar L1527 and find the C$^{18}$O velocity moment map has features resembling the disk plus envelope emission that naturally arise when the two are connected by a shock. Thus, spectral line observations having sub-km/s spectral resolution and angular resolution sufficient to fully resolve the disk can reveal protostars' envelope-disk shocks.

 - **Abstract**
 Primordial Black Holes~(PBHs) are hypothetical black holes with a wide range of masses that formed in the early universe. As a result, they may play an important cosmological role and provide a unique probe of the early universe. A PBH with an initial mass of approximately $10^{15}$~g is expected to explode today in a final burst of Hawking radiation. In this work, we conduct an all-sky search for individual PBH burst events using the data collected from March 2021 to July 2024 by the Water Cherenkov Detector Array of the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO). Three PBH burst durations, 10~s, 20~s, and 100~s, are searched, with no significant PBH bursts observed. The upper limit on the local PBH burst rate density is set to be as low as 181~pc$^{-3}$~yr$^{-1}$ at 99$\%$ confidence level, representing the most stringent limit achieved to date.

 - **Abstract**
 $\delta N$ formalism is a useful method to calculate the curvature perturbation. Contrary to what it is typically done in the literature, we re-formulate the $\delta N$ formalism by using the $e$-folding number $n$ counted forward in time. For a fixed initial time $\bar{n}_0$, the probability density function (PDF) of the initial conditions $\delta\phi_0$ and $\delta\pi_0$ are specified by the solutions of the perturbation equation on subhorizon scales. As $\delta\pi_0$ is fully correlated with $\delta\phi_0$ after horizon exit, we find a simple formula to calculate the curvature perturbation as well as its PDF by using the $\delta N$ method reformulated in terms of $n$, the $\delta n$ formalism.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the a near complete spectral energy distribution (SED) for an extrasolar world: the T8 brown dwarf 2MASS~J04151954$-$0935066. Spanning from optical to mid-infrared (0.7--20.4 micron) wavelengths, the SED for this substellar atmosphere is constructed from new JWST NIRSpec G395H ($R\sim$2700) and Magellan FIRE echelle ($R\sim$8000) near-infrared spectra, along with MIRI mid-infrared photometry complemented by spectra from Keck I, IRTF, Magellan, AKARI, Spitzer and photometry from various surveys and missions. The NIRSpec G395H spectrum reveals strong molecular absorptions from NH$_{3}$, CH$_{4}$, H$_{2}$S, CO$_{2}$ and H$_{2}$O at approximately 3.00, 3.35, 3.95, 4.25, and 5.00 micron respectively, along with the presence of a CO absorption feature detected mainly at $\sim$ 4.6 micron. We detect no absorption of near-infrared K I doublets in the $R\sim8000$ FIRE spectra. In the mid-infrared IRS spectrum, we tentatively identify a new CO$_{2}$ feature at 14--16 micron. The comprehensive SED allows us to empirically constrain bolometric luminosity, effective temperature, mass and radius. Additionally, we demonstrate that the NIRSpec G395H resolution, the highest allowable by JWST, enables a precise radial velocity measurement of $47.1\pm1.8$ km s$^{-1}$ for the object, in agreement with previous measurements.

 - **Abstract**
 The discovery of ultra-high-energy neutrinos by IceCube marked the beginning of neutrino astronomy. Yet, the origin and production mechanisms of these neutrinos remain open questions. With the recent observation of the highest-energy neutrino event to date by the KM3NeT collaboration, transient sources - astrophysical objects that emit particles in brief, localized bursts - have emerged as promising candidates. In this work, we revisit the identification of such sources in IceCube and future neutrino telescopes, focusing on how both the timing and sky localization of the source affect the detection sensitivity. We highlight the crucial role of the source's right ascension in determining the effective area of detectors not located at the poles, such as KM3NeT, and present a framework to consistently account for this dependence. As a case study, we investigate evaporating primordial black holes (PBHs) as transient neutrino sources, showing that the detection prospects and localization accuracy are strongly influenced by the PBH's position in the sky. Our results emphasize the complementarity between neutrino and gamma-ray observatories and showcase the potential of a global network of neutrino detectors to identify and localize transient events that might be missed by traditional photon-based instruments.

          CGCS 6306, another X-ray-emitting asymptotic giant branch star confirmed to be a symbiotic binary

 - **Abstract**
 A number of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars are known to exhibit UV excess and/or X-ray emission. These have been considered signposts of a hot white dwarf (WD) companion in a symbiotic system (SySt), but AGB stars are so bright that they easily outshine these companions hampering their detection at optical wavelengths. A recent multi-wavelength investigation on the X-ray-emitting AGB (X-AGB) star Y Gem has confirmed the presence of a WD companion and, thus, its SySt nature. Our goal is to explore the true nature of another X-AGB star, namely CGCS 6306, to investigate whether some objects from this group may in fact be unnoticed symbiotic systems with AGB donors. Optical spectra and photometric data, together with X-ray observations, have been analyzed to investigate the properties of the stellar components and accretion process in CGCS 6306. CGCS 6306 is a carbon Mira with a pulsation period of 362 days. Its optical spectrum exhibits the typical saw-shaped features of molecular absorptions in addition to H I and He I recombination and [O I] and [O III] forbidden emission lines. The H$\alpha$ line profile is broad, which can be interpreted as evidence for an accretion disk. The X-ray spectrum is hard, typical of highly-extincted hot plasma emission, and the X-ray luminosity is $\approx10^{32}$ erg s$^{-1}$. The detection of high-excitation optical emission lines and the X-ray properties of CGCS 6306 confirm the presence of a WD companion, making it a bona-fide $\delta$-type X-SySt. Its X-ray luminosity is comparable to that of Y Gem, the other X-AGB confirmed to be a SySt, which was found to exhibit a high accretion rate. The lack of suitable information on the UV and blue optical properties of CGCS 6306, however, precludes a definitive estimate of the accretion rate in this system. Since CGCS 6306 is a carbon Mira, it adds to the small group of Galactic carbon SySts.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations from DESI DR2 are challenging the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm by suggesting that the equation-of-state parameter of dark energy evolves across $w = -1$, a phenomenon known as the Quintom scenario. Inspired by this development, we present a staged review of Quintom cosmology including its theoretical foundations, observational supports, and implications as well as possible extensions. We first trace the historical progression from Einstein's static cosmological constant to modern dynamical dark energy, summarizing recent cosmological constraints that favor an evolving $w(z)$ along time. A key focus is the theoretical no-go theorem for dark energy showing that no single canonical field or perfect fluid model can smoothly cross the $w = -1$ boundary. We then survey viable Quintom constructions, including two-field models, single-scalar fields with higher derivatives, modified gravity frameworks, and an effective field theory approach that unifies these mechanisms. Possible interactions of Quintom fields with ordinary matter and the potential roles in yielding non-singular universe solutions are discussed.

          What solves the Hubble tension in phenomenological dark energy models at background level?

 - **Abstract**
 Few phenomenological models tend to favour higher values of the Hubble parameter, often at the expense of invoking phantom transitions. These models achieve this without introducing additional parameters, akin to the simplicity of the concordance $\Lambda$CDM model. In this work, we investigate two such models -- Phenomenologically Emergent Dark Energy (PEDE) and Granda-Oliveros Holographic Dark Energy (GOHDE) -- to assess how correlations between $H_0$ and $\Omega_m$, as well as the choice of datasets, influence conclusions regarding their potential to address the Hubble tension at the background level. We find that minimally extended versions of these models favour notably low values for the Hubble parameter, with the perceived preference for higher values driven by the associated prior. Excluding BAO Ly$\alpha$-$H(z)$ data points at a redshift of $\sim 2.3$ results in a Hubble parameter that remains in significant tension with SH0ES measurements. In contrast, including these data points favours a higher $H_0$, as they suggest a relatively lower matter density within the framework of the assumed fiducial cosmology. Additionally, recent DESI DR1 and DR2 data exhibit mild tension with BAO-$H(z)$ estimates from SDSS. We demonstrate that the inclusion of stringent constraints, such as the CMB shift-parameter along with Pantheon$^+$, on the effective pressure less matter density significantly impacts the estimation of the Hubble parameter. Finally, reinterpreting these models in terms of interacting dark sectors with $Q = 3H\gamma_{\Lambda}\tilde{\rho}_{m}$ reveals that addressing the Hubble tension necessitates a varying $\gamma_{\Lambda}$ characterised by a singular sign-switch behaviour. This phantom behaviour, or equivalently, the onset of violation of the null energy condition in the future, is crucial for minimal models to solve the Hubble tension.

          Identification of New Candidate Be/X-Ray Binary Systems in the Small Magellanic Cloud via Analysis of S-CUBED Source Catalog

 - **Abstract**
 It has long been known that a large population of Be/X-ray Binaries (BeXRBs) exists in the Milky Way's neighboring dwarf galaxy, the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), due to a recent period of intense star formation. Since 2016, efforts have been made to monitor this population and identify new BeXRBs through the Swift SMC Survey (S-CUBED). S-CUBED's weekly observation cadence has identified many new BeXRBs that exist within the SMC, but evidence suggests that more systems exist that have thusfar escaped detection. A major challenge in identifying new BeXRBs is their transient nature at high-energy wavelengths, which prevents them from being detected via their X-ray emission characteristics when not in outburst. In order to identify sources that may have been missed due to a long period of quiescence, it becomes necessary to devise methods of detection that rely on wavelengths at which BeXRBs are more persistent emitters. In this work, we attempt to use archival analysis of infrared, optical, and ultraviolet observations to identify new candidate BeXRBs that have been overlooked within the S-CUBED source catalog. Using X-ray/optical selection of source properties, unsupervised clustering, SED-fitting to VizieR archival measurements, and ultraviolet light curve analysis, we are able to identify six new candidate BeXRB systems that otherwise would have been missed by automated analysis pipelines. Using these results, we demonstrate the use of ultraviolet through near-infrared observational data in identifying candidate BeXRBs when they cannot be identified using their X-ray emission.

 - **Abstract**
 Measuring the astrometric and spectroscopic data of stars orbiting the central black hole in our galaxy (Sgr A*) offers a promising way to measure relativistic effects. In principle, the "no-hair" theorem can be tested at the Galactic Center by monitoring the orbital precession of S-stars due to the angular momentum (spin) and quadrupole moment of Sgr A*. Closer-in stars, more strongly affected by the black hole's rotation, may be required. GRAVITY+ could detect such stars that are currently too faint for GRAVITY. We aim to analytically and numerically characterize orbital reorientations induced by spin-related effects of Sgr A* up to the second post-Newtonian (2PN) order. We use the two-timescale method to derive the 2PN analytical expressions of the secular evolution of the orbital parameters that are related to the observer. To study the interaction between the orbital and spin orientations, we introduce observer-independent quantities that offer insight into the Kerr geometry. We also use the post-Newtonian code OOGRE to simulate hypothetical stars orbiting closer to Sgr A*, where spin and quadrupole effects are stronger. This enables comparison with our analytical predictions. We exhibit three orbital-timescale precession rates that encode the in-plane pericenter shift and the out-of-plane redirection of the osculating ellipse. We provide the 2PN expressions of these precession rates and express the orbit-integrated associated angular shifts of the pericenter and of the ellipse axes. We relate these orbital-timescale precession rates to the secular-timescale precession of the orbital angular momentum around the black hole spin axis. We consider that the theoretical insight we provide in this article will be useful in constraining the spin effect of Sgr A* with GRAVITY+ observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Accurate parameter estimation from cosmic microwave background data requires reliable likelihood modeling, particularly at large angular scales where angular power spectrum estimators exhibit non-Gaussian statistics. We present a novel approach, based on the Hamimeche-Lewis formalism, that marginalizes over auto-spectra, thus reducing residual biases from noise misestimation and partial sky coverage. We validate our approach by simulating three independent CMB channels, or data splits, in a multi-field setting, comparing to the pixel-based likelihood ground truth estimates for the optical depth $\tau$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. We benchmark our method against the main power spectrum based alternatives available in the literature, showing that it outperforms all of them in terms of accuracy, while remaining fast and computationally efficient.

 - **Abstract**
 A novel methodology to obtain global transonic solutions around compact objects is reported here. A unified methodology to obtain accretion as well as wind solutions around these objects has been presented. Flows around compact objects are dissipative, and the conservation equations are therefore stiff. In such conditions, obtaining of sonic point(s) and hence, the transonic solution is not trivial. The conserved equations of motion fail to integrate in the presence of realistic viscosity, thereby making it difficult to obtain a global solution. This inhibits one from getting an actual picture of an astrophysical flow. The current work addresses this long-standing issue of obtaining solutions for both accretion and wind. The methodology developed utilises the inner boundary conditions and takes recourse to implicit-explicit (ImEx) integration schemes, to obtain general global transonic accretion and wind solutions. This is the first time such an attempt has been made. Current work considers the different cooling processes like bremsstrahlung, synchrotron and their inverse-Comptonizations, which are found to affect the thermodynamics of the flow. This methodology could successfully generate all topologies of global solutions, multiple sonic point regime, as well as shocks. A broad parameter space study has been done in this work. In an upcoming part II of the paper, a detailed discussion on the spectra and luminosity of the accretion and wind solutions has been presented.

 - **Abstract**
 We describe the SPHEREx Sky Simulator, a software tool designed to model science data for NASA's SPHEREx mission that will carry out a series of all-sky spectrophotometric surveys at $\sim$6'' spatial resolution in 102 spectral channels spanning 0.75 to 5 $\mu$m. The Simulator software implements models for astrophysical emission, instrument characteristics, and survey strategy to generate realistic infrared sky scenes as they will be observed by SPHEREx. The simulated data includes a variety of realistic noise and systematic effects that are estimated using up-to-date astrophysical measurements and information from pre-launch instrument characterization campaigns. Through the pre-flight mission phases the Simulator has been critical in predicting the impact of various effects on SPHEREx science performance, and has played an important role guiding the development of the SPHEREx data analysis pipeline. In this paper, we describe the \skysim\ architecture, pre-flight instrument and sky models, and summarize high-level predictions from the Simulator, including a pre-launch prediction for the 5$\sigma$ point source sensitivity of SPHEREx, which we estimate to be $m_{\rm AB}$ 18.5--19 from 0.75 to 3.8~$\mu$m and $m_{\rm AB}$ 16.6--18 from 3.8 to 5 $\mu$m, with the sensitivity limited by the zodiacal light background at all wavelengths. In the future, on-orbit data will be used to improve the Simulator, which will form the basis of a variety of forward-modeling tools that will be used to model myriad instrumental and astrophysical processes to characterize their systematic effects on our final data products and analyses.

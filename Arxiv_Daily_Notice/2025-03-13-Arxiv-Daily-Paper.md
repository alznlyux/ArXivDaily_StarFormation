 - **Abstract**
 We present measurements in the context of a survey of southern hemisphere binary and multiple stellar systems observed with the Zorro Speckle dual diffraction-limited optical imaging camera on the 8.1m Gemini-South telescope carried out between 2019 and 2023. The overall motivation of our survey, as well as some initial results of these observations, are outlined to demonstrate the capabilities - and limitations - of Zorro. We report on the astrometric characterization of the instrument in terms of the precision and accuracy of our measurements and provide details of our custom-made data reduction pipeline. For targets with separations smaller than 0.4 arcsec, an overall precision of 1 mas in the radial and tangential directions is obtained, while the uncertainty in position angle is 0.2 deg. Relative astrometry and contrast brightness in the two Zorro filters at 562 and 832 nm are reported for 70 pairs on 64 distinct systems (six are triples). Eleven new binaries are found, mostly of small separations (down to 15 mas), and large brightness contrast (up to Delta m=6 in the red channel). Our results indicate that the Zorro instrument, when properly calibrated, delivers excellent quality data for visual binary studies of tight and/or faint companions.

 - **Abstract**
 In 2023, ASTRON took the step of incorporating a dedicated User Experience (UX) designer into its software development process. This decision aimed to enhance the accessibility and usability of services providing access to the data holdings from the telescopes we are developing. The field of astronomical software development has historically under emphasized UX design. ASTRON's initiative not only improves our own tools, but can also be used to demonstrate to the broader community the value of integrating UX expertise into development teams. We discuss how we integrate the UX designer at the start of our software development lifecycle. We end with providing some considerations on how other projects could make use of UX knowledge in their development process.

 - **Abstract**
 Over the past two decades, an increasing number of transients have shown luminous activity at their explosion sites weeks to years before an interacting supernova (SN) is observed. For some objects, this pre-SN activity is typically linked to large-scale mass-loss events preceding core collapse, yet its triggering mechanism and the underlying explosion process remain uncertain. We present SN 2022mop, which was initially observed in August 2022, exhibiting nebular emission, including [O I], Mg I], and [Ca II], resembling the late-time (~200 days post-explosion) spectrum of a stripped-envelope SN (SESN) from a progenitor with M[ZAMS] < 18 Msun. SN 2022mop shows strong (~ 1 mag) repeating undulations in its light curve, suggesting late-time interaction. In mid-2024, the transient re-brightened for several months before a Type IIn SN (r[peak] = -18.2 mag) was observed in December 2024, closely resembling the evolution of SN 2009ip. By triangulating both transients using Pan-STARRS images, we determine that both transients are coincident within approximately 3 parsecs. Given the environment, the chance alignment of two isolated SNe is unlikely. We propose a merger-burst scenario: a compact object formed in 2022, is kicked into an eccentric orbit, interacts with its hydrogen-rich companion over subsequent months, and ultimately merges, triggering a Type IIn SN-like transient.

          Echoes of Self-Interacting Dark Matter from Binary Black Hole Mergers

 - **Abstract**
 Dark matter (DM) environments around black holes (BHs) can influence their mergers through dynamical friction, causing gravitational wave (GW) dephasing during the inspiral phase. While this effect is well studied for collisionless dark matter (CDM), it remains unexplored for self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) due to the typically low DM density in SIDM halo cores. In this work, we show that SIDM models with a massive force mediator can support dense enough DM spikes, significantly affecting BH mergers and producing a distinct GW dephasing. Using ${N}$-body simulations, we analyze GW dephasing in binary BH inspirals within CDM and SIDM spikes. By tracking the binary's motion in different SIDM environments, we show that the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) can distinguish DM profiles shaped by varying DM interaction strengths, revealing detailed properties of SIDM.

          Multi-Phase Shock Cooling Emission in Ultra-Stripped Supernovae

 - **Abstract**
 Ultra-stripped and Type Ibn supernovae (USSNe and SNe Ibn, respectively) are fast-evolving, hydrogen-poor transients that often show signs of interaction with dense circumstellar material (CSM). Wu & Fuller (2022) identify a mass range for helium-core stars in which they expand significantly during core oxygen/neon burning, resulting in extreme late-stage mass loss in tight binaries ($P\sim1-100\,{\rm days}$). Here we explore the resulting light curves from a subset of models from Wu & Fuller (2022) and find that in some cases they can exhibit two phases of shock cooling emission (SCE). The first SCE is attributed to the circumbinary material, and the second SCE is from the extended helium-burning envelope of the exploding star. Since SCE luminosity is roughly proportional to the initial radius of the emitting material, events that exhibit both phases of SCE provide the exciting opportunity of measuring both the extent of the CSM and the radius of the exploding star. These light curves are explored with both analytic arguments and numerical modeling, and from this we identify the parameter space of CSM mass, helium envelope mass, and nickel mass, for which the helium envelope SCE will be visible. We provide a qualitative comparison of these models to two fast-evolving, helium-rich transients, SN2019kbj and SN2019dge. The similarity between these events and our models demonstrates that this extreme binary mass loss mechanism may explain some SNe Ibn and USSNe.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the design of the Compact Network of Detectors with Orbital Range (CONDOR), a proposed high-altitude gamma-ray and cosmic-ray (CR) observatory set to become the highest of its kind. Planned for installation at Cerro Toco in the Atacama Desert, Chile, at 5300 meters above sea level (m.a.s.l.), CONDOR is optimized to operate in the 100 GeV to 1 TeV range using the extensive air-shower technique. The design prioritizes simplicity, modularity, and robustness to ensure reliable performance in a harsh environment. The CONDOR array has a full coverage factor of 90 and consists of 6000 plastic scintillator panels, each approximately 1 m^2, read by wavelength-shifting fibers and SiPMs. The readout electronics are based on fast ADCs, with White Rabbit technology ensuring time synchronization. We present an analysis of angular resolution and effective area by variation of the CORSIKA design to meet the developing GeV threshold, complementing other ground-based observatories in gamma-ray and proton CR measurements. CONDOR has the potential to support an extensive research program in astroparticle physics and multimessenger astronomy from the Southern Hemisphere, operating in all-sky mode 24 hours per day, year-round, with satellite data ranges.

          On the million-degree signature of spicules

 - **Abstract**
 Spicules have often been proposed as substantial contributors toward the mass and energy balance of the solar corona. While their transition region (TR) counterpart has unequivocally been established over the past decade, the observations concerning the coronal contribution of spicules have often been contested. This is mainly attributed to the lack of adequate coordinated observations, their small spatial scales, highly dynamic nature, and complex multi-thermal evolution, which are often observed at the limit of our current observational facilities. Therefore, it remains unclear how much heating occurs in association with spicules to coronal temperatures. In this study, we use coordinated high-resolution observations of the solar chromosphere, TR, and corona of a quiet Sun region and a coronal hole with the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) and the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) to investigate the (lower) coronal ($\sim$1MK) emission associated with spicules. We perform differential emission measure (DEM) analysis on the AIA passbands using basis pursuit and a newly developed technique based on Tikhonov regularization to probe the thermal structure of the spicular environment at coronal temperatures. We find that the EM maps at 1 MK reveal the presence of ubiquitous, small-scale jets with a clear spatio-temporal coherence with the spicules observed in the IRIS/TR passband. Detailed space-time analysis of the chromospheric, TR, and EM maps show unambiguous evidence of rapidly outward propagating spicules with strong emission (2--3 times higher than the background) at 1 MK. Our findings are consistent with previously reported MHD simulations that show heating to coronal temperatures associated with spicules.

 - **Abstract**
 This study presents a comprehensive analysis of the youngest stellar clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), utilising a multi-wavelength approach. We analyse data spanning from infrared to ultraviolet wavelengths, with the goal of enhancing our understanding of these clusters' physical properties, such as age, mass, and size. Our methodology includes a novel cluster detection procedure; it employs machine learning techniques for the accurate identification of these young clusters. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis, using the Automated Stellar Cluster Analysis tool, plays a crucial role in deriving the clusters' key physical parameters. Our findings provide significant insights into the early stages of stellar and galactic evolution, particularly in dwarf galaxy environments, and contribute to the broader understanding of star formation and cluster evolution. For the 109 clusters in our sample younger than 5 Myr, we measure a positive correlation between cluster mass and the mass of the most massive star in the cluster. This study emphasises the importance of multi-wavelength observations in revealing the intricate properties of young stellar clusters.

          Probing 2D Asymmetries of an Exoplanet Atmosphere from Chromatic Transit Variation

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a new method for investigating atmospheric inhomogeneities in exoplanets through transmission spectroscopy. Our approach links chromatic variations in conventional transit model parameters (central transit time, total and full durations, and transit depth) to atmospheric asymmetries. By separately analyzing atmospheric asymmetries during ingress and egress, we can derive clear connections between these variations and the underlying asymmetries of the planetary limbs. Additionally, this approach enables us to investigate differences between the limbs slightly offset from the terminator on the dayside and the nightside. We applied this method to JWST's NIRSpec/G395H observations of the hot Saturn exoplanet WASP-39 b. Our analysis suggests a higher abundance of CO2 on the evening limb compared to the morning limb and indicates a greater probability of SO2 on the limb slightly offset from the terminator on the dayside relative to the nightside. These findings highlight the potential of our method to enhance the understanding of photochemical processes in exoplanetary atmospheres.

          FAST Discovery of A Gas-rich and Ultra-faint Dwarf Galaxy: KK153

 - **Abstract**
 Based on a high-sensitivity HI survey using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST), we identified an isolated HI cloud with a system velocity of ~127.0 km/s, which is associated with an optical galaxy KK153 in space. The HI gas of KK153 shows a typical disk-galaxy structure. Using the Baryonic Tully-Fisher relation, we obtained that the distance to KK153 is 2.0_{-0.8}^{+1.7} Mpc. Adopting such distance, we derived a stellar mass of 4.1_{-2.6}^{+10.0}*10^{5} Msun and a neutral gas fraction of 0.63, implying that KK153 is a gas-rich ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) galaxy in the Local Group or its outskirts. KK153 shows a cool (~200 K) and warm (~7400 K) two-phase neutral medium. The g-r color distribution of KK153 suggests that new stars are mostly forming in its inner disk. The dynamical mass of KK153 is 6.9_{-3.0}^{+5.5}*10^{7} Msun, which is about 60 times larger than its baryonic matter. Detection of such a low-mass and gas-rich halo poses a challenge to the theory of cosmic reionization.

          Progenitor Dependence of Neutrino-driven Supernova Explosions with the Aid of Heavy Axion-like Particles

 - **Abstract**
 We perform spherically symmetric simulations of core-collapse supernovae with the aid of heavy axion-like particles (ALPs) which interact with photons and redistribute energy within supernova matter. We explore a wide ALP parameter space that includes MeV-scale ALP mass $m_{\,a}$ and the ALP-photon coupling constant $g_{\,a \gamma} \sim 10^{\,-10} \, \rm{GeV}^{\,-1}$ , employing three progenitor models with zero-age main-sequence mass of $11.2\,M_\odot$, $20.0\,M_\odot$, and $25.0\,M_\odot$. We find a general trend that, given $m_{\,a}\lesssim 300\,$MeV, heavier ALPs are favorable for the shock wave to be successfully revived, aiding the onset of the neutrino-driven explosion. However, if ALPs are heavier than $\sim 400\,$MeV, the explosion is failed or weaker than that for the models with smaller $m_{\,a}$, because of an insufficient temperature inside the supernova core to produce heavy ALPs. The maximum temperature in the core depends on the initial progenitor structure. Our simulations indicate that the high-temperature environment in the collapsing core of massive progenitors leads to a significant impact of ALPs on the explodability.

          Multi-frequency Very Long Baseline Interferometry Study of Emission and Absorption in the Two-Sided Jets of NGC 3998

 - **Abstract**
 We present the multi-frequency, multi-epoch Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) study of the two-sided jets in the low-luminosity active galactic nucleus NGC 3998, where physical properties of the jets on parsec scales remain poorly understood. Using Very Long Baseline Array data observed at 1.4, 1.7, 2.3, and 5 GHz, we detect symmetric twin jets aligned along the north-south direction, with a total extent of $\sim 5.3$ pc. Notably, the position angle of the pc-scale jets differs by $26^\circ$-$30^\circ$ from that of the kpc-scale jets, suggesting the possibility of jet precession. Based on the frequency-dependent core shift and north/south jet brightness ratio, we identify the northern jet as the approaching jet and the southern jet as the counter-jet. Measurements of the radial intensity profile on both sides indicate a change in the counter-jet emission from rapid fading to a slower decline at 1.4, 1.7 and 2.3 GHz. Spectral analysis shows that the approaching jet exhibits an optically thin spectrum, while the counter-jet is dominated by an optically thick, inverted spectrum. These findings tentatively suggest free-free absorption in NGC 3998, which should be verified in future studies. Finally, our observations also reveal a flat-spectrum VLBI core, showing significant radio variability that is likely linked to a jet ejection event.

          Earth as an Exoplanet: Investigating the effects of cloud variability on the direct-imaging of atmospheres

 - **Abstract**
 A planet's spectrum is dynamic and only represents a time-dependent snapshot of its properties. Changing atmospheric conditions due to climate and weather patterns, particularly variation in cloud cover, can significantly affect the spectrum in ways that complicate the understanding of a planet's baseline atmospheric properties. Variable cloud cover and cloud properties affect the detectability of atmospheric constituents, and also greatly influence the radiative transfer that determines a planet's spectrum. This has considerable implications for direct imaging observations of potentially habitable exoplanets and thus it is critical to study and characterize the effects of clouds on their spectra. Clouds have been extensively modeled before and their effects have been incorporated across climate frameworks spanning a spectrum of complexity. Given the challenges associated with modeling clouds, we adopt a novel approach in this work to study the effects of clouds by using real-time cloud data from Earth observations. Treating Earth as an exoplanet and using detailed observations from the MERRA 2 data collection, we quantify the effects of cloud variability on the spectrum as well as on the detectability of atmospheric constituents, specifically biomarkers like O2, O3 and H2O. The coverage and vertical position of clouds significantly affects the SNRs of these gases and subsequently their detectability in exo-Earth atmospheres. Moreover, we show that variations in the amount of cloud cover will potentially confound efforts to retrieve a stable baseline atmosphere for a planet. This work has important applications to future direct-imaging missions like the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO).

          "Dark comet" 2005 VL$_1$ is unlikely to be the lost Soviet-era probe Venera 2

 - **Abstract**
 Loeb & Cloete (2025) intriguingly suggest that the near-Earth object 2005 VL$_1$ could be the lost Soviet probe Venera 2. Here I evaluate the plausibility of such a claim against the available data. I have re-determined the orbit of 2005 VL$_1$ (including a non-gravitational acceleration component) using the astrometric observations retrieved from the Minor Planet Center (MPC) database. By propagating the orbit of 2005 VL$_1$ over the period of the Venera 2 mission, I compare this object's distance from the Earth and from Venus at the times of the probe's launch and flyby with Venus, respectively. My analysis, which takes into account realistic uncertainties on both the orbit of 2005 VL1 and the position of Venera 2, decisively rules out the proposed identification. My approach relies entirely on open-source software and publicly available data, and could represent a viable method to assess similar claims in the future.

          Tomography of the Ophiuchus Molecular Cloud with Velocity Features in C$_2$H $N=1-0$ spectra: A Pilot Study of Coherent Sub-structures

 - **Abstract**
 The C$_2$H $N=1-0$ transition was used to investigate the possible line of sight sub-structures from the dense and optically thick in $^{13}$CO $J=1-0$ regions in the Ophiuchus star forming molecular cloud. With a 0.2 K or lower noise, multi-peak spectra were obtained and then used for identifying sub-structures. There are clues, e.g., the core velocity dispersion remains unchanged with the increasing scale that this cloud has a mild thickness in the line of sight direction and a large amount of overlapping CO cores, as expected, at least two coherent layers have been found. The integrated intensity maps of these two layers are different in shape and morphology. Inferred from the point velocity dispersion, one sub-structure with a thickness of $\sim 1$ pc was found, while other substructures were more likely to be fragments.

          Tiny-Scale Properties within the Interstellar Medium towards PSR J1644$-$4559: I. Observational Evidence of Turbulence-induced Tiny Scale Atomic Structures

 - **Abstract**
 We investigated HI absorption toward a single pulsar, PSR J1644$-$4559, and its variability over timescales from days to years, using Murriyang, CSIRO's Parkes Radio Telescope. Our 19 epochs of spectral observations, spanning 1.2 years with intervals as short as 1 day, provide the most comprehensive cadence coverage for monitoring HI absorption to date. We identified two significant detections of tiny-scale atomic structure (TSAS) with spatial scales ranging from a lower limit of $\sim$11 au to an upper limit of 165 au, both exhibiting integrated signal-to-noise ratios exceeding 5.0. We find a relationship between linear size and optical depth variation in the cold neutral medium (CNM) component hosting the TSAS, described by a power-law relationship, $\Delta\tau_{\rm int} = \Delta\tau_0 (\Delta L)^{(\alpha-2)/2}$, with $\alpha = 4.1 \pm 0.4$. This is the first observational evidence explicitly connecting TSAS to turbulence in CNM. This power-law index is significantly steeper than previously reported values for the CNM, where $\alpha$ ranges from 2.3 to 2.9, but similar to those observed in the warm ionized gas. Additionally, we observe no significant variation in $\alpha$ across the entire range of spatial scales traced in our study, indicating that turbulence may be cascading down and dissipating at smaller scales. While there is no precise proper motion measurement for this pulsar, our estimates for the turbulence dissipation in the CNM place the lower and upper limits at less than 0.03 au and 0.4 au, respectively.

          Resonant drag instabilities for polydisperse dust. II. The streaming and settling instabilities

 - **Abstract**
 Dust grains embedded in gas flow give rise to a class of hydrodynamic instabilities, called resonant drag instabilities. These instabilities have predominantly been studied for single grain sizes, in which case they are found to grow fast. Nonlinear simulations indicate that strong dust overdensities can form, aiding the formation of planetesimals. In reality, however, there is going to be a distribution of dust sizes, which potentially has important consequences. We study two different resonant drag instabilities, the streaming instability and the settling instability, taking into account a continuous spectrum of grain sizes, to determine whether these instabilities survive in the polydisperse regime and how the resulting growth rates compare to the monodisperse case. We solve the linear equations for a polydisperse fluid in an unstratified shearing box to recover the streaming instability and, for approximate stratification, the settling instability, in all cases focusing on small dust-to-gas ratios. Size distributions of realistic width turn the singular perturbation of the monodisperse limit into a regular perturbation due to the fact that the backreaction on the gas involves an integration over the resonance. The contribution of the resonance to the integral can be negative, as in the case of the streaming instability, which as a result does not survive in the polydisperse regime, or positive, which is the case in the settling instability. The latter therefore has a polydisperse counterpart, with growth rates that can be comparable to the monodisperse case. Wide size distributions in almost all cases remove the resonant nature of drag instabilities. This can lead to reduced growth, as is the case in large parts of parameter space for the settling instability, or complete stabilisation, as is the case for the streaming instability.

 - **Abstract**
 We describe a practical implementation of the anamorphically curved detector concept. In order to demonstrate its advantages, a telescope lab prototype was developed, built, and tested. It is based on a 4-mirror all-spherical unobscured design, similar to that proposed by D. Shafer. The telescope is open at F/#=5.5 and its extended field of view is 10.6x8 degrees. We explore the design parameter space to demonstrate the change in gain introduced by the curved detector and to substantiate the chosen parameters. If the image surface is curved to the shape of a toroid, the image quality reaches the diffraction limit over the entire field by design. The design was optimized to use standard concave spherical mirrors. The detector was curved down toroidally with an exquisite surface precision of approximately 11 micrometers Peak-to-Valley. The experimental tests of the prototype have shown that use of the toroidally curved detector allows to increase the contrast in the field corner by up to 0.3 units, which is in good agreement with the modeling results. We also propose a few prospective applications of the demonstrated concept.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an updated catalog of stellar parameters, including effective temperature, luminosity classification, and metallicity, for over fifty million stars from the SkyMapper Southern Survey (SMSS) DR4 and Gaia DR3. The accuracy of the derived parameters remains consistent with those achieved in SMSS DR2 using the same methods. Thanks to the advancements in SMSS DR4, photometric-metallicity estimates are now available for an unprecedented number of metal-poor stars. The catalog includes over 13 million metal-poor (MP; [Fe/H]<-1) stars, nearly three million very metal-poor (VMP; [Fe/H]<-2.0) stars, and approximately 120,000 extremely metal-poor (EMP; [Fe/H]<-3.0) stars -- representing an increase by a factor of 4-6 compared to SMSS DR2. This catalog, combined with other stellar parameters obtained through our efforts, will be made available at this https URL.

 - **Abstract**
 Main sequence stars of spectral types F, G, and K with low to moderate activity levels exhibit a recognizable pattern known as the first ionization potential effect (FIP effect), where elements with lower first ionization potentials are more abundant in the stellar corona than in the photosphere. In contrast, high activity main sequence stars such as AB Dor (K0), active binaries, and M dwarfs exhibit an inverse pattern known as iFIP. We aim to determine whether or not the iFIP pattern persists in moderate-activity M dwarfs. We used XMM-Newton to observe the moderately active M dwarf HD 223889 that has an X-ray surface flux of log FX,surf = 5.26, the lowest for an M dwarf studied so far for coronal abundance patterns. We used low-resolution CCD spectra of the star to calculate the strength of the FIP effect quantified by the FIP bias (Fbias) to assess the persistence of the iFIP effect in M dwarfs. Our findings reveal an iFIP effect similar to that of another moderately active binary star, GJ 338 AB, with a comparable error margin. The results hint at a possible plateau in the Teff-Fbias diagram for moderately active M dwarfs. Targeting stars with low coronal activity that have a coronal temperature between 2 MK and 4 MK is essential for refining our understanding of (i)FIP patterns and their causes.

 The main contributors of the IceCube diffuse neutrino flux remain unclear. Tidal disruption events (TDEs) have been proposed as potential emitters of the high-energy neutrinos detected by IceCube. Therefore, investigating the correlation between the TDE population and IceCube neutrinos could help us better understand whether the TDE population could be potential high-energy neutrino emitters. In this paper, we perform a systematic search for TDEs that are associated with neutrinos in a sample including 143 IceCube neutrino alert events and 61 TDEs classified by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) - Bright Transient Survey (BTS). Furthermore, considering that the TDEs/TDE candidates reported as potential IceCube neutrino emitters are all accompanied by infrared (IR) observations, we further select the TDEs with IR observations from these 61 TDEs as a subsample to examine the correlation with neutrinos. Based on the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) mission database, seven TDEs are identified as having IR observations. Due to good spatial localization is crucial for association analysis, we employ two methods to handle alert events with large error radii in our sample. Then we employ three Monte Carlo simulation methods to investigate the correlation between TDE sample/subsample and IceCube neutrinos. Finally, after considering spatial and temporal criteria, seven TDEs with IR flares show the most significant correlation at a 2.43{\sigma} confidence level. If we tentatively further take the time delay factor into account in the weighting scheme, the correlation enhances to 2.54{\sigma} confidence level.

          Prospects for ${\rm kSZ^2}$-${\rm 21cm^2}$ Cross-Correlations during Reionization

 - **Abstract**
 The 21\,cm line and the patchy kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect are promising and complementary probes of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). A challenge for cross-correlating these two signals is that foreground avoidance or removal algorithms applied to the 21\,cm data inevitably sacrifice Fourier modes with long wavelengths along the line-of-sight (i.e., low-$k_\parallel$ modes), yet \textit{only} these same modes contribute to the kSZ signal. Here we show that a suitable kSZ$^2$ $\times$ 21\,cm$^2$ cross-correlation statistic nevertheless remains non-vanishing, even after filtering out the corrupted low-$k_\parallel$ Fourier modes from the 21\,cm data. We simulate the kSZ$^2$ $\times$ 21\,cm$^2$ cross-correlation signal across reionization-era redshifts and find distinctive redshift evolution. This signal peaks early in the reionization history, when the volume-averaged fraction is around $0.1 \lesssim x_\mathrm{HII} \lesssim 0.2$, after which it changes sign and reaches a minimum near reionization's midpoint ($x_\mathrm{HII} \sim 0.5$), while the signal gradually vanishes as reionization completes. These trends appear generic across three simulated models which differ in their reionization histories. We forecast the detectability of the kSZ$^2$ $\times$ 21\,cm$^2$ cross-power spectrum for the HERA and SKA1-Low 21\,cm experiments in combination with current and next-generation CMB surveys including the Simons Observatory, CMB-S4, and CMB-HD. We find that a high-significance detection ($\mathrm{S/N} \gtrsim 5\sigma$) is possible with SKA1-Low and CMB-S4.

 Studies of the structure and kinematics of cores associated with the regions of massive star and star cluster formation are necessary for constructing scenario for the evolution of these objects. We analyzed spectral maps of the massive cores of G012.418+00.506, G326.472+00.888, G328.567--00.535, G335.586--00.289 and G343.127--00.063 from the MALT90 survey in the HCO$^+$(1--0) and H$^{13}$CO$^+$(1--0) lines. The cores are at different stages of evolution and have signs of contraction. By fitting spectral maps calculated within the framework of a spherically symmetric model into the observed ones, the parameters of the radial profiles of density, turbulent velocity and contraction velocity were calculated. The power-law index of the density decay with distance from the center varies in the range of $\sim 1.5-2.8$. The lowest value is obtained for the core of G326.472+00.888 without internal sources. The contraction velocity in all cores depends weakly on the distance from the center, decreasing with an index of $\sim 0.1$, which differs from the free-fall mode. There are indications of rotation for the cores of G328.567--00.535 and G335.586--00.289. Analysis of $^{13}$CO(2--1) data from the SEDIGISM survey for the regions G012.418+00.506, G335.586--00.289, and G343.127--00.063 revealed motions from the surrounding gas toward the cores. The results obtained indicate that the massive cores under consideration interact with their environment and are apparently in a state of global collapse.t the massive cores under consideration interact with their environment and are apparently in a state of global collapse.

 - **Abstract**
 The prompt emission of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) could be composed of different spectral components, such as a dominant non-thermal Band component in the keV-MeV range, a subdominant quasi-thermal component, and an additional hard non-thermal component extending into the GeV range. The existence and evolutionary behaviors of these components could place strong implication on physical models, such as ejecta composition and dissipation processes. Although numerous GRBs have been found to exhibit one or two spectral components, reports of GRBs containing all three components remain rare. In this letter, based on the joint observations of GRB 240825A from multiple gamma-ray telescopes, we conduct a comprehensive temporal and spectral analysis to identify the presence and evolution of all three components. The bulk Lorentz factor of this bright and relatively short-duration burst is independently calculated using the thermal and hard non-thermal components, supporting a jet penetration scenario. The multi-segment broken powerlaw feature observed in the flux light curves suggests the presence of an early afterglow in the keV-MeV band and hints at a possible two-jet structure. Furthermore, the observed transition from positive to negative on the spectral lag can be interpreted as an independent evolution of the soft and hard components, leading to misalignment in the cross-correlation function (CCF) analysis of pulses.

- **Abstract**
 We present measurements of key protoplanetary disk properties inferred from parametric models of ALMA 12CO spectral line visibilities. We derive gas-disk radii, integrated fluxes, optically thick emission layers, and brightness temperature profiles for the disk population of the old (4 - 14 Myr) Upper Scorpius star-forming region. We measure CO emission sizes for 37 disks with bright CO J=3-2 emission (S/N > 10 on the integrated flux; out of the 83 disks with CO detections), finding that the median radius containing 90% of the flux is ~84 au, with radii spanning from 23 up to 243 au. We report a correlation between the 12CO brightness temperatures and stellar luminosities, with a Pearson coefficient of 0.6, and we use it to prove that the 12CO optically thick emission layer primarily emanates from a region below the super-heated dust, which is optically thin to the stellar irradiation. Moreover, we derive 33 CO emission surface height profiles, finding a median aspect ratio <z/r> ~ 0.16 in a range from ~0.01 up to ~0.45 over the sample. Finally, we comment on the multiple systems in our sample, of which only some were already known. These results re-affirm how it is possible to derive bulk disk properties by modeling moderate angular resolution ALMA visibilities.

          Ionizing radiation of [WR] stars: atmospheres and photoionization models

- **Abstract**
 The radiation field of central stars of planetary nebulae (CSPNe) is crucial for determining the physical conditions of planetary nebulae (PNe). Many studies in the literature model PNe using the blackbody approximation (bb) or plane-parallel (p-p) atmospheres as the ionizing source. However, these approaches become inconsistent when the central star is a Wolf-Rayet ([WR]) type. These objects are hydrogen-deficient and exhibit intense stellar winds, similar to classical massive WR stars. Their accurate description therefore requires sophisticated NLTE expanding atmosphere models. In this work, we selected [WR] NLTE expanding-atmosphere models spanning a range of temperatures and mass-loss rates and compared them with bb and p-p models. We examined differences in the spectral energy distribution and ionizing photon fluxes for H I, He I, and He II to assess the impact of stellar winds on the nebula-star interaction. Using CLOUDY, we also evaluated how each ionizing source affects predicted line ratios (I$_{\lambda}$/I$_{\beta}$) for a sample of PNe with [WR] nuclei. Model performance was measured through the rms deviation between observed and predicted ratios. For temperatures below 100,000 K, the EUV spectrum differs strongly among the three model types. Stellar winds introduce substantial opacity, reducing log Q(He II) significantly relative to no-wind models. For hotter [WR] stars, wind effects on ionizing fluxes are much smaller. For nebulae hosting late-type [WR] stars, models including winds provide much better agreement with observed line ratios than bb or p-p models, whereas for early-type stars the choice of ionizing source has only a minor influence. Our results indicate that bb and p-p approximations should be avoided when modelling PNe with [WR] central stars, especially those of the [WCL] subtype, because they fail to reproduce the strong wind-modified ionizing spectra.

          Self-bound quark stars with a first-order two-to-three flavor phase transition

- **Abstract**
 We investigate self-bound quark stars in a flavor-dependent quark-mass density-dependent (QMDD) model with an excluded-volume correction. We chart the parameter space at zero pressure to identify self-bound regimes, including cases with a first-order $ud \to uds$ transition, and construct cold, $\beta$-equilibrated stellar sequences via the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations. The excluded-volume parameter $\kappa$ controls the stiffness of the equation of state and thus masses, radii, tidal deformabilities, and moments of inertia. Intermediate repulsion typically reconciles $M_{\max} \gtrsim 2\,M_\odot$ with current radius/tidal constraints, with hybrid self-bound objects more compatible than pure strange-quark stars. We identify three EOS-insensitive trends $-$ dimensionless moment of inertia vs. compactness, tidal deformability vs. compactness, and gravitational vs. baryonic compactness $-$ whose explicit $\kappa$-dependence largely disappears in dimensionless form (the first two being notably tighter than the third). These results provide model-guided priors and tools for discriminating between hadronic and self-bound EOS families with multimessenger data.

          TRAO Survey of the Nearby Filamentary Molecular Clouds, the Universal Nursery of Stars (TRAO-FUNS). IV. Filaments and Dense Cores in the W40 and Serpens South Regions of Aquila

- **Abstract**
 We present the results of molecular line observations toward the W40 and Serpens South regions of the Aquila molecular cloud complex, conducted as part of the TRAO-FUNS project to investigate the role of filamentary structures in the formation of dense cores and stars in molecular clouds. We performed a Gaussian decomposition of the C$^{18}$O spectra to disentangle multiple velocity components along the line-of-sight and a `Friends-of-Friends' algorithm on these decomposed components to identify 24 velocity-coherent filaments in the observed region. The `FellWalker' algorithm is applied on the N$_{2}$H$^{+}$ integrated intensity map to identify the dense cores embedded within the filaments. Many of the filaments previously identified from the Herschel survey are found to contain multiple velocity-coherent filaments. Virial analysis indicated that all of our identified filaments are thermally supercritical and gravitationally bound. Velocity gradients are observed along the filaments in the vicinity of embedded dense cores, indicating the presence of longitudinal flows that contribute to core formation. The median mass flow rate across the observed region is estimated to be $\sim$35 M$_{\odot}$ Myr$^{-1}$, with Serpens South showing a rate $\sim$40\% higher than W40. The analysis of non-thermal motions revealed that the dense cores mainly show subsonic to transonic motions, while their host filaments are mostly supersonic, suggesting that the turbulent motions in filaments may dissipate on smaller scales, allowing core formation. These findings highlight the essential role of the filaments' criticality, mass flow, and turbulent dissipation in the formation of dense cores within the filaments.

- **Abstract**
 We present the results of a STAROS monitoring campaign on the bright eclipsing binary star alpha Draconis. Over 200 high-resolution spectra were obtained by an international group of amateur astronomers. We were able to calculate an homogeneously covered radial velocity curve and redetermine the orbital elements of the alpha Draconis system. From the data set, we estimated the quality of our observations and accuracy of our radial velocity measurements. Finally, we have also implemented a spectral disentangling method to search for the signature of a companion star and used atmosphere models to constrain the atmospheric parameters of the system.

          A Multi-Scale Attention-Enhanced Architecture for Gravity Wave Localization in Satellite Imagery

 - **Abstract**
 Satellite images present unique challenges due to their high object variability and lower spatial resolution, particularly for detecting atmospheric gravity waves which exhibit significant variability in scale, shape, and pattern extent, making accurate localization highly challenging. This variability is further compounded by dominant unwanted objects such as clouds and city lights, as well as instrumental noise, all within a single image channel, while conventional detection methods struggle to capture the diverse and often subtle features of gravity waves across varying conditions. To address these issues, we introduce YOLO-DCAT incorporating Multi Dilated Residual Convolution (MDRC) and Simplified Spatial and Channel Attention (SSCA), an enhanced version of YOLOv5 specifically designed to improve gravity wave localization by effectively handling their complex and variable characteristics. MDRC captures multi-scale features through parallel dilated convolutions with varying dilation rates, while SSCA focuses on the most relevant spatial regions and channel features to enhance detection accuracy and suppress interference from background noise. In our experiments, the improved model outperformed state-of-the-art alternatives, improving mean Average Precision (mAP) by over 14% and Intersection over Union (IoU) by approximately 17%, demonstrating significantly improved localization accuracy for gravity waves in challenging satellite imagery and contributing to more precise climate research and modeling.

 - **Abstract**
 The prevalence and properties of low-mass dark matter haloes serve as a crucial test for understanding the nature of dark matter, and may be constrained through the gravitational deflection of strongly lensed arcs. Previous studies found evidence for the presence of low-mass dark matter haloes in observations of the gravitationally lensed, dusty star-forming galaxy SDP.81, using the Atacama Large Millimetre/sub-millimetre Array (ALMA). In this work, we analyse these observations to assess the robustness of these reported results. While our analysis indicates that the data support additional angular structure in the lensing mass distribution beyond an elliptical power-law density profile, we do not find evidence for two previously reported sub-halo detections. However, we verify with realistic mock data that we could have found evidence in favour of a previously reported $\approx 10^{9}\,{\rm M_{\odot}}$ sub-halo with a log Bayes factor of 29, should it exist in the real data. After testing various systematics, we find that this previous sub-halo inference was most likely spurious and resulted from an inadequate smooth model, specifically, poorly fitting multipoles. While we do not find evidence in favour of any individual sub-halo, we find evidence for similarity in the lensing signatures of multipoles ($m=3,4$) and single massive sub-haloes, consistent with other recent work. We suggest that future searches for low-mass haloes in lensed arcs include lens angular structure in the form of multipoles up to 4th order and require a good-fitting smooth model as a prerequisite. Overall, our findings demonstrate the suitability of ALMA data of this quality to simultaneously constrain the abundance of low-mass haloes and lens angular structure.

          Spectral Characteristics of Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS from SOAR Observations

 - **Abstract**
 Interstellar objects (ISOs) provide unique insights into the building blocks and conditions of extrasolar planetary systems. The newly discovered object, 3I/ATLAS (C/2025 N1), represents the third known ISO after 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. We present initial spectroscopic characterizations of 3I using observations from the Goodman High Throughput Spectrograph on the 4.1 m SOAR Telescope in Chile during the night of July 3rd. The reflectance spectrum of 3I, covering 3700-7000\,Å\, reveals a red continuum, comparable to extreme trans-Neptunian objects, with a weak UV-optical turnover indicative of complex carbonaceous and irradiated organics. At the time of observation, when 3I was at a heliocentric distance of 4.4 AU, we detected no discernible gas emission from canonical cometary species (CN, C$_3$, C$_2$, CO$^+$, [O{\sc i}]). This is in agreement with expectations from our thermal-evolution model, which indicates sublimation-driven activity should commence once 3I/ATLAS approaches smaller heliocentric distances. Nonetheless, the paradoxical situation of early onset coma without evidence of sublimation tracers calls for other dust-liberating mechanisms that ancient ISOs may be subjected to at large heliocentric distances.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an upgraded version of TRICERATOPS, a software package designed to calculate false positive probabilities for planet candidates identified by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). This enhanced framework now incorporates ground-based light curves in separate bandpasses, which are routinely obtained as part of the candidate vetting process. We apply this upgraded framework to explore the planetary nature of 14 TESS planet candidates, combining primarily J band light curves acquired with the 200-inch Hale Telescope at Palomar Observatory with complementary archival observations from the Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope (LCOGT), the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory (FLWO), and the Teide Observatory, along with existing TESS data and contrast curves from high-resolution imaging. As a result of this analysis we statistically validate (False Positive Probability < 1.5% and Nearby False Positive Probability < 0.1%) six new planets in five systems: TOI-1346 b, TOI-1346 c, TOI-2719 b, TOI-4155 b, TOI-6000 b, and TOI-6324 b. For these systems, we provide updated estimates of their stellar and planetary properties derived from the TESS and ground-based observations. These new systems contain planets with radii between 0.9-6 Re and orbital periods between 0.3-5.5 days. Finally, we use our upgraded version of TRICERATOPS to quantify the relative importance of multi-wavelength transit photometry and high-resolution imaging for exoplanet candidate validation, and discuss which kinds of candidates typically benefit the most from ground-based multi-color transit observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Blue horizontal-branch (BHB) stars are old, low-mass, metal-poor stars that serve as important tracers of the Galactic halo structure, kinematics, and this http URL their binary properties provides key insights into their formation channels and the role of binary interactions in the evolution of horizontal branch stars. We intend to investigate the intrinsic binary fraction $f_{\rm b}^{\rm in}$ of BHB stars and its dependencies on metallicity, kinematics, and effective temperature. We collect \GG{299} BHB stars from LAMOST with multiple radial velocity (RV) measurements and classify the sample into halo-like and disk-like BHBs based on their kinematics and metallicity, as well as into bluer and redder BHBs based on their \G{effective temperature}. We then investigate the observed binary fraction for each group based on the radial velocity variations and apply a set of Monte Carlo simulations, assuming distributions of $f(P) \propto P^\pi$ and $f(q) \propto q^\kappa$, to correct the observed binary fraction for observational biases and derive the intrinsic binary fraction. After correcting for observational biases, the intrinsic binary fraction increases to 31% for n > 2 and 32% for n > 3. A clear contrast is observed between halo-like and disk-like BHB stars, with halo-like BHBs exhibiting a lower intrinsic binary fraction (28% for n > 2 and 29% for n> 3) compared to disk-like BHBs (46% and 51%, respectively), indicating different formation pathways. Additionally, we find that bluer BHB stars exhibit a significantly higher binary fraction (42% for n > 2 and 45% for n> 3) than redder BHB stars (24% and 23%, respectively), which suggests a possible link between binarity and the effective temperature, although more samples are required to confirm this.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent measurements of astrophysical neutrinos have expanded our understanding of their nature and origin. However, very little is still known about the astrophysical $\bar{\nu}:\nu$ ratio. The only prior measurement is the recent, single Glashow event seen by IceCube. Understanding the astrophysical $\bar{\nu}:\nu$ ratio has a bearing on multiple questions, including the astrophysical spectral shape and neutrino production mechanisms. This analysis uses a new approach to measuring the astrophysical muon $\bar{\nu}:\nu$ ratio at various energies. It uses inelasticity, the fraction of the initial neutrino energy carried away by the hadronic shower. Inelasticity probes the $\bar{\nu}:\nu$ ratio due to the fact that at energies below roughly 100 TeV, valence quarks dominate in deep inelastic scattering interactions, leading to different neutrino and antineutrino inelasticities and cross-sections. We use 10.3 years of IceCube data consisting of starting tracks at energies between 1 TeV and 1 PeV with a self-veto selection that enhances astrophysical event purity in the down-going direction. Based on this sample and analysis method, we present the first measurement of the astrophysical $\bar{\nu}:\nu$ ratio at sub-PeV energies.

 - **Abstract**
 The proper motion (also known as position drift) field of extragalactic sources at cosmological distances across our sky can be used to measure the acceleration of the Solar System through the aberration effect. If measured very precisely, the signal would also hold cosmological information, for instance about bulk flows of distant sources or the presence of tensor modes. In the $\Lambda$ cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model, the acceleration of the Solar System is by far the dominant contributor to the position drift signal for sources at cosmological distances, and the measurement is therefore expected to yield a constant spheroidal dipole across redshifts as long as convergence to the cosmic restframe has been reached. The aim of this paper is to test this hypothesis. We analyze data from the cosmic reference frame dataset of Gaia data release 3 focusing on constraining the dipole and quadrupole in the position drift signal, with an emphasis on redshift dependence of the signal as a consistency test of the $\Lambda$CDM model. The spheroidal dipole that we find is in mild tension, at the level of $2-3\sigma$, with the constant-in-redshift signature expected from the local acceleration of the Solar System. We also find significant quadrupole components, that however do not have any significant evolution with redshift. The most straightforward interpretation of these findings is (unknown) systematic errors related to the Gaia instrumentation, but a cosmological origin is a possibility. Our analysis remains inconclusive on the cause of the redshift dependence of the dipole and warrants further investigations with upcoming data releases. We discuss possible implications of our results and highlight the importance of proper motion measurements for rest frame determinations in cosmology. In our discussion, we highlight interesting avenues for doing cosmology with Gaia data.

          Survey of (sub)mm water masers in low-mass star-forming regions

 - **Abstract**
 Water masers are common in star-forming regions (SFRs), with the 22.235 GHz transition widely detected in both high- and low-mass protostars. In contrast, (sub)millimeter water maser transitions remain poorly studied, especially in low-mass SFRs. We search for millimeter water masers in a sample of low-mass SFRs previously known to exhibit 22 GHz emission. We target the transitions at 183.3, 321.2, and 325.2 GHz, respectively. We also examine their potential as probes of evolutionary stage by comparing them with previously reported Class I methanol masers (MM). We used the APEX 12m telescope. To assess the evolutionary stage of each source, we modeled their spectral energy distributions (SEDs) using archival data and used the derived dust temperatures as proxies of ages. We then compared the occurrence of water and methanol masers across the sample. We detected 183.3 GHz water masers in 5 out of 18 sources. IRAS 16293-2422 shows all three transitions, while Serpens FIRS 1 also displays the 321.2 GHz line. Despite excellent observing conditions, detection rates drop with increasing frequency, reflecting both intrinsic line weakness and variability. Notably, the brightest (sub)millimeter masers can reach flux densities comparable to the 22 GHz line. Comparisons of velocity profiles show that different transitions often trace distinct gas components. Water masers generally appear at earlier or comparable evolutionary stages than MM, suggesting no universal maser-based age sequence. Our results demonstrate the detectability of submillimeter water in low-mass SFRs, although their occurrence is sparse. Velocity overlap between some centimeter and millimeter components suggests partial spatial coincidence, but many features appear uniquely in one frequency regime, indicating that different transitions often trace distinct gas regions with varying physical conditions.

          Surface Response of Mercury's Sulfides under Solar Wind Ion Irradiation

 - **Abstract**
 The MESSENGER mission revealed unexpectedly high sulfur content within Mercury's surface, deviating from the Lunar regolith, which was, until recently, considered a good Mercury analogue. Mercury's exposure to energetic space weathering processes such as meteoritic impact and solar-wind sputtering suggests this high sulfur concentration should be reflected in the suprathermal sulfur population of the Hermean exosphere. UV spectroscopy has not yet detected exospheric sulfur, a result attributed primarily to its low glow-factor. Future detection by BepiColombo's Mass Spectrum Analyzer depends on sulfur abundance in the exosphere. Radiation-induced segregation has been observed in the common sulfide troilite (FeS), a constituent mineral in returned Lunar samples, meteorites, and asteroids, where the resulting metal cap is expected to reduce sulfur ejection to Mercury's exosphere. In this work, we investigate the irradiation response of Mercury-relevant sulfides. Niningerite (MgS) and oldhamite (CaS) were irradiated with solar-wind speed 2 keV H$_2^+$ or 4 keV He$^+$, and in-situ compositional and chemical bond analysis as a function of fluence was performed using an XPS microprobe. Neither MgS nor CaS expressed detectable damage-induced segregation and instead reached metal-to-sulfur ratios close to bulk with irradiation. Based on this finding, structural information, and literature analyses, we infer that an S-S anionic spacing exceeding $\sim$3.2 Å inhibits radiation-induced sulfur depletion and promotes stoichiometric sputtering. We therefore predict no cation (metal) surface segregation in Hermean sulfides and no reduction in suprathermal sulfur emission caused by metal cladding formation in TiS, CrS, and Ca-Mg sulfides. This radiation-hardness for Mercury-relevant sulfides is novel and unexpected, and should facilitate detection in Mercury's exosphere by the BepiColombo mission.

          The X-ray Variability and Luminosity Function of High Mass X-ray Binaries in the Dwarf Starburst Galaxy IC 10

 - **Abstract**
 We present an analysis of $\sim$235 ks of Chandra observations obtained over $\sim$19 years of the nearby dwarf starburst galaxy IC 10 in order to study the X-ray variability and X-ray luminosity function (XLF) of its X-ray binary (XRB) population. We identify 23 likely XRBs within the 2MASS $K_S$ isophotal radius and find the distributions of their dynamic ranges and duty cycles are consistent with a young, high-mass XRB population dominated by supergiant (sg)-fed systems, consistent with previous work. In general, we find that brighter HMXBs (those with $L_X\gtrsim$several$\times10^{36}$ erg s$^{-1}$) have higher duty cycles (i.e., are more persistent X-ray sources) than fainter objects, and the dynamic ranges of the sgHMXBs in the lower metallicity environment of IC 10 are higher than what is observed for comparable systems in the Milky Way. After filtering out foreground stars on the basis of Gaia parallaxes we construct, for the first time, the XLF of IC 10. We then use the XLF to model the star formation history of the galaxy, finding that a very recent (3-8 Myr) burst of star formation with rate of $\sim$0.5 $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ is needed to adequately explain the observed bright-end ($L_X\sim10^{37}$ erg s$^{-1}$) of the HMXB XLF.

          Hubble Space Telescope Observations of the Interstellar Interloper 3I/ATLAS

 - **Abstract**
 We present high angular resolution observations of the third known interstellar interloper, 3I/ATLAS, from the Hubble Space Telescope. The object is clearly active at 3.8 au pre-perihelion, showing dust emitted from the hot Sun-facing side of the nucleus and a weak, radiation pressure swept tail away from the Sun. We apply a simple model to estimate the mass loss rate in dust as dM/dt = 6 a kg/s, where a is the mean particle size in microns. With 1 < a < 100, we infer dM/dt = 6 to 60 kg/s. A fit to the surface brightness distribution of the inner coma limits the effective radius of the nucleus to be r < 2.8 km, assuming red geometric albedo 0.04. Conversely, the nucleus cannot be smaller than 0.16 km in radius if its coma is supplied by sublimation of carbon monoxide, and must be larger if a less volatile molecule drives the mass loss.

          Photochemical Haze Formation on Titan and Uranus: A Comparative Review

 - **Abstract**
 The formation and evolution of haze layers in planetary atmospheres play a critical role in shaping their chemical composition, radiative balance, and optical properties. In the outer solar system, the atmospheres of Titan and the giant planets exhibit a wide range of compositional and seasonal variability, creating environments favorable for the production of complex organic molecules under low-temperature conditions. Among them, Uranus -- the smallest of the ice giants -- has, since Voyager 2, emerged as a compelling target for future exploration due to unanswered questions regarding the composition and structure of its atmosphere, as well as its ring system and diverse icy moon population (which includes four possible ocean worlds). Titan, as the only moon to harbor a dense atmosphere, presents some of the most complex and unique organics found in the solar system. Central to the production of these organics are chemical processes driven by low-energy photons and electrons (<50 eV), which initiate reaction pathways leading to the formation of organic species and gas phase precursors to high-molecular-weight compounds, including aerosols. These aerosols, in turn, remain susceptible to further processing by low-energy UV radiation as they are transported from the upper atmosphere to the lower stratosphere and troposphere where condensation occurs. In this review, I aim to summarize the current understanding of low-energy (<50 eV) photon- and electron-induced chemistry, drawing on decades of insights from studies of Titan, with the objective of evaluating the relevance and extent of these processes on Uranus in anticipation of future observational and in situ exploration.

          Re-examination of the CO absorption line in the M87 nucleus

 - **Abstract**
 We analyzed the archival ALMA data of the nuclear region of M87 and evaluate the molecular gas content from the CO(2--1) absorption line. We found an enigmatic variability in the absorption line depth between two epochs separated by only two months. We reexamined the dataset used in the analysis and found that the bandpass calibration source within the same dataset also revealed a similar absorption line structure. Furthermore, we observed a rise in the system noise temperature spectrum. We concluded that the absorption line structure identified in a previous study, and attributed to CO(2--1), does not originate from M87 but instead results from telluric contamination, and that we still have only the upper limit on the molecular gas around the nucleus of M87.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar age determination for large samples of stars opens new avenues for a broad range of astronomical sciences. While precise stellar ages for evolved stars have been derived from large ground- and space-based stellar surveys, reliable age determination for cool main-sequence dwarf stars remains a challenge. In this work, we set out to estimate the age of dwarf stars from the LAMOST spectra with a data-driven approach. We build a training set by using wide binaries that the primary component has reliable isochrone age estimate thus gives the age of the secondary. This training set is further supplemented with field stars and cluster stars whose ages are known. We then train a data-driven model for inferring age from their spectra with the XGBoost algorithm. Given a spectral signal-to-noise ratio greater than 50, the age estimation precise to 10% to 25% for K-type stars, as younger stars have larger relative errors. Validations suggest that the underlying information used for our age estimation is largely attributed to the LAMOST spectral features of chemical abundances. It means our result is a manifestation of stellar chemical clock effectively acted on LAMOST spectra ($R\simeq1800$). Applying our model to the LAMOST DR10 yields a massive age catalog for $\sim4$ million dwarf stars. Statistical properties, such as the age distribution, age-abundance and age-stellar activity relations of the sample stars are discussed. The catalog is publicly accessible and can be helpful for extensive sciences from detection and characterization of Earth-like planets to Galactic archaeology.

 - **Abstract**
 To understand the underlying mechanisms for high lithium abundances among core He-burning or red clump (RC) giants, we analyzed a sample of 5227 RC giants of mass M $\leq$ 2~M$_{\odot}$ using spectra and asteroseismic data. We found 120 RC giants ($\sim$2~$\%$) with a lower limit of A(Li) = 0.7~dex, a factor of 40 more than their predecessors close to the RGB tip. Of the 120 RC giants, we could measure actual rotations for 16 RC giants using stellar spots from the Kepler light curve analysis. We found that most of the high rotation RC giants are also very high Li-rich RC giants, and the rotation seems to decline rapidly with Li abundance depletion, suggesting that both the high rotation and high Li abundance are transient phenomena and associated with a single source. Further, we found a significantly high occurrence of 15~$\%$ and 12~$\%$ of Li-rich RC giants among extremely low-mass RC giants and RC giants with anomalous [C/N] ratios, respectively. The extremely low mass, fast rotation and anomalous [C/N] values of RC giants are attributed to their past binary interaction/merger history. The results pose a question of whether the binary interaction/merger is a prerequisite along with the He-flash for Li-enhancement among RC giants.

 - **Abstract**
 In recent years, a significant number of observatories and universities have been planning to construct optical and infrared telescopes at the Lenghu site in Qinghai Province due to the site's excellent seeing and clear night sky fraction. Although astronomical performances of the Lenghu site have been reported in detail by numerous papers, there were few reports showing statistics of temperature and wind characteristics in the traditional way required for the design of steel structures of large astronomical telescopes and enclosures, as well as the ventilation and air conditioning systems of these enclosures. This paper aims to present such new statistical data on temperature and wind conditions at the site, which could be helpful to inform and aid in such design decisions at the Lenghu site

 - **Abstract**
 The pulsation of white dwarfs provides crucial information on stellar parameters for understanding the atmosphere and interior structure of these stars. In this study, we present a comprehensive statistical analysis of known ZZ Ceti stars from historical literature. Our dataset includes stellar parameters and oscillation properties from 339 samples, with 194 of them having undergone asteroseismological analysis. We investigated the empirical instability strip of ZZ Ceti stars and confirmed the linear relationship between temperature and weighted mean pulsation periods (WMP). We found that the WMP distribution is well-described with two groups of stars with peak values at $\sim254$ s and $\sim719$ s. Using seismic mass and trigonometrical radii derived from GAIA DR3 parallaxes, we tested the mass-radius relationship of white dwarfs through observational and seismic analysis of ZZ Cetis. They are generally larger than the theoretical values, with the discrepancy reaching up to $\sim15\%$ for massive stars with a mass estimated by seismology.

 The Querying Underlying mechanisms of massive star formation with ALMA-Resolved gas Kinematics and Structures (QUARKS) survey observed 139 infrared-bright (IR-bright) massive protoclusters at 1.3 mm wavelength with ALMA. This study investigates clump-to-core fragmentation and searches for candidate high-mass starless cores within IR-bright clumps using combined ALMA 12-m (C-2) and Atacama Compact Array (ACA) 7-m data, providing $\sim$ 1 arcsec ($\sim\rm0.02~pc$ at 3.7 kpc) resolution and $\sim\rm0.6\,mJy\,beam^{-1}$ continuum sensitivity ($\sim 0.3~M_{\odot}$ at 30 K). We identified 1562 compact cores from 1.3 mm continuum emission using getsf. Observed linear core separations ($\lambda_{\rm obs}$) are significantly less than the thermal Jeans length ($\lambda_{\rm J}$), with the $\lambda_{\rm obs}/\lambda_{\rm J}$ ratios peaking at $\sim0.2$. This indicates that thermal Jeans fragmentation has taken place within the IR-bright protocluster clumps studied here. The observed low ratio of $\lambda_{\rm obs}/\lambda_{\rm J}\ll 1$ could be the result of evolving core separation or hierarchical fragmentation. Based on associated signatures of star formation (e.g., outflows and ionized gas), we classified cores into three categories: 127 starless, 971 warm, and 464 evolved cores. Two starless cores have mass exceeding 16$\,M_{\odot}$, and represent high-mass candidates. The scarcity of such candidates suggests that competitive accretion-type models could be more applicable than turbulent core accretion-type models in high-mass star formation within these IR-bright protocluster clumps.

 - **Abstract**
 Giant impacts were common in the early evolution of the Solar System, and it is possible that Venus also experienced an impact. A giant impact on Venus could have affected its rotation rate and possibly its thermal evolution. In this work, we explore a range of possible impacts using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). We consider the final major collision, assuming that differentiation already occurred and that Venus consists of an iron core (30% of Venus' mass) and a forsterite mantle (70% of Venus' mass). We use differentiated impactors with masses ranging from 0.01 to 0.1 Earth masses, impact velocities between 10 and 15 km/s, various impact geometries (head-on and oblique), different primordial thermal profiles, and a range of pre-impact rotation rates of Venus. We analyse the post-impact rotation periods and debris disc masses to identify scenarios that can reproduce Venus' present-day characteristics. Our findings show that a wide range of impact scenarios are consistent with Venus' current rotation. These include head-on collisions on a non-rotating Venus and oblique, hit-and-run impacts by Mars-sized bodies on a rotating Venus. Importantly, collisions that match Venus' present-day rotation rate typically produce minimal debris discs residing within Venus' synchronous orbit. This suggests that the material would likely reaccrete onto the planet, preventing the formation of long-lasting satellites - consistent with Venus' lack of a moon. We conclude that a giant impact can be consistent with both Venus' unusual rotation and lack of a moon, potentially setting the stage for its subsequent thermal evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 In order to compress and more easily interpret Lyman-$\alpha$ forest (Ly$\alpha$F) datasets, summary statistics, e.g. the power spectrum, are commonly used. However, such summaries unavoidably lose some information, weakening the constraining power on parameters of interest. Recently, machine learning (ML)-based summary approaches have been proposed as an alternative to human-defined statistical measures. This raises a question: can ML-based summaries contain the full information captured by traditional statistics, and vice versa? In this study, we apply three human-defined techniques and one ML-based approach to summarize mock Ly$\alpha$F data from hydrodynamical simulations and infer two thermal parameters of the intergalactic medium, assuming a power-law temperature-density relation. We introduce a metric for measuring the improvement in the figure of merit when combining two summaries. Consequently, we demonstrate that the ML-based summary approach not only contains almost all of the information from the human-defined statistics, but also that it provides significantly stronger constraints by a ratio of better than 1:3 in terms of the posterior volume on the temperature-density relation parameters.

 - **Abstract**
 The majority of Galactic globular star clusters (GCs) have been reported to contain at least two populations of stars (we use P1 for the primordial and P2 for the chemically-enriched population). Recent observational studies found that dynamically-old GCs have P1 and P2 spatially mixed due to relaxation processes. However, in dynamically-young GCs, where P2 is expected to be more centrally concentrated from birth, the spatial distributions of P1 and P2 are sometimes very different from system to system. This suggests that more complex dynamical processes specific to certain GCs might have shaped those distributions. We aim to investigate the discrepancies between the spatial concentration of P1 and P2 stars in dynamically-young GCs. Our focus is to evaluate whether massive binary stars (e.g. BHs) can cause the expansion of the P2 stars through binary-single interactions in the core, and whether they can mix or even radially invert the P1 and P2 distributions. We use a set of theoretical and empirical arguments to evaluate the effectiveness of binary-single star scattering. We then construct a set of direct N-body models with massive primordial binaries to verify our estimates further and gain more insights into the dynamical processes in GCs. We find that binary-single star scatterings can push the central P2 stars outwards within a few relaxation times. While we do not produce radial inversion of P1 and P2 for any initial conditions we tested, this mechanism systematically produces clusters where P1 and P2 look fully mixed even in projection. The mixing is enhanced 1) in denser GCs, 2) in GCs containing more binary stars, and 3) when the mass ratio between the binary components and the cluster members is higher. Binary-single star interactions seem able to explain the observable properties of some dynamically-young GCs (e.g. NGC4590 or NGC5904) where P1 and P2 are fully radially mixed.

 - **Abstract**
 The first JWST observations of SN 1987A provided clear evidence that a compact object is ionizing the innermost ejecta. Here we analyze a second epoch of JWST NIRSpec and MIRI/MRS observations to better characterize the properties of this region, aided by a higher spectral resolving power for the new NIRSpec data. We confirm the presence of the previously identified narrow lines from the central region; [Ar VI] 4.5292 $\mu$m, [Ar II] 6.9853 $\mu$m, [S IV] 10.5105 $\mu$m, and [S III] 18.7130 $\mu$m, and also identify similar components in [Ca V] 4.1585 $\mu$m, [Cl II] 14.3678 $\mu$m, and possibly [Fe II] 1.6440 $\mu$m. These lines are blueshifted by $\sim$ -250 km/s, while the emission region is spatially unresolved and located southeast of the center. The offset and blueshift could imply a kick velocity of $510 \pm 55$ km/s for the neutron star. We also identify [Ca IV] 3.2068 $\mu$m near the center, but it is displaced to the north and has a redshift of $\sim 700$ km/s. We find that scattering by dust in the ejecta with a typical grain size $\sim 0.3\ \mu$m can explain the [Ca IV] properties and the absence of other narrow lines at shorter wavelengths, while dust absorption is important at $\lambda \gtrsim 8\ \mu$m. Photoionization models for a pulsar wind nebula and a cooling neutron star are both compatible with the observations, with the exception of the [Fe II] feature. The two models primarily differ at short wavelengths, where new lines are expected to emerge over time as the optical depth of dust in the expanding ejecta decreases.

 - **Abstract**
 In the last few years Intensity Interferometry (II) has made significant strides in achieving high-precision resolution of stellar objects at optical wavelengths. Despite these advancements, phase retrieval remains a major challenge due to the nature of photon correlation. This paper explores the application of a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) to tackle the problem of image reconstruction in Intensity Interferometry. This approach successfully reconstructs the shape, size, and brightness distribution of a fast-rotating star from sparsely sampled, spatial power spectrum of the source, corresponding to II with four telescopes. Although this particular example could also be addressed using parameter fitting, the results suggest that with larger arrays much more complicated systems could be reconstructed by applying machine-learning techniques to II.

 - **Abstract**
 Aperture photometry is a fundamental technique widely used to obtain high-precision light curves in optical survey projects like Tianyu. However, its effectiveness is limited in crowded fields, and the choice of aperture size critically impacts photometric precision. To address these challenges, we propose DeepAP, an efficient and accurate two-stage deep learning framework for aperture photometry. Specifically, for a given source, we first train a Vision Transformer (ViT) model to assess its feasibility of aperture photometry. We then train the Residual Neural Network (ResNet) to predict its optimal aperture size. For aperture photometry feasibility assessment, the ViT model yields an ROC AUC value of 0.96, and achieves a precision of 0.974, a recall of 0.930, and an F1 score of 0.952 on the test set. For aperture size prediction, the ResNet model effectively mitigates biases inherent in classical growth curve methods by adaptively selecting apertures appropriate for sources of varying brightness, thereby enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) across a wide range of targets. Meanwhile, some samples in the test set have a higher SNR than those obtained by exhaustive aperture size enumeration because of the finer granularity of aperture size estimation. By integrating ResNet with the ViT network, the DeepAP framework achieves a median total processing time of 18 milliseconds for a batch of 10 images, representing a speed-up of approximately 59000 times compared to exhaustive aperture size enumeration. This work paves the way for the automatic application of aperture photometry in future high-precision surveys such as Tianyu and LSST. The source code and model are available at this https URL.

 We present the first first X-ray polarization measurements of a white dwarf, the intermediate polar EX Hya. We measured significant polarization only in the 2 -- 3 keV energy band with a polarization degree of 8 percent at a $3\sigma$ significance. No significant polarization was detected above 3 keV, which we attribute to the higher energy bands having lower signal-to-noise. We found that the scattering surface detected by the IXPE is nearly perpendicular to the optical scattering plane, showing that the X-ray scattering surface is the WD and close to the base of the accretion column. Finally, we show how the polarization can be used to estimate the height of the accretion shock above the white dwarf's surface.

 - **Abstract**
 Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and carbonaceous dust have been observed in clumpy circumstellar environments, yet their formation and evolutionary pathways in such environments remain elusive. We aim to characterize the PAH emission in a clumpy planetary nebula to decipher their formation and evolution pathways. We obtained JWST Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) and Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) integral field unit spectroscopic observations of two individual knots in the Ring Nebula (NGC 6720), a clumpy planetary nebula, and determine the PAH spectral characteristics. We detect the 3.3 and 11.2 um PAH emission bands in both knots but do not detect PAH emission in the 6-9 um range. We supplement our data with Spitzer Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) Short-Low 1 (SL1) and SL2 data, containing 11.2, weak 6.2, and weak 7.7 um PAH emission bands. The JWST data confirm the unusual profile of the 11.2 um band, which is very broad and redshifted with respect to typical 11.2 um PAH profiles. We estimate the PAH population to be largely neutral. The relative integrated surface brightness of the 3.3 and 11.2 um bands indicates the presence of small-sized PAHs, consisting of 35 +/- 6 carbon atoms. We find that the PAH emission is concentrated outside of the clumps, in the inter-clump medium, and confirm the existence of enhanced PAH emission in a narrow 'PAH ring' centred on the central star. This morphology suggests that PAHs formed during the Ring Nebula's asymptotic giant branch phase, in the central star's dust-driven wind.

 - **Abstract**
 A sample of high-frequency peaker (HFP) candidates was formed from the AT20G catalog radio sources with spectral indices of the optically thick emission region $\alpha_{below}$ exceeding +0.5. A study of the spectral properties of the sources in the sample, which included 269 radio sources, was performed. The spectra of the sources were constructed and the spectral indices below $\alpha_{below}$ and above the peak $\alpha_{above}$, the peak frequency $\nu_{obs}$, the flux density at the peak frequency $S_{peak}$, and the peak half-width in the radio spectrum were determined. Analysis of the spectra showed that the sample is fairly homogeneous and consists of HFPs with $\nu_{obs}>5$ GHz. Most sources (67%) do not have data at frequencies below 0.8 GHz. 187 sources have ultra-inverted spectra ($\alpha_{below}>$+0.7), which is 3.2% of all sources in the AT20G catalog and 70% of radio sources in our sample. Optical identification of radio sources in the sample showed that 70% of the hosts are quasars. The sample consists of compact objects with radio luminosity at 20 GHz in the range of $10^{23}$-$10^{30}$ W/Hz, angular sizes of emitting regions of radio sources are 0.002-0.25 mas, projected linear sizes are from 0.2 to 30 pc. The dependence of the peak frequencies of radio sources on their angular sizes is in good agreement with that previously discovered for CSS and GPS sources.

 - **Abstract**
 We perform a suite of numerical simulations of tidal disruption events, using smoothed particle hydrodynamics, for a close binary system consisting of two low-mass white dwarfs, and an intermediate mass non-spinning black hole. The binary components are considered to be detached and on the same plane with the black hole. Our results quantify how the outcomes of these events depend crucially on the positional configuration of the binary components at the orbital pericenter, and we also show how distinctive behaviour for non-identical mass binaries arise, as compared to identical ones. We highlight these differences on observables such as mass fallback rates, kick velocities and gravitational waves, and also compute clump formation time within the stellar debris. In our setup, prograde binary motion, where the angular momentum of the binary is in the same direction as that of the center of mass motion around the black hole, is qualitatively similar to multiple events of single star tidal disruptions. However, we argue that interactions between stellar debris in the corresponding retrograde scenarios result in different and distinct outcomes. Our results should serve as indicative benchmarks in the observational aspects of tidal interactions between close white dwarf binaries and intermediate mass black holes.

 - **Abstract**
 Orbital maneuver planning is a critical aspect of mission design, aimed at minimizing propellant consumption, which is directly correlated with the total velocity change ($\Delta V$). While analytical solutions like the Hohmann and Bi-elliptic transfers offer optimal strategies for specific cases, they lack the flexibility for more general optimization problems. This paper presents a computational framework that couples a Genetic Algorithm (GA) with the Poliastro orbital mechanics library to autonomously discover fuel-optimal, three-impulse transfer trajectories between coplanar circular orbits. We validate this framework across two distinct scenarios: a low-energy transfer from Low Earth Orbit (LEO) to a Geostationary Orbit (GEO), and a high-energy transfer to a distant orbit with a radius 20 times that of LEO. Our results demonstrate the framework's remarkable adaptability. For the LEO-to-GEO transfer, the GA precisely converges to the classical Hohmann transfer, achieving an identical $\Delta V$ of 3853.96 m/s and validating the method's accuracy. Conversely, for the high-energy transfer, the GA identifies a superior Bi-elliptic trajectory that yields a significant $\Delta V$ saving of 213.47 m/s compared to the Hohmann transfer. This fuel efficiency, however, necessitates a trade-off, extending the mission duration from approximately 1 day to over 140 years. This work demonstrates an accessible and powerful toolchain for the rapid prototyping of optimal trajectories, showcasing how combining evolutionary algorithms with open-source libraries provides a robust method for solving complex astrodynamics problems and quantifying their critical design trade-offs.

 - **Abstract**
 We perform a detailed observational analysis of several galactic X-ray binaries, focusing on the interplay between black hole spin, jet power, and radiative efficiency within the context of Blandford-Znajek-powered jets. Using updated measurements from continuum fitting and Fe-line methods, we constrain the spin parameter a and the deviation parameter $\beta$ for five key black hole systems: H1743-322, XTE J1550-564, GRS 1124-683, GRO J1655-40, and GRS 1915+105. For each system, we compare the allowed parameter spaces derived independently from observed radiative efficiencies and emitted jet powers under different assumptions for the jet Lorentz factor $\Gamma=2,5$. By overlapping these observational constraints with theoretical expectations for regular black holes, we assess the viability of various spin-deviation combinations in explaining the observed phenomena. Our results reveal significant restrictions on the allowed values of $\beta$, with typical upper bounds around 0.38 - 0.4, except for rapidly spinning sources where the constraint becomes notably tighter. We further present a modified method for generating rotating solutions from static regular black hole spacetimes and provide a robust theoretical framework for relating jet power to black hole angular frequency in curved geometries. We also find that the theoretical jet power is modified by regularization factor for regular black holes. These findings place stringent observational bounds on deviations from the Kerr geometry and provide important insight into the astrophysical mechanisms powering accreting stellar-mass black holes.

 - **Abstract**
 At certain radii protoplanetary discs may sustain a form of oscillatory convection (`convective overstability'; COS) due to localised adverse entropy gradients. The resulting hydrodynamical activity can produce coherent structures, such as zonal flows and vortices, that may concentrate solid material and aid their further coagulation. In this paper we extend previous axisymmetric runs by performing local three-dimensional simulations of the COS, using the code SNOOPY. As parameters are varied, we characterise how the various axisymmetric COS saturated states are transformed in 3D, while also tracking their interrelationship with the subcritical baroclinic instability. In particular, at low Reynolds number (Re) our 3D simulations exhibit similar weakly nonlinear and wave turbulent states to our earlier axisymmetic runs. At higher Re, but low Peclet number (Pe), we obtain bursty cycles involving the creation of zonal flows, the subsequent development of planar vortices, and their destruction by elliptical instability. For larger Pe, however, zonal flows can persist, alongside weaker more elongated vortices. These results further reveal the diversity of the COS's behaviour, and show that solid accumulation via COS-induced vortices may not be straightforward.

          On the spatiotemporal coincidence of meteorites in recent fall search campaigns

 - **Abstract**
 The meteoritical community widely assumes that the probability of finding two meteorites from different falls laying in close proximity is negligible. However, recent studies have suggested that spatiotemporal coincidences may be critical when associating a meteorite with a witnessed fall. In this work, we estimate the number of accumulated meteorites--those resulting from past falls--that are present in landing regions of new falls, while accounting for the effects of terrestrial weathering. We present a simple, fast-computing model to estimate such probability, validated with a Monte Carlo approach based on dark flight computations from real meteorite-dropping fireball data. Considering meteorite masses higher than 10 g, our results indicate that in regions with minimal weathering, like Antarctica, the probability of encountering a previous meteorite within a new fall strewn field may be as high as 75%. In environments with higher weathering rates, like countryside or urban regions, this probability decreases to <1%. When considering the 30 g Lake Frome 006 meteorite coincidence case, the probability of recovering a non-related meteorite with an age of 3.2 kyr from a 0.7 km^2 search area is 6.9%. In the case of the 1 kg Ischgl meteorite, the probability of coincidence with another fresh meteorite of similar mass is 0.06% assuming a large strewn field of 210 km^2. Applied to the Almahata Sitta case, our model predicts a 11.3% of coincidence with a previous meteorite fall. Our results strongly suggest that isotopic dating is essential before associating any meteorite with a witnessed fall.

 - **Abstract**
 We assemble a homogeneous database of precise and consistent determinations of effective temperature, surface gravity, projected rotational rate, and macro- and micro-turbulent velocities for over 1800 Galactic stars spanning spectral types O to K and luminosity classes I to V. By carefully minimizing biases due to target selection, data quality, and disparate analysis techniques, we carry out statistical tests and comparative analyses to probe potential dependencies between these parameters and micro-turbulence. Our findings indicate that photospheric micro-turbulence is a genuine physical phenomenon rather than a modelling artifact. A direct comparison between observed micro-turbulent velocities and corresponding theoretical predictions for the turbulent pressure fraction strongly suggests that this phenomenon most likely arises from photospheric motions driven by envelope convection zones, with an additional pulsational component likely operating in main-sequence B stars. We show that neglecting micro-turbulent broadening in Fourier transform analyses can partly explain the dearth of slow rotators and the scarcity of stars with extremely low macro-turbulent velocity. We argue that including micro-turbulent pressure in atmospheric modelling can significantly mitigate (even resolve) the mass discrepancy for less massive O stars. Our database offers a valuable resource for testing and refining theoretical scenarios, particularly those addressing puzzling phenomena in hot massive stars.

          Detectability of compact intermediate-mass black hole binaries as low-frequency gravitational wave sources: the influence of dynamical friction of dark matter

 - **Abstract**
 The black hole (BH) spin could significantly change the density of dark matter (DM) in its vicinity, creating a mini-spike of the density of DM. The dynamical friction (DF) between DM and the companion star of a BH can provide an efficient loss of angular momentum, driving the BH-main sequence (MS) star binary to evolve toward a compact orbit system. We investigate the influence of the DF of DM on the detectability of intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH)-MS binaries as low-frequency gravitational wave (GW) sources. Taking into account the DF of DM, we employ the detailed binary evolution code MESA to model the evolution of a large number of IMBH-MS binaries. Our simulation shows that the DF of DM can drive those IMBH-MS binaries to evolve toward low-frequency GW sources for a low donor-star mass, a high spike index, or a short initial orbital period. When the spike index $\gamma=1.60$, those IMBH-MS binaries with donor-star masses of $1.0-3.4~ M_{\odot}$ and initial orbital periods of $0.65-16.82~ \rm days$ could potentially evolve into visible LISA sources within a distance of $10~\rm kpc$. The DF of DM can enlarge the initial parameter space and prolong the bifurcation periods. In the low-frequency GW source stage, the X-ray luminosities of those IMBH X-ray binaries are $\sim 10^{35}-10^{36}~\rm erg\,s^{-1}$, hence they are ideal multimessenger objects.

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a new model for the origin of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), attributing these phenomena to sudden discharges of accumulated electric charge in the accretion disk of compact objects such as black holes. Our framework demonstrates how Compton scattering within the disk plasma generates charge separation, creating a capacitor-like system stabilized by the equilibrium between radiation pressure and electrostatic forces. We detail the discharge process through destabilizing mechanisms in this capacitor, resulting in radiative emission. We compare our model's prediction on radiation signatures with observational data, using FRB2018725A as an example to obtain key quantitative relationships. Additionally, we estimate the total charge buildup via Compton scattering for a stellar-mass black hole, constrained by the best-fit between our model and observations, and determine the corresponding electron density in the accretion disk for this mechanism to operate.

 In the 7 Ms Chandra Deep Field-South catalog, only one source, XID 912, was highly significantly detected in X-rays but had no formally reported counterparts in the UV, optical, infrared, or radio bands. We identified its potential JWST and VLT VIMOS counterparts and measured the corresponding aperture photometry to construct its spectral energy distribution (SED). We fitted this SED using CIGALE. The results indicate that the source is most likely an off-nuclear ultraluminous X-ray source, rather than a background active galactic nucleus.

 - **Abstract**
 The rate of long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) from isolated Pop III stars is not well known, as it depends on our poor understanding of their initial mass function (IMF), rotation rates, stellar evolution, and mass loss. A sub-population of massive ($M_{\rm ZAMS}\gtrsim20M_\odot$) Pop III stars is expected to suffer core-collapse and launch a relativistic jet that would power a GRB. In the collapsar scenario, a key requirement is that the pre-supernova star imparts sufficient angular momentum to the remnant black hole to form an accretion disc and launch a relativistic jet, which demands rapid initial rotation of the progenitor star and suppression of line-driven mass loss during its chemically homogeneous evolution. Here we explore a grid of stellar evolution models of Pop III stars with masses $20\leq M_{\rm ZAMS}/M_\odot \leq 100$, which are initially rotating with surface angular velocities $0.6\leq \Omega_0/\Omega_{\rm crit}\leq 0.9$, where centrifugally-driven mass loss ensues for $\Omega>\Omega_{\rm crit}$. Realistic accretion and jet propagation models are used to derive the initial black hole masses and spins, and jet breakout times for these stars. The GRB production efficiency is obtained over a phase space comprising progenitor initial mass, rotation, and wind efficiency. For modest wind efficiency of $\eta_{\rm wind}=0.45-0.35$, the Pop III GRB production efficiency is $\eta_{\rm GRB}\sim10^{-5}-3\times10^{-4}\,M_\odot^{-1}$, respectively, for a top-heavy IMF. This yields an observable all-sky equivalent rate of $\sim2-40\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$ by \textit{Swift}, with 75\% of the GRBs located at $z\lesssim8$. If the actual observed rate is much lower, then this would imply $\eta_{\rm wind}>0.45$, which leads to significant loss of mass and angular momentum that renders isolated Pop III stars incapable of producing GRBs and favours a binary scenario instead.

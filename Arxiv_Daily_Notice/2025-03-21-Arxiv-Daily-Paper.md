 - **Abstract**
 The Maunakea Spectroscopic Explorer (MSE) ia a massively multiplexed spectroscopic survey facility that is proposed to replace the Canada-France-Hawai'i-Telescope in the 2040s. Since 2019, due to the uncertainty for new facilities on Maunakea, the project has been focused on new technology enabling greater capabilities beyond the concept design reviewed facility plan. Enhanced fiber density, and thereby survey speed, is made possible by using a new quad mirror (QM) 11.5-meter telescope design with 18,000+ fibers and a 1.5 square degree field-of-view. The MSE spectrographs will be moderate-resolution (360 nm through H-band at R=7,000) and high-resolution (R=40,000). MSE's baseline NIR capabilities will enable studies of highly-reddened regions in the Local Group, unlike other proposed next generation facilities. The MSE large-scale survey instrument suite will enable the equivalent to a full SDSS Legacy Survey every several weeks. This work presents the current status of the project after the Fall 2024 MSE science Workshop.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an updated collection of eclipsing and ellipsoidal binary systems in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC and SMC), as observed by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) survey. The catalog comprises a total of 75 400 binary systems, including 63 252 in the LMC and 12 148 in the SMC. The sample is categorized into 67 971 eclipsing and 7429 ellipsoidal variables. For all stars, we provide I-band and V-band photometric time series collected between 2010 and 2024 during the fourth phase of the OGLE project (OGLE-IV). We discuss methods used to identify binary systems in the OGLE data and present objects of particular interest, including double periodic variables, transient eclipsing binaries, double eclipsing binaries, and binary systems with pulsating stars. We present a comparative analysis based on the most comprehensive catalogs of variable stars in the Magellanic System, compiled from surveys like Gaia, ASAS-SN, and EROS-2, and included in the International Variable Star Index.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a homogeneous catalog of global asteroseismic parameters and derived stellar parameters for 765 Kepler main-sequence and subgiant stars. The catalog was produced by re-analyzing all available Kepler DR25 short-cadence data using pySYD, an automated pipeline to extract global asteroseismic parameters. We find 50 new detections, seven of which are also planet candidate host stars. We find excellent agreement between our $\nu_{\text{max}}$ and $\Delta \nu$ measurements and literature values, with an average offset of $0.2 \pm 0.4\%$ ($\sigma=5\%$) and $0.2 \pm 0.7\%$ ($\sigma=2\%$), respectively. In addition, we derive stellar radii and masses with an average precision of $2.7\%$ and $10.4\%$, respectively, and find a median offset of $0.4 \pm 0.4\%$ ($\sigma=10\%$) between our radii derived with asteroseismology and those from Gaia parallaxes. Using spectroscopic $\log{R'_{\text{HK}}}$ activity measurements from Keck/HIRES, we derive a new amplitude scaling relation with an activity term for main-sequence and subgiant stars, which reduces the offset between expected and observed oscillation amplitudes from $9.3 \pm 1.6\%$ to $1.7 \pm 0.9\%$. Our work is the largest and most homogeneous asteroseismic catalog of Kepler main-sequence and subgiant stars to date, including a total of 101 stars hosting planet candidates and 451 stars with measured rotation periods.

 - **Abstract**
 RY Scuti, thought to be a Wolf-Rayet (WR) progenitor, is a massive, post-main-sequence, binary star system undergoing Roche lobe overflow (RLOF). SOFIA (+FORCAST) spectroscopy of the inner, ionized region of RY Scuti's double ringed toroidal nebula affirms the previous detection of the well-studied 12.81 $\mu$m Ne II forbidden transition and reveals four distinct emission lines, including three previously undetected transitions, S III, Fe III, and S III. Cloudy photoionization modeling of the four neon, sulfur, and iron lines was performed to derive fractional abundances (log($\frac{X}{H}$)) of neon at -3.19 $\pm$ 0.0251, sulfur at -3.76 $\pm$ 0.0487, and iron at -2.23 $\pm$ 0.0286. All three species are overabundant with respect to fiducial solar chemical abundances, especially iron. Our analysis suggests that the outer envelope of the primary star in the RY Scuti system is being stripped away via RLOF, leaving helium-rich and hydrogen-poor material visible to observation. This material also exhibits elevated neon, sulfur, and iron fractional abundances, consistent with RY Scuti evolving toward a WR object.

          Light in the dark forest -- I. An efficient optimal estimator for 3D Lyman-alpha forest power spectrum

 - **Abstract**
 The highly anisotropic nature of the Lyman-alpha (Ly$\alpha$) forest data introduces a complex survey window function that complicates the measurement of the three-dimensional power spectrum ($P_{\mathrm{3D}}$). In this paper, we present the first fully optimal estimator for $P_{\mathrm{3D}}$, which exactly deconvolves the survey window function and marginalizes contaminated modes that distort the power spectrum. Our approach adapts optimal estimator techniques developed for the 2D cosmic microwave background data to the 3D case. To achieve computational feasibility, we employ the conjugate gradient method and implement the P$^3$M formalism to handle large-scale and small-scale operations separately and efficiently. We validate our estimator using Monte Carlo mocks and Gaussian simulations, demonstrating its accuracy and computational efficiency. We confirm that mode marginalization eliminates distortions arising from quasar continuum errors and delivers robust power spectrum estimation, though it also inflates errors at large scales. This first implementation works in the flat sky case; we discuss the remaining steps needed to generalize to the curved sky. This formalism offers a foundation for the Ly$\alpha$ forest $P_{\mathrm{3D}}$ measurements and a new path toward cosmological constraints from the Ly$\alpha$ forest data.

 - **Abstract**
 Deuterium, a heavy isotope of hydrogen, is a key tracer of the formation of the Solar System. Recent JWST observations have expanded the dataset of D/H ratios in methane on the KBOs Eris and Makemake, providing new insights into their origins. This study examines the elevated D/H ratios in methane on these KBOs in the context of protosolar nebula dynamics and chemistry, and proposes a primordial origin for the methane, in contrast to previous hypotheses suggesting abiotic production by internal heating. A time-dependent disk model coupled with a deuterium chemistry module was used to simulate the isotopic exchange between methane and hydrogen. Observational constraints, including the D/H ratio measured in methane in comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, were used to refine the primordial D/H abundance. The simulations show that the observed D/H ratios in methane on Eris and Makemake are consistent with a primordial origin. The results suggest that methane on these KBOs likely originates from the protosolar nebula, similar to cometary methane, and was sequestered in solid form -- either as pure condensates or clathrates -- within their building blocks prior to accretion. These results provide a { simple} explanation for the high D/H ratios in methane on Eris and Makemake, without the need to invoke internal production mechanisms.

          A low-redshift preference for an interacting dark energy model

 - **Abstract**
 We explore an interacting dark sector model in trace-free Einstein gravity where dark energy has a constant equation of state, $w=-1$, and the energy-momentum transfer potential is proportional to the cold dark matter density. Compared to the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, this scenario introduces a single additional dimensionless parameter, $\epsilon$, which determines the amplitude of the transfer potential. Using a combination of \textit{Planck} 2018 Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), DESI 2024 Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO), and Pantheon+ Type Ia supernovae (SNIa) data, we derive stringent constraints on the interaction, finding $\epsilon$ to be of the order of $\sim \mathcal{O}(10^{-4})$. While CMB and SNIa data alone do not favor the presence of such an interaction, the inclusion of DESI data introduces a mild $1\sigma$ preference for an energy-momentum transfer from dark matter to dark energy. This preference is primarily driven by low-redshift DESI BAO measurements, which favor a slightly lower total matter density $\Omega_m$ compared to CMB constraints. Although the interaction remains weak and does not significantly alleviate the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions, our results highlight the potential role of dark sector interactions in late-time cosmology.

 - **Abstract**
 Secondary eclipse observations of exoplanets at near-infrared wavelengths enable the detection of thermal emission and reflected stellar light, providing insights into the thermal structure and aerosol composition of their atmospheres. These properties are intertwined, as aerosols influence the energy budget of the planet. WASP-80 b is a warm gas giant with an equilibrium temperature of 825 K orbiting a bright late-K/early-M dwarf, and for which the presence of aerosols in its atmosphere have been suggested from previous HST and Spitzer observations. We present an eclipse spectrum of WASP-80 b obtained with JWST NIRISS/SOSS, spanning 0.68 to 2.83 $\mu$m, which includes the first eclipse measurements below 1.1 $\mu$m for this exoplanet, extending our ability to probe light reflected by its atmosphere. When a reflected light geometric albedo is included in the atmospheric retrieval, our eclipse spectrum is best explained by a reflected light contribution of $\sim$30 ppm at short wavelengths, although further observations are needed to statistically confirm this preference. We measure a dayside brightness temperature of $T_{\rm B}=811_{-70}^{+69}$ K and constrain the reflected light geometric albedo across the SOSS wavelength range to $A_{\rm g}=0.204_{-0.056}^{+0.051}$, allowing us to estimate a 1-$\sigma$ range for the Bond albedo of $0.148\lesssim A_{\rm B}\lesssim0.383$. By comparing our spectrum with aerosol models, we find that manganese sulfide and silicate clouds are disfavored, while cloud species with weak-to-moderate near-infrared reflectance, along with soots or low formation-rate tholin hazes, are consistent with our eclipse spectrum.

          The Nature of Classical Be Star Outbursts: A Multi-Epoch Study of the Be system EPIC 202060631

 - **Abstract**
 Through cross-matching the ASASSN photometric light curves and LAMOST spectroscopic observations, we serendipitously captured a rare major outburst event from the Be star EPIC 202060631, lasting over 1000 days. Fortuitously, the LAMOST ow-resolution spectra densely covered the flux rising stage with 20 epochs, while an additional 7 low-resolution and 11 medium esolution spectra monitored the subsequent decay phase. Moreover, this target was observed by Kepler telescope in its K2 mission when before the outburst and by TESS telescope while after returning to quiescence. Analyses of these datasets reveal pulsation behavior and mode amplitudes, indications of radial and tangential motions in the photosphere, and clear evidence of mass ejection and circumstellar disk formation. We modeled the central star using the BRUCE04 code and analyzed the disk structure using HDUST. Our results suggest episodic mass injection events from the central star triggered the disk buildup and carried imprints of the changing stellar pulsations. This study offers unique insights into the connections between photospheric activities, disk evolution, and stellar rotation during Be star outbursts.

 - **Abstract**
 The diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs) have remained a mystery in astronomy since their discovery over a century ago. The only currently known carrier is C$_{60}^+$ responsible for five DIBs, while more than 550 are yet to be interpreted. The spectra of short carbon chain cations C$_n^+$, which are considered one of the most promising classes of species for the role of carriers of DIBs, are successfully recorded using He-tagging spectroscopy. The comparison of laboratory spectra with the observations demonstrates a close match of two absorption bands of C$_4^+$ with the broad DIB at 503.9 nm. This defines a high abundance of these ions in the interstellar medium (ISM), which should exceed those of other similar-sized carbon chain cations. It is anticipated that all other short carbon chain cations will exhibit linear geometry and, as a consequence, will have a long vibrational progression. However, the distinctive cyclic geometry of C$_4^+$ is postulated to underpin the elevated abundance of these ions in the ISM, as well as the distinctive spectrum of this ion, which displays a single strong, relatively narrow absorption band that exceeds in intensity all other absorption bands in the visible range.

          Pulsations and Pre-He White Dwarf in the Post-mass Transfer Eclipsing System WASP 1021-28

 - **Abstract**
 We present results from VLT/UVES spectra and TESS photometric observations of the pulsating EL CVn binary WASP 1021-28, containing a He-core white dwarf precursor (pre-He WD). Double-lined radial velocities were measured with the atmospheric parameters of $T_{\rm eff,A}$ = 7411$\pm40$ K, [M/H] = 0.34$\pm$0.05 dex, and $v_{\rm A}$$\sin i$ = 86.6$\pm$4.0 km s$^{-1}$ for the more massive primary. Combining these measurements and TESS data from four sectors allowed the direct calculation of accurate values for the absolute parameters of each component and the distance to the system. The third-light source of $l_3$ = 0.029 may be the outer tertiary object previously discovered by SPHERE/IRDIS observations. WASP 1021-28 A is located near the blue edge of the $\gamma$ Dor instability strip, and the less massive companion is concurrent with the He-core WD model for metallicity $Z$ = 0.02 and mass $M$ = 0.191 $M_\odot$. The $Z$ value and the Galactic kinematics demonstrate that the program target belongs to the thin-disk population. We iteratively prewhitened the entire TESS residuals and extracted four and nine significant signals in two ranges of 1.12$-$2.25 day$^{-1}$ and 111.25$-$139.24 day$^{-1}$, respectively. A signal of $f_2$ = 1.31865 day$^{-1}$ in the low-frequency region can be attributed to the $\gamma$ Dor pulsation of WASP 1021-28 A, and the high frequencies may be extremely low-mass pre-He WD oscillations. The results presented here provide valuable information on the evolution of short-period EL CVn stars proposed as inner binaries of hierarchical triple systems and the multiperiodic pulsations.

 - **Abstract**
 Ultra-short-period (USP) planets are a rare but dynamically significant subset of the exoplanet sample, and understanding their dynamical histories and migration processes is necessary to build a complete picture of the outcomes of planet formation. In this work, we present an analysis of system age constraints and the impact of tidal evolution in the TOI-1937A system, a component of a large-separation stellar binary with an ambiguous age constraint that hosts a massive (> 2 $M_{Jup}$) USP planetary companion. Through a suite of tidal evolution simulations and analysis of the transit timing variations present in the photometric data, we find that the ultra-hot Jupiter TOI-1937Ab is likely undergoing orbital decay driven by tidal interactions, and we place an observational upper limit on its decay rate of |$\dot{P}$| < 0.09. We consider three different hypotheses for the system age based on three distinct methods of age estimation. These three age limits are complemented by indirect evidence of the age of the star that comes from our dynamical and transit timing analyses. We discuss the possibility that future data will provide more concrete constraints on the tidal parameters of TOI-1937Ab and its host star.

          Multiwavelength Analysis of GRB 250101A: From Gamma-ray Prompt Emission to Optical Afterglow

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are the most luminous transients in the universe. The interaction between the relativistic jet and the circumburst medium produces a multiwavelength afterglow through synchrotron radiation. In this work, we present multiwavelength properties of GRB~250101A based on the observations of Swift, Fermi, and Multi-channel Photometric Survey Telescope (Mephisto). The spectral analysis of Swift/BAT and Fermi/GBM reveals a soft prompt spectrum with a low-energy photon index of $-1.18$ and a peak energy of 33 keV, and the isotropic energy is $1.4\times10^{52}~{\rm erg}$. The prompt emission of GRB 250101A aligns with Type II GRBs in the Amati relation. Meanwhile, our analysis indicates that GRB 250101A is an X-ray-rich or X-ray-dominated GRB, with intrinsic properties suggesting that it is relatively softer than most classical GRBs. Optical observation with Mephisto, beginning 197 s post-trigger, shows a single power-law decay in $uvgriz$ bands, with $F_{\nu,\mathrm{obs}} \propto t^{-0.76} \nu^{-1.20}$. The observed spectral index significantly exceeds theoretical predictions under standard afterglow models, suggesting a color excess of $\sim0.21$ mag. However, combining X-ray and optical afterglow, we find that GRB 250101A is more likely a ``normal burst'' rather than an ``optical-dark burst'', and the dust extinction effect plays an important role in the optical blue bands. Furthermore, there is a structural change at $T_0+2924$ s in the optical light curve, indicating a density drop of $\sim50$ \% in the interstellar medium at a distance of $\sim0.05~{\rm pc}$.

          Characterising the Atmosphere of 55 Cancri e: 1D Forward Model Grid for Current and Future JWST Observations

 - **Abstract**
 Recent JWST observations with NIRCam and MIRI of the ultra-short-period super-Earth 55 Cancri e indicate a possible volatile atmosphere surrounding the planet. Previous analysis of the NIRCam spectra suggested potential absorption features from \ce{CO2} or \ce{CO} and significant sub-weekly variability. The MIRI low-resolution spectrum does not contain substantial features but was found to be consistent with effective heat redistribution models. In this work, we computed a grid of over 25000 self-consistent 1D forward models incorporating H-N-O-C-S-P-Si-Ti equilibrium chemistry and assessed plausible atmospheric compositions based on the current JWST data. Despite exhaustive analysis, the composition and properties of the atmosphere remain elusive. While our results statistically favour a global, hydrogen-free, nitrogen-dominated atmosphere enriched in \ce{PO} and \ce{CO2}, various alternative compositions, including \ce{H2O}-,\ce{CO}-, \ce{PH3}-, or Si-bearing remain viable explanations. Unconstrained heat redistribution efficiency and absolute NIRCam flux are among the largest sources of uncertainty in our analysis. We also find that the heat redistribution factor and surface pressure are highly degenerate with atmospheric composition, and that these parameters cannot be independently constrained using current JWST observations. Furthermore, we show that the observed variability may arise from dynamic interactions between the atmosphere and an underlying magma ocean, driving rapid shifts in atmospheric chemistry and thermal emission. Our results highlight the importance of using self-consistent forward models when analysing novel JWST spectra with limited signal-to-noise ratios -- such as those of 55 Cancri e -- as it allows for a more comprehensive evaluation of potential atmospheric scenarios while also being less sensitive to subtle spectral differences than retrievals...

 - **Abstract**
 To deepen our understanding of optical astronomy, we must advance imaging technology to overcome conventional frame-based cameras' limited dynamic range and temporal resolution. Our Perspective paper examines how neuromorphic cameras can effectively address these challenges. Drawing inspiration from the human retina, neuromorphic cameras excel in speed and high dynamic range by utilizing asynchronous pixel operation and logarithmic photocurrent conversion, making them highly effective for celestial imaging. We use 1300 mm terrestrial telescope to demonstrate the neuromorphic camera's ability to simultaneously capture faint and bright celestial sources while preventing saturation effects. We illustrate its photometric capabilities through aperture photometry of a star field with faint stars. Detection of the faint gas cloud structure of the Trapezium cluster during a full moon night highlights the camera's high dynamic range, effectively mitigating static glare from lunar illumination. Our investigations also include detecting meteorite passing near the Moon and Earth, as well as imaging satellites and anthropogenic debris with exceptionally high temporal resolution using a 200mm telescope. Our observations show the immense potential of neuromorphic cameras in advancing astronomical optical imaging and pushing the boundaries of observational astronomy.

 - **Abstract**
 The potential for catastrophic collision makes near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) a serious concern. Planetary defense depends on accurately classifying potentially hazardous asteroids (PHAs), however the complexity of the data hampers conventional techniques. This work offers a sophisticated method for accurately predicting hazards by combining machine learning, deep learning, explainable AI (XAI), and anomaly detection. Our approach extracts essential parameters like size, velocity, and trajectory from historical and real-time asteroid data. A hybrid algorithm improves prediction accuracy by combining several cutting-edge models. A forecasting module predicts future asteroid behavior, and Monte Carlo simulations evaluate the likelihood of collisions. Timely mitigation is made possible by a real-time alarm system that notifies worldwide monitoring stations. This technique enhances planetary defense efforts by combining real-time alarms with sophisticated predictive modeling.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Population III star clusters are predicted to form in unenriched dark matter halos. Direct N-body simulation of Pop III clusters implies the possible formation and merger of intermediate-mass binary black holes (IMBBHs). The gravitational wave signals could be detected by space-borne gravitational wave detectors like TianQin. Aims. This study evaluates the potential of TianQin in detecting IMBBHs from Pop III star clusters, focusing on key factors such as the detection horizon, detection number, and Fisher uncertainty. Methods. A Monte Carlo simulation is employed to derive IMBBH sources, utilizing the IMRPhenomD waveform model to simulate catalogs of observable IMBBH mergers. The mass and redshift distributions are derived from direct N-body simulations of IMBBHs in Population III star clusters. Detection numbers are determined by calculating the signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) of the simulated signals and applying thresholds for detection. Fisher uncertainty is obtained through Fisher information matrix analysis. Results. The findings suggest that TianQin could achieve detection numbers within 5 years ranging from 1 in the most pessimistic scenario to 253 in the most optimistic scenario. Furthermore, TianQin can precisely constrain the IMBBH mass with a relative uncertainty of $10^{-6}$, coalescence time $t_c$ within 1 second, and sky location $\bar{\Omega}_S$ within 1 $\rm{deg}^2$. However, the luminosity distance $D_L$ and inclination angle $\iota$ exhibit substantial degeneracies, limiting their precise estimation.

 - **Abstract**
 Our understanding of multiple populations in globular clusters (GCs) largely comes from photometry and spectroscopy: appropriate photometric diagrams can disentangle first and second populations (1P and 2P)-1P having chemical signatures similar to field stars, and 2P stars showing unique light-element variations-while spectroscopy enables detailed chemical abundances analyses of these populations. We combine multi-band photometry with extensive spectroscopic data to investigate the chemical composition of multiple populations across 38 GCs, yielding a chemical abundance dataset for stars with precise population tagging. This dataset provides the most extensive analysis of C, N, O, Na, Mg, and Al variations, revealing the largest sample yet of light-element spreads across GCs. GC mass correlates with light-element variations, supporting earlier photometric studies. We investigated iron differences among 1P stars, confirming their presence in 19 GCs, and finding a spread consistent with prediction based on photometry. Notably, in eight of them we detected a correlation between [Fe/H] and the position in iron-sensitive photometric diagrams. More massive GCs display larger lithium depletion among 2P stars, which is consistent with zero at smaller masses. Notably, some 2P stars with the most extreme chemical differences compared to 1P stars still show Li comparable to 1P, suggesting that the 1P polluters have produced some amount of this element. We analyzed the anomalous stars, a population characterized by enrichment in iron, s-process elements, and C+N+O, in ten GCs. NGC1851, NGC5139, NGC6656, and NGC 6715 display light-element inhomogeneities similar to 1P and 2P stars. Iron and barium enrichment varies widely-negligible in some clusters and much larger than errors in others. Generally, these elemental spreads correlate with GC mass.

 The SKA Observatory (SKAO), a landmark project in radio astronomy, seeks to address fundamental questions in astronomy. To process its immense data output, approximately 700 PB/year, a global network of SKA Regional Centres (SR-CNet) will provide the infrastructure, tools, computational power needed for scientific analysis and scientific support. The Spanish SRC (espSRC) focuses on ensuring the sustainability of this network by reducing its environmental impact, integrating green practices into data platforms, and developing Open Science technologies to enable reproducible research. This paper discusses and summarizes part of the research and development activities that the team is conducting to reduce the SRC energy consumption at the espSRC and SRCNet. The paper also discusses fundamental research on trusted repositories to support Open Science practices.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The Kepler and TESS space missions have revealed the rich gravity (g-)mode pulsation spectra of many hot subdwarf B (sdB) stars in detail. These spectra exhibit complex behaviors, with some stars exhibiting trapped modes interposing in the asymptotic period sequences of regular period spacing, while others do not. Methods. We used our STELlar modeling from the Universite de Montreal (STELUM) code to compute static (parametric) and evolutionary models of sdB stars, with different prescriptions for their chemical and thermal structures. We used our adiabatic PULSE code to compute the theoretical spectra of g-mode pulsations for degrees of l=1 to 4 and for periods between 1000 s and 15 000 s, amply covering the range of observed g-modes in these stars. Results. We show that g-mode pulsation spectra and, in particular, the appearance of trapped modes are highly dependent on the chemical and thermal structures in the models as the star evolves, particularly in the region just above the He-burning core. Depending on the prescriptions and specific evolutionary stage, we observe mainly three types of spectra for mid to high radial-order g-modes (the ones observed in sdB stars): flat spectra of nearly constant period spacing; spectra with deep minima of the period spacing interposing between modes with more regular spacing (which correspond to trapped modes); and spectra showing a wavy pattern in period spacing. For the two latter cases, we have identified the region where the modes are trapped in the star. Conclusions. Detailed comparisons with observed g-mode spectra ought to be carried out next to progress on this issue and constrain the internal structure of core-He burning stars via asteroseismology, in particular, for the region above the He-burning core.

 - **Abstract**
 Binary stars are pairs of stars that are gravitationally bound, providing in some cases accurate measurements of their masses and radii. As such, they serve as excellent testbeds for the theory of stellar structure and evolution. Moreover, binary stars that orbit each other at a sufficiently small distance will interact during their lifetimes, leading to a multitude of different evolutionary pathways that are not present in single star evolution. Among other outcomes, this can lead to the production of stellar mergers, rejuvenated and chemically contaminated accreting stars, stars stripped of their hydrogen envelopes and gravitational wave sources. For stars massive enough to undergo a supernova, binary interaction is expected to impact the evolution of most of them, making the understanding of binary evolution a critical element to comprehend stellar populations and their impact at large scales.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we conduct a statistical analysis of various cosmological models within the framework of f (R) gravity theories, motivated by persistent challenges in modern cosmology, such as the unknown mechanisms driving the late-time accelerated expansion of the universe. We begin by presenting a comprehensive formulation of these theories and discussing their potential to resolve the outstanding issues. Following this, we perform a detailed statistical examination in a cosmological context, leveraging a wide array of observational data. Special attention is given to the incorporation of the latest Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and of the Pantheon++SH0ES compilation, which play a critical role in constraining these models. Our results show an increase in the values of the distortion parameter b and of the Hubble parameter H0 estimates, due to the use of this new compilation of SnIa data. However, no major changes are perceived when using the DESI data set instead of the previous BAO observations.

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a method to detect exoplanets based on their host star's intensity centroid after it passes thru a vortex filter. Based on our calculations with planets in face-on orbits, exoplanets with relative proximity to their host stars and with low mass ratios ($m_p/m_s$) can have discernible signals that can be amplified by the topological charge $\ell$ of the vortex filter. For exoplanets that have higher mass ratios and are far from their host stars, a clear signal can also be obtained but these are not affected by the value of $\ell$ and other planet detection methods may be more suitable. We present a simple table-top optical experiment to support our calculations. Our proposed method adds to the arsenal of techniques for astrometric exoplanet detection.

 Stellar occultations are an ideal way to characterize the physical and orbital properties of trans-Neptunian binary systems. In this research note, we detail the prediction and observation of a stellar occultation observed with NASA's IRTF on March 16$^{\mathrm{th}}$, 2025 (UT), with drop-outs from both the dwarf planet Haumea and its smaller satellite Namaka. This occultation places a lower limit of 83 $\pm$ 2 km on Namaka's diameter. We also discuss the possibility that this detection could help to constrain the orbit of Namaka, measure Haumea's gravitational harmonics, and provide a path to measuring the internal structure of Haumea.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the spatial distribution and physical characteristics of molecular clouds in the G24 region, which is located near the intersection of the Milky Way's Galactic bar with the Norma arm and the 3 kpc arm. Utilizing molecular line data from the Milky Way Imaging Scroll Painting (MWISP) project, including $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, and C$^{18}$O, along with our own observations of HCO$^{+}$ line using the Purple Mountain Observatory (PMO) 13.7 m telescope, we have revealed the complex architecture of molecular clouds in the G24 region. Seven giant molecular clouds, each with a mass exceeding $10^4$ $M_\odot$ and a typical H$_2$ column density of $10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$, have been identified through observations of CO and its isotopes. The conversion factor $X_{\text{CO}}$ for the G24 region is estimated to be 8.25 $\times$ 10$^{19}$ cm$^{-2}$ (K km s$^{-1}$)$^{-1}$, aligning with the typical values observed in other regions. Adopting the GaussClumps algorithm, we have identified a total of 257, 201, and 110 clumps in $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O within G24 region, respectively. The derived physical properties (including effective radius, mass, and virial parameter) indicate that the majority of these clumps are gravitationally bound, with a subset possessing the potential to form massive stars. Examination of gas infall activities within these clumps further suggests ongoing massive star formation. The complex physical and kinematic environment, shaped by the G24 region's unique location within the Milky Way, has limited the clear detection of gas outflows.

 - **Abstract**
 This study analyzes twelve years of wind speed and direction data collected at the proposed National Large Solar Telescope (NLST) site near Pangong Tso, Merak village, Leh-Ladakh. A weather station from Campbell Scientific Instruments, installed in 2008, has been continuously monitoring meteorological parameters, including wind speed and direction. The data reveals a consistent pattern of predominantly northwest winds, particularly during morning hours, with speeds generally below 5 m/s. While seasonal variations influence wind speed and direction, the overall trend remains stable. To assess the site's suitability for astronomical observations, we compared high-altitude wind speeds at various renowned astronomical sites using reanalysis data from 2008 to 2020. Strong correlations were observed between surface and high-altitude wind speeds at 10~m, 50~m, and 500~m. Statistical analysis of 200-mbar pressure level wind speeds identified La Palma as the most favorable site with a wind speed of 18.76~m/s. La Silla, on the other hand, exhibited the highest wind speed at 34.76~m/s. Merak's estimated wind speed of 30.99~m/s, coupled with its favorable wind direction and low surface wind speeds, suggests its potential as a promising site for astronomical observations.

          Towards a definition of a meteor cluster: Detection of meteor clusters from meteor orbit databases

 - **Abstract**
 As of today, there is no official definition of a meteor cluster. It is usually identified as a large number of meteors sharing a similar radiant and velocity, all occurring within a few seconds. Only eight clusters have been reported so far, from single-camera or camera network observations. We aim to provide an overview of meteor clusters to help define what constitutes a cluster by potentially adding more to the already identified ones and determining their common parameters. A search for new clusters is performed in publicly available International Astronomical Union meteor databases with the DBSCAN algorithm. Then, a statistical significance method is applied to derive the most promising cluster candidates. However, the method still lacks a way to debias the atmospheric area surveyed by the cameras due to a lack of publicly available data. A set of 16 statistically significant potential clusters is identified, involving 4 to 7 fragments. The 90th percentile includes a duration of 8 seconds, a velocity difference of 2.2 km/s, and a radiant spread of nearly 4 degrees. The velocity difference may arise from the method used for orbit computation. Meteor clusters might be more frequent than currently reported. However, we recommend that future meteor orbit databases also include a way to estimate the surveyed area by the cameras involved in the detection. This would strengthen the veracity of the 16 identified cluster candidates and ultimately allow scientists to fully debias the number of clusters, and hence derive the physical lifetime expectancy of meteoroids, which is often overlooked due to the focus on collisional lifetime estimates only. We also recommend that any future cluster observation report includes the expected number of random occurrences and consider the event to be real if this value is below 0.1.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic-ray physics in the GeV-to-TeV energy range has entered a precision era thanks to recent data from space-based experiments. However, the poor knowledge of nuclear reactions, in particular for the production of antimatter and secondary nuclei, limits the information that can be extracted from these data, such as source properties, transport in the Galaxy and indirect searches for particle dark matter. The Cross-Section for Cosmic Rays at CERN workshop series has addressed the challenges encountered in the interpretation of high-precision cosmic-ray data, with the goal of strengthening emergent synergies and taking advantage of the complementarity and know-how in different communities, from theoretical and experimental astroparticle physics to high-energy and nuclear physics. In this paper, we present the outcomes of the third edition of the workshop that took place in 2024. We present the current state of cosmic-ray experiments and their perspectives, and provide a detailed road map to close the most urgent gaps in cross-section data, in order to efficiently progress on many open physics cases, which are motivated in the paper. Finally, with the aim of being as exhaustive as possible, this report touches several other fields -- such as cosmogenic studies, space radiation protection and hadrontherapy -- where overlapping and specific new cross-section measurements, as well as nuclear code improvement and benchmarking efforts, are also needed. We also briefly highlight further synergies between astroparticle and high-energy physics on the question of cross-sections.

          Analyzing the Morphology of Late-phase Stellar Flares From G-, K-, and M-type Stars

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar flares occasionally present a $\textit{peak-bump}$ light curve morphology, consisting of an initial impulsive phase followed by a gradual late phase. Analyzing this specific morphology can uncover the underlying physics of stellar flare dynamics, particularly the plasma heating-evaporation-condensation process. While previous studies have mainly examined peak-bump occurrences on M-dwarfs, this report extends the investigation to G-, K-, and M-type stars. We utilize the flare catalog published by arXiv:2212.00993, encompassing 12,597 flares, detected by using $\textit{Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite}$ (TESS) observations. Our analysis identifies 10,142 flares with discernible classical and complex morphology, of which 197 ($\sim1.9\%$) exhibit the peak-bump feature. We delve into the statistical properties of these TESS late-phase flares, noting that both the amplitude and full-width-half-maximum (FWHM) duration of both the peaks and bumps show positive correlations across all source-star spectral types, following a power law with indices 0.69 $\pm$ 0.09 and 1.0 $\pm$ 0.15, respectively. Additionally, a negative correlation between flare amplitude and the effective temperature of their host stars is observed. Compared to the other flares in our sample, peak-bump flares tend to have larger and longer initial peak amplitudes and FWHM durations, and possess energies ranging from $10^{31}$ to $10^{36}$ erg.

 - **Abstract**
 Hybrid CMOS detectors (HCDs) have several excellent features as high-performance X-ray detectors, including rapid readout, deep-depletion silicon for high quantum efficiency, radiation hardness, and low power. Random telegraph noise (RTN) is a type of noise that can reduce the performance of HCDs and other CMOS sensors. After finding and quantifying RTN in the recently developed engineering grade Speedster-EXD550 HCDs, this form of noise has also been found in other X-ray HCDs. This paper aims to investigate its presence and characteristics in the relatively mature H2RG X-ray HCD and to compare it with that of the Speedster-EXD550. We use archival data taken with an H2RG X-ray HCD at two different temperatures to determine the percentage of pixels that are being impacted by RTN. We identify RTN in 0.42% of pixels when the detector is operated at 140 K, while we are only able to identify RTN in 0.060% of pixels when the detector is operated at 160 K. We characterize RTN in two Speedster-EXD550 detectors, identifying 5.1% of pixels with RTN in one detector and 7.1% in another, which is significantly more than the H2RG. These results verify the difference between two different HCDs and provide techniques that can be applied to future hybrid CMOS detectors.

 - **Abstract**
 The James Webb Space Telescope now enables the spectral study of ices with unprecedented sensitivity and angular resolution. Water ice plays a crucial role in the growth of grains and in planetary formation but its spatial distribution in protoplanetary disks is poorly constrained. To help the interpretation of future observations, we study here for the first time how the water ice band depends on the observer's perspective and the location where spectra are measured within protoplanetary disks. Based on a standard protoplanetary disk model around a T Tauri star, we used the radiative transfer code MCFOST to extract water-ice spectra and to measure the depth and central wavelength of the water-ice band at different locations in the disk. Even in the context of a spatially homogeneous ice mixture, the observed properties of water-ice bands depend on the inclination of the system as well as on the location in the disk from which the spectra are extracted. In particular, the wavelength of the band minimum can change by up to 0.17 {\mu}m comparable to the difference expected between amorphous and crystalline ices, for instance. This phenomenon stems from a balance between absorption and scattering and must be taken into account in detailed modeling of spatially-resolved infrared spectroscopy of ices, including CO and CO2.

 - **Abstract**
 Next-generation telescopes will bring groundbreaking discoveries but they will also present new technological challenges. The Square Kilometre Array Observatory (SKAO) will be one of the most demanding scientific infrastructures, with a projected data output of 700 PB per year to be distributed to a network of SKA Regional Centres. Current tools are not fully suited to manage such massive data volumes, therefore, new research is required to transform science archives from data providers into service providers. In this paper we examine how a science archive can deliver advanced visualisation capabilities for the SKA science archive. In particular, we have conducted a thorough exploration of existing visualisation software for astronomy and other fields to identify tools capable of addressing Big Data requirements. Using selected technologies, we have developed a prototype archive that provides access to interactive visualisations of 3D radio data through web-based interfaces, adhering to International Virtual Observatory Alliance (IVOA) recommendations to favour interoperability and Open Science practices. In addition, we discuss how current IVOA recommendations support these visualisation capabilities and how they could be expanded. Our prototype archive includes a service to generate 3D models on the fly as a server operation, enabling remote visualisations in a flexible manner; for instance, a set of parameters can be used to customise the models and their visualisation. We have used SKA precursor and pathfinder data to test its usability and scalability, concluding that remote visualisation is a viable solution for handling high-volume data. However, our prototype is constrained by memory limitations, requiring techniques to reduce memory usage.

          Gamma-Ray Burst Jets in Circumstellar Material: Dynamics, Breakout, and Diversity of Transients

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations indicate that stripped-envelope core-collapse supernovae are often surrounded by dense circumstellar material (CSM). Motivated by this, we develop an analytic model to systematically study the dynamics of long gamma-ray burst (LGRB) jet propagation in various CSM environments. We derive a general formula for the jet head velocity ($\beta_{\rm h}$) and breakout time ($t_{\rm b}$) valid across Newtonian, relativistic, and intermediate regimes, accounting for a previously unrecognized dependence on $1 - \beta_{\rm h}$. Our results highlight a fundamental distinction between jet propagation in massive stars, where $\beta_{\rm h}\ll 1$, and in extended CSM, where $1-\beta_{\rm h}\ll 1$. We establish an analytic success/failure criterion for jets and express it in terms of jet and CSM parameters, revealing a strong dependence on CSM radius. To quantify the relativistic nature of the jet-cocoon system, we introduce the energy-weighted proper velocity $\overline{\Gamma\beta}$. We identify three possible jet outcomes-(a) successful jets ($\overline{\Gamma\beta} \sim 10-100$), (b) barely failed jets ($\overline{\Gamma\beta} \sim 1$), and (c) completely failed jets ($\overline{\Gamma\beta} \sim 0.1$)-and constrain their respective jet/CSM parameter spaces. We show that in (b) and (c), large CSM radii can power luminous fast blue optical transients via cocoon cooling emission. This theoretical framework provides a basis for future observational and theoretical studies to elucidate the link between LGRBs, intermediate GRBs, low-luminosity LGRBs, and their environments.

 - **Abstract**
 The recent Einstein Probe (EP) event EP240414a exhibits several unusual observational features. Its prompt and afterglow emissions place it between long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) and low-luminosity GRBs (LLGRBs). The event is followed by a fast optical transient (AT~2024gsa), initially exhibiting a thermal-like spectrum but later evolving into an unusually red peak at $\sim 3-5$ days, which is difficult to explain with thermal emission. Using our generalized analytic framework for jet propagation in a circumstellar material (CSM; Hamidani et al. 2025), we explore a scenario in which a conventional LGRB jet is launched in a progenitor surrounded by a dense CSM. For a CSM of $\sim 0.03 M_\odot$ extending to $\sim 3\times 10^{13}$ cm, we find that the jet is significantly weakened before breaking out, becoming ``barely failed'', an intermediate state between successful (LGRB) and completely failed (LLGRB) jets. This scenario naturally explains EP240414a's multi-wavelength observations, with the early thermal component produced by cocoon cooling emission, and the red peak explained by non-thermal afterglow emission from the mildly relativistic barely failed jet (and its inner cocoon). Our work demonstrates the important role of extended CSM in shaping GRB jets and illustrates how early multi-wavelength follow-up observations can reveal the physically diverse nature of jet-driven transients.

 - **Abstract**
 The detection of exceptionally high-energy {\gamma}-photons (up to 18 TeV) from GRB 221009A by the LHAASO Collaboration challenges conventional physics. Photon-axion-like particle (ALP) oscillations have been proposed to explain this anomaly, but they rely on specific parameter tuning. We present an alternative explanation involving superluminal dark photons. Building on the frameworks of Markoulakis and Valamontes, we propose that dark photons facilitated faster-than-light (FTL) propagation of information, allowing {\gamma}-photons to bypass extragalactic background light (EBL) attenuation. This hypothesis aligns with cosmological observations and experimental results, including those from the LHC, providing a robust framework for addressing the GRB 221009A anomaly.

 - **Abstract**
 We perform a comprehensive thermodynamic analysis of three sign-switching dark energy models in a flat FLRW cosmology: graduated dark energy (gDE), sign-switching cosmological constant ($\Lambda_s$), and smoothed sign-switching cosmological constant ($\Lambda_t$). We systematically derive key cosmological thermodynamic quantities -- horizon temperature, horizon entropy, internal entropy, total entropy, and their first and second derivatives -- using the Generalised Second Law (GSL) as the fundamental evaluation criterion. We first confirm the compliance of the $\Lambda$CDM model with the GSL, establishing a baseline for comparison. We find that despite their unconventional negative-to-positive energy density transitions, both $\Lambda_s$ and $\Lambda_t$ remain thermodynamically consistent. In contrast, gDE exhibits significant issues: divergences in its equation-of-state lead to infinite horizon temperature and entropy derivatives; and asymptotically, the horizon temperature diverges while entropy approaches zero, causing entropy reduction and violating the GSL. We highlight a key insight: models with divergences in the product of the dark energy equation-of-state parameter and its energy density ($w_x \Omega_x$) inevitably produce thermodynamic inconsistencies in standard cosmology. This thermodynamic approach provides a complementary criterion alongside observational constraints for evaluating the physical viability of cosmological models.

 The gravitational wave signature from core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) is dominated by quadrupolar oscillation modes of the newly born proto-neutron star (PNS), and could be detectable at galactic distances. We have developed a framework for computing the normal oscillation modes of a PNS in general relativity, including, for the first time, the presence of an accretion flow and a surrounding stalled accretion shock. These new ingredients are key to understand PNS oscillation modes, in particular those related to the standing-accretion-shock instability (SASI). Their incorporation is an important step towards accurate PNS asteroseismology. For this purpose, we perform linear and adiabatic perturbations of a spherically symmetric background, in the relativistic Cowling approximation, and cast the resulting equations as an eigenvalue problem. We discretize the eigenvalue problem using collocation Chebyshev spectral methods, which is then solved by means of standard and efficient linear algebra methods. We impose boundary conditions at the accretion shock compatible with the Rankine-Hugoniot conditions. We present several numerical examples to assess the accuracy and convergence of the numerical code, as well as to understand the effect of an accretion flow on the oscillation modes, as a stepping stone towards a complete analysis of the CCSNe case.

 - **Abstract**
 Chondrules are small spherical objects that formed at high temperatures early in the history of the Solar System. The key compositional characteristics of chondrules may be well explained by high gas pressures in their formation environment (Galy et al. 2000; Alexander et al. 2008). However, such high gas pressures are widely considered astrophysically unreasonable (Ebel et al. 2023). Here, we propose that chondrules were formed via the processing of dust grains in the dust-rich envelopes of planetary embryos, before getting ejected via convective diffusion. We show that this scenario can explain many salient constraints on chondrule formation, including formation locations; mass and timescale of chondrule production; repeat chondrule heating events; heating timescales; and, most crucially, high prevailing gas pressures. Our work suggests that high gas pressures may indeed have prevailed during the formation of chondrules, reconciling previous analytical observations, experimental evidence, and theory. We suggest that chondrules are mostly the products rather than the precursors of planetary embryo formation - a result which would have important implications for our understanding of the early history of the Solar System.

 - **Abstract**
 In the current paper, we present a study of the spatial distribution of luminous blue variables (LBVs) and various LBV candidates (cLBVs) with respect to OB associations in the M33 galaxy. The identification of blue star groups was based on the LGGS data and was carried out by two clustering algorithms with initial parameters determined during simulations of random stellar fields. We have found that the distribution of distances to the nearest OB association obtained for the LBV/cLBV sample is close to that for massive stars with $M_{\rm init}>20\,M_\odot$ and Wolf-Rayet stars. This result is in good agreement with the standard assumption that luminous blue variables represent an intermediate stage in the evolution of the most massive stars. However, some objects from the LBV/cLBV sample, particularly Fe$\,$II-emission stars, demonstrated severe isolation compared to other massive stars, which, together with certain features of their spectra, implicitly indicates that the nature of these objects and other LBVs/cLBVs may differ radically.

 - **Abstract**
 We show that a simple coupling between dark energy and dark matter can simultaneously address two distinct hints at new physics coming from cosmological observations. The first is the recent evidence from the DESI project and supernovae observations that the dark energy equation of state~$w$ is evolving over cosmic time from an earlier value that is~$<-1$ to a present-day value~$>-1$. The second observation is the so-called~$S_8$ tension, describing the suppression of the growth of matter overdensities compared to that expected in the~$\Lambda$CDM model. We propose a stable, technically natural particle physics implementation of this idea, in which dark matter consists of dark baryons in a strongly-coupled hidden sector, and the dark energy field is the associated dark axion. The time-variation of the dark matter mass results in an effective dark energy equation of state that exhibits a phantom crossing behavior consistent with recent results. It also results in a slight delay in matter-radiation equality, which suppresses the overall growth of density perturbations.

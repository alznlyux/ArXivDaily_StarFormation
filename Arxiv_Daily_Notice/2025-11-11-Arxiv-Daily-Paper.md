#### Title:
          The essential elements of dust evolution: a-C(:H) nanoparticle sub-structures and photo-fragmentation
 - **Authors:** A.P. Jones, N. Ysard
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA)
- **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04750](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04750)

- **Abstract**
 Hydrogenated amorphous carbon materials, a-C(:H), are heterogeneous structures consisting of carbon atoms in different hybridisation states and bonding configurations and are thought to constitute a significant and observationally important fraction of the interstellar dust material. This work aims to characterise semi-conducting a-C(:H) nanoparticle structures and, in particular, their property-characterising aromatic domain size distribution and so predict how they will behave in intense UV radiation fields that can fragment them through dissociative and charge effects as a result of carbon-carbon bond-breaking. Using a statistical approach we determine the typical sizes of the aromatic domains, their size distribution, how they are network-bonded, and where they are to be found within the structure. We consider the effects of thermal excitation, photo-dissociation and charging of a-C(:H) nanoparticles, and the products of their fragmentation. The derived UV photon-induced fragmentation lifetimes for nanometre-sized a-C(:H) nanoparticles, with radii ~0.4-0.5nm radius and containing ~40-60 carbon atoms, are of the order of 10^6-10^7yr in the diffuse interstellar medium and likely 10^2-10^4 times shorter in photodissociation regions, depending on the local radiation field intensity. Grains larger than this are stable against photodissociation. In H{\footnotesize II} regions only a-C(:H) nanoparticles with radii greater than 0.7nm (> 150 carbon atoms) are likely to survive. The photon-driven fragmentation of sub-nanometre a-C(:H) particles was determined to be important in the diffuse interstellar medium and also in high excitation regions, such as photodissociation and HII regions. However, in these same regions Coulomb fragmentation is unlikely to be an important dust destruction process.

          Kinematic and extinction analysis of a potential spiral arm beyond the Galactic bar

- **Abstract**
 Determining the structure of the Milky Way is essential for understanding its morphology, dynamics, and evolution. However, studying its innermost regions is challenging due to high extinction and crowding. The detection of a double red clump (RC; core-helium-burning stars) feature at very low Galactic latitudes suggests the presence of a spiral arm beyond the Galactic bar, providing new insights into the Galaxy's structure along this complex line of sight. We evaluate this possibility by analysing the proper motion and extinction distributions of the detected RC features. We constructed proper motion and extinction difference maps to investigate the kinematic and reddening properties of the RC populations, and the kinematic differences were validated using N-body simulations of a Milky Way-like galaxy. We find that the two RC features are kinematically distinct, with a relative proper motion difference of $-0.16\pm0.02\, mas/yr$ in the component parallel to the Galactic plane. This difference can be explained by Galactic rotation if the two RCs lie at different distances, consistent with the simulations. The extinction towards the secondary RC is also $\sim0.05$ mag higher than that of the primary RC. Additionally, we estimate that the extinction difference between the RC features corresponds to only $\sim5\%$ of the total extinction from Earth to the first RC, suggesting little interstellar material between the farthest edge of the Galactic bar and the kinematically distinct structure traced by the secondary RC. Using $JK_s$ photometry, we derive $A_J/A_{K_s}=3.34\pm0.07$, consistent with previous results and showing no significant variation across fields or along the line of sight. The results support the secondary clump tracing a distant structure, possibly a spiral arm, although we cannot exclude that the population belongs to the disc.

- **Abstract**
 Many stars are components of triple-star systems, or of higher-order multiples. In such systems mass transfer is common, and when the transfer is dynamically unstable, a common envelope forms. As such, it is important to be able to compute the post-common-envelope orbital separations among the various stars comprising the system, and to determine whether the common envelope induces mergers and/or makes later mergers inevitable. In this paper we compute the results of common-envelope evolution for triples. We employ the SCATTER formalism, a new approach to the computation of post-common-envelope separations. This work has applications to gravitational mergers, Type Ia supernovae, and a broad range of highly energetic phenomena.

          Calcium Excess in Novae: Beyond Nuclear Physics Uncertainties

- **Abstract**
 We examine Ca abundances in classical novae from spectroscopic observations spanning 65 years and investigate whether they are systematically high compared to those predicted by nova models. For the first time, we perform Monte Carlo simulations assessing the impact of nuclear reaction rate uncertainties on abundances predicted by multi-zone nova models. While the Ca abundances in the models are sensitive to variations of rates of the reactions 37Ar(p,gamma)38K and 38K(p,gamma)39Ca, the nuclear physics uncertainties of these reactions cannot account for the discrepancy between the observed and predicted Ca abundances in novae. Furthermore, the overabundance of Ca has important implications for measuring 7Be in nova ejecta, as Ca lines are used to estimate 7Be abundances. If the Ca abundance is incorrectly determined, it could lead to inaccurate 7Be abundance estimates. Possible alternative explanations for the observed Ca overabundance are discussed.

- **Abstract**
 Open clusters have been extensively used as tracers of Galactic chemical evolution, as their constituent stars possess shared characteristics, including age, Galactocentric radius, metallicity, and chemical composition. By examining the trends of elemental abundances with metallicity, age, and Galactocentric radius, valuable insights can be gained into the distribution and nucleosynthetic origins of chemical elements across the Galactic disc. The infrared domain in particular facilitates the observation of some elemental abundances that can be challenging or impossible to discern in the optical, for example K and F. The objective of this study is to derive the stellar parameters and elemental abundances of up to 23 elements in 114 stars spanning 41 open clusters using high-resolution infrared spectroscopy. In addition, the present study aims to examine the chemical evolution of the Galactic disc. This is achieved by investigating radial abundance gradients, variations in abundance between clusters, and the dependence of chemical abundances on cluster age.

          Recovering Ion Distribution Functions: II. Gyrotropic Slepian Reconstruction of Solar Wind Electrostatic Analyzer Measurements

- **Abstract**
 Velocity distribution functions (VDF) are an essential observable for studying kinetic and wave-particle processes in solar wind plasmas. To experimentally distinguish modes of heating, acceleration, and turbulence in the solar wind, precise representations of particle phase space VDFs are needed. In the first paper of this series, we developed the Slepian Basis Reconstruction (SBR) method to approximate fully agyrotropic continuous distributions from discrete measurements of electrostatic analyzers (ESAs). The method enables accurate determination of plasma moments, preserves kinetic features, and prescribes smooth gradients in phase space. In this paper, we extend the SBR method by imposing gyrotropic symmetry (g-SBR). Incorporating this symmetry enables high-fidelity reconstruction of VDFs that are partially measured, as from an ESA with a limited field-of-view (FOV). We introduce three frameworks for g-SBR, the gyrotropic Slepian Basis Reconstruction: (A) 1D angular Slepian functions on a polar-cap, (B) 2D Slepian functions in a Cartesian plane, and (C) a hybrid method. We employ model distributions representing multiple anisotropic ion populations in the solar wind to benchmark these methods, and we show that the g-SBR method produces a reconstruction that preserves kinetic structures and plasma moments, even with a strongly limited FOV. For our choice of model distribution, g-SBR can recover $\geq90\%$ of the density when only $20\%$ is measured. We provide the package \texttt{gdf} for open-source use and contribution by the heliophysics community. This work establishes direct pathways to bridge particle observations with kinetic theory and simulations, facilitating the investigation of gyrotropic plasma heating phenomena across the heliosphere.

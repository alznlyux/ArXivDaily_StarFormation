 - **Abstract**
 The third Gaia Data Release has provided the astronomical community with astrometric data of more than 1.8 billion sources, and low resolution spectra for 220 million. Such a large amount of data is difficult to handle by means of visual inspection. In this work, we present a spectral analysis of the Gaia white dwarf population up to 500 pc from the Sun based on artificial intelligence algorithms to classify the sample into their main spectral types and subtypes. In order to classify the sample, which consists of 78 920 white dwarfs with available Gaia spectra, we have applied a Random Forest algorithm to the Gaia spectral coefficients. We used the Montreal White Dwarf Database of already labeled objects as our training sample. The classified sample is compared with other already published catalogs and with our own higher resolution Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC) spectra, enabling the construction of a golden sample of well-classified objects. The Random Forest spectral classification of the 500-pc white dwarf population achieves an excellent global accuracy of 0.91 and an F1-score of 0.88 for the DA versus non-DA classification. In addition, we obtain a very high accuracy of 0.76 and a global F1-score of 0.62 for the non-DA subtype classification. In particular, our classification shows an excellent recall for DAs, DBs and DCs and a very good precision for DQs, DZs and DOs. The use of machine learning techniques, particularly the Random Forest algorithm, has enabled us to spectrally classify 78,920 white dwarfs with reasonable accuracy. Having an estimate of the spectral type for the vast majority of white dwarfs up to 500 pc provides the possibility of making better estimates of cooling ages, star formation rates, and stellar evolution processes, among other fundamental aspects for the study of the white dwarf population.

 - **Abstract**
 Long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) are typically thought to result from the collapse of massive stars. Nonetheless, recent observations of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) 211211A and 230307A, coupled with the low-redshift excess of LGRB event rates relative to star formation rates, present significant challenges to the prevailing model. We reexamine the selection criteria for higher redshift complete GRB samples and identify 280 Swift GRBs with peak flux over $2.6 ph cm^{-2} s^{-1}$. Assuming all LGRBs with $z \geq 2$ originate from collapsars, we construct the GRB luminosity functions(LFs) in three scenarios: no evolution, luminosity evolution, and density evolution. Our results indicate that a strong redshift evolution in luminosity $\delta = 1.87^{+0.27}_{-0.31}$ or in density $\delta = 1.10^{+0.21}_{-0.20}$ is necessary. The luminosity/density evolution model predicts 72.67/57.28 collapsar GRBs at $z < 2$, which can account for 67.29%/ 53.04% of the observed LGRBs. This suggests that a substantial portion of LGRBs at $z< 2$ may not be collapsar GRBs, which would challenge the universality of empirical GRB relations and affect their reliability in cosmological applications.

 - **Abstract**
 Post-main-sequence binary mergers are a common evolutionary pathway for massive stars, but the effects of merging on the long-term structure and evolution of the resulting star are a matter of active debate. Furthermore, the way in which merger products are modeled in 1D is not uniform. We present the evolution of an 11 M$_\odot$ and 6.6 M$_\odot$ binary on an 11 day orbit, that merges while the primary is crossing the Hertzsprung gap. We construct the merger product either by rapidly accreting the secondary onto the surface of the primary or by injecting material from the secondary deeper into the primary via entropy sorting. We then evolve them to carbon ignition, comparing their interior structures at this stage. We find that all merger products experience an extended blue supergiant phase and have undermassive helium cores and low carbon mass fractions compared to single and stripped stars. However, the evolution of central density, temperature, and composition in the entropy-sorted model is distinct from those of the rapid-accretion models.

 - **Abstract**
 We study a new channel for binary system formation involving stars and stellar-mass primordial black holes (PBHs) embedded in dark matter (DM) minihalos. In this scenario, binaries form when a star passes through the DM minihalo surrounding a PBH and loses sufficient energy due to dynamical friction. The continued energy loss induced by this friction is expected to drive the resulting systems to merge rapidly. We estimate their merger rate and explore the implications for two observables: rapidly decaying X-ray binaries in the Milky Way and gravitational waves sourced by compact object mergers. We find that this mechanism naturally produces a population of O(1) currently observable short-lived X-ray binaries. It also leads to a non-negligible gravitational wave event rate of O(0.3) Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$, potentially involving high mass ratios and black holes in the lower or upper mass gap. This dynamical friction channel thus offers a plausible explanation for several unusual observations reported in recent years across both the X-ray and gravitational wave domains.

          The survivorship bias of protoplanetary disc populations

 - **Abstract**
 The evolution of protoplanetary discs has a substantial impact on theories of planet formation. To date, neither of the two main competing evolutionary models, namely the viscous-photoevaporative paradigm and the MHD winds model, has been ruled out by observations. Due to the high number of sources observed by large surveys, population synthesis is a powerful tool to distinguish the evolution mechanism in observations. We explore the evolution of the mass distribution of synthetic populations under the assumptions of turbulence-driven accretion and dispersal caused by internal photoevaporation. We find that the rapid removal of light discs often results in an apparent increase of the median mass of the survived disc population. This occurs both when the disc properties are independent of each other, and when typical correlations between these quantities and the stellar mass are assumed. Furthermore, as MHD wind-driven accretion rarely manifests the same feature, this serves as a signature of the viscous-photoevaporative evolution when dispersal proceeds from inside-out. Therefore, we propose the evolution of the median mass as a new method to distinguish this model in observed populations. This survivorship bias is not shown by the median accretion rate, which, instead, decreases with time. Moreover, we introduce a new criterion that estimates the disc lifetime as a function of initial conditions and an analytical relation to predict whether internal photoevaporation triggers an inside-out or an outside-in dispersal. We verify both analytical relations with numerical simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 Orbital Torus Imaging (OTI) is a dynamical inference method for determining the Milky Way's gravitational potential using stellar survey data. OTI uses gradients in stellar astrophysical quantities, such as element abundances, as functions of dynamical quantities, like orbital actions or energy, to estimate the Galactic mass distribution, assuming axisymmetry and steady-state of the system. While preliminary applications have shown promising outcomes, its sensitivity to disequilibrium effects is unknown. Here, we apply OTI to a benchmark Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE-2) cosmological hydrodynamic simulation, m12i, which enables a comparative analysis between known FIRE-2 vertical acceleration profiles and total surface mass densities to the analogous OTI-inferred results. We quantify OTI's accuracy within solar-analog volumes embedded in the simulated galactic disk. Despite a dynamically-evolving system, we find that OTI recovers the known vertical acceleration profiles within 3 sigma/1 sigma errors for 94%/75% of the volumes considered. We discuss the method's sensitivity to the local, instantaneous structure of the disk, reporting a loss in accuracy for volumes that have large (>1.5 kpc) scale heights and low total density at z=1.1 kpc. We present realistic OTI error bars from both MCMC sampling and bootstrapping the FIRE-2 simulated data, which provides a touchstone for interpreting results obtained from current and forthcoming surveys such as SDSS-V, Gaia, WEAVE, and 4MOST.

 - **Abstract**
 Venus, our neighboring planet, is an open-air laboratory that can be used to study why Earth and Venus evolved in such different ways. Noble gases in planetary atmospheres are tracers of their geophysical evolution, and measuring the elemental and isotopic composition of noble gases in the Venus atmosphere informs us about the origin and evolution of the entire planet. In this work we describe a new SmallSat mission concept, Venus ATMOSpheric - Sample Return (VATMOS-SR), that would return gas samples from the upper atmosphere of Venus to Earth for scientific analysis. To ensure it is possible to relate the composition of the sampled gases (acquired when the spacecraft is traveling >10 km/s) to the free stream atmospheric composition, large-scale numerical simulations are employed to model the flow into and through the sampling system. An emphasis is placed on quantifying noble gas elemental and isotopic fractionation that occurs during the sample acquisition and transfer process, to determine how measured isotopic ratios of noble gases in the sample would compare to the actual isotopic ratios in the Venusian atmosphere. We find that lighter noble gases are depleted after they are sampled compared to the freestream conditions, and heavier ones are enriched, due to the high pressure gradients present in the flowfield. Finally, we observe that, in general, the numerical parameters do not have a major impact on the observed fractionation. However, the freestream velocity and density have a major impact on fractionation and need to be precisely known to properly reconstruct the fractionation in the sampling system. We demonstrate that the sample fractionation can be predicted with numerical simulations, and believe that VATMOS-SR, which could be the first mission to bring back samples from another planet, could answer key scientific questions related to understanding the evolution of Venus.

 - **Abstract**
 We use new HST observations coupled with archival data spanning a total temporal baseline of 17 years to study the internal kinematics of the multiple populations in the globular cluster NGC 2808 from its center out to ~8 half-light radii (r_h). We detect different kinematical behaviors between the first- and second-generation populations. This is especially evident towards the external regions of the cluster, where second-generation stars are increasingly more radially anisotropic. Our results are in agreement with theoretical simulations that predict that second-generation stars, initially more concentrated in the inner regions, gradually diffuse outward and develop a stronger radially anisotropic velocity distribution with respect to the first-generation stars. We find the central regions of the cluster to exhibit a higher degree of energy equipartition than the outskirts; our analysis reveals similar levels of energy equipartition in the radial and tangential components of the motion within about 4 r_h, while outside 4 r_h the data suggest that the equipartition level of the radial component of the velocity dispersion is slightly higher than that of the tangential component. Finally, we measured the dispersion of the angular momentum L_z for the three main subpopulations along the main sequence, which provides further evidence of the differences in the velocity anisotropy of 1G and 2G stars and shows marginal evidence for the most extreme second-generation subpopulation being slightly more radially anisotropic than the other second-generation subpopulation.

          Peekaboo: Secular Resonances from Evolving Stellar Oblateness Impede Transit Detection

 - **Abstract**
 Secular resonances in exoplanet systems occur when two or more planets have commensurabilities in the precession rates of their orbital elements, causing an exchange of angular momentum between them. The stellar gravitational quadrupole moment, which evolves over time due to stellar spin-down over the first $\sim 100\,$Myr, causes these resonances to sweep through the parameter space (of masses and semimajor-axis ratios), affecting a wider variety of systems than when spin-down is neglected. The angular momentum exchange in these resonances typically aligns the outer planets' orbits together while misaligning the innermost planet from its companions. Here, we explore how resonance-induced (mis-)alignments between planets affect the transit outcome. We use the three-planet Kepler-619 system as a concrete case study that is relatively likely (approximately $1$:$1$ odds) to have undergone a sweeping resonance. Consequently, if the outer planets are initially misaligned, a sweeping-resonance-induced push toward alignment in the outer planets' orbits substantially increases the probability that they are observed transiting together. However, the resulting misalignment of the innermost planet from its outer companions, reduces the overall probability that Kepler-619 is observed as a multi-planet transiting system when considering any pair of planets or all three together. This implies that sweeping resonances (which may occur in $20\%$ of systems) have a deleterious effect on the transiting exoplanet sample, suppressing the detection of multi-planet transiting systems in favor of apparent single-planet systems.

 - **Abstract**
 Photometric data from TESS were analyzed to obtain the light curve, confirming that the orbital period (P = 11.307 $\pm$ 0.005 days) remains constant. A wavelet analysis was applied to detect temporal anomalies. The photometric effective temperature of HD 72968 was estimated through colorimetry, comparing it with main-sequence stars. UVES spectra were analyzed, Doppler-corrected, and normalized using Chebyshev functions. A theoretical spectral grid generated with SPECTRUM and ATLAS9 was fitted using the chi-squared method. A comparison with UVES-ESO spectra refined the temperature estimate of HD 72968. The analysis of the spectral energy distribution (SED) enabled the derivation of stellar parameters, validating the models employed. These results provide new insights into the atmosphere and variability of HD 72968 and motivate further spectral studies for improved stellar modeling.

          Population synthesis of hot subdwarf B stars with COMPAS: on the observed Galactic population

 - **Abstract**
 Hot subdwarf B stars (sdBs) are helium-burning stars with thin hydrogen-rich envelopes. Their most widely accepted formation channels involve binary evolution and progenitors near the tip of the red giant branch, thus studying these objects improves our knowledge of complicated astrophysical processes such as common envelope evolution and the helium flash. In this work, we compare the observed sdB population with a synthetic Galactic population generated through the binary population synthesis code COMPAS, which allows us to estimate the physical properties of the current-day Galactic sdB population. We show that our synthetic sdB population matches the general properties of the observations quite well in the Kiel diagram when either a normal or lognormal distribution is assumed for the assignment of hydrogen-rich envelope masses. We also find that the canonical mass assumption should only be confidently assumed for specific system configurations and that the estimated number of sdBs found within 500 pc of the Sun in our model is at least four times higher than the observational one. We recover the observational P-q relation for sdBs plus main-sequence companions, while a similar relation between sdBs and helium white dwarf companions is rather complicated. We conclude that a better understanding of hydrogen-rich envelopes is needed, as well as an observational characterization of the sdB plus main-sequence companions earlier than spectral type $~$F. These issues aside, atmospheric properties, companion types, period, and mass distributions are in good agreement with observational and theoretical studies available in the literature.

 - **Abstract**
 Radio continuum galaxy surveys can provide a relatively fast map of the projected distribution of structure in the Universe, at the cost of lacking information about the radial distribution. We can use these surveys to learn about the growth of structure and the fundamental physics of the Universe, but doing so requires extra information to be provided in the modelling of the redshift distribution, $dN/dz$. In this work, we show how the cross-correlation of the two dimensional radio continuum map with another galaxy map (in this case a photometric optical extragalactic survey), with a known redshift distribution, can be used to determine the redshift distribution through statistical inference. We use data from the Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU) Pilot Survey 1 and cross-correlate it with optical data from the Dark Energy Survey to fit the parameters of our $dN/dz$ model. We show that the recovered distribution fits the data much better than current simulated $dN/dz$ models available in the literature, and peaks at a much higher redshift. These results will have significance for future cosmological analyses with large-scale radio continuum surveys such as the full EMU, or with the SKAO.

          Optical QPOs with dual periodicities 1103days and 243days in the blue quasar SDSS J100438.8+151056

 - **Abstract**
 This manuscript investigates the possible existence of a binary supermassive black holes (BSMBH) system in the blue quasar SDSS J100438.8+151056 (=SDSS J1004+1510) at z=0.219 based on the detection of robust optical QPOs. We determine QPOs using multiple analysis methods applied to the CSS-V, ZTFg/r band light curves, and additionally, combined with the characteristics of broad emission lines and explores potential mechanisms for the QPOs, including jet and disk precession models. Two distinct periodicities, $1103\pm260$days and $243\pm29$days, are identified in the ZTF g/r-band light curves with confidence level exceeding $5\sigma$, through four different techniques. Meanwhile, the $1103\pm260$days periodicity is also clearly detected in the CSS V-band light curve. The optical periodicities suggest a BSMBH system candidate in SDSS J1004+1510, with an estimated total virial BH mass of $(1.13\pm0.14)\times10^8 M_{\odot}$ and a space separation of $0.0053\pm0.0016$pc for the periodicity of $1103\pm260$days. The second periodicity of $243\pm29$days could be attributed to harmonic oscillations, considering $(1103\pm260)/(243\pm29)\sim4.54\pm0.47$ with large scatters. However, if the periodicity of $243\pm29$days was from an independent QPO, a triple BH system candidate on sub-pc scale could be probably expected, with space separations of $0.00036\pm0.00004$pc between a close BSMBH system and of $0.0053\pm0.0016$pc between the BSMBH system and the third BH, after considering similar BH mass of the third BH as the total mass of the central BSMBH. These findings strongly demonstrate that combined light curves from the different sky survey projects can lead to more reliable QPOs candidates to be detected, and also indicate higher quality light curves could be helpful to find probably potential QPOs with multiple periodicities leading to rare detections of candidates for sub-pc triple BH systems.

          A Study of the Spectral Properties of Gamma-Ray Bursts with the Main and Second Bursts

 - **Abstract**
 The origins of the main burst and second burst of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and the composition of their jets remain uncertain. To explore this complex subject more thoroughly, we conduct a spectral analysis on 18 GRBs with a main and a second burst observed by Fermi/GBM. First, we employ Bayesian time-resolved spectral analysis to compare the spectral components of the main and the second burst, finding that $83.3\%$ of the main and second bursts contain a thermal component. $67\%$ of the GRBs, the thermal component gradually decreased from the main to the second burst and the number of spectra exceeding the "Synchrotron line-of-death" is significantly higher in the main burst than in the second burst. Subsequently, we ascertain that for both the main and second bursts, $71.4\%$ of the low-energy spectral index $\alpha$ and $77.8\%$ of the peak energy $E_{p}$ evolve in a similar fashion. There are $50.0\%$ and $72.2\%$ of the GRBs exhibit comparable correlations for the $Flux-\alpha$ and $\alpha-E_{p}$, respectively. For $Flux-E_{p}$ both the main and second burst show a positive correlation. Moreover, from the perspective of the temporal evolution of characteristic radii, the transition from the main to the second burst appeared to be seamless. Finally, we find that both the main and the second burst follow the same Amati relation and Yonetoku relation. Our analysis strongly indicates that the second burst is a continuation of the main burst and is highly likely to share a common physical origin.

          Metal-Enriched Atmospheres in Warm (Super- and Sub-)Neptunes Induced by Extreme Atmospheric Escape

 - **Abstract**
 Planet formation impacts exoplanet atmospheres by accreting metals in solid form, leading to atmospheric C/O and S/N ratios that deviate from their host stars. Recent observations indicate differing metal abundances in planetary atmospheres compared to their stellar companions (e.g., Alderson et al. 2022; Bean et al. 2023). However, these observations are biased toward mature planets, raising questions about whether these abundances result from formation or evolved over time. Another way to alter an atmosphere is through the qescape of particles due to thermal heating. This study examines how billions of years of particle escape affect metal abundances. Using an adjusted stellar evolution code incorporating hydrodynamic escape, we model a warm ($T_{\mathrm{eq}} \approx 1000$ K) super-Neptune-type planet ($M_{\mathrm{ini}} = 26$ $M_{\oplus}$) orbiting a solar-type star. Our results show increased metal-to-hydrogen abundances of $\sim$50-70x initial enrichment after 10 Gyr. We also see a 0.88x decrease in C/O abundance and a 1.27x increase in S/N abundance, which can affect the interpretation of planet formation parameters. We also simulate the evolving atmosphere using chemical kinetics and radiative transfer codes, finding substantial increases in SO$_2$, CO$_2$, and H$_2$O abundances and a decrease in CH$_4$ abundance. These changes are easily observable in the IR waveband transmission spectrum. Our findings demonstrate that extreme escape of lighter particles significantly influences the evolution of warm Neptunes and complicates the interpretation of their observational data. This highlights the need to consider long-term atmospheric evolution in understanding exoplanet compositions.

 - **Abstract**
 Some transition disks host misaligned inner disks with radii of several au. Understanding the geometric and physical properties of these misaligned disks is essential for advancing terrestrial planet formation models. This study introduces a novel method to infer the three-dimensional structures of both inner and outer disks by analyzing non-axisymmetric shadows and the horizon in optical and infrared scattered light images of the outer disk. This method was applied to the HD 100453 system, in which infrared scattered light images from the Very Large Telescope revealed disk shadows. These results indicate that the inner disk is misaligned by $\sim$70$^{\circ}$ relative to the outer disk, which is consistent with the results of previous studies. The aspect ratio of the inner disk surface was estimated to be 0.17, which may reflect the surface height of the optically thick dusty component due to vertical lofting by MHD winds or turbulence. In addition, the surface height distribution of the outer disk was characterized, providing novel insights into its vertical structure.

 - **Abstract**
 Most young stars and therefore planetary systems form in high-mass star forming regions and are exposed to ultraviolet radiation, affecting the protoplanetary disk. These regions are located at large distances and only now with JWST become accessible to study the inner disks surrounding young stars. We present the eXtreme UV Environments (XUE) program, which provides the first detailed characterization of the physical and chemical properties of the inner disks around young intermediate-mass stars exposed to external irradiation from nearby massive stars. We present high signal to noise MIRI-MRS spectroscopy of 12 disks located in three sub-clusters of the high-mass star-forming region NGC 6357. Based on their mid-infrared spectral energy distribution, we classify the XUE sources into Group I and II based on the Meeus scheme. We analyze their molecular emission features, and compare their spectral indices and 10 $\mu$m silicate emission profiles to those of nearby Herbig and intermediate T Tauri disks. Despite being more massive, the XUE stars host disks with molecular richness comparable to isolated T Tauri systems. The 10 $\mu$m silicate features show lower F$_{11.3}$/F$_{9.8}$ ratios at a given F$_{\mathrm{peak}}$, but current uncertainties prevent conclusions about their inner disk properties. Most disks display water emission from the inner disk, suggesting that even in these extreme environments rocky planets can form in the presence of water. The absence of strong line fluxes and other irradiation signatures suggests that the XUE disks have been truncated by external UV photons. However, this truncation does not appear to significantly impact the chemical richness of their inner regions. These findings indicate that even in extreme environments, IMTT disks can retain the ingredients necessary for rocky planet formation.

 Dark Stars, i.e. early stars composed almost entirely of hydrogen and helium but powered by Dark Matter, could form in zero metallicity clouds located close to the center of high redshift Dark Matter halos. In 2023 three of us identified (in a PNAS work) the first three photometric Dark Star candidates: JADES-GS-z11-0, JADES-GS-z12-0, and JADES-GS-z13-0. We report here our results of a followup analysis based on available NIRSpec JWST data. We find that JADES-GS-z11-0 and JADES-GS-z-13-0 are spectroscopically consistent with a Dark Star interpretation. Moreover, we find two additional spectroscopic Dark Star candidates: JADES-GS-z14-0 and JADES-GS-z-14-1, with the former being the most distant luminous object ever observed. We furthermore identify a feature in its spectrum indicative of the smoking gun signature of Dark Stars: the He II$\lambda$1640 absorption line. In view ALMA's recent identification of a probable OIII nebular emission line in the spectrum of JADES-GS-z14-0, the simple interpretation of this object as an isolated Dark Star is unlikely. If both spectral features survive follow-up observations it would imply a Dark Star embedded in a metal rich environment, requiring theoretical refinements of the formation of evolution of Dark Stars, which in previous studies were assumed to form in isolation, without any companions.

 - **Abstract**
 Previous studies suggest that the Galactic diffuse X-ray emission is composed of unresolved point sources, primarily mCVs. However, nearby mCVs have a much lower 6.7 keV line equivalent width ($\rm EW_{6.7}$) compared to the diffuse X-ray emission. Therefore, the primary contributors to the unresolved X-ray emission remain unclear. We detected a total of 859 sources in the 6.5-7 keV band using XMM-Newton observations of the inner Galactic disc, of which 72 sources show significant iron line emission at 6.7 keV. The distribution of spectral index $\Gamma$ for these 72 sources is bimodal, with peaks at $\Gamma=0.5\pm0.4$ and $1.8\pm0.3$, suggesting two populations of sources. The soft X-ray sources have significantly larger $\rm EW_{6.7}$ than the hard X-ray sources. Furthermore, 18 of the 32 hard sources are associated with previously known CVs. We identify CV candidates in our sample as those with spectral index $\Gamma<1.25$. The line ratio, 2-10 keV luminosity, and previous detection of spin period suggest that most of these hard sources are mCVs. The distribution of the $\rm EW_{6.7}$ line for the combined sample of previously identified and candidate CVs has a mean value of <$\rm EW_{6.7}$>$=415\pm39$ eV. Furthermore, we computed the stacked spectra of all sources detected in the 6.5-7 keV band for different flux groups, and we find evidence in the stacked spectra of hard sources that the $\rm EW_{6.7}$ increases with decreasing flux. The soft X-ray sources have <$\rm EW_{6.7}$>$=1.1\pm0.1$ keV. We identified 13 of the 30 soft sources associated with active stars, young stellar objects, and active binaries of RS CVn type. The <$\rm EW_{6.7}$> of our CV candidate sample is more than twice as large as the typical $\rm EW_{6.7}$ found in mCVs within 500 pc, and the <$\rm EW_{6.7}$> of our CV candidate sample is close to the $\rm EW_{6.7}$ value of Galactic diffuse X-ray emission.

 - **Abstract**
 The dwarf spheroidal galaxy, Segue 1, is thought to have one of the largest ratios of dark matter to stellar mass. Using orbit-based dynamical models, we model Segue 1, including a dark halo and a central black hole. The best-fit model requires a black hole mass of $4 \pm 1.5 \times 10^5\ M_\odot$. The value of the black hole mass is the same with or without a dark halo. The mass-to-light ratio of the stars is poorly constrained by the dynamical modeling, reflecting that Segue 1 is dominated by mass other than stars. Dynamical models that exclude a black hole provide a worse fit and require a dark halo with very small scale radii of around 100 parsecs. Additionally, the zero black hole models require a stellar orbital distribution that is highly radially biased. The model with a black hole provides an orbital structure that is close to isotropic, more similar to other well-studied systems. We argue that the two-parameter models of stars and black hole provide a better description of Segue 1 than the three-parameter models of stars and two dark halo components. Additional support for a central black hole comes from a significant increase in the central rotation. Using individual velocities, we measure a rotation amplitude of $9.0 \pm 2.4\ \mathrm{km\ s^{-1}}$. Segue 1 is likely being tidally stripped at large radii, and we might be witnessing the remnant nucleus of a more massive system. Alternatively, given the high black hole mass relative to the stellar mass, Segue 1 is analogous to Little Red Dots seen in the early Universe.

 - **Abstract**
 Spectroscopic observations of the quasar J0950+5128 spanning 22 years show that its broad H$\beta$ emission line displays monotonic radial velocity variations consistent with those expected from a supermassive binary. At the same time, the profile of the broad H$\beta$ line is changing, necessitating careful measurements. We present robust measurements of the broad H$\beta$ velocity shifts. We fit the spectra with a multi-component parametric model to isolate the broad H$\beta$ by removing the stellar and non-stellar continua, the Fe ii line blends, and various narrow and broad emission lines in its vicinity. We measure the H$\beta$ velocity shifts via cross-correlation, both before and after decomposing the spectra, and we demonstrate that they can be reliably measured in spite of variations in the line profiles. We incorporate radial velocity "jitter" into the radial velocity curve to emulate typical quasar variability, and fit the curve with a Keplerian orbit model. The fit yields a period of 33 years and an eccentricity of 0.65, with lower limits on the semi-major axis and black hole mass of $10^{-2}$ pc and $10^7\ M_\odot$, respectively. Thus, this quasar is a compelling supermassive binary candidate. Continued monitoring is essential to further evaluate its credentials.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first application of the Machine Learning (ML) pipeline $\texttt{cecilia}$ to determine the physical parameters and photospheric composition of five metal-polluted He-atmosphere white dwarfs without well-characterised elemental abundances. To achieve this, we perform a joint and iterative Bayesian fit to their $\textit{SDSS}$ (R=2,000) and $\textit{Keck/ESI}$ (R=4,500) optical spectra, covering the wavelength range from about 3,800Å to 9,000Å. Our analysis measures the abundances of at least two $-$and up to six$-$ chemical elements in their atmospheres with a predictive accuracy similar to that of conventional WD analysis techniques ($\approx$0.20 dex). The white dwarfs with the largest number of detected heavy elements are SDSS J0859$+$5732 and SDSS J2311$-$0041, which simultaneously exhibit O, Mg, Si, Ca, and Fe in their $\textit{Keck/ESI}$ spectra. For all systems, we find that the bulk composition of their pollutants is largely consistent with those of primitive CI chondrites to within 1-2$\sigma$. We also find evidence of statistically significant ($>2\sigma$) oxygen excesses for SDSS J0859$+$5732 and SDSS J2311$-$0041, which could point to the accretion of oxygen-rich exoplanetary material. In the future, as wide-field astronomical surveys deliver millions of public WD spectra to the scientific community, $\texttt{cecilia}$ aspires to unlock population-wide studies of polluted WDs, therefore helping to improve our statistical knowledge of extrasolar compositions.

 - **Abstract**
 Lucky image (LI) is a technique to achieve near diffraction-limit high-angular resolution images for meter-class optical telescopes. In this work, by observing the core of globular cluster M15, we demonstrated the LI technique can be applied to a 1-meter telescope, the Lulin One-meter Telescope (LOT), together with a commercial-grade CMOS camera. We have also developed a method to sort the quality of the LI frames by measuring the mean intensity per pixel on the selected reference stars. For a LI-reconstructed image based on the best 10\%-selected frames, we achieved a $1.7\times$ improvement on the full-width at half-maximum over the conventional long-exposure image. When cross-matched the detected sources on the LI-reconstructed image to the Gaia Data Release 3 catalog, we obtained a mean difference of $-0.04\pm0.09$" and $-0.02\pm0.09$" on the right ascension and declination, respectively, as well as reaching to a $5\sigma$ depth of $\sim 17.9$ mag in the Gaia $G$-band.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a benchmark problem to assess the treatment of shock-induced nuclear burning in the context of double detonation Type Ia supernovae. In a stratified white dwarf model, we implement a shock-detection criterion that suppresses burning in zones characterized by compression and significant pressure gradients, controlled by a tunable parameter, $f_{\rm shock}$. One-dimensional simulations, using the open-source Castro suite, were conducted across three treatments - burning fully enabled, and burning suppressed with $f_{\rm shock} = 2/3$ and $f_{\rm shock} = 1$ - across three spatial resolutions (5.0, 2.5, and 0.3125 km). At the finest resolution, the burning-enabled and $f_{\rm shock} = 1$ models converge, while the $f_{\rm shock} = 2/3$ front continues to show slight offset behavior. Since most simulations are carried out at much lower resolutions, our tests support the idea that burning in shocks should always be disabled in practice. We also observe that the behavior of lower-resolution simulations remains extremely sensitive to the choice of $f_{\rm shock}$.

          A third star in the HAT-P-7 system, and a new dynamical pathway to misaligned hot Jupiters

 - **Abstract**
 The retrograde orbit of the hot Jupiter HAT-P-7b is suggestive of high-eccentricity migration caused by dynamical interactions with a massive companion. However, the only other known body in the system is an M dwarf located $\sim$10$^3$~AU away, too distant to cause high-eccentricity migration without fine tuning. Here we present transit-timing and radial-velocity evidence for an additional stellar companion with semi-major axis $32^{+16}_{-11}$~AU, eccentricity $0.76^{+0.12}_{-0.26}$, and minimum mass $0.19^{+0.11}_{-0.06}$~$\rm M_\odot$. We investigate several dynamical routes by which this nearby companion star could have played a role in converting a cold Jupiter into the retrograde hot Jupiter that is observed today. Of particular interest is a novel "eccentricity cascade" mechanism involving both of the companion stars: the outer companion periodically excites the eccentricity of the inner companion through von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai (ZLK) cycles, and this eccentricity excitation is slowly transferred to the cold Jupiter via successive close encounters, eventually triggering its high-eccentricity migration. The plausibility of this mechanism in explaining HAT-P-7b shows that stellar companions traditionally considered too distant to cause hot Jupiter formation might nevertheless be responsible, with the aid of closer-orbiting massive companions. With these developments, HAT-P-7b is one of the few hot Jupiters for which a complete high-eccentricity migration history can be simulated based only on observed bodies, rather than invoking bodies that are beneath detection limits or that are no longer in the system.
#### Title:
          Origin of the asymmetric gas distribution near the co-orbital Lagrange points of an embedded planet

 - **Abstract**
 Hydrodynamic simulations of planet-disk interactions often show material accumulation near the co-orbital Lagrange points $L_4$ and $L_5$ -- features that may correspond to observed crescents in protoplanetary disks. Intriguingly, these simulations also show an asymmetrical distribution of gas between $L_4$ and $L_5$, whose physical origin is not yet understood and could allow to further constrain the inner workings of planet-disk interactions. We performed 2D hydrodynamic simulations of a single, non-migrating planet embedded in a gaseous disk to investigate this effect. We find that the asymmetry is solely controlled by the sign of the radial temperature gradient with positive gradients enhancing the accumulation at $L_4$ and negative ones enhancing $L_5$. A symmetric distribution is recovered on globally isothermal disks. Furthermore, we find that the azimuthal locations of $L_4$ and $L_5$ deviate from the classical circular restricted three-body problem, following a monotonic trend with the disk pressure scale height $h_{\rm p}$: $\phi_{\text{max}}\approx\pm60^{\circ}[1+0.18(h_{\rm p}^3M_\star/m_{\rm p})^{2/3}]$. Our simulations show that the longest-lived and largest-amplitude structures are produced by planets opening gaps with depths $\Sigma_{\rm gap}/\Sigma_0\lesssim 0.2$. We successfully reproduce the observed asymmetry using a semi-analytical model that incorporates the azimuthally asymmetric radial velocity background induced by the planet. Overall, our results suggest that asymmetries in the form of crescents and clumps inside of density gaps opened by planets can constrain the local thermodynamic properties of protoplanetary disks.

 - **Abstract**
 Timing analysis of accreting systems is key to probe the structure and dynamics around compact objects. In Black-Hole Low-Mass X-ray Binaries (BH LMXBs), the compact object accretes matter from a low-mass companion star via Roche Lobe overflow, forming an accretion disk, and occasionally exhibiting bright eruptions. The BH LMXB Swift J1727.8-1613 (hereafter J1727), recently underwent one of the brightest outbursts ever recorded in X-rays, in August 2023. This analysis aims to study the timing properties of J1727, in the decaying phase of its outburst, using high-time resolution XMM-Newton data. We analyzed J1727's power spectrum (PS) and cross spectrum (CS), which we modeled with Lorentzians. The PS reveals how the source's power is distributed across frequencies, and the Real and Imaginary parts of the CS compare the displacement of the light curves in different energy bands across the observations. Finally, we simultaneously derived the phase lags and the coherence, using a constant phase lag model. While the first (soft-state) observation does not show any strong variability, the two harder observations exhibit quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs). Because the QPO is more significantly detected in the Imaginary part of the CS than in the PS, we refer to it as the 'Imaginary QPO'. The QPO is more prominent in the soft 0.3-2 keV band than in the hard 2-12 keV band. As the source evolves towards the hard state, the Imaginary QPO shifts to lower frequencies, the broadband fractional rms amplitude in the 0.3-2 keV energy band increases, while the rms covariance of the Imaginary QPO decreases. Simultaneously, the phase lags increase and the coherence function drops at the Imaginary QPO frequency. In the elusive soft-to-hard transition of J1727, the first XMM-Newton observations of the source reveal an Imaginary QPO also detected in the PS, exhibiting the properties of a type-C QPO.

 - **Abstract**
 Precision cosmology benefits from extracting maximal information from cosmic structures, motivating the use of higher-order statistics (HOS) at small spatial scales. However, predicting how baryonic processes modify matter statistics at these scales has been challenging. The baryonic correction model (BCM) addresses this by modifying dark-matter-only simulations to mimic baryonic effects, providing a flexible, simulation-based framework for predicting both two-point and HOS. We show that a 3-parameter version of the BCM can jointly fit weak lensing maps' two-point statistics, wavelet phase harmonics coefficients, scattering coefficients, and the third and fourth moments to within 2% accuracy across all scales $\ell < 2000$ and tomographic bins for a DES-Y3-like redshift distribution ($z \lesssim 2$), using the FLAMINGO simulations. These results demonstrate the viability of BCM-assisted, simulation-based weak lensing inference of two-point and HOS, paving the way for robust cosmological constraints that fully exploit non-Gaussian information on small spatial scales.

          Establishing a Connection Between the Jet and the Corona in Black Hole Low Mass X-Ray Binaries

 - **Abstract**
 Low-mass black hole X-ray Binaries (LMXBs) undergo outbursts, during which their brightness increases greatly for timescales of months. The X-ray accretion and radio jet properties change dramatically throughout an outburst in a broadly consistent way between sources. Changes to the accretion flow and the corona are evident through X-ray spectral variations, while the jet's evolution produces changes in the radio. Typically, high energy emission from the corona initially dominate the X-ray spectrum, and quasi-steady compact jets are observed in the radio. As the outburst progresses, emission from the corona fades and is superseded by lower energy X-ray accretion disk emission. During this transition, the compact jets are quenched and discrete ejecta, called transient jets, are launched. The concurrence of the corona's weakening and the jet's transition from compact to transient implies a connection, but the precise relationship has not been established. Motivated by this, we aim to investigate the corona-jet connection. We perform spectral modeling in the hard and soft X-ray, utilizing $NuSTAR$, $NICER$, and $Swift$/XRT observations to track the evolving X-ray corona for three LMXBs: MAXI J1348-630, MAXI J1535-571 and MAXI J1820+070. We use prior work to mark the presence of compact jets and the dates of discrete jet ejections. We find a clear connection between the evolution of the corona and the jet: across all three sources an increase in the distance of the corona from the black hole occurs near the time that the compact jet is quenched and the transient jet is launched.

          NuSTAR Detection of an Absorption Feature in ESP 39607: Evidence for an Ultra-fast Inflow?

 - **Abstract**
 We report the serendipitous discovery of an absorption feature at 4.8 keV in the NuSTAR spectra of ESP 39607, a Seyfert 2 galaxy at $z = 0.201$, observed in May 2023 and August 2024. The feature is detected in both observations with individual significance levels between 2 and 3$\sigma$, computed with multiple statistical methods. The combined probability of detecting it in both observations is $\gtrsim$4$\sigma$. The absorption feature is consistent with an ultra-fast inflow (UFI) potentially associated with Fe XXV or Fe XXVI K$\alpha$ transitions. The inferred inflow velocity is $\sim$0.15-0.20$c$, with an estimated launching radius of 22-89 $R_g$, depending on the assumed iron transition and whether radiation pressure is accounted for. Photoionization modeling associates the UFI primarily with Fe XXV K$\alpha$ absorption, blended with a minor contribution from Fe XXVI K$\alpha$. Alternative explanations, including associations with the warm-hot intergalactic medium or outflows of lighter elements, were investigated but found unlikely. If confirmed, this detection represents a rare example of a UFI, providing valuable evidence into extreme and/or non-standard accretion processes near supermassive black holes. Follow-up observations with higher-resolution X-ray spectroscopy, such as with XMM-Newton or XRISM, will be essential to confirm the nature of this feature and better constrain the physical mechanisms driving it.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a systematic study of the multi-phase interstellar gas in the Inner Galaxy using HST/STIS absorption spectroscopy of 16 massive stars located at spectroscopic distances between 1.3 and 10 kpc in the region $-30^\circ\lesssim l \lesssim+30^\circ$ and $-15^\circ\lesssim b \lesssim+15^\circ$. These sight lines probe gas above and below the Sagittarius Carina, Scutum Crux-Centaurus, Norma, and Near 3 kpc spiral arms in a range of $z$-height from 0 to 1.5 kpc. Along the 16 sight lines, we measure velocity centroids for 800 UV absorption-line components across multiple gas phases (molecular CO, neutral, low ion, and high ion). We find that 619/800 components have velocities that are consistent with a simple model of co-rotation with the disk, indicating that multi-phase gas with disk-like kinematics extends at least 1 kpc into the halo. We present a database of absorption-line parameters that can be used for kinematic modeling of gas flows into and out of the Galactic disk.

 - **Abstract**
 The one-dimensional power spectrum $P_{\mathrm{1D}}$ of Ly$\alpha$ forest offers rich insights into cosmological and astrophysical parameters, including constraints on the sum of neutrino masses, warm dark matter models, and the thermal state of the intergalactic medium. We present the measurement of $P_{\mathrm{1D}}$ using the optimal quadratic maximum likelihood estimator applied to over 300,000 Ly$\alpha$ quasars from Data Release 1 (DR1) of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey. This sample represents the largest to date for $P_{\mathrm{1D}}$ measurements and is larger than the Extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) by a factor of 1.7. We conduct a meticulous investigation of instrumental and analysis systematics and quantify their impact on $P_{\mathrm{1D}}$. This includes the development of a cross-exposure estimator that eliminates the need to model the pipeline noise and has strong potential for future $P_{\mathrm{1D}}$ measurements. We also present new insights into metal contamination through the 1D correlation function. Using a fitting function we measure the evolution of the Ly$\alpha$ forest bias with high precision: $b_F(z) = (-0.218\pm0.002)\times((1 + z) / 4)^{2.96\pm0.06}$. In a companion validation paper, we substantially extend our previous suite of CCD image simulations to quantify the pipeline's exquisite performance accurately. In another companion paper, we present DR1 $P_{\mathrm{1D}}$ measurements using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) approach to power spectrum estimation. These two measurements are consistent with each other and constitute the most precise $P_{\mathrm{1D}}$ measurement to date, while being in good agreement with results from the DESI early data release.

 - **Abstract**
 One of the most striking structures in the solar atmosphere are prominences, predominantly coronal structures, with thermodynamic conditions that vary from chromospheric internally to the corona that surrounds them. These structures play an important role in the energy transfer between all layers of the atmosphere. Although mostly studied as a fully ionised plasma, prominences are, in fact, composed of partially ionised plasma. We do not yet fully understand the extent to which the two-fluid plasma-neutral properties play a role in the evolution of these coronal structures. In this work, we explore for the very first time how prominence formation and growth in a coronal loop evolves in a two-fluid setting. We used MPI-AMRVAC to study the evaporation-condensation process, where we consider radiative cooling, thermal conduction, and localised heating in a coronal loop in a fully stratified atmosphere. We report on the differences the two-fluid plasma brings into the prominence evolution, and more specifically in the period after the dynamic formation process finishes. Furthermore, we highlight the role it plays during the linear and the non-linear phases of the evolution. We find pronounced two-fluid effects in shocks that appear with the first complete condensation and confirm decoupling effects in the PCTR on the order of 100$\,$m$\,$s$^{-1}$, consistent with observations.

 - **Abstract**
 The embedded phase is a crucial period in the development of a young star. Mid-IR observations, now possible with JWST with unprecedented sensitivity, spectral resolution and sharpness are key for probing many physical and chemical processes on sub-arcsecond scales. JOYS addresses a wide variety of questions, from protostellar accretion and the nature of primeval jets, winds and outflows, to the chemistry of gas and ice, and the characteristics of embedded disks. We introduce the program and show representative results. MIRI-MRS data of 17 low-mass and 6 high-mass protostars show a wide variety of features. Atomic line maps differ among refractory (e.g., Fe), semi-refractory (e.g., S) and volatile elements (e.g., Ne), linked to their different levels of depletion and local (shock) conditions. Nested, stratified jet structures consisting of an inner ionized core seen in [Fe II] with an outer H2 layer are commonly seen. Wide-angle winds are found in low-J H2 lines. [S I] follows the jet in the youngest protostars, but is concentrated on source when more evolved. [Ne II] reveals a mix of jet shock and photoionized emission. H I lines measure accretion, but are also associated with jets. Molecular emission (CO2, C2H2, HCN, H2O, ..) is cool compared with disks, and likely associated with hot cores. Deep ice absorption features reveal not just the major ice components but also ions (as part of salts) and complex organic molecules, with comparable abundances from low- to high-mass sources. A second detection of HDO ice in a solar-mass source is presented with HDO/H2O ~ 0.4%, providing a link with disks and comets. A deep search for solid O2 suggests it is not a significant oxygen reservoir. Only few embedded Class I disks show the same forest of water lines as Class II disks do, perhaps due to significant dust extinction of the upper layers [abridged].

 - **Abstract**
 The precision of stellar models is higher than the precision at which we are able to measure the masses of most stars, with the notable exception of binaries where we can determine dynamical masses of the component stars. In addition to well-measured stellar properties, the ideal benchmark star is far enough from its companion that its properties are indistinguishable from an otherwise identical single star. Currently, there are a handful of stars with precise ($\pm$3 %), model-independent mass measurements that are "effectively single" and for which we can obtain clean spectra (i.e. spectra that are not blended with a close companion). In this paper, we introduce GJ 105 AC as the newest members of this exclusive population. We present an updated orbital analysis for the long-period K3+M7 binary GJ 105 AC. We jointly analyze radial velocity (RV) and relative astrometry data, including new RVs from the Miniature Exoplanet Radial Velocity Array (MINERVA) that capture the full periapsis passage and the RV minimum of the $76.0 \pm 1.3$ yr orbit for the first time. We derive precise dynamical masses of $M_1 = 0.78 \pm 0.02\, \mathrm{M}_\odot$ and $M_2 = 0.098 \pm 0.002\, \mathrm{M}_\odot$. We find that of all stars with similarly precise masses (~2%), GJ 105 AC stands out as having the widest on-sky separation after $\alpha$ Centauri AB, making it one of the most easily accessible to spectroscopy, as well as the the second-widest true separation, ensuring that its members are truly "effectively single" in terms of their evolution.

          Impact of ACT DR6 and DESI DR2 for Early Dark Energy and the Hubble tension

 - **Abstract**
 The data release six of the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT DR6) and the second data release from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI DR2) recently became available. In light of these data, we update constraints on the Early Dark Energy (EDE) resolution to the Hubble tension. While ACT DR6 does not favor EDE over the core cosmological model $\Lambda$CDM, it allows for a significantly larger maximum contribution of EDE, $f_{\rm EDE}$, in the pre-recombination era than the latest analysis of {\it Planck} NPIPE despite increased precision at small angular scales. Moreover, EDE rises the value of $H_0r_s$, improving consistency between CMB and DESI DR2 data. We find a residual tension with SH0ES of $\sim 2 \sigma$ for the combination of {\it Planck} at $\ell <1000$ + ACT DR6 + lensing + Pantheon-plus + DESI DR2, a significant decrease from $3.7 \sigma$ for analyses that use NPIPE and SDSS BAO data. A profile likelihood analysis reveals significant prior-volume effects in Bayesian analyses which do not include SH$0$ES, with confidence intervals of $f_{\rm EDE}=0.09\pm 0.03$ and $H_0= 71.0\pm1.1$ km/s/Mpc. When including DESI data, the EDE model with $H_0=73$ km/s/Mpc provides a better fit than the $\Lambda$CDM model with $H_0=68.4$ km/s/Mpc. The inclusion of SH$0$ES data rises the preference well above $5\sigma$, with $\Delta\chi^2=-35.4$. Our work demonstrates that after ACT DR6 and DESI DR2, EDE remains a potential resolution to the Hubble tension.

 - **Abstract**
 We present high-resolution ALMA observations at 0.89 mm of the Class II brown dwarf 2MASS J04442713+2512164 (2M0444), achieving a spatial resolution of 0$.\!\!^{\prime\prime}$046 ($\sim$6.4 au at the distance to the source). These observations targeted continuum emission together with $^{12}$CO (3-2) molecular line. The line emission traces a Keplerian disk, allowing us to derive a dynamical mass between 0.043-0.092 M${_{\odot}}$ for the central object. We constrain the gas-to-dust disk size ratio to be $\sim$7, consistent with efficient radial drift. However, the observed dust emission suggest that a dust trap is present, enough to retain some dust particles. We perform visibility fitting of the continuum emission, and under the assumption of annular substructure, our best fit shows a gap and a ring at 98.1$^{+4.2}_{-8.4}$ mas ($\sim$14 au) and 116.0$^{+4.2}_{-4.8}$ mas ($\sim$16 au), respectively, with a gap width of 20 mas ($\sim$3 au). To ensure robustness, the data were analyzed through a variety of methods in both the image and uv plane, employing multiple codes and approaches. This tentative disk structure could be linked to a possible planetary companion in the process of formation. These results provide the first dynamical mass of the lowest mass object to date, together with the possible direct detection of a substructure, offering new insights into disk dynamics and planet formation in the very low-mass regime. Future higher spatial resolution ALMA observations will be essential to confirm these findings and further investigate the link between substructures and planet formation in brown dwarf disks.

 We study the internal wave propagation and transmission across the radiation-convection interface in a solar-type star by solving the linear perturbation equations of a self-gravitating and uniformly rotating polytropic fluid in spherical geometry with Coriolis force fully taken into account. Three structures are considered: convective zone, radiative zone, and a transitional layer at the interface. In a rotating convective zone, energy flux is predominantly carried by sound waves while kinetic energy by inertial waves, and rotation has a great effect on non-axisymmetric modes. In a radiative zone without rotation, energy flux is predominantly carried by sound waves or gravity waves while kinetic energy by gravity waves. In a layered structure, rotation enhances gravito-inertial waves transmission at the interface because the group velocity of inertial waves is almost along the rotational axis. This implies that we can detect the deep interior of rapidly rotating solar-type stars at the young age.

 Context. Open clusters (OCs) are important for understanding star formation, dynamics, and evolution. Previous studies have indicated a relationship between cluster structure and member star properties, but the formation mechanism of the layered structure of OCs remains unclear. Aims. We study the three-dimensional spatial distribution of 279 nearby OCs to understand the formation mechanism of the layered structure. Methods. We analyzed the spatial distribution of member stars within each OC and correlated the presence of a layered structure with the number of member stars. Additionally, we performd N-body simulations to model the evolution of OCSN 125. We assessd the correlation between the binary fraction, the most massive star, and the radius of the layered structure in each simulated OC. Results. Our analysis reveals that OCs with fewer member stars tend to lack a layered structure. The results from N-body simulations indicate that the presence of a layered structure is strongly influenced by dynamical factors, particularly the most massive star and the binary fraction. Massive stars drive mass loss through supernova explosions and stellar winds, which weaken the spatial layering. Furthermore, clusters with higher binary fractions exhibit a weaker layered structure, likely due to energy equipartition, dynamical friction, and perturbations caused by binary systems. These factors contribute to delaying core collapse and slowing the emergence of a layered structure. Conclusions. Our findings suggest that dynamical interactions, including the effects of the most massive stars and binary fraction, play a critical role in the formation and disruption of the layered structure in OCs.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations from the Juno spacecraft show that Jupiter has a large dilute core rather than a compact core. To investigate the effects of different core structures on wave propagation and transmission in Jupiter's interior, we consider three models: (1) an isentropic sphere, (2) an isentropic envelope with a rigid core, and (3) an isentropic envelope with a dilute core. We study the propagation and transmission of p modes (sound waves), g modes (gravity waves), r modes (inertial waves), and GIWs (gravito-inertial waves) by solving the linear equations of a compressible, self-gravitating, uniformly rotating polytropic model, fully taking into account the the effects of Coriolis force but neglecting centrifugal flattening. Our results show that energy flux is primarily carried by fast waves with higher frequencies whereas kinetic energy by slow waves with lower frequencies. Rotation has a greater effect on non-axisymmetric modes than on axisymmetric ones. In model 2, rigid core facilitates propagation of r modes. In model 3, rotation enhances the transmission of GIWs across the interface between the dilute core and the isentropic envelope, particularly at high latitudes. This suggests that Jupiter's internal structure may be inferred by detecting the oscillation signals in its polar regions.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of temporary Forbush decreases (FDs) in the Galactic cosmic ray (GCR) flux due to passage of solar storms are useful for space weather studies and alerts. Here we introduce techniques that use global networks of ground-based neutron monitors and muon detectors to measure variations of GCR rigidity spectra in space during FDs by: A) fitting count rate decreases for power-law rigidity spectra in space with anisotropy up to second order, and B) using the "leader fraction" derived from a single neutron monitor. We demonstrate that both provide consistent results for hourly spectral index variations for five major FDs and they agree with daily space-based data when available from AMS-02. We have also made the neutron monitor leader fraction publicly available in real time. This work verifies that ground-based observations can be used to precisely monitor GCR spectral variation over a wide range of rigidities during space weather events, with results in real time or from short-term post-analysis.

 - **Abstract**
 We study observational bounds in a class of scalar-tensor gravity theories recently proposed. Either an upper or lower bound on a conformal factor in these theories is derived from null observation in composition dependent fifth force search, microscope mission. The important case of a lower bound implies that future improved observations have chances of verifying this class of theories. Future prospect for a particular type of observation is mentioned. The considered class of scalar-tensor gravity was shown elsewhere to explain the conversion of inflationary early phase to late time quintessence type dark energy.

 - **Abstract**
 Radiative transfer is essential in astronomy, both for interpreting observations and simulating various astrophysical phenomena. However, self-consistent line radiative transfer is computationally expensive, especially in 3D. To reduce the computational cost when utilizing a discrete angular discretization, we use a comoving frame interpretation of the radiative transfer equation. The main innovation of this paper lies in the novel stabilization method for the resulting numerical discretization. The stabilization method is able to reduce spurious oscillatory behavior in the computed intensities, at the expense of extra boundary conditions which need to be enforced. We also implement an adaptive angular discretization for the ray-tracing implementation, in order to efficiently and accurately calculate the radiation field. Finally, we apply this new numerical method to compute NLTE line radiative transfer on a hydrodynamics model, showcasing its potential improvement in computation efficiency.

 - **Abstract**
 In recent years, a number of new instruments and data reduction pipelines have been developed to obtain high-precision radial velocities (RVs). In particular in the optical, considerable progress has been made and RV precision below 50 cm/s has been reached. Yet, the RV precision in the near-infrared (NIR) is trailing behind. This is due to a number of factors, such as imprinted atmospheric absorption lines, lower stellar information content, different types of detectors, and usable calibration lamps. However, observations in the NIR are important for the search and study of exoplanets around cool low-mass stars that are faint at optical wavelengths. Not only are M dwarfs brightest in the NIR, the signal of stellar activity is also reduced at longer wavelengths. In this paper we introduce the RV pipeline viper (Velocity and IP EstimatoR). The philosophy of viper is to offer a publicly available and user-friendly code that is able to process data from various spectrographs. Originally designed to handle data from optical instruments, the code now has been extended to enable the processing of NIR data. viper uses a least-square fitting to model the stellar RV as well as the temporal and spatial variable IP. We have improved upon this method by adding a term for the telluric spectrum that enables the forward modelling of molecules present in the Earth's atmosphere. In this paper we use CRIRES+ observations in the K band to demonstrate viper's ability to handle data in the NIR. We show that it is possible to achieve an RV accuracy of 3 m/s over a period of 2.5 years with the use of a gas cell. Additionally, we present a study of the stability of atmospheric lines in the NIR. With viper it is possible to handle data taken with or without a gas cell, and we show that a long-term RV precision of around 10 m/s can be achieved when using only telluric lines for the wavelength calibration.

 - **Abstract**
 Nulling interferometry is a powerful observing technique to study exoplanets and circumstellar dust at separations too small for direct imaging with single-dish telescopes. With recent photonics developments and the near-future ground-based instrumental projects, it bears the potential to detect young giant planets near the snow lines of their host stars. The observable quantity of a nulling interferometer is called the null depth, its precise measurement and calibration remain challenging against instrument and atmospheric noise. Null self-calibration is a method aiming to model the statistical distribution of the nulled signal. It has proven to be more sensitive and accurate than average-based data reduction methods in nulling interferometry. The variety of existing and upcoming of nullers raises the issue of consistency of the calibration process, structure of the data and the ability to reduce archived data on the long term. It has also led to many different implementations of the Null self-calibration method. In this article, we introduce GRIP: the first open-source toolbox to reduce nulling data with enhanced statistical self-calibration methods from any nulling interferometric instrument within a single and consistent framework. Astrophysical results show good consistency with two published GLINT and LBTI datasets and confirm nulling precision down to a few 10$^{-4}$.

 - **Abstract**
 The CHEOPS, the first ESA small-class mission, has been performing photometric astronomical observations with a particular emphasis on exoplanetary science for the past five years. A distinctive feature of CHEOPS is that the responsibility for all operational aspects of the mission lies with the consortium rather than ESA. As a result, all subsystems, their architecture, and operational processes have been independently developed and tailored specifically to CHEOPS. This paper offers an overview of the CHEOPS operational subsystems, the design, and the automation framework that compose the two main components of the CHEOPS ground segment: the MOC and the SOC. This comprehensive description of the CHEOPS workflow aims to serve as a reference and potential source of inspiration for future small and/or independent space missions.

 - **Abstract**
 We identify stellar tidal debris from the $\omega$ Centauri ($\omega$ Cen) system among field stars in the APOGEE survey via chemical tagging using a neural network trained on APOGEE observations of the $\omega$ Cen core. We find a total of 463 $\omega$ Cen debris candidates have a probability $P > 0.8$ of sharing common patterns in their chemical abundances across a range of individual elements or element combinations, including [C+N], O, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Ni, and Fe. Some debris candidates show prograde or retrograde disk-like kinematics, but most show kinematics consistent with the accreted halo, showing high radial actions, $J_{R}$, values. We find that a sample of Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GES) members are chemically distinct from the $\omega$ Cen core, suggesting that $\omega$ Cen is associated to an independent merger event shaping the Milky Way halo. However, a connection between GSE and $\omega$ Cen cannot be ruled out. A detailed comparison with $N$-body simulations indicates that the $\omega$ Cen progenitor was a massive dwarf galaxy ($\gtrsim 10^8 M_{\odot}$). The existence of a metal-poor high-$\alpha$ chemically homogeneous halo debris is also reported.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the discovery and localisation of a repeating fast radio burst (FRB) source from the MeerTRAP project, a commensal fast radio transient search programme using the MeerKAT telescope. FRB 20240619D was first discovered on 2024 June 19 with three bursts being detected within two minutes in the MeerKAT L-band (856 - 1712MHz). We conducted follow-up observations of FRB 20240619D with MeerKAT using the Ultra-High Frequency (UHF; 544 - 1088MHz), L-band and S-band (1968 - 2843MHz) receivers one week after its discovery, and recorded a total of 249 bursts. The MeerKAT-detected bursts exhibit band-limited emission with an average fractional bandwidth of 0.31, 0.34 and 0.48 in the UHF, L-band and S-band, respectively. We find our observations are complete down to a fluence limit of ~1Jy ms, above which the cumulative burst rate follows a power law $R (>F)\propto (F/1\,\text{Jy}\,\text{ms})^\gamma$ with $\gamma=-1.6\pm0.1$ and $-1.7\pm0.1$ in the UHF and L-band, respectively. The near-simultaneous L-band, UHF and S-band observations reveal a frequency dependent burst rate with $3\times$ more bursts being detected in the L-band than in the UHF and S-band, suggesting a spectral turnover in the burst energy distribution of FRB 20240619D. Our polarimetric analysis demonstrates that most of the bursts have $\sim100\%$ linear polarisation fractions and $\sim10\%\text{--}20\%$ circular polarisation fractions. We find no optical counterpart of FRB 20240619D in the MeerLICHT optical observations simultaneous to the radio observations and set a fluence upper limit in MeerLICHT's q-band of 0.76Jy ms and an optical-to-radio fluence ratio limit of 0.034 for a 15s exposure.

 - **Abstract**
 Globular clusters (GCs) are key to understanding the formation and evolution of our Galaxy. While the abundances of light and Fe-peak elements in GCs have been widely studied, investigations into heavier, neutron-capture elements -- and their connection to multiple stellar populations and GC origins -- remain limited. In this work, we analysed the chemical abundances of neutron-capture elements in GCs to trace the Galactic halo and to explore possible links to the MP phenomenon. Our goal is to better constrain the nature of the polluters responsible for intracluster enrichment and to distinguish the origin of GCs through the chemical signature of neutron-capture elements. We examined 14 GCs from the Gaia-ESO Survey, spanning a wide metallicity range, [Fe/H] from -0.40 to -2.32, using a homogeneous methodology. We focused on the abundances of Y, Zr, Ba, La, Ce, Nd, Pr, and Eu, derived from FLAMES-UVES spectra. These were compared with predictions from a stochastic Galactic chemical evolution model. With the exception of Zr, the model broadly reproduces the observed trends in neutron-capture elements. In some GCs, we found strong correlations between hot H-burning products (Na, Al) and s-process elements, pointing to a shared nucleosynthesis site, e.g., asymptotic giant branch stars of different masses and/or fast-rotating massive stars. We also detect a distinct difference in [Eu/Mg] ratio between in-situ ($\langle$[Eu/Mg]$\rangle$ = 0.14 dex) and ex-situ ($\langle$[Eu/Mg]$\langle$ = 0.32 dex) GCs, highlighting their different enrichment histories. Finally, on average, Type II GCs (NGC 362, NGC 1261, and NGC 1851) showed a s-process element spread ratio between second- and first-generations about twice as large as those seen in Type I clusters.

          Understanding molecular ratios in the carbon and oxygen poor outer Milky Way with interpretable machine learning

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The outer Milky Way has a lower metallicity than our solar neighbourhood, but still many molecules are detected in the region. Molecular line ratios can serve as probes to better understand the chemistry and physics in these regions. Aims. We use interpretable machine learning to study 9 different molecular ratios, helping us understand the forward connection between the physics of these environments and the carbon and oxygen chemistries. Methods. Using a large grid of astrochemical models generated using UCLCHEM, we study the properties of molecular clouds of low oxygen and carbon initial abundance. We first try to understand the line ratios using a classical analysis. We then move on to using interpretable machine learning, namely Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP), to understand the higher order dependencies of the ratios over the entire parameter grid. Lastly we use the Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection technique (UMAP) as a reduction method to create intuitive groupings of models. Results. We find that the parameter space is well covered by the line ratios, allowing us to investigate all input parameters. SHAP analysis shows that the temperature and density are the most important features, but the carbon and oxygen abundances are important in parts of the parameter space. Lastly, we find that we can group different types of ratios using UMAP. Conclusions. We show the chosen ratios are mostly sensitive to changes in the carbon initial abundance, together with the temperature and density. Especially the CN/HCN and HNC/HCN ratio are shown to be sensitive to the initial carbon abundance, making them excellent probes for this parameter. Out of the ratios, only CS/SO shows a sensitivity to the oxygen abundance.

 - **Abstract**
 The present-day phosphorus abundance in the solar neighbourhood is determined from a sample of OB-type stars. This is in order to constrain the endpoint of the galactochemical evolution of phosphorus in the course of stellar nucleosynthesis over cosmic time and to provide an abundance baseline for the study of the depletion of phosphorus onto dust grains in the interstellar medium. A model atom for P II/III/IV based on a comprehensive new set of ab initio data for line transitions, photoionisations and electron-impact excitation was developed. Non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) line formation calculations with the codes DETAIL and SURFACE were conducted, based on LTE line-blanketed hydrostatic model atmospheres computed with the ATLAS12 code. High-resolution optical spectra for a sample of 42 apparently slowly rotating main-sequence OB-type stars and B-type supergiants in the solar vicinity within ~500 pc and beyond, out to a distance of ~2 kpc, were analysed. The non-LTE effects on the formation of the P II/III/IV lines are discussed. Non-LTE effects on the stellar abundances range from zero to ~0.3 dex. Where available in the spectra, ionisation balance between two phosphorus ionic species is achieved. Accurate and precise abundances are provided for the sample stars, statistical and systematic 1 sigma uncertainties are typically each well below 0.1 dex. The present-day cosmic phosphorus abundance in the solar neighbourhood is constrained to log(P/H)+12 = 5.36 +- 0.14, which is compatible with the solar photospheric abundance, but lower than derived by LTE analyses of neutral phosphorus lines in solar-type stars. The amount of phosphorus depleted onto dust grains is ~0.25 dex.

 - **Abstract**
 We make the first calculation of the spectral distortion constraints on the primordial curvature power spectrum in the limit of large cubic non-Gaussianity. This calculation involves computing a 2-loop integral, which we perform analytically. Despite being non-perturbatively non-Gaussian, we show that the constraints only change significantly from the case of Gaussian perturbations in the high-k tail, where spectral distortions become weak. We conclude that generating primordial supermassive black holes requires even more extreme forms of non-Gaussianity. We also argue why the mu-distortion constraint is unlikely to significantly change even in the presence of more extreme local non-Gaussianity.

 - **Abstract**
 L-BASS is an instrument designed to produce an absolutely calibrated map of the sky at a wavelength of 21 cm (L-band) with a radiometric accuracy of less than or equal to 0.1 K and with an angular resolution of 23 degrees. The prime motivations are to improve the temperature calibration of higher resolution maps and to investigate the steep spectrum radio background proposed by the ARCADE 2 team. The instrument consists of a pair of conical horn antennas which can scan independently in elevation; each antenna produces a circularly polarized output. The difference in signals from the antennas is measured with a continuous-comparison receiver connected to a digital spectrometer sampling the signal from 1400 MHz to 1425 MHz within the protected radio astronomy band. We describe the astrophysical motivation for the project, the design requirements and how these will be attained.

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce a two-parameter phenomenological extension of the $\Lambda$CDM model in which the equation of state parameter of the ``dust'' fluid becomes different from zero for redshifts below a transition value $z_t$. Using data from DESI DR2 BAO, DESY5 Sn~Ia and CMB distance priors ($R,l_A,\omega_b$) data, we compare our model with the standard CPL parameterization $w_0-w_a$ for dynamical dark energy. Using the Deviance Information Criteria (DIC), we find that the two models are essentially indistinguishable ($\Delta$DIC $<$ 2) and preferred over $\Lambda$CDM with a significance $\geq 3 \sigma$. We discuss how this parameterization finds a natural interpretation in the context of cosmological backreaction and derive a prediction for the evolution of the growth factor, discussing its impact on low redshift $f\sigma_8$ measurements.

 - **Abstract**
 IRAS 15398-3359, a Class 0 protostar in Lupus I star forming region, is associated with three generations of outflows. The primary outflow, i.e., the most recent one, shows internal structure named ``shell structure'' in the near infrared emission map. The shell structure is also seen in the emission lines of CO, H$_2$CO, and others species. We find a similar structure in an underexpanded jet produced in aerodynamics and other engineering applications. A high pressure gas ejected through a nozzle expands to form a supersonic flow. When the pressure of the ejected gas becomes lower than that of the ambient gas, the jet is compressed to form a shock wave. The shock heated gas expands again to form substructures along the jet. We examine the similarity between the primary outflow of IRAS 15398-3359 and industrial underexpanded jet and the possibility that the shell structure of the former is due to repeated expansion and compression in the direction perpendicular to the jet propagation.

 - **Abstract**
 The detection and characterisation of other "Earths", orbiting other suns, is a bold objective of present-day astrophysics. However, this quest is severely challenged by astrophysical "noise" from the host stars, whose signatures distort the observed spectra. Motivated by this problem, we are building a dedicated facility, the Paranal solar ESPRESSO Telescope (PoET). PoET will collect solar light and channel it into the ESPRESSO spectrograph, allowing us to use the Sun as a proxy to unambiguously identify and understand the sources of relevant variability in solar-type stars.

          Cracking the relation between mass and 1P-star fraction of globular clusters: III. Initial distributions of in-situ and ex-situ clusters

 - **Abstract**
 Galactic globular clusters consist of two main stellar populations, the pristine (1P) and polluted (2P) stars. The fraction of 1P stars in clusters, $F_{1P}$, is a decreasing function of the cluster present-day mass, $m_{prst}$. The information about cluster formation it contains has yet to be unlocked. Paper I demonstrated that the observed distribution $(m_{prst},F_{1P})$ of Galactic globular clusters can result from a pristine-star fraction that is inversely proportional to their birth mass, $m_{ecl}$. This relation was then calibrated with a fixed stellar mass threshold for 2P-star formation, $m_{th}$, i.e., $F_{1P}=m_{th}/m_{ecl}$. We now estimate the masses $m_{init}$ of Galactic globular clusters as they start their long-term gas-free evolution in the Galaxy and we map their behavior in the $(m_{init},F_{1P})$ space. Several dissolution time-scales are tested (with and without primordial mass segregation), each yielding its own initial cluster distribution $(m_{init},F_{1P})$. The $(m_{init},F_{1P})$ distributions are mapped according to cluster origin, with the emphasis on the Disk, Low-Energy and Gaia-Enceladus cluster groups of Massari et al. (2019). All three initial distributions $(m_{init},F_{1P})$ are more compact than their present-day counterparts since dynamical evolution scatters clusters in the $F_{1P}$ versus cluster-mass space. The Disk initial distribution is the tightest one and potential reasons for this are discussed. Its power-law representation allows us to generalize the initial mass threshold of Paper I and prompts us to represent the cluster $({\rm mass},F_{1P})$ distribution in a log-log space. No evidence is found suggesting that, initially, the pristine-star fraction of globular clusters depends on their metallicity on top of their mass.

 - **Abstract**
 Alfvénic waves are considered a key contributor to the energy flux that powers the Sun's corona, with theoretical models demonstrating their potential to explain coronal EUV and X-ray emission and the acceleration of the solar wind. However, confirming underlying assumptions of the models has proved challenging, especially obtaining evidence for the excitation and dissipation of Alfvénic waves in the lower solar atmosphere and tracing their propagation into the corona. We present an investigation of the Alfvénic wave power spectrum in the Sun's corona, obtained from observations with DKIST Cryo-NIRSP. The data provide unprecedented temporal resolution and signal-to-noise, revealing a detailed power spectrum out to frequencies exceeding 10 mHz. A broad enhancement in power dominates the spectrum and we demonstrate it is accurately reproduced using a physics-based model. The results corroborate the scenario where the corona is dominated by Alfvénic waves excited in the photosphere by horizontal convective motions, with low-frequency waves subject to reflection at the transition region and higher frequency waves significantly dissipated by the partially ionized chromosphere. The coronal Alfvénic power spectrum also indicates there are contributions from \textit{p}-modes (via mode conversion) and a yet-unknown higher-frequency source. These results provide key insight into how the Sun's convective motions imprint themselves on the corona and highlight the critical role of partial ionization, reflection, and damping in regulating upward-propagating Alfvénic waves. A further implication of this is that reconnection-driven Alfvénic waves likely play a smaller role in powering the corona and solar wind than has been suggested by recent studies.

 - **Abstract**
 Multi-color OGLE survey light curves of about 20 years duration are analyzed for about 3000 classical Be stars in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC, SMC) in order to study the properties and variability. Each light curve was manually analyzed to distinguish between different scenarios, such as photospheric baseline levels, and disk build-up and dissipation phases. This analysis was aided by dynamical disk models and photospheric models to coarsely determine inclination angle and mass. Measured quantities such as the fraction of time spent actively ejecting mass (the duty cycle), the fraction of time spent with a detectable disk (the disk duty cycle), the build-up and dissipation time of isolated disk events, and the number of mass outbursts per year allow us to characterize and compare the behavior of the two populations. There is a wide spread in the duty cycle, with median values of 0.44 (LMC) and 0.60 (SMC). The disk duty cycle is high for both populations, with median values of 0.99 (LMC) and 1.0 (SMC), indicating that disks are almost always present for these stars. The occurrence rate of outbursts ranges from zero to about two per year, with median values of 0.31 (LMC) and 0.26 (SMC). There are strong statistical differences in the behavior of the LMC and SMC populations, with the lower metallicity stars being more active in terms of their duty cycle and disk duty cycle, and with less frequent but longer lasting outbursts.

 - **Abstract**
 Five Venus missions are under development to study the planet in the next decade, with both NASA's VERITAS and ESA's EnVision featuring a geophysical investigation among their objectives. Their radar and gravity experiments will determine Venus's orientation, enabling spin dynamics analyses to infer geophysical and atmospheric properties. This work aims to characterize Venus's polar motion -- the motion of its spin axis in a body-fixed frame-focusing on signatures from its interior and atmosphere to support its potential detection by future orbiters. We develop a polar motion model for a triaxial planet accounting for solar torque, centrifugal and tidal deformations of a viscoelastic mantle, and atmospheric dynamics. Core-mantle coupling effects are analyzed separately considering a simplified spherical core. We compute the period and damping time of the free motion -- called the Chandler wobble -- and determine the frequencies and amplitudes of the forced motion. We revisit the Chandler frequency expression. Solar torque is the dominant phenomenon affecting Venus's Chandler frequency, increasing it by a factor of 2.75. Our model predicts a Chandler period in the range [12900 ; 18900] years. The Chandler wobble appears as a linear polar drift of about 90 meters on Venus's surface during EnVision's 4-year primary mission, at the limit of its resolution. We also predict forced polar motion oscillations with an amplitude of about 20 meters, driven by the atmosphere and the solar torque. Compared to the 240-meter spin axis precession occurring in inertial space over this duration, these results suggest that Venus's polar motion could also be detectable by future orbiters. It should be incorporated into rotation models when anticipating these missions, providing additional constraints on Venus's interior structure.

          Radio observations point to a moderately relativistic outflow in the fast X-ray transient EP241021a

 - **Abstract**
 Fast X-ray transients (FXRTs) are short-lived X-ray outbursts with diverse progenitor scenarios, including compact object mergers, stellar core-collapses and tidal disruption events. The Einstein Probe (EP) has enabled the rapid discovery and follow-up of dozens of FXRTs, revealing that while some of them overlap with traditional gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), a larger fraction of FXRTs have no associated gamma-ray counterpart down to deep limits. The origin of these gamma-ray dark FXRTs and their connection to the diverse landscape of stellar explosions remains an open question, which can be tackled through the study of their multi-wavelength counterparts and environment. In this paper, we present long-term radio observations of the gamma-ray dark EP241021a, which exhibits sustained radio emission for over 100 days, placing it among the longest-lived radio afterglows. We detect signature of interstellar scintillation in early epochs, allowing us to constrain the angular size and Lorentz factor of the emitting region. Our observations point to an outflow that is at least mildly relativistic with Lorentz factor > 4. Afterglow modeling favors a moderately relativistic and collimated outflow interacting with a low-density interstellar medium. The derived beaming-corrected kinetic energy and low radiative efficiency are consistent with a standard relativistic explosion which did not produce bright gamma-rays. Alternatively, a highly-relativistic structured jet remains consistent with our observations if seen substantially off-axis. In the latter case, the initial X-ray flare detected by EP would be caused by the slower ejecta from the lateral wings intercepting our line of sight rather than by traditional prompt-emission mechanisms within the jet core.

          Kination-like Era Driven by the Effective Inflaton/Higgs Potential

 - **Abstract**
 Based on the minimal $U(1)_X$ extended Standard Model, we explore cosmic inflation where the $U(1)_X$ Higgs field serves as the inflaton. We demonstrate that a stiff era with an equation of state $w > 1/3$ can emerge during the inflaton's oscillatory phase after inflation, driven by the Coleman-Weinberg potential of the inflaton, arising due to radiative corrections. This leads to significant modulation and enhancement of the irreducible stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background from inflation, deviating from the conventional scale-invariant spectrum. Such a distinct GW spectrum could be detectable by next-generation GW interferometer missions, such as U-DECIGO. In our framework, the GW spectrum depends on the $U(1)_X$ gauge coupling and the mass of the $U(1)_X$ gauge boson ($Z^\prime$). As a result, future GW observations and $Z^\prime$ boson resonance searches at high-energy collider experiments are complementary to one another.

 - **Abstract**
 In preparation for the first cosmological measurements from the full-shape of the Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) forest from DESI, we must carefully model all relevant systematics that might bias our analysis. It was shown in Youles et al. (2022) that random quasar redshift errors produce a smoothing effect on the mean quasar continuum in the Ly$\alpha$ forest region. This in turn gives rise to spurious features in the Ly$\alpha$ auto-correlation, and its cross-correlation with quasars. Using synthetic data sets based on the DESI survey, we confirm that the impact on BAO measurements is small, but that a bias is introduced to parameters which depend on the full-shape of our correlations. We combine a model of this contamination in the cross-correlation (Youles et al. 2022) with a new model we introduce here for the auto-correlation. These are parametrised by 3 parameters, which when included in a joint fit to both correlation functions, successfully eliminate any impact of redshift errors on our full-shape constraints. We also present a strategy for removing this contamination from real data, by removing $\sim$0.3% of correlating pairs.

#### Title:
          Natural experiments from Earth Hour reveal urban night sky being drastically lit up by few decorative buildings

 - **Abstract**
 Light pollution, a typically underrecognized environmental issue, has gained attention in recent years. While controlling light pollution requires sustained efforts, Earth Hour offers a unique natural experimental setting to assess temporary lights-out measures. Using photometric and spectroscopic sensors, we observed up to 50% night sky darkening during Earth Hour from 2011 to 2024 in Hong Kong, primarily as a result of a small but critical number of lights-out instances in central business districts, as evidenced by crowd-sourced photography records. Weekend lighting pattern in the city during Earth Hour remained unaffected. The emission reductions mostly occurred in the 445-500, 500-540, and 615-650 nm spectral ranges-corresponding to peak emissions from LED billboard screens- and in the 585-595 nm range, associated with metal halide floodlights used for facades and billboards. Our study identifies these sources as major contributors to urban light pollution. By combining multimodal observations, we offer a comprehensive assessment of light pollution sources and the potential benefits of sustainable lighting practices in urban environments. This research highlights the importance of targeted light pollution mitigation efforts and provides critical insights for policymakers to enhance urban sustainability and human well-being.

 - **Abstract**
 We present deep $K_s$-band imaging of the extreme T subdwarf CWISE J221706.28$-$145437.6. Using the new photometry, we construct its spectral energy distribution and find this object exhibits exceptionally strong collision-induced absorption in the $H$ and $K$ band. The comparison with the nearest benchmark extreme T subdwarf WISEA J181006.18$-$101000.5 suggests the object would be cooler and more metal-poor than the benchmark.

          Many-Body Simulations of the Fast Flavor Instability

 - **Abstract**
 The neutrino fast flavor instability dominates the evolution of neutrino flavor within the engines of core-collapse supernovae and neutron star mergers. However, theoretical models of neutrino flavor change that include many-body quantum correlations can differ starkly from similar mean-field calculations. We demonstrate for the first time that the inhomogeneous fast flavor instability is disrupted by many-body correlations using a novel tensor network framework that allows a continuous transition between mean-field and many-body results by tuning the singular value decomposition cutoff value. Generalizing the forward-scattering Hamiltonian to spatially varying conditions, we demonstrate that the timescale of flavor transformation scales logarithmically with system size, suggesting that many-body effects could outpace mean-field instabilities even for realistic neutrino numbers. Our results have significant implications for astrophysical explosion dynamics, nucleosynthesis, and observable neutrino signatures.

          Constraining compact dark matter with time-varying quasar equivalent widths

 - **Abstract**
 One of the possible explanations for dark matter is that of compact dark objects of baryonic origin, such as black holes or even planets. Accumulating evidence, including the discovery of merging stellar mass black holes through gravitational waves, point to a population of such objects making up at least some fraction of dark matter. We revisit a historically heavily used probe, quasar spectra, from the new perspective of time variability and gravitational lensing. From a sample of 777 quasars selected from archival data we identify 19 that show decisive evidence of lensing by compact objects with masses measured in the range $5\times 10^{-5} < M/\mathrm{M}_{\odot} < 2\times 10^{-2}$ with 99\% confidence. This is much lower than what is hoped to be detected by even the most futuristic gravitational wave detectors and analysis strategies, but is crucial for theories of compact dark matter, such as primordial black holes predicted from quantum phase transitions in the early Universe.
#### Title:
          The importance of the dynamical corotation torque for the migration of low-mass planets -- 1D analytical prescriptions verified by 2D hydrodynamical simulations

 - **Abstract**
 Recent developments suggested that planet formation occurs in regions of the discs with low turbulent viscosity. There, the dynamical corotation torque is thought to play an important role by slowing down type I migration. We aim to provide a simple analytical prescription for the dynamical corotation torque for use in 1D global models of planet formation and evolution, and assess the importance of the dynamical corotation torque for the migration of low-mass planets in low-viscosity discs. We propose simple prescriptions for calculating in 1D the time evolution of the vortensities of the librating and orbit-crossing flows around a low-mass planet, which both enter the analytical expression for the dynamical corotation torque. One of our prescriptions involves a memory timescale for the librating flow, and 2D hydrodynamical simulations of disc-planet interactions are used to assess the memory timescale and validate our model. The orbital evolution of a low-mass planet is calculated by 1D simulations where the dynamical corotation torque features our prescriptions for the vortensities of the librating and orbit-crossing flows, and by 2D hydrodynamical simulations of disc-planet interactions, assuming locally isothermal discs. We find very good agreement between the 1D and 2D simulations for a wide parameter space, whether the dynamical corotation torque slows down or accelerates inward migration. We provide maps showing how much the dynamical corotation torque reduces the classical type I migration torque as a function of planet mass and orbital distance. The reduction is about 50\% for a 10 Earth-mass planet at 10 au in a young disc with surface density profile in $r^{-1/2}$ and alpha viscosity of $10^{-4}$. In discs with low turbulent viscosity, the dynamical corotation torque should be taken into account in global models as it can strongly slow down type I migration.

          Do Pulsar Timing Datasets Favor Massive Gravity?

 - **Abstract**
 Several observational phenomena suggest that the standard model of cosmology and particle physics requires revision. To address this, we consider the extension of general relativity known as massive gravity (MG). In this Letter, we explore the imprints of MG on the propagation of gravitational waves (GWs): their modified dispersion relation and their additional (two vector and one scalar) polarization modes on the stochastic GW background (SGWB) detected by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs). We analyze the effects of massive GWs on the Hellings-Downs curve induced by modification of the overlap reduction function. Our study consists of analyzing observational data from the NANOGrav 15-year dataset and the Chinese PTA Data Release I, and is independent of the origin of the SGWB (astrophysical or cosmological). By considering the bound on the graviton mass imposed through the dispersion relation, we scrutinize the possibility of detecting traces of MG in the PTA observational data. We find that massive GWs predict better fits for the observed pulsar correlations. Future PTA missions with more precise data will hopefully be able to detect the GW additional polarization modes and might be effectively used to constrain the graviton mass.

          Impact of rotation on synthetic mass-radius relationships of two-layer rocky planets and water worlds

 - **Abstract**
 We have analyzed the effects of rotation on mass-radius relationships for single-layer and two-layer planets having a core and an envelope made of pure materials among iron, perovskite and water in solid phase. The numerical surveys use the DROP code updated with a modified polytropic equation-of-state (EOS) and investigate flattening parameters $f$ up to $0.2$. In the mass range $0.1 M_\oplus < M < 10 M_\oplus$, we find that rotation systematically shifts the curves of composition towards larger radii and/or smaller masses. Relative to the spherical case, the equatorial radius $R_{eq}$ is increased by about $0.36f$ for single-layer planets, and by $0.30f$ to $0.55f$ for two-layer planets (depending on the core size fraction $q$ and planet mass $M$). Rotation is an additional source of confusion in deriving planetary structures, as the radius alterations are of the same order as i) current observational uncertainties for super-Earths, and ii) EOS variations. We have established a multivariate fit of the form $R_{eq}(M,f,q)$, which enables a fast characterization of the core size and rotational state of rocky planets and ocean worlds. We discuss how the observational data must be shifted in the diagrams to self-consistently account for an eventual planet spin, depending on the geometry of the transit (circular/oblate). A simple application to the recently characterized super-Earth candidate LHS1140b is discussed.

          Exoplanet Atmospheric Refraction Effects in the Kepler Sample

 - **Abstract**
 We present an analysis on the detection viability of refraction effects in Kepler's exoplanet atmospheres using binning techniques for their light curves in order to compare against simulated refraction effects. We split the Kepler exoplanets into sub-populations according to orbital period and planetary radius, then search for out-of-transit changes in the relative flux associated with atmospheric refraction of starlight. The presence of refraction effects - or lack thereof - may be used to measure and set limits on the bulk properties of an atmosphere, including mean molecular weight or the presence of hazes. In this work, we use the presence of refraction effects to test whether exoplanets above the period-radius valley have H/He atmospheres, which high levels of stellar radiation could evaporate away, in turn leaving rocky cores below the valley. We find strong observational evidence of refraction effects for exoplanets above the period-radius valley based on Kepler photometry, however those related to optically thin H/He atmospheres are not common in the observed planetary population. This result may be attributed to signal dampening caused by clouds and hazes, consistent with the optically thick and intrinsically hotter atmospheres of Kepler exoplanets caused by relatively close host star proximity.

          The 3D Cosmic Shoreline for Nurturing Planetary Atmospheres

 - **Abstract**
 Various ``cosmic shorelines" have been proposed to delineate which planets have atmospheres. The fates of individual planet atmospheres may be set by a complex sea of growth and loss processes, driven by unmeasurable environmental factors or unknown historical events. Yet, defining population-level boundaries helps illuminate which processes matter and identify high-priority targets for future atmospheric searches. Here, we provide a statistical framework for inferring the position, shape, and fuzziness of an instellation-based cosmic shoreline, defined in the three-dimensional space of planet escape velocity, planet bolometric flux received, and host star luminosity; explicitly including luminosity partially circumvents the need to estimate host stars' historical X-ray and extreme ultraviolet fluences. Using Solar System and exoplanet atmospheric constraints, under the restrictive assumption that one planar boundary applies across a wide parameter space, we find the critical flux threshold for atmospheres scales with escape velocity with a power-law index of $p=6.08^{+0.69}_{-0.48}$, steeper than the canonical literature slope of $p=4$, and scales with stellar luminosity with a power-law index of $q=1.25^{+0.31}_{-0.22}$, steep enough to disfavor atmospheres on Earth-sized planets out to the habitable zone for stars less luminous than $\log_{10} (L_\star/L_\odot) = -2.22 \pm 0.21$ (roughly spectral type M4.5V). If we relax the assumption that one power law must stretch from the hottest exoplanets to the coolest Solar System worlds, the narrower question of ``Which warm planets have thick CO$_2$ secondary atmospheres?" is still poorly constrained by data but should improve significantly with planned JWST observations.

          Large Scale Wind Driven Structures in the Orion Nebula

 - **Abstract**
 A study of [C II] 158 micron and HI 21-cm spectroscopic images plus high velocity resolution optical and ultraviolet spectra has shown the structure of the Orion Nebula to be different from that found from the study of those data separately. The [C II] features recently identified as the [C II] Shell is shown to be part of the Veil-B HI foreground layer. Jointly called the Outer Shell, it covers the bright Huygens Region and the Extended Orion Nebula. Its maximum expansion velocity is 15 km/s. Closer to ThetaOne OrionisC there is a second expanding shell, called the Inner Shell. It has an expansion velocity of 27 km/s and probably results from a more recent period of strong wind from one or more of the Trapezium stars. Even closer to ThetaOne OrionisC there is a central high ionization bubble, freely expanding towards the observer but slowed in the opposite direction by photo-ionized gas coming off the Main Ionization Front. Utilization of spectroscopic measures of the equivalent width of Hbeta shows that the enhanced emission in [C II] seen just outside the visual wavelength boundaries of the Orion Nebula is not caused by limb-brightening of the Outer Shell. This enhanced emission is due to the radiation field of the Trapezium stars being filtered by intervening residual neutral hydrogen. A velocity component near 30 km/s (Heliocentric) first seen in HI is also present in [C II] and may result from a foreground cloud of the ISM.

 - **Abstract**
 A wide range of scientific imaging datasets benefit from human inspection for purposes ranging from prosaic-such as fault identification and quality inspection-to profound, enabling the discovery of new phenomena. As such, these datasets come in a wide variety of forms, with diverse inspection needs. In this paper we present a software package, Image Marker, designed to help facilitate human categorization of images. The software allows for quick seeking through images and enables flexible marking and logging of up to 9 different classes of features and their locations in files of FITS, TIFF, PNG, and JPEG format. Additional tools are provided to add text-based comments to the marking logs and for displaying external mark datasets on images during the classification process. As our primary use case will be the identification of features in astronomical survey data, Image Marker will also utilize standard world coordinate system (WCS) headers embedded in FITS headers and TIFF metadata when available. The lightweight software, based on the Qt Framework to build the GUI application, enables efficient marking of thousands of images on personal-scale computers. We provide Image Marker as a Python package, and as Mac and Windows 11 executables. It is available on GitHub or via pip installation.

 - **Abstract**
 Counting the number and brightness of ionizing radiation sources out to a redshift of z ~ 1.2 will revolutionize our understanding of how the ionizing background is created and sustained by the embedded growth of meta-galactic structures. The shear number of sparsely separated targets required to efficiently construct redshift binned luminosity functions is industrial in scale, driving the need for low spectral resolution multi-object spectroscopy (MOS) with a short wavelength cut-off ~ 1000 Å, a sensitivity in the far-UV to better than 30 abmag, and an instantaneous field-of-view ~ (2')$^2$. A MOS on Habitable Worlds Observatory is the only instrument that could conceivably carry out such an ambitious observing program.

          A general polynomial emulator for cosmology via moment projection

 - **Abstract**
 We present MomentEmu, a general-purpose polynomial emulator for fast and interpretable mappings between theoretical parameters and observational features. The method constructs moment matrices to project simulation data onto polynomial bases, yielding symbolic expressions that approximate the target mapping. Compared to neural-network-based emulators, MomentEmu offers negligible training cost, millisecond-level evaluation, and transparent functional forms. As a demonstration, we develop two emulators: PolyCAMB-$D_\ell$, which maps six cosmological parameters to the CMB temperature power spectrum, and PolyCAMB-peak, which enables bidirectional mapping between parameters and acoustic peak features. PolyCAMB-$D_\ell$ achieves an accuracy of $0.03\%$over $\ell \leq 2510$, while PolyCAMB-peak also reaches sub-percent accuracy and produces symbolic forms consistent with known analytical approximations. The method is well suited for forward modelling, parameter inference, and uncertainty propagation, particularly when the parameter space is moderate in dimensionality and the mapping is smooth. MomentEmu offers a lightweight and portable alternative to regression-based or black-box emulators in cosmological analysis.

          XRISM analysis of the complex Fe K$α$ line in Centaurus A

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze the high-resolution XRISM/Resolve spectrum of the Fe K$\alpha$ emission line of the nearest active galactic nucleus, in Centaurus A. The line features two narrow and resolved peaks of Fe K$\alpha_1$, and Fe K$\alpha_2$ with a FWHM of $(4.8\pm0.2)\times10^2$ km/s each. A broad line with a FWHM of $(4.3\pm0.3)\times10^3$ km/s, and with a flux similar to the two narrow line cores, is also required. This broad component is not observed in the optical or IR spectra of Cen A. The line shape requires the existence of an emission region that extends from $\sim10^{-3}$ pc to $\sim10^1$ pc. Assuming that the emissivity follows a radial power-law profile of $r^{-q}$, we find $q\approx2$. This may indicate an extended corona, an emitting region that bends towards the corona, or a non-uniform density. When assuming $q=3$, the line shape can only be reproduced by including three emitting components in the model. The measured best-fit inclination is $24^{+13}_{-7}$ degrees, but higher inclinations are only slightly disfavored. A single blurred MYTorusL line profile can describe the line shape, but requires a large relative normalization. This could be due to past variability, modified abundances, or differing geometries. The line shape can be reproduced from the radii measured by reverberation mapping, but only if an additional extended emitting region at small radii is included.

          Ammonia in the hot core W51-IRS2: Maser line profiles, variability, and saturation

 - **Abstract**
 W51-IRS2 is known to be one of the most prolific sources of interstellar ammonia (NH$_3$) maser lines. So far, however, many of these inversion lines have rarely been studied. Here we report spectrally resolved line profiles for the majority of detected features and provide information on the variability of these maser components between 2012 and 2023. This includes the first tentative detection of a ($J$,$K$) = (5,2) maser in the interstellar medium and the first tentative detection of a (6,4) maser in W51-IRS2. Furthermore, we report for the first time NH$_3$ (9,6) maser emission below Local Standard of Rest velocities of 50 km s$^{-1}$ in this source as well as double maser features occasionally seen in other transitions. The detected maser lines strongly indicate vibrational pumping by $\approx$10 $\mu$m photons, which must be abundant due to the high kinetic temperature ($\approx$300 K) of the ammonia emitting gas. The detection of vibrationally excited NH$_3$, suggesting a vibrational excitation temperature consistent with the kinetic one, and a comparison with measured SiO line profiles is also presented. For the (10,7) line, we find a tentative correlation between flux density and line width compatible with unsaturated maser emission. The velocity drift of the so-called 45 km s$^{-1}$ maser features, reported to be +0.2 km s$^{-1}$ yr$^{-1}$ between 1996 and 2012, has either slowed down to values $<$0.1 km s$^{-1}$ or has entirely disappeared. In 2023, the component is only seen in ammonia inversion lines that are located at least 800 K above the ground state. The other features have faded. Possible scenarios explaining this phenomenon are discussed.

          A high mutual inclination system around KOI-134 revealed by transit timing variations

 - **Abstract**
 Few planetary systems have measured mutual inclinations, and even less are found to be non-coplanar. Observing the gravitational interactions between exoplanets is an effective tool to detect non-transiting companions to transiting planets. Evidence of these interactions can manifest in the light curve through transit timing variations (TTVs) and transit duration variations (TDVs). Through analysis of Kepler photometry and joint TTV-TDV modeling, we confirm the detection of KOI-134 b, a transiting planet with mass and size similar to Jupiter on a period of ~67 days, and find that it exhibits high TTVs (~20-hr amplitude) and significant TDVs. We explain these signals with the presence of an innermost non-transiting planet in 2:1 resonance with KOI-134 b. KOI-134 c has a mass $M = 0.220^{+0.010}_{-0.011} M_\text{Jup}$ and a moderately-high mutual inclination with KOI-134 b of $i_\text{mut} = 15.4_{-2.5}^{+2.8}{^\circ}$. Moreover, the inclination variations of KOI-134 b are so large that the planet is predicted to stop transiting in about 100 years. This system architecture cannot be easily explained by any one formation mechanism, with other dynamical effects needed to excite the planets' mutual inclination while still preserving their resonance.

          Prospects for PBR detection of KM3-230213A-like events

 - **Abstract**
 POEMMA-Balloon with Radio (PBR) is a scaled-down version of the Probe Of Extreme Multi-Messenger Astrophysics (POEMMA) design, optimized to be flown as a payload on one of NASA's sub-orbital super pressure balloons circling the Earth above the southern oceans for a mission duration of more than 20 days. One of the main science objectives of PBR is to follow up astrophysical event alerts in search of neutrinos with very high energy ($10^8 \lesssim E_\nu /{\rm GeV} \lesssim 10^{10}$). Of particular interest for anticipated PBR observations, the KM3NeT Collaboration has recently reported the detection of the neutrino KM3-230213A with $10^{8.1} \lesssim E_\nu/{\rm GeV} \lesssim 10^{8.9}$. Such an unprecedented event is in tension with upper limits on the cosmic neutrino flux from IceCube and the Pierre Auger Observatory: for a diffuse isotropic neutrino flux there is a $3.5\sigma$ tension between KM3NeT and IceCube measurements, and about $2.6\sigma$ if the neutrino flux originates in transient sources. Therefore, if KM3-230213A was not beginner's luck, it becomes compelling to consider beyond Standard Model (BSM) possibilities which could lead to a signal at KM3NeT-ARCA but not at IceCube/Auger. We calculate the PBR horizon-range sensitivity to probe BSM physics compatible with observation at KM3NeT-ARCA and non-observation at IceCube/Auger. As an illustration, we consider a particular class of BSM physics models which has been described in the literature as a possible explanation of KM3-230213A.

 - **Abstract**
 Massive stars play a decisive role in the evolution of the Universe. In order to constrain their current state and structure, we need sufficiently complex models, constrained by astrometric, interferometric, and spectroscopic observations. However, they are not available for distant stars. Instead, we focused on the nearest massive stars in the Orion Belt. We obtained VLTI interferometric observations of Orion Belt stars and calibrated visibility data from the GRAVITY and PIONIER instruments. Additionally, we obtained spectroscopic data from the CFHT and CTIO observatories. For modelling, we used a modified version of PHOEBE2, extended with new interferometric and spectroscopic modules. To describe non-spherical, rotating, or Roche-like stars, integrals over triangular meshes have to be computed, using extensive grids of synthetic spectra. For fitting, we used the simplex algorithm and chi2 mapping of the parameter space. In this paper, we present single-star models of the B0Ia supergiant eps Ori. Interferometric visibilities indicate that the star is not spherical but rotating close to its critical velocity. The preferred distance, d=(384+-8)pc, corresponds to the median of distances for the Orion OB1b association. We obtained the following parameters: m=(28.4+-2.0)Msol, R=(27.6+-1.5)Rsol, Teff=25000 K, i=45deg, longitude of the ascending node, Omega=300deg, and Prot=4.3+1.0d. This compromise model provides a reasonable fit to wind-free Balmer line profiles, but there is still some tension between interferometric and spectroscopic datasets, corresponding to a faster- vs. slower-rotating star. Our fast-rotating model implies that circumstellar matter should be naturally present, in the form of wind or disk, and contribute to continuum radiation. The fast rotation of eps Ori is compatible with a merger, formed from a multiple system of comparable mass, like del, zet or sig Ori.

 - **Abstract**
 Nearby stars offer prime opportunities for exoplanet discovery and characterization through various detection methods. By combining HCI, RV, and astrometry, it is possible to better constrain the presence of substellar companions, as each method probes different regions of their parameter space. A detailed census of planets around nearby stars is essential to guide the selection of targets for future space missions seeking to identify Earth-like planets and potentially habitable worlds. In addition, the detection and characterisation of giant planets and brown dwarfs is crucial for understanding the formation and evolution of planetary systems. We aim to constrain the possible presence of substellar companions for 7 nearby M-dwarf stars using a combination of new SPHERE/H2 HCI and archival RV and astrometric data. We investigate how combining these techniques improves the detection constraints for giant planets and brown dwarfs compared to using each method individually. For each star and each data set, we compute the mass limits as a function of semi-major axis or projected separation using standard techniques. We then use a Monte Carlo approach to assess the completeness of the companion mass / semi-major axis parameter space probed by the combination of the three methods, as well as by the three methods independently. Our combined approach significantly increases the fraction of detectable companions. Although no new companion was detected, we could place stronger constraints on potential substellar companions. The combination of HCI, RV and astrometry provides significant improvements in the detection of substellar companions over a wider parameter space. Applying this approach to larger samples and lower-mass companions will help constraining the search space for future space missions aimed at finding potentially habitable or even inhabited planets.

 - **Abstract**
 Massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) and other sources within the frequency band of spaceborne gravitational wave observatories like the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), Taiji and Tianqin pose unique challenges, as gaps and glitches during the years-long observation lead to both loss of information and spectral leakage. We propose a novel data imputation strategy based on Kalman filter and smoother to mitigate gap-induced biases in parameter estimation. Applied to a scenario where traditional windowing and smoothing technique introduce significant biases, our method mitigates the biases and demonstrates lower computational cost compared to existing data augmentation techniques such as noise inpainting. This framework presents a new gap treatment approach that balances robustness and efficiency for space-based gravitational wave data analysis.

 - **Abstract**
 The super-soft source (SSS) phase of a nova eruption, observed a few days after the outburst, usually displays an absorbed X-ray thermal continuum with absorption features, emitted by the white dwarf (WD) atmosphere. However, the X-ray spectra of many novae in this phase display additional emission lines which likely originate from shocks in the novae ejecta. When the shocked plasma interacts with cold gas, narrow radiative recombination continua (RRCs) and charge exchange (CX) emission are observed. We present the analysis of high-resolution ChandraLETG X-ray grating spectra of Nova Sco 2023, observed 128 and 183 days after the optical peak, on 2023 August and October. At both epochs, the absorbed X-ray thermal continuum is well described by a Non-Local Thermal Equilibrium atmosphere model with a temperature T=750,000 K (kT = 65 eV). On day 128, the atmosphere is found to be outflowing at v=-3500 km s^-1. On day 183, the atmosphere brightened by a factor of ~2 and slowed down to v=-1500$ km s^-1. The discrete emission features of the spectrum consist of the C^+5, N^+5, and N^+6 RRCs, indicating a cold electron temperature of kT_e=1 eV on day 128, and kT_e=20 eV on day 183. The observed line series of H-like and He-like C^+5, N^+5, N^+6, and O^+6 show enhanced intensities of high-n (principal quantum number) transitions, consistent with a CX model of hot ions at kT~100 eV. The velocity shift of the CX lines remained at v=+-3000 km s^-1, which can be explained by a bipolar outflow. After Nova Ret 2020 (YZ Ret), Nova Sco 2023 is yet another nova in which we have found exquisite evidence of CX in astrophysical ionized plasma.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigated the widths and profiles of cosmic filaments using the IllustrisTNG simulations. Filaments were identified with DisPerSE, using galaxy samples in simulations as input. Since the width of an individual filament can vary significantly along its spine, we divided each filament into segments with lengths between $1.5\,h^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}$ and $2.5\,h^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}$ and measure their properties. The typical width of these filament segments increases gradually from approximately $0.3\,\mathrm{Mpc}$ at redshift $z = 2.0$ to about $1.0-1.5\,\mathrm{Mpc}$ at $z = 0.0$. We find that the segment width correlates nearly linearly with the linear halo mass density, consistent with previous studies. A similar linear relation is observed between the segment width and the linear stellar mass density, providing a potential estimator for filament width. Furthermore, the density profiles of filaments with different widths exhibit self-similarity and can be described by a unified formula akin to the isothermal $\beta$-model. For segments with a given width, the rescaled density profiles show only mild evolution from $z = 2.0$ to $z = 0.0$. Within the filament width, the gas temperature decreases slowly from the center to the boundary, with thicker filaments generally containing hotter gas than thinner ones. These trends in filament width, density, and thermal profiles are consistently observed across the TNG50, TNG100, and TNG300 simulations, and align well with results from earlier studies. We briefly discuss the potential implications and applications of our findings.

 We present recent progress in our understanding of the physical interaction mechanisms at work in evolved binaries of low-to-intermediate initial mass, which are surrounded by a stable disc of gas and dust. These systems are known as post-asymptotic giant-branch (post-AGB) binaries, but recently, it has been shown that some systems are too low in luminosity and should be considered as post-red-giant branch (post-RGB) instead. While the systems are currently well within their Roche lobe, they still show signs of active ongoing interaction between the different building blocks. We end this contribution with some future research plans.

          Partial Differentiation of Callisto as Possible Evidence for Pebble Accretion

 - **Abstract**
 "Planetesimal or pebble" is one of the most fundamental open questions in planet formation theory. Similarly, "satellitesimal or pebble" remains unsettled regarding the formation of the Galilean satellites. I focus on a unique characteristic of Callisto--its interior is estimated to be only partially differentiated based on gravitational field measurements. I robustly demonstrate that such a state is not achievable through satellitesimal accretion, which inevitably leads to significant differentiation, but can be maintained with pebble accretion. Pebbles can release their impact energy at the surface of the satellite, allowing efficient radiative cooling, and their impact velocities can be reduced by aerodynamic drag from the circumplanetary gas disk. If future missions such as JUpiter ICy moons Explorer (JUICE) confirm that Callisto is indeed only partially differentiated, it could provide the first observed evidence for the pebble accretion mechanism--not only in the context of satellite formation, but also in the broader framework of planet formation.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a novel approach for assessing the muon content of air showers with large zenith angles on a combined analysis of their radio emission and particle footprint. We use the radiation energy reconstructed by the Auger Engineering Radio Array (AERA) as an energy estimator and determine the muon number independently with the water-Cherenkov detector array of the Pierre Auger Observatory, deployed on a 1500 m grid. We focus our analysis on air showers with primary energy above 4 EeV to ensure full detection efficiency. Over approximately ten years of accumulated data, we identify a set of 40 high-quality events that are used in the analysis. The estimated muon contents in data are compatible with those for iron primaries as predicted by current-generation hadronic interaction models. This result can be interpreted as a deficit of muons in simulations as a lighter mass composition has been established from Xmax measurements. This muon deficit was already observed in previous analyses of the Auger Collaboration and is confirmed using hybrid events that include radio measurements for the first time.

          Gas Pressure Driven Screening Forces and Pebble Aggregation: A Pathway for Growth in Planet Formation

 - **Abstract**
 The formation of planetesimals from cm-sized pebbles in protoplanetary disks faces significant barriers, including fragmentation and radial drift. We identify a previously unaccounted screening force, arising from mutual shielding of thermal gas particles between pebbles when their separation falls below the gas mean free path. This force facilitates pebble binding, overcoming key growth barriers under turbulent disk conditions. Unlike conventional mechanisms, screening forces operate independently of surface adhesion and complement streaming instability and pressure traps by enhancing aggregation in high-density regions. Our analysis predicts that screening interactions are most effective in the {middle disk regions ($ \sim 0.3$ to few AU),} consistent with ALMA observations (e.g., TW Hya) of enhanced dust concentrations. {Furthermore, we find that screening-induced pebble growth from centimeter to kilometer scales can occur on timescales significantly shorter than the disk lifetime ($\sim 10^5$ years). Importantly, this growth naturally terminates when particles smaller than the local gas mean free path are depleted, thereby avoiding runaway accretion.} Beyond planetary science, the screening forces have {potential} implications for high-energy astrophysics, dusty plasmas, confined particle suspensions and other relevant areas, suggesting a broader fundamental significance.

 - **Abstract**
 Small low-density exoplanets are sculpted by strong stellar irradiation but their origin is unknown. Two competing scenarios are that they formed either with rocky interiors and H2-He atmospheres (`gas-dwarfs'), or instead with bulk compositions dominated by H2O phases (`water-worlds'). Observations of L 98-59 d have revealed its unusually low density and spectral characteristics, opening a window for disentangling its origin. We constrain the possible range of evolutionary histories linking L 98-59 d's birth conditions to these observations, using a coupled atmosphere-interior modelling framework. Observations are explained by a chemically-reducing mantle and early substantial (>1.8 mass%) sulfur and hydrogen content, inconsistent with both the gas-dwarf and water-world origin scenarios. Observed spectral features are explained by in-situ photochemical production of SO2 in an H2 background. L 98-59 d's interior comprises a permanent magma ocean, allowing long-term retention of volatiles within its interior over billions of years, consistent with surveyed Kepler Survey trends. Modelling of the `cosmic shoreline' suggests that early volatile-metal budget is a determinant of atmospheric retention - here, we explicitly show that large initial budgets can explain JWST observations of some super-Earth planets (including DDT targets). In breaking with the supposed gas-dwarf/water-world dichotomy, we reveal an evolutionary pathway defined by high-molar-mass atmospheres overlying magma oceans, and invite a more nuanced taxonomy of small exoplanets.

          A Hot Jupiter with a Retrograde Orbit around a Sun-like Star and a Toy Model of Hot Jupiters in Wide Binary Star Systems

 - **Abstract**
 We report an observation of a transit of the hot Jupiter (HJ) KELT-23A b with the Keck Planet Finder spectrograph and a measurement of the sky-projected obliquity ($\lambda$) of its Sun-like ($T_{\rm eff} \approx 5900$ K) host star. We measured a projected stellar obliquity of $\lambda \approx 180^\circ$, indicating that the orbit of the HJ is retrograde relative to the direction of the stellar spin. Due to the slow sky-projected rotational velocity of the host star ($v \sin{i_\star} \approx 0.5$ km s$^{-1}$), the true orbit of the HJ could be closer to polar. HJs around stars with effective temperatures below the Kraft break -- such as KELT-23A -- are generally found to have prograde orbits that are well-aligned with the equatorial planes of their host stars (i.e., $\lambda \sim 0^\circ$), most likely due to spin-orbit realignment driven by stellar tidal dissipation. This system is therefore a unique outlier that strains migration and tidal theories. The fact that the HJ has a highly misaligned orbit may suggest that the planet arrived at its close-in orbit relatively recently, possibly via interactions with the wide-separation (570 AU) M-dwarf companion in the system, or that it has stalled near an antialigned or polar orientation while realigning. Using Gaia DR3, we determined the orbit of the stellar companion to be moderately face-on ($\gamma = 60 \pm 4^\circ$). We show that the distribution of observed systems in the $\gamma - \lambda$ plane can be broadly reproduced using a toy model in which the orbits of the planetary and stellar companions begin aligned with the equatorial plane of the primary star and, upon migrating inwards, the planet preferentially obtains either an aligned or polar orbit.

 - **Abstract**
 We consider a model of inflation in which the inflaton field is a rolling axion with a potential which is flat enough to support an intermediate phase of USR inflation. Because of the Chern-Simons interaction, one polarization of the gauge field experiences the tachyonic growth during the first slow-roll stage, inducing large corrections in curvature perturbations via the inverse decay effect. A non-trivial feature of our setup is that once the system enters the USR phase, the instability parameter falls off rapidly, terminating the gauge field production efficiently. Consequently, the power spectrum involves two separate peaks, the first peak is induced by the gauge field particles production while the second peak is due to standard USR mechanism. We show that the power spectrum at the intermediate scales develops strong scale-dependence $\propto k^m$ with the index $m >4$. Calculating the bispectrum, we demonstrate that non-Gaussianities with non-trivial shapes and multiple peaks are generated in this setup.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate cosmic structure formation in the framework of a path-integral formulation of an $N$-particle ensemble in phase space, dubbed Resummed Kinetic Field Theory (RKFT), up to one-loop perturbative order. In particular, we compute power spectra of the density contrast, the divergence and curl of the momentum density and arbitrary $n$-point cumulants of the stress tensor. In contrast to earlier works, we propose a different method of sampling initial conditions, with a Gaussian initial phase-space density. Doing so, we exactly reproduce the corresponding results from Eulerian standard perturbation theory (SPT) at one-loop order, showing that formerly found deviations can be fully attributed to inconsistencies in the previous sampling method. Since, in contrast to SPT, the full phase-space description does not assume a truncation of the Vlasov hierarchy, our findings suggest that non-perturbative techniques are required to accurately capture the physics of cosmic structure formation.

 - **Abstract**
 The potentially distinct formation pathways of exoplanets and brown dwarfs may be imprinted in their elemental and isotopic ratios. This work is part of the ESO SupJup Survey, which aims to disentangle the formation pathways of super-Jupiters and brown dwarfs through the analysis of their chemical and isotopic ratios. In this study, we characterize the atmospheres of two young L4 dwarfs, 2MASS J03552337+1133437 (2M0355) and 2MASS J14252798-3650229 (2M1425), in the AB Doradus Moving Group. This involved constraining their chemical composition, $^{12}$CO/$^{13}$CO ratio, pressure-temperature profile, surface gravity, and rotational velocity. We have obtained high-resolution CRIRES+ K-band spectra of these brown dwarfs, which we analyzed with an atmospheric retrieval pipeline. Atmospheric models were generated with the radiative transfer code petitRADTRANS, for which we employed a free and equilibrium chemistry approach, which we coupled with the PyMultiNest sampling algorithm to determine the best fit. We report robust detections of $^{13}$CO (13.4 & 8.0 $\sigma$) and HF (11.6 & 15.8 $\sigma$) in 2M0355 and 2M1425, respectively. The objects have similar overall atmospheric properties, including $^{12}$CO/$^{13}$CO isotope ratios of $95.5\substack{+6.8 \\ -6.4}$ for 2M0355 and $109.6\substack{+10.6 \\ -9.6}$ for 2M1425. In both brown dwarfs, we find only tentative hints of H$_2^{18}$O (1.1 & 3.0 $\sigma$), with lower limits of H$_2^{16}$O/H$_2^{18}$O $\sim$ 1000. Both objects appear to be close to chemical equilibrium, considering the main spectral contributors. Future studies will put them into the context of other objects observed as part of the ESO SupJup Survey.

 Parity-violation leaves tell-tale trails in many cosmological observables. We illustrate parity-odd primordial scalar trispectra, that despite being of modest strength, impart detectable chirality to scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGW). This allows us to impose strong bounds on the parity-odd part of trispectrum. Over certain scales, we find SIGW directly quantify parity-violation in primordial non-Gaussianity, unobscured by the Gaussian contribution. Our results call for treatment of SIGW and parity-odd trispectrum as complementary predictions of parity-violating theories.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a cautionary assessment of the extended X-ray emission around PSR B0656+14 in eROSITA Cal-PV data in response to the work of Niu et al. 2025 (arXiv:2501.17046). The eROSITA PSF model is known to underestimate emission in the wings beyond 1'. This prevents a reliable detection of faint nebular emission around PSR B0656+14 as claimed in arXiv:2501.17046. In addition, spectral analysis shows the surrounding diffuse X-rays can be fitted with the same 2BB+PL model as the pulsar's emission itself. This strongly invalidates the interpretation by the authors of arXiv:2501.17046 that the X-ray emission in the (4-10)' region is associated with the degree-scale gamma-ray halo recently found by the High-Altitude Water Cherenkov Observatory (HAWC), and shows that it originates from the pulsar due to the wings of the PSF.

 - **Abstract**
 Recently, the microquasar V4641 Sgr and its surrounding is detected at TeV-PeV gamma-ray band. Interestingly, the spectrum follows a power-law function continuing up to 0.8 PeV as reported by LHAASO, and the morphology of the emission appears a puzzling elongated structure. In this work, we propose that the elongated UHE emission from V4641 Sgr could originate from the inverse Compton radiation of electrons with a very hard spectrum, which may result from shear acceleration mechanism in the jets driven by V4641 Sgr. We also calculate the corresponding X-ray synchrotron emission from the same electron population, predicting the potential range of non-thermal X-ray flux of the source. The recent observation by XRISM toward the central part of the UHE source could pose a constraint on the model parameters. In the future, a full coverage of the source by sensitive X-ray instrument and high-resolution TeV-PeV gamma-ray instrument may provide a critical test of the model.

 Ultra-hot Jupiters (UHJs) offer exceptional opportunities for detailed atmospheric characterization via emission spectroscopy. Here we present a comprehensive analysis of the dayside atmosphere of WASP-19b$\unicode{x2014}$one of the shortest-period UHJs$\unicode{x2014}$using archival JWST NIRSpec/PRISM observations spanning 0.6-5.3 $\mu$m. We report robust detections of H$_2$O (16.44 $\sigma$), CO (5.47 $\sigma$), and CO$_2$ (10.72 $\sigma$), along with marginal detections of CH$_4$ (3.76 $\sigma$) and C$_2$H$_2$ (2.45 $\sigma$). The retrieved composition reveals a highly carbon-rich atmosphere with a tightly constrained super-solar C/O ratio of 0.94$\pm$0.03. Elevated abundances of carbon-bearing species provide strong evidence (11.69 $\sigma$) for disequilibrium chemistry. We also detect condensate clouds, likely Al$_2$O$_3$(c), at high significance (17.28 $\sigma$), and constrain the atmospheric metallicity to 1.7$_{-0.7}^{+1.2}$ $\times$ solar. These results establish a precise benchmark for modeling dayside conditions in extreme irradiated atmospheres and demonstrate JWST's transformative capabilities for exoplanet science.

 - **Abstract**
 Large aperture telescopes are pivotal for exploring the universe, yet even with state-of-the-art manufacturing and launch technology, their size is limited to several meters. As we aim to build larger telescopes - extending tens of meters - designs in which the main mirror is based on liquid deployment in space are emerging as promising candidates. However, alongside their enormous potential advantages, liquid-based surfaces present new challenges in material science, mechanics, and fluid dynamics. One of the fundamental questions is whether it is possible for such surfaces to maintain their precise optical shape over long durations, and in particular under the forces induced by the telescope's accelerations. In this paper, we present a model and a closed-form analytical solution for the non-self-adjoint problem of the dynamics of a thin liquid film pinned within a finite circular domain. We use the 50-meter Fluidic Telescope (FLUTE) concept as the case study, and examine the liquid dynamics of the telescope under both slewing actuation and relaxation regimes, elucidating the role of geometrical parameters and liquid properties. The solutions reveal a maneuvering 'budget' wherein the degradation of the mirror surface is directly linked to the choice of maneuvers and their sequence. By simulating ten years of typical operation, we show that, while the maximal deformation might reach several microns, the spatial distribution of the deformation and their propagation rate allows the telescope to maintain its optical functionality for years, with at least a substantial portion of the aperture remaining suitable for astronomical observations. The model provides valuable insights and guidelines into the performance of liquid-film space telescopes, marking a crucial step toward realizing the potential of this innovative concept.

 - **Abstract**
 We examine the joint effects of relativistic accretion and memory burdened evaporation on the evolution of primordial black holes (PBHs). The memory burden effect, which delays the evaporation by inducing a backreaction and making the evaporation rate scale as an inverse power law of the PBH entropy, opens up a new window that allows PBHs with $M \lesssim 10^{15}~\mathrm{g}$ to survive until the present epoch. Meanwhile, accretion increases the mass of PBHs, thereby enhancing their chances of survival for a given initial mass. We consider two main scenarios: one where PBHs evaporate completely before big bang nucleosynthesis, and another where PBHs persist until today. In the case of evaporation, we analyse the emission of dark matter (DM) and dark radiation (DR) during the process of evaporation. Conversely, in the other case, the surviving PBHs themselves can contribute as DM. We further investigate how relativistic and non-relativistic accretion, together with memory burdened evaporation, impact the parameter space of the emitted DM, the abundance of stable PBHs as DM, and the contribution of DR to the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, $\Delta N_{\mathrm{eff}}$.

 The Cosmological Principle posits that the Universe is isotropic on the largest scales. While widely supported, this foundational assumption remains testable. We analyse the angular distribution of over one million quasars from the Gaia-unWISE catalogue using Renyi entropy, a multiscale statistical measure sensitive to higher-order clustering. Dividing the sample into three redshift bins, we find that both the low- and high-redshift distributions are statistically consistent with isotropy. However, at intermediate redshift ($1 \leq z < 2.2$), we detect a statistically significant and scale-dependent anisotropy that persists under stringent masking, suggesting a physical origin. We interpret this as evidence for a transitional epoch in cosmic history, during which large-scale structures such as superclusters became prominent before their growth was gradually damped by the onset of accelerated expansion. These findings position Renyi entropy as a powerful probe of cosmic evolution and highlight the potential thermodynamic links between structure formation, entropy dissipation, and the emergence of large-scale isotropy.

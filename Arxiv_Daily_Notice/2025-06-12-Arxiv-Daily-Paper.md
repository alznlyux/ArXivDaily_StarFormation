 - **Abstract**
 We present high-resolution Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array observations of the 22 GHz $\mathrm{H_2O}$ maser line in the extended Sagittarius B2 cloud. We detect 499 $\mathrm{H_2O}$ masers across the observed velocities between -39 and 172 km s$^{-1}$. To investigate the nature of the masers, we analyze their spatial distribution and cross-match with catalogs of HII regions and protostellar cores. 62% of masers are associated with protostellar cores and 32% with HII regions. The nature of the remaining 6% of sources was not established, but is likely associated with protostellar cores. Based on the spatial extent of the groups of masers, we classify them as either outflow-associated or young stellar object (YSO)-associated. We identify 144 unique sites of maser emission: 23 are associated with HII regions and 94 with protostellar cores, of which 33 are associated with protostellar outflows and 18 with YSOs. The outflow-associated $\mathrm{H_2O}$ maser emission is confined to within $<2000$ au of the central continuum source, despite shocked SiO emission extending over tens of thousands of au. The YSO-associated masers show a lack of detections at $5 < V_{rel} < 30$ km s$^{-1}$, which we suggest may be due to maser self-absorption. We show how $\mathrm{H_2O}$ masers trace the large-scale material flow in Sgr B2 N (North) also seen in SiO and mm continuum emission. Finally, we find that protostellar cores with associated $\mathrm{H_2O}$ masers tend to have brighter 3 mm continuum emission on average, although there is no strong correlation between maser brightness and continuum flux.

          Bar-driven dispersal of Galactic substructure

 - **Abstract**
 Galactic archaeologists often assume that integrals of motion (IoMs) such as $L_z$ and $E$ are conserved, so substructure remains frozen in IoM space over many Gyr. However, this is not true in the Milky Way due in part to its rotating bar. In this study we quantify the effects of the bar on the dynamics of substructure. We employ three different theoretical models: an analytical toy model; a set of test particle simulations with steady and slowing bars; and a cosmological zoom-in simulation of a Milky Way-like galaxy. Each model predicts that the bar increases the angular momentum and energy spread of low-energy substructures by a factor of $\sim10-100$, so they cannot remain tightly clustered. We derive a criterion for determining when this effect is important. The most affected orbits are low energy ($E\lesssim E_\odot$, $r_\mathrm{apo}<40$ kpc), prograde, eccentric, or low inclination. This includes $\sim3/4$ of Galactic globular clusters and $\sim1/4$ of known stellar streams. We predict the presence of abundant bar-dispersed substructure. The structures remain much more tightly clustered in the space of metallicity and Jacobi integral $H_\mathrm{J}=E-\Omega_\mathrm{b}L_z$. We therefore propose using $H_\mathrm{J}$ and chemistry instead of traditional IoMs when searching for inner halo substructure. In $(L_z,E)$ space the dispersal of the structures is along a principal direction with gradient $\mathrm{d}E/\mathrm{d}L_z$ equal to the bar's pattern speed $\Omega_\mathrm{b}$. Bar-dispersed substructure should therefore allow the past evolution of $\Omega_\mathrm{b}$ to be constrained.

 - **Abstract**
 We develop techniques for generating accurate and precise internal covariances for measurements of clustering and weak lensing angular power spectra. These methods are designed to produce non-singular and unbiased covariances for Euclid's large anticipated data vector and will be critical for validation against observational systematic effects. We construct jackknife segments that are equal in area to high precision by adapting the binary space partition algorithm to work on arbitrarily shaped regions on the unit sphere. Jackknife estimates of the covariances are internally derived and require no assumptions about cosmology or galaxy population and bias. Our covariance estimation, called DICES (Debiased Internal Covariance Estimation with Shrinkage), first estimates a noisy covariance through conventional delete-1 jackknife resampling. This is followed by linear shrinkage of the empirical correlation matrix towards the Gaussian prediction, rather than linear shrinkage of the covariance matrix. Shrinkage ensures the covariance is non-singular and therefore invertible, critical for the estimation of likelihoods and validation. We then apply a delete-2 jackknife bias correction to the diagonal components of the jackknife covariance that removes the general tendency for jackknife error estimates to be biased high. We validate internally derived covariances, which use the jackknife resampling technique, on synthetic Euclid-like lognormal catalogues. We demonstrate that DICES produces accurate, non-singular covariance estimates, with the relative error improving by $33\%$ for the covariance and $48\%$ for the correlation structure in comparison to jackknife estimates. These estimates can be used for highly accurate regression and inference.

          Spin-orbit misalignment and residual eccentricity are evidence that neutron star-black hole mergers form through triple star evolution

 - **Abstract**
 There is growing evidence that a substantial fraction of the neutron star-black holes (NSBHs) detected through gravitational waves merge with non-zero eccentricity or large BH spin-orbit misalignment. This is in tension with the leading formation scenarios to date. Residual eccentricity rules out formation through isolated binary star evolution, while NS natal kicks and the unequal masses of NSBHs inhibit efficient pairing in dense stellar environments. Here, we report that all observed properties-NSBH merger rate, eccentricity, and spin-orbit misalignment-are explained by the high prevalence of massive stellar triples in the field. Modelling their evolution from the ZAMS, we investigate NSBH mergers caused by gravitational perturbations from a tertiary companion. We show that the formation of the NS decisively impacts the triple stability, preferentially leaving behind surviving NSBHs in compact triple architectures. The rich three-body dynamics of compact, unequal-mass triples enables mergers across a wide range of orbital parameters without requiring fine-tuned highly inclined tertiary orbits and provides a natural explanation for an abundance of residual eccentricity and spin-orbit misalignment. We infer a total NSBH merger rate of $R\sim1-23\,\rm Gpc^{-3}\,yr^{-1}$, with more than a few 10% exhibiting eccentricity $e_{20}>0.1$ or large spin-orbit misalignment $\cos\theta_{\rm BH}<0$, consistent with current observations. Tertiary-driven NSBH mergers closely track the cosmic star formation rate due to their short delay times, include a substantial fraction of burst-like highly eccentric systems ($e_{20} > 0.9$), and almost universally retain eccentricities $e_{20}>10^{-3}$, potentially detectable by next-generation detectors. If evidence for eccentric and misaligned events solidifies, our results suggest that triple dynamics is the dominant formation channel of NSBH mergers.

          Computing Nonlinear Power Spectra Across Dynamical Dark Energy Model Space with Neural ODEs

 - **Abstract**
 I show how to compute the nonlinear power spectrum across the entire $w(z)$ dynamical dark energy model space. Using synthetic $\Lambda$CDM data, I train a neural ordinary differential equation (ODE) to infer the evolution of the nonlinear matter power spectrum as a function of the background expansion and mean matter density across $\sim$$9 {\rm \ Gyr}$ of cosmic evolution. After training, the model generalises to {\it any} dynamical dark energy model parameterised by $w(z)$. With little optimisation, the neural ODE is accurate to within $4\%$ up to k = $5 \ h {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. Unlike simulation rescaling methods, neural ODEs naturally extend to summary statistics beyond the power spectrum that are sensitive to the growth history.

 - **Abstract**
 We aim to investigate the theoretical bi-stability jump, which predicts an increase in mass-loss rates below 21 kK. We further aim to constrain the photospheric and wind parameters of a sample of 16 LMC late-O and B supergiants. We utilise the 1D, non-LTE radiative transfer model CMFGEN in a grid-based approach and subsequent fine-tuned spectroscopic fitting procedure to determine the stellar and wind parameters of each star. We apply this method to ultra-violet data from the ULLYSES programme and complementary optical data from the XShootU collaboration. We also utilise evolutionary models to obtain the evolutionary masses and compare them to our derived spectroscopic masses. We derive physical parameters and wind properties of 16 late-O and B supergiants that span a wide $T_{eff}$ range of 12-30 kK, surface gravity range $\log{g/cm~s^{-2}}$ of 1.8-3.1, and a mass-loss rate range of $10^{-7.6}-10^{-5.7}M_{\odot}yr^{-1}$. We also compare our results to previous studies spectroscopic studies of LMC OB stars. We find that our derived photospheric and wind properties are consistent with multiple previous studies. For most of our sample, we find that the evolutionary masses and spectroscopic masses are consistent. Our results do not reproduce a bi-stability jump in any temperature range, but rather a monotonic decrease in mass-loss rate at lower temperatures. We obtain a terminal wind velocity-effective temperature relation for LMC supergiants. We find that our derived mass-loss rates do not agree with predictions from any of the numerical recipes. This is also the case for the ratio of the terminal wind velocity to the escape velocity $v_{\infty}/v_{esc}$, and we derive a $v_{\infty}/v_{esc}$-$T_{eff}$ relation. We find that wind properties are metallicity dependent from a comparison with a previous SMC study, and we obtain a new modified wind momentum-luminosity relation.

 - **Abstract**
 We model the effect of resonances between time-varying perturbative forces and the epi-cyclical motion of eccentric binaries in the gravitational wave (GW) driven regime. These induce secular drifts in the orbital elements which are reflected in a dephasing of the binary's GW signal, derived here systematically. The resulting dephasing prescriptions showcase a much richer phenomenology with respect to typically adopted power-laws, and are better able to model realistic environmental effects (EE). The most important consequences are for gas embedded binaries, which we analyse in detail with a series of analytical calculations, numerical experiments and a curated set of hydrodynamical simulations. Even in these simplified tests, we find the surprising result that dephasing caused by epi-cyclical resonances dominate over expectations based on smoothed or orbit averaged gas drag models in GW signals that retain mild eccentricity in the detector band ($e> 0.05$). We discuss how dissecting GW dephasing in its component Fourier modes can be used to probe the coupling of binaries with their surrounding environment in unprecedented detail.

 - **Abstract**
 Dark matter halos are typically defined as spheres that enclose some overdensity, but these sharp, somewhat arbitrary boundaries introduce non-physical artifacts such as backsplash halos, pseudo-evolution, and an incomplete accounting of halo mass. A more physically motivated alternative is to define halos as the collection of particles that are physically orbiting within their potential well. However, existing methods to classify particles as orbiting or infalling suffer from trade-offs between accuracy, computational cost, and generalizability across cosmologies. We present an efficient, yet accurate, supervised machine learning approach using decision trees. The classification is based on only the particle radii and velocities at two epochs. Compared to detailed analysis of particle trajectories, we find that our model matches the classification of 97\% of particles. Consequently, we are able to quickly and accurately reproduce the density profiles of the orbiting and infalling components out to many virial radii. We demonstrate that our model generalizes to a significantly different cosmology that lies outside the training dataset. We make publicly available both our final model and the code to train similar models.

          Inferring the pair-instability mass gap from gravitational wave data using flexible models

 - **Abstract**
 We use hierarchical Bayesian inference with non-parametric Gaussian process models to investigate the effective inspiral spin parameter, $\chi_{\rm eff}$, as a function of primary black hole mass in the third gravitational-wave transient catalog (GWTC-3). Our analysis reveals a transition in the population at a primary mass of $46^{+7}_{-5}\,M_\odot$. Beyond this mass, the $\chi_{\rm eff}$ distribution broadens, becomes consistent with being symmetric around zero, and has a median of $-0.03^{+0.36}_{-0.59}$ (90\% credibility). These results are consistent with the presence of a pair-instability mass gap that is repopulated by black holes that are the remnant of a previous merger, formed in dense star clusters. However, asymmetric distributions skewed toward positive $\chi_{\rm eff}$ are not excluded by current data. Below the inferred transition mass, we constrain the fraction of second-generation black holes to be $\lesssim 10\%$. These results provide model-independent support for a high-mass and high-spin population of black holes in the data, consistent with earlier work using parametric models. Imminent gravitational-wave data releases will be essential to sharpen constraints on spin symmetry and clarify the origin of the black holes.

 - **Abstract**
 Eclipsing binary systems play a vital role in astrophysics, as they provide a direct means of measuring fundamental stellar parameters. By combining high-precision space-based observations with ground-based multicolor photometric data, these parameters can be determined with greater accuracy. In this study, we present the first photometric analysis of the IY Aur eclipsing binary system, using a combination of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) light curve and new UBVRI CCD observations obtained with the 60 cm robotic telescope (T60) at the TUBITAK National Observatory. Through detailed photometric modeling, the masses and radii of the system's primary and secondary components were determined as $M_{1}=6.51\pm 0.81\,M_{\odot}$, $M_{2}=5.39\pm 0.87\,M_{\odot}$, and $R_{1}=4.15\pm 0.20\,R_{\odot}$, $R_{2}=6.88\pm 0.33\,R_{\odot}$, respectively. The logarithmic values of luminosity and surface gravity were calculated as $\log L_{1}=3.14\pm 0.20\,L_{\odot}$ and $\log g_{1}=4.01\pm 0.02$ cgs for the primary component, and $\log L_{2}=2.50 \pm 0.22\,L_{\odot}$ and $\log g_{2}=3.49\pm 0.03$ cgs for the secondary component. Furthermore, the distance to IY Aur was estimated as $d=1690\pm237$ pc.

          Dynamics of low-mass black hole seeds in the BRAHMA simulations using subgrid-dynamical friction: Impact on merger-driven black hole growth in the high redshift Universe

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze the dynamics of low-mass black hole (BH) seeds in the high-redshift ($z\gtrsim5$) Universe using a suite of $[4.5~\mathrm{Mpc}]^3$ and $[9~\mathrm{Mpc}]^3$ BRAHMA cosmological hydrodynamic simulations. The simulations form seeds with mass $M_{\mathrm{seed}}=2.2\times10^3~M_{\odot}$ in halos that exceed critical thresholds of dense & metal-poor gas mass ($5-150~M_{\mathrm{seed}}$) and the halo mass ($1000-10000~M_{\mathrm{seed}}$). While the initial BRAHMA boxes pinned the BHs to the halo centers, here we implement a sub-grid dynamical friction (DF) model. We also compare simulations where the BH is allowed to wander without the added DF. We investigate the spatial and velocity offsets of BHs in their host subhalos, as well as BH merger rates. We find that subgrid DF is crucial to ensure that a significant fraction of BHs effectively sink to halo centers by $z\sim5$, thereby enabling them to get gravitationally bound and merge with other BHs at separations close to the spatial resolution ($\sim0.2-0.4~\rm kpc$) of the simulation. For the BHs that merge, the associated merger time scales lag between $\sim100-1000~\mathrm{Myr}$ after their host halos merge. Compared to predictions using BH repositioning, the overall $z\gtrsim5$ BH merger rates under subgrid DF decrease by a factor of $\sim4-10$. Under subgrid DF, the different seed models predict merger rates between $\sim100-1000$ events per year at $z\gtrsim5$. These mergers dominate early BH growth, assembling BHs up to $\sim10^4-10^5~M_{\odot}$ by $z\sim5$, wherein $\lesssim2~\%$ of their mass is assembled via gas accretion. Our results highlight the promise for constraining seeding mechanisms using gravitational waves from future facilities such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna.

 - **Abstract**
 Most observed multi-planet systems are coplanar, in a dynamically "cold" configuration of concentric orbits like our own Solar System. With the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) we have detected 14 Her c, the first mature and cold exoplanet directly imaged in a dynamically "hot", multi-planet system. With large eccentricities and a nonzero mutual inclination, the present-day architecture of this system points to a turbulent past and ongoing angular momentum exchange between the planetary orbits of 14 Her b and c. The temperature of 14 Her c rivals both the coldest imaged exoplanet and the coldest known brown dwarf. Moreover, its photometry at 4.4 mu is consistent with the presence of carbon disequilibrium chemistry and water ice clouds in its atmosphere. 14 Her c presents a unique laboratory to study giant planet formation, dynamical evolution of multi-planet system architectures, and atmospheric composition and dynamics in extremely cold worlds.

          Improved H2-He and H2-H2 Collision-Induced Absorption Models and Application to Outer-Planet Atmospheres

 - **Abstract**
 Using state-of-the-art ab initio interaction-induced dipole and potential-energy surfaces for hydrogen-helium (H2-He) pairs, we compute the rototranslational collision-induced absorption coefficient at 40-400 K for frequencies covering 0-4000 cm-1. The quantum mechanical scattering calculations account for the full anisotropic interaction potential, replacing the isotropic approximation. The absorption data are expected to be accurate with an uncertainty of 2% or better up to 2500 cm-1. The uncertainty is slightly higher at the highest frequencies where the rototranslational absorption is largely obscured by the rovibrational band. Our improved agreement with measurements at 200-800 cm-1 results from the improvement of the potential energy surface. The previously available rototranslational data set for H2-H2 pairs (Fletcher et al., Astrophys. J. Supp. 235, 24 (2018)) is also extended up to 4000 cm-1. In the rovibrational band previous isotropic potential calculations for H2-He (Gustafsson et al. J. Chem. Physics. 113, 3641 (2000)) and H2-H2 (Borysow, Icarus 92, 273 (1992)) have been extended to complement the rototranslational data set. The absorption coefficients are tabulated for ortho-to-para ratios from normal-H2 to pure para-H2, as well as equilibrium-H2, over 40-400 K. The effect of these updates are simulated for the cold atmosphere of Uranus and warmer atmosphere of Jupiter. They are equivalent to a brightness temperature difference of a fraction of a degree in the rototranslational region but up to 4 degrees in the rovibrational region. Our state-of-the-art modifications correct an otherwise +2% error in determining the He/H2 ratio in Uranus from its spectrum alone.

          $w_{dm}$-$w_{de}$ cosmological model with new data samples of cosmological observations

 - **Abstract**
 We revisit a cosmological model where dark matter (DM) and dark energy (DE) follow barotropic equations of state, allowing deviations from the standard $\Lambda$CDM framework (i.e. $w_{dm} \neq 0$, $w_{de} \neq -1$) considering both, flat and non-flat curvature. Using a dynamical system approach, we identify equilibrium states that govern stability, expansion, and contraction. Expansion occurs when $H>0$, while contraction is linked to $H < 0$. Accelerated expansion arises from DE dominance, whereas radiation- and matter-dominated phases lead to deceleration. Some solutions are unphysical, because of density constraints, but viable cases offer insights into cosmic transitions, including the Einstein static universe, which allows shifts between accelerating and decelerating phases. We perform a Bayesian analysis with updated datasets, including observational Hubble data, Pantheon+ Type Ia supernovae, strong lensing systems, and baryon acoustic oscillations, to constrain the parameters $w_{dm}$ and $w_{de}$. Our results from the data joint analysis show consistency with $\Lambda$CDM within $3\sigma$, but none of the cases reproduce $w_{dm} = 0$ and $w_{de} = -1$. Nevertheless, the comparison with the standard model using the Akaike and Bayesian information criteria indicates that only the non-flat scenario has the potential to be competitive. This suggests that a non-dust-like DM may impact structure formation, while DE could shift toward quintessence fluid. While $\Lambda$CDM remains a strong model, our findings indicate that alternative dark sector models with non-standard EoS could be viable and offer new insights into cosmic evolution.

First, we study the growth rate, that is a scale dependent quantity, and compare our results with those of the $n=1 $ Hu-Sawcki (HS) model, finding that the Symmetron has a growth quite similar to the HS F6 in the wavenumber interval $0.01 \leq k \leq 0.1 $ and for redshifts where Symmetron model is viable. We also propose a growth parametrization that turns to be a good approximation for the HS and Symmetron models, with a deviation less than $0.6 \%$. To compute the RSD multipoles we employ an expansion of the velocity moments generating function that is suitable for general modified gravity models. Later, we apply the fk-Perturbation Theory (fkPT) approximation to reduce the computation time of nonlinear kernels, to find the fullshape galaxy power spectrum for the Symmetron, and study the differences with HS model. The RSD multipoles of the Symmetron result similar to those of the HS F6 model. Next, we integrate this theory to an MCMC sampler and validate our results by fitting our parameters to EZMocks to recover the parameters that bring the model to GR. We found a similar agreement in the model validation between Symmetron and F6 model, recovering the simulation cosmological parameters, and concluding that our pipeline is ready to make cosmological parameters' inference with real data.

 - **Abstract**
 Symbiotic star (SySt) is long-period interacting binary system, typically consisting of a white dwarf and a red giant surrounded by a nebula. These systems are natural astrophysical laboratories for investigating binary star evolution. In this paper, we identified nine SySts from the LAMOST DR10 low-resolution spectra survey, seven of which were previously known, while two are newly identified. Initially, we selected LAMOST spectra exhibiting typical SySt emission lines (e.g., $\rm H_{\alpha}, ~H_{\beta}, ~H_{\gamma}, ~and ~He II$). Subsequently, we utilized the distribution of known SySts on the HR diagram to select SySt candidates, and visually inspected their spectra. Ultimately, we classified all nine as S-type SySts using the $J - H$ vs. $H - K$ diagram. Additionally, based on multi-band photometric data from GALEX, Gaia, 2MASS, ALLWISE, and several X-ray catalogs, we found 12 accreting-only SySt (acc-SySt) candidates, characterized by concurrent ultraviolet and infrared excess and accretion process. Furthermore, we estimated the white dwarf temperatures by fitting their observed SEDs using a combination of Kurucz stellar atmosphere model and Koester white dwarf model. We compared the accretion rates of acc-SySt candidates and confirmed SySts, and found they have similar accretion rate distribution, providing evidence that these acc-SySt candidates constitute bona fide SySts.

 - **Abstract**
 Historically, there is no doubt that the early years of the USSR space program put them way ahead of the competition (the USA). Nonetheless, although this was not what the Russians wished to present to the world, the interplanetary campaign, centred around missions to the planet Venus (the Venera program) was also beset with difficulties. Many of the early Venera probes failed, despite making it to a heliocentric orbit, but naturally the success rate improved with time. The result is that there are now many Venera probes in heliocentric orbits, either completely intact, or the main bus after a successful deployment of the lander; together with the associated Blok-L upper stages. This paper is a response to some previous quite contentious research proposing that a certain member of a new class of objects, designated $2005\ VL_1$ may in fact be the Venera-2 probe. In this paper we look into the invariance of the Earth Tisserand parameter in an attempt to establish if there are indeed any members of this class which could be Venera probes. It is found, with extremely small probability, that compared to a sample of randomly chosen NEOs, members of the class of Dark Comet have an Earth Tisserand unusually close to 3, a property shared by the Venera missions. Furthermore there are particular associations of 3 Dark Comets with 3 of these probes, the most significant being $2010\ RF_{12}$ with the Venera-12 mission

 - **Abstract**
 We present a theoretical framework for the formation of X-ray linear polarization in black hole (BH) source. The X-ray linear polarization originates from up-scatterings of initially soft photons within a hot, optically thick Compton cloud (CC) characterized by a flat geometry. The IXPE observations of several BHs X-ray binaries and of one Seyfert-1 galaxy confirm our theoretical prediction regarding values of the linear polarization P. The goal of this paper is to demonstrate that the main physical parameters of these Galactic and extragalactic sources can be derived without any free parameter using the polarization and X-ray spectral measurements. We estimate the CC optical depth, {\tau}0 for all BHs observed by IXPE, using the plot of P vs {\mu} = cos i, where i is an observer inclination with respect to the normal, and considering the values P for a given source. Using X ray spectral analysis, we obtain the photon index {\Gamma} and, analytically determined the CC plasma temperature kBTe. Different BHs (Cyg X 1, 4U 1630 47, LMC X 1, 4U 1957+115, Swift J1727.8 1613, GX 339 4) and the Seyfert 1 NGC 4151 exhibited polarization between 1 and 8 percent level nearly independently of energy. kBTe is in the range between 5 and 90 keV with a smaller value in High/Soft State with respect to Low/Hard State. We find a similarity between the physical parameter and the IXPE findings and we provide evidence suggesting that the CC exhibits a flat geometry.

 - **Abstract**
 Helioseismology has revolutionized our understanding of the Sun by analyzing its global oscillation modes. However, the solar core remains elusive, limiting a full understanding of its evolution. In this work, we study a previously unnoticed global oscillation mode of the Sun using a fully compressible, hydrodynamical simulation of the solar interior, and assess that it is a mixed $f$/$g$ mode with a period of about one hour. This is the first global stellar hydrodynamics simulation that successfuly couple compressible and gravity modes. To understand this coupling, we invoke a recent theory on the nature of $f$-modes seen through the prism of wave topology, characterizing their ability to propagate deep into stellar interiors. We demonstrate that the mixed $f$/$g$ mode is highly sensitive to the core's rotation rate, providing a new promising pathway to explore the Sun's core.

          Evidence for Dual Periodic Signatures in PKS 0805-07 from Multi-technique Time Series Analysis

 - **Abstract**
 We report the identification of two statistically significant quasi-periodic oscillations in the weekly binned $\gamma$-ray light curve of the flat-spectrum radio quasar PKS 0805$-$07, observed by Fermi-LAT over the period MJD 59047.5-59740.5. By applying a suite of complementary time-series analysis techniques, we identify periodic signatures at approximately 255 and 112 days. These techniques include the Lomb-Scargle periodogram (LSP), Weighted Wavelet Z-transform (WWZ), REDFIT, Date-Compensated Discrete Fourier Transform (DCDFT), Phase Dispersion Minimization (PDM), and the String-length method. The reliability of these signals is supported by high local significance (> 99) in all methods and reinforced through phase-folding. Model selection using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) strongly supports a two-component periodic model. The detection of dual QPOs is rare among blazars and suggests complex variability mechanisms. Although a binary supermassive black hole (SMBH) scenario could be considered given the sources high redshift (z = 1.837), the short periodicities are difficult to reconcile with orbital motion unless invoking extreme parameters. Double-sine model fitting reveals that the oscillatory components have comparable amplitudes but are out of phase, suggesting a potential beating phenomenon due to interference. This amplitude-modulated variability is consistent with a geometric origin, most plausibly jet precession driven by Lense-Thirring torques, superimposed with a secondary process such as polar jet oscillation. Doppler factor modulation arising from these effects can account for the observed flux variations without requiring an unrealistically compact binary.

          The intermediate-mass black hole 2XMM J123103.2+110648: a varying disc accretion rate during possible X-ray quasi-periodic eruptions?

 - **Abstract**
 We fit the evolving X-ray spectra of the variable and fading source 2XMM J123103.2+110648 (J1231), which is an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) candidate. Recent X-ray timing studies have proposed that J1231's quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) observed at the peak of its X-ray lightcurve is a variant of the quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) observed in other sources. Here, we fit X-ray spectra from XMM-Newton, Swift, and Chandra using a slim disc model for the black hole's accretion disc, obtaining a best-fit black hole mass of ($6\pm3)\times10^{4}$ $M_\odot$ and spin of $>0.6$ at 2$\sigma$ confidence. This mass is consistent with past estimates, supporting the IMBH interpretation, and the spin measurement is new. Yet the nature of J1231 remains uncertain: its long-term variability (decade-long continuum evolution) could signal a tidal disruption event or active galactic nuclear variability. We find that the spectral evolution within the first three years after the source's detection can be well explained by either a varying disc accretion rate $\dot m$ or a varying disc inclination $\theta$. Meanwhile, we find that during the short-term variability (the QPO with a ~3.8hr period), each oscillation does not show the "hard-rise-soft-decay" typical of QPEs. We fit the average spectrum at the QPO lightcurve maxima and the average spectrum at its minima, finding that the spectral difference is well explained by $\dot m$ decreasing from peaks to valleys if $\theta<30^{\circ}$ and constant between all data epochs. This result suggests that the short-term QPO behaviour might also be driven by a varying disc $\dot m$.

 - **Abstract**
 The aperture photometry method is a powerful tool that enables us to study large star cluster systems efficiently. However, its accuracy depends on various factors, including the stochasticity of the stellar initial mass function and variations in the sky background. Previously, in the eighth paper of this series, we established the best achievable limits of the aperture photometry method for star cluster studies in the local universe. The aim of this study is to determine how the sky background affects the limits and applicability of the aperture photometry method in star cluster analysis. We used a large sample of star cluster models spanning the parameter space of M 31 clusters. To determine how the background affects star cluster photometry, we placed images of simulated clusters into five background fields of different stellar density from the Panchromatic $Hubble$ Andromeda Treasury (PHAT) survey and measured them using aperture photometry. We determined age and mass limits for the M 31 disc star clusters at which photometric uncertainties are low enough to enable the determination of cluster parameters using the aperture photometry method. We demonstrated that for typical-size clusters, optimal aperture diameters are of ~3 half-light radii. We assessed cluster detection completeness in relation to varying sky background densities, based on the M 31 PHAT survey data. Our results suggest that a significant selection bias towards more compact clusters may exist in the PHAT survey. We derived low-mass limits of the cluster mass function (CMF) in the PHAT survey, reaching down to masses of ~500 $M_\odot$ in outer disc areas, ~1500 $M_\odot$ in middle disc or star-forming regions, and ~3000 $M_\odot$ in inner disc regions. Therefore, we stress a necessity of careful accounting for selection effects arising due to sky background variations when studying the CMF.

 - **Abstract**
 Accurate theoretical prediction for halo mass function across a broad cosmological space is crucial for the forthcoming China Space Station Telescope (CSST) observations, which will capture cosmological information from multiple probes, e.g., cluster abundance, and weak lensing. In this work, we quantify the percent-level impact of different mass binning schemes when measuring the differential halo mass function from simulations, and demonstrate that the cumulative form of the halo mass function is independent of the binning scheme. Through the recently finished Kun simulation suite, we propose a generalized framework to construct multiple accurate halo mass function emulators for different halo mass definitions, including $M_{200m}$, $M_{vir}$, and $M_{200c}$. This extends our CSST Emulator to provide fast and accurate halo mass function predictions for halo mass $M\geq 10^{12}\,h^{-1}M_{\odot}$ up to $z=3.0$. For redshifts $z\leq 1.0$, the accuracy is within $2\%$ for $M\leq 10^{13}\,h^{-1}M_{\odot}$, $5\%$ for $M\leq 10^{14}\,h^{-1}M_{\odot}$, and $10\%$ for $M\leq 10^{15}\,h^{-1}M_{\odot}$, which is comparable with the statistical errors of training simulations. This tool is integrated in CSST Emulator and publicly available at this https URL.

 - **Abstract**
 The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is active in multi-messenger follow-ups of Gravitational Wave (GW) events. Since the release of the Gravitational Wave Transient Catalogue (GWTC)-2.1 by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) collaboration, sub-threshold GW candidates have been made publicly available. However, they were not followed up in real-time to search for neutrino counterparts. For a deeper understanding of these sub-threshold candidates, archival searches are essential. Finding evidence for a neutrino counterpart will enhance the astrophysical significance of these sub-threshold GW candidates and improve their localisation. Additionally, it will aid in better understanding possible thresholds on specific GW parameters, beyond which the sub-threshold GW candidates could also be promising multi-messenger sources. Thus, the search contributes to the ongoing efforts to establish correlations between astrophysical neutrinos and GW sources. Here, we present the current status of this ongoing work with the IceCube neutrino data.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a catalog of 8,440 candidate very metal-poor (VMP; [Fe/H] < -2.0) main-sequence turn-off (MSTO) and red giant stars in the Milky Way, identified from low-resolution spectra in LAMOST DR10. More than 7,000 of these candidates are brighter than G ~ 16, making them excellent targets for high-resolution spectroscopic follow-up with 4-10 meter-class telescopes. Unlike most previous studies, we employed an empirical calibration to estimate metallicities from the equivalent widths (EWs) of the Calcium Triplet (CaT) lines, taking advantage of the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the red arm of LAMOST spectra. We further refined this calibration to improve its reliability for more distant stars. This method enables robust identification of VMP candidates with metallicities as low as [Fe/H] = -4.0 among both MSTO and red giant stars. Comparisons with metal-poor samples from other spectroscopic surveys and high-resolution follow-up observations confirm the accuracy of our estimates, showing a typical median offset of ~0.1 dex and a standard deviation of ~0.2 dex.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the Virtual Research Assistant (VRA) of the ATLAS sky survey which performs preliminary eyeballing on our clean transient data stream. The VRA uses Histogram Based Gradient Boosted Decision Tree Classifiers trained on real data to score incoming alerts on two axes: "Real" and "Galactic". The alerts are then ranked using a geometric distance such that the most "Real" and "Extra-galactic" receive high scores; the scores are updated when new light curve data is obtained on subsequent visits. To assess the quality of the training we use the Recall at rank K, which is more informative to our science goal than general metrics such as accuracy or F1-Scores. We also establish benchmarks for our metric based on the pre-VRA eyeballing strategy, to ensure our models provide notable improvements before being added to the ATLAS pipeline. Finally, policies are defined on the ranked list to select the most promising alerts for humans to eyeball and to automatically remove the bogus alerts. In production the VRA method has resulted in a reduction in eyeballing workload by 85% with a loss of follow-up opportunity <0.08%. It also allows us to automatically trigger follow-up observations with the Lesedi telescope, paving the way to automated methods that will be required in the era of LSST.

 The Surface Array Enhancement of the IceCube Neutrino Observatory is set to equip the existing surface cosmic-ray array of ice-Cherenkov detectors, IceTop, with radio antennas and scintillation detectors. This can lower the energy threshold of detection and increase the measurement accuracy of IceTop. The antenna readout uses a multiplicity trigger from the scintillation detectors. A fully functioning prototype station of the enhancement was deployed at the South Pole in 2020 and upgraded in 2023, and provides a pathway for the future IceCube-Gen2 surface array detector. Previous results include air-shower searches with existing data using traditional and machine learning methods and a preliminary estimation of $X_\mathrm{max}$. The detection methods for radio involving multi-detector components are described and the latest results are presented.

 - **Abstract**
 The nature of dark matter remains one of the most fundamental and unresolved questions in modern cosmology. In most cosmological models, dark matter is typically modeled as pressureless dust with an equation of state (EoS) parameter $w_{\rm dm} = 0$. However, there is no fundamental theoretical reason to exclude the possibility of a non-zero dark matter EoS parameter. In this work, we explore the possibility of a non-zero dark matter EoS within the phenomenologically emergent dark energy (PEDE) model, given its simplicity and proven ability to alleviate the Hubble tension. We perform observational constraints by using the latest baryon acoustic oscillation data from DESI DR2, the cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from Planck, and the type Ia supernova data from DESY5 and PantheonPlus. From our analysis, we observe that a negative dark matter EoS parameter is preferred in all scenarios. Specifically, the CMB+DESI+DESY5 data yields $w_{\mathrm{dm}} = -0.00093 \pm 0.00032$, deviating from zero at approximately the $3\sigma$ level. However, this deviation is likely driven by unidentified systematics or inconsistencies in the DESY5 data, with the deviation decreasing to $2\sigma$ when using PantheonPlus data. Meanwhile, a negative $w_{\rm dm}$ would increase the Hubble tension due to the positive degeneracy between $w_{\rm dm}$ and $H_0$. Furthermore, Bayesian evidence suggests that the $\Lambda$CDM model is strongly preferred over the PEDE+$w_{\rm dm}$ model. These analyses illustrate that it is not possible to both support a non-cold dark matter component within the PEDE model and alleviate the Hubble tension simultaneously.

 - **Abstract**
 The Sun is a powerful source of radio emissions, so much so that, unlike most celestial sources, this emission can dominate the system noise of radio telescopes. We outline the theory of noise in maps formed by Fourier synthesis techniques at radio wavelengths, with a focus on self-noise: that is, noise due to the source itself. As a means of developing intuition we consider noise for the case of a single dish, a two-element interferometer, and an n-element array for simple limiting cases. We then turn to the question of the distribution of noise on a map of an arbitrary source observed at radio wavelengths by an n-element interferometric array. We consider the implications of self-noise for observations of the Sun in a companion paper.

 Noise in images of strong celestial sources at radio wavelengths using Fourier synthesis arrays can be dominated by the source itself, so-called self-noise. We outlined the theory of self-noise for strong sources in a companion paper. Here we consider the case of noise in maps of radio emission from the Sun which, as we show, is always dominated by self noise. We consider several classes of science use cases for current and planned arrays designed to observe the Sun in order to understand limitations imposed by self-noise. We focus on instruments operating at decimeter and centimeter wavelengths but the results are applicable to other wavelength regimes.

 - **Abstract**
 XPoSat is India's first X-ray spectro-polarimetry mission, consisting of two co-aligned instruments, a polarimeter (POLIX) and a spectrometer (XSPECT), to study the X-ray emission from celestial sources. Since polarimetry is a photon-hungry technique, the mission is designed to observe sources for long integration times (~ few days to weeks). This provides an unique opportunity, enabling XSPECT to carry out long-term monitoring of sources, and study their spectro-temporal evolution. To ensure that the instrument is able to fulfill its scientific objectives, it was extensively calibrated on-ground. Post launch, these calibrations were validated using on-board observations. Additionally, some aspects of the instrument such as alignment and effective area were also derived and fine-tuned from in-flight data. In this paper, we describe the calibration of XSPECT instrument in detail, including some initial results derived from its data to establish its capabilities.

 - **Abstract**
 The Milky Way is home to a thin disk that can be defined via kinematics and/or elemental abundances. The elemental abundance-defined thin disk, also called the low-alpha disk, is generally thought to be comprised of stars on planar, circular orbits that approximate the circular velocity curve. While this is an apt description for the majority of stars with thin-disk-like abundances, there are a number of interesting exceptions. In this analysis, we identify and investigate $\sim 70$ stars with thin-disk-like abundances and very slow or retrograde Galactocentric azimuthal velocities. These stars could be kinematical outliers of the thin disk or elemental abundance outliers of the halo. Focusing first on the former, we introduce a number of mechanisms that could alter a thin disk orbit and cause the azimuthal velocity to become slow or retrograde. We then determine signatures for each mechanism and assess whether that mechanism is unlikely, plausible, or consistent given each star's reported properties. We find that at least one mechanism is plausible for each star, and the mechanism with the highest number of consistent candidate stars is dynamical ejection from stellar clusters. We next discuss scenarios that could produce halo stars with thin disk abundances, and again identify stars that could be connected to these mechanisms. With this sample we investigate rare processes, such as binary disruption by the central supermassive black hole, while also providing a unique perspective into the chemo-dynamics and structural components of the Milky Way.

 - **Abstract**
 Mechanisms such as collisions of rocky bodies or cometary activity give rise to dusty debris disks. Debris disks trace the leftover building blocks of planets, and thus also planetary composition. HD 172555, a stellar twin of beta Pic, hosts a debris disk thought to have resulted from a giant collision. It is known for its extreme mid-infrared silica dust feature, indicating a warm population of silica-rich grains in the asteroid belt (~5 au), cold CO observed by ALMA, and small bodies evaporating as they approach close to the star. Our JWST MIRI/MRS observations now reveal emission from an inner gaseous disk (<0.5 au) that arises from the evaporation of close-in material. For the first time in a debris disk, we detect neutral atomic chlorine and sulfur, as well as ionized nickel. We recovered the neutral sulfur line in ~20-year-old Spitzer data, showing it is long-lived and stable. Ionized iron, previously seen only in beta Pic, is also detected. All lines are broadened by Keplerian rotation, pinpointing the gas location. The HD 172555 system serves as a unique laboratory to study the composition of planetesimals, asteroids, and comets beyond the Solar System. The comparison to beta Pic reveals, that the gas in HD 172555 is hotter, closer to the star, and poor in argon -- suggesting it originates from evaporating rocky bodies near the star, while beta Pic's gas may trace volatile-rich bodies from larger separations.

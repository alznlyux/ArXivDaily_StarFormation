 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we examined the nearby open clusters (OCs) Alessi 36 and Collinder 135. Their spatial proximity was assessed using photometric and astrometric data from \textit{Gaia} DR3. Likely member stars were identified based on a membership probability threshold ($P \geq 0.5$), yielding 230 members for Alessi 36 and 342 members for Collinder 135. The mean proper-motion components ($\mu_\alpha \cos\delta, \mu_\delta$) were determined as $(-9.681 \pm 0.072, 7.021 \pm 0.081)$ mas yr$^{-1}$ for Alessi 36 and $(-10.061 \pm 0.083, 6.256 \pm 0.095)$ mas yr$^{-1}$ for Collinder 135. The parallax-based distances ($d$) were found to be $278 \pm 7$ and $299 \pm 11$ pc, while their estimated ages ($t$) were $39 \pm 5$ and $36 \pm 5$ Myr for Alessi 36 and Collinder 135, respectively. The Galactic orbital analysis of Alessi 36 and Collinder 135 reveals nearly circular orbits with low eccentricities and minor fluctuations in their apogalactic and perigalactic distances. The maximum heights they attain above the Galactic plane are $0.035 \pm 0.001$ kpc for Alessi 36 and $0.074 \pm 0.003$ kpc for Collinder 135, supporting their classification as part of the young stellar disc population.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a detailed radio study of the tidal disruption events (TDEs) AT 2020zso and AT 2021sdu. Both exhibit transient radio emission beginning shortly after optical discovery and persisting for several years. For AT 2020zso, we identify two distinct radio flares. The first arises soon after the optical peak, reaching a maximum $\sim1$ year post-discovery before fading. The second flare appears $\sim800$ days after discovery and results in the brief presence of two distinct components in the radio spectra, providing strong evidence for physically separate outflows. Both flares are consistent with non-relativistic outflows, with velocities $v\approx0.1-0.2c$ and energies $E\sim10^{49}$ erg, propagating through a Bondi-like circumnuclear medium. Our analysis supports a scenario in which the first outflow is accretion-driven, launched while the TDE disk is accreting at a relatively high Eddington fraction, whereas the second outflow is associated with a transition to an advection-dominated accretion flow. In contrast, the radio emission from AT 2021sdu is best explained by a slower ($v\approx0.03c$), less energetic outflow ($E\sim10^{48}$ erg), combined with diffuse, non-variable host emission that becomes dominant $\sim500$ days after discovery. Assuming free expansion, we infer an outflow launch date preceding the optical discovery date. This suggests that the outflow may originate from either the unbound stellar debris ejected during disruption or, alternatively, from a decelerating outflow. Our findings demonstrate the diversity of outflow properties in TDEs and highlight the observational challenges of interpreting late-time radio variability in the presence of host galaxy contamination.

 - **Abstract**
 JWST has revealed sulfur chemistry in giant exoplanet atmospheres, where molecules such as SO2 trace photochemistry, metallicity, and formation and migration. To ascertain the conditions that determine whether (or how much) SO2, H2S, and other sulfur-bearing species are present in exoplanet atmospheres, we present a grid of planetary atmospheres covering metallicities from 0.3-1000x Solar and temperatures from 250-2050 K. These models map out the 'SO2 shoreline,' the region of metallicity and irradiation for which SO2 may be sufficiently abundant to be detectable. SO2 is a sensitive indicator of metallicity; expected SO2 abundances also depend strongly on overall temperature and C/O ratio; the SO2 abundance depends surprisingly weakly on XUV irradiation, also weakly on Kzz (for Teq > 600 K), and is essentially independent of internal temperature. Despite its detection in a growing number of giant planets, SO2 is never the dominant sulfur-bearing molecule: depending on temperature and metallicity, H2S, S2, NS, SO, SH, and even S8 or atomic S are frequently as common (or more so) as SO2. Nonetheless SO2 remains the most easily detectable sulfur-bearing species, followed by H2S, though perhaps SO and SH could be detectable in some gas giants. Aside from a pressing need for additional observational constraints on sulfur, we also identify the need for future work to account for the effects of clouds and hazes, fully self-consistent atmospheric models, 2D and 3D models, a wider range of planetary masses and radii, and studies to measure and refine reaction rates and molecular opacities of sulfur-bearing species

 - **Abstract**
 We present new VLTI/GRAVITY astrometry and updated orbit fits for the directly imaged companions YSES 1 b and HR 2562 B, substellar objects straddling the planet-brown dwarf boundary. Using high-precision astrometry, radial velocity (RV) data, and proper motions, we derive revised orbital parameters with orbitize! arXiv:1910.01756. For YSES 1 b, the inclusion of GRAVITY astrometry and a relative radial velocity measurement from arXiv:2409.16660 overcomes the traditional challenge of constraining eccentricities for distant companions, enabling the first orbit fit and yielding a constrained eccentricity of 0.44 (0.20). This represents the first full orbit fit for the system. Additionally, we calculate a median line-of-sight stellar obliquity of 12 (+11, -8) degrees, providing further insight into the system's dynamical architecture. For HR 2562 B, our analysis agrees with arXiv:2302.04893, confirming a low-eccentricity orbit (0.34 (0.20)) and an inclination of 87 (1) degrees. We find HR 2562 B's orbit to be nearly coplanar with the debris disk, with a mutual inclination of 3.7 (0.3) degrees. For both YSES 1 b and HR 2562 B the lower eccentricities favor an in situ formation scenario over extreme scattering or cloud fragmentation.

 - **Abstract**
 The standard cosmological analysis with the Ly$\alpha$ forest relies on a continuum fitting procedure that suppresses information on large scales and distorts the three-dimensional correlation function on all scales. In this work, we present the first cosmological forecasts without continuum fitting distortion in the Ly$\alpha$ forest, focusing on the recovery of large-scale information. Using idealized synthetic data, we compare the constraining power of the full shape of the Ly$\alpha$ forest auto-correlation and its cross-correlation with quasars using the baseline continuum fitting analysis versus the true continuum. We find that knowledge of the true continuum enables a $\sim10\%$ reduction in uncertainties on the Alcock-Paczyński (AP) parameter and the matter density, $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$. We also explore the impact of large-scale information by extending the analysis up to separations of $240\,h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$ along and across the line of sight. The combination of these analysis choices can recover significant large-scale information, yielding up to a $\sim15\%$ improvement in AP constraints. This improvement is analogous to extending the Ly$\alpha$ forest survey area by $\sim40\%$.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the status and goals of the readout electronics system we are developing to support the detector arrays in the coronagraph instrument on the NASA Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) mission currently in development. HWO aims to revolutionize exoplanet exploration by performing direct imaging and spectroscopy of 25 or more habitable exoplanets, and to resolve a broad range of astrophysics science questions as well. Since exoplanet yield depends critically on the detector dark count rate, as we show in this paper, the ambitious goals of HWO require arrays of single-photon energy-resolving detectors. We argue that Kinetic Inductance Detectors (KIDs) are best suited to meet these requirements. To support the detectors required for HWO and future far-IR missions, at the required power consumption and detector count, we are developing a radiation-tolerant reconfigurable readout system for both imaging and energy-resolving single photon KID detector arrays. We leverage an existing RFSoC-based system we built for NASA balloons that has a power consumption of 30 Watts and reads out 2000-4000 detectors (i.e. 7-15 mW/pixel), and move to a radiation tolerant Kintex Ultrascale FPGA chip to bring low-power wide bandwidth readout to a space-qualified platform for the first time. This improves significantly over previous spaceflight systems, and delivers what is required for NASA's future needs: ~100,000 pixels with less than 1 kW total power consumption. Overall, the system we are developing is a significant step forward in capability, and retires many key risks for the Habitable Worlds Observatory mission.

 - **Abstract**
 A nova super-remnant (NSR) is a greatly-extended structure grown by repeated nova eruptions sweeping the surrounding material away from a nova into a dense outer shell and are predicted to form around all novae. To date, four NSRs are known, with three located in the Galaxy and one residing in M31. Here we present the discovery of the first NSR in the Large Magellanic Cloud and only the second extragalactic nova shell to be identified, hosted by the recurrent nova LMCN 1971-08a. The structure is coincident with the nova, has a circular morphology and is visible in narrowband H$\alpha$ and [S II] filters but very faint in [O III], as expected. HI data also potentially reveal the existence of a coincident structure. Further, with a diameter of ${\sim}200$ pc, this NSR is the largest example yet found, with models indicating an ${\sim}4130 \ \text{M}_{\odot}$ shell expanding at ${\sim}20 \ \text{km} \ \text{s}^{-1}$ into the surrounding medium and an age of $\sim$2.4 Myr. The existence of the NSR also suggests that LMCN 1971-08a may have a much shorter recurrence period than currently presumed.

 - **Abstract**
 Stars exhibit a range of variability periods that depend on their mass, age, and evolutionary stage. For space-based photometric data, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated success in recovering and measuring periodic variability from photometric missions like Kepler and TESS. All-sky ground-based surveys can have similar if not longer baselines than space-based missions, however these datasets are more challenging to work with due to irregular sampling, more complex systematics, and larger data gaps. In this work, we demonstrate that CNNs can be used to derive variability periods from ground-based surveys. From the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN) we recover 208,260 variability periods between 1-30 days, approximately 60% of which are new detections. We recover periods for active RSCVn, anomalous sub-subgiants, and cool dwarfs that are consistent with previously measured rotation periods, while periods for stars above the Kraft break are generally spurious. We also identify periodic signals in tens of thousands of giants stars which correspond to frequencies of stellar oscillations rather than rotation. Our results highlight that CNNs can be used on sparsely sampled ground-based photometry and may prove useful for upcoming observations from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST).

 - **Abstract**
 For the first time in nearly a decade, a new, bright transient was detected in the central parsec (pc) of the Galaxy. MAXI J1744-294 was never observed in outburst prior to January 2025. We present the results of a broadband, multi-wavelength study of this enigmatic source, including data from the NuSTAR, Chandra, XMM-Newton, Swift, and NICER X-ray telescopes, as well as complementary radio and near-infrared observations. We find that MAXI J1744-294 remained in the bright/soft state throughout the first months of 2025. Spectral hardening was observed in April 2025, followed by a decline in flux. Based on the spectral and temporal characteristics of the source, we identify MAXI J1744-294 as a candidate black hole (BH) low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) $-$ the fourth candidate BH transient discovered within a (projected) distance of one pc from the Galactic supermassive black hole Sgr A*. This discovery provides further evidence for a cusp of BH-LMXBs in the central pc of our Galaxy, as argued for in previous observational work and suggested by analytical and theoretical work. Our multi wavelength study, involving a complementary range of observatories and spanning different outburst states, can serve as a model for future time domain astrophysics research.

          First Detection of X-ray Polarization and Its Short-term Increase Pre- and Post-Eclipse in HMXB 4U 1700-377

 - **Abstract**
 We report the first statistically significant detection of X-ray polarization from the high-mass X-ray binary (HMXB) 4U 1700-377, observed using the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE). A polarization degree exceeding 10% was detected above 5 keV, placing it among the highest polarization observed in HMXBs to date. The observation was conducted over a full orbital period of the binary system, during which several sporadic and instantaneous flares were detected. We identify a clear correlation between the polarization degree and orbital phase, with the highest polarization occurring just before and after the eclipse, reaching over 20% for a few tens of ks. These results suggest that the scattering medium responsible for the observed polarization is spatially localized between the compact object and the O-type companion star, likely created by large-scale inhomogeneities in the stellar wind and its interaction with the compact star's emission. We also explore the roles of disk winds and orbital reflection in the observed polarization variability. While both mechanisms contribute to the polarization, the substantial increase in polarization before and after the eclipse cannot be fully explained by these models alone, suggesting that the involvement of additional factors. The properties of the X-ray polarization observed by IXPE provide new insights into the accretion processes, X-ray emission, and wind structure in 4U 1700-377, advancing our understanding of their complex environments and the nature of the compact objects within.

 - **Abstract**
 SPHEREx, a recently launched astronomy mission, detected a bright 1.083 micron emission feature in the commissioning data. The PI group attributed this feature to the He I 1.0833 micron triplet line. Here, I review the physics and aeronomy of this well-known line of atmospheric origin. SPHEREx is in a dawn-dusk sun-synchronous polar orbit, circling the earth nearly 15 times a day and observing close to the terminator plane. With a height of 650 km, SPHEREx is located in the upper thermosphere that is dominated by atomic oxygen and helium. The He I line is a result of resonance scattering of solar photons by metastable helium atoms. It appears that SPHEREx has the capacity to provide a rich dataset (global, daily, and 2-minute cadence) of column density of metastable helium in the upper thermosphere. As an example of this assertion, with data from just one orbit, the winter helium bulge was readily seen. Rapid variations in the column density of metastable helium is seen over the south pole which is probably due to spatial structure in the distribution of metastable helium as well as solar activity. Helium in the thermosphere is of considerable interest to operators of low-earth orbiting (LEO) satellites, since drag in the thermosphere is the primary cause of the decay of these satellites. SPHEREx, along with on-going ground-based studies (passive NIR spectroscopy, lidar, incoherent scatter radar), is poised to contribute to this topic.

 - **Abstract**
 The Compton camera is a gamma-ray imaging device developed in the 1970s. In the 1990s, the COMPTEL detector onboard the CGRO was the first to utilize a Compton camera for MeV all-sky survey observations. Recently, various Compton cameras have been developed using scintillators, semiconductors, and gas detectors, some of which are intended for future small satellite missions as well as medical applications. However, the image obtained by a Compton camera has strong artifacts owing to the overlap of the Compton cones or the arcs, which degrade the resolution and sensitivity of the image. In this study, we revisit the adaptive ARM cut that significantly reduces artifacts when the direction of gamma ray emitting source is already known. This approach complements the statistically well-defined method based on the response function in the three-dimensional data space of scattering direction (\chi, \psi) and scattering angle \theta, but it is more direct, intuitive, and simplifies the extraction of spectra in astronomical observations of point-like sources. Using a Compton camera, INSPIRE, onboard the ultra-small satellite GRAPHIUM as an example, we numerically evaluated the extent of background reduction to estimate simulation-based sensitivity. The method was also applied to actual measurements using a quarter-scale prototype of INSPIRE to extract spectra from multiple sources within the same field of view.

 - **Abstract**
 How do planetary systems, in general, and our own Solar System (SS), in particular, form? In conjunction, Astronomy and Isotope Cosmochemistry provide us with powerful tools to answer this age-old question. In this contribution, we review recent advances in our understanding of circumstellar disk evolution, including infall and disk processes, as explored through astrophysical models and nucleosynthetic isotope anomalies of SS materials. Astronomically, filamentary structures and anisotropy are observed across the dynamic range of star formation and disk substructures are found to be ubiquitous, highlighting how star- and planet-forming environments are far more complex and dynamic than previously thought. Isotopically, two decades of investigation of nucleosynthetic anomalies in bulk meteorites and refractory inclusions have produced a rich dataset, revealing the existence of pervasive heterogeneity in the early SS, both at the large- (i.e., NC-CC dichotomy) and fine-scale (i.e., trends within the NC group). Using an updated data compilation, we review the systematics and emerging structures of these anomalies as a function of their nucleosynthetic origin. We present the two main families of models - inheritance vs. unmixing - that have been proposed to explain the origin of the observed isotope heterogeneities, and discuss their respective implications for cloud infall and thermal processing in the disk. We also discuss how the extension of nucleosynthetic anomaly analyses to other chondritic components (Ameboid Olivine Aggregates, chondrules, matrix) has started to yield insights into transport, processing and mixing of dust in the disk. Limitations, open questions and key avenues for future work are presented in closing.

 Planetary nebulae are sites where ejected stellar material evolves into complex molecules, but the precise physical conditions and chemical routes that govern these processes are unclear. The presence of abundant carbon-rich molecules in O-rich environments poses particular challenges. Here we report the first detection of methyl cation (CH3+) in any planetary nebula, observed in the O-rich nebula NGC 6302 using JWST MIRI/MRS observations. CH3+ is a key driver of organic chemistry in UV-irradiated environments. Spatially resolved observations reveal that CH3+ is co-located with 12CO, H2, H II, HCO+, and Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). LTE modelling of the CH3+ emission yields excitation temperatures of 500-800K in the inner bubble and torus, rising to 1000-2000K in the outer bubble of NGC 6302, with column densities ranging from ~10^11 to 10^13 cm^-2. This detection demonstrates that hydrocarbon radical chemistry must be incorporated into planetary nebulae chemical models. Further near-IR observations are crucial to map different chemical networks operating in these environments.

 - **Abstract**
 The Multi-Channel Imager (MCI) is a powerful near-ultraviolet (NUV) and visible imager onboard the Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST). The MCI provides three imaging channels, which are the NUV channel, the Optical-blue channel and the Optical-red channel, with the wavelength range of 255-430 nm, 430-700 nm, and 700-1000 nm, respectively. The three channels can target the same field simultaneously. Each channel employs a CCD focal plane of 9216 x 9232 pixels and $\sim$7.5 x 7.5 arcmin$^2$ field of view. The MCI's three channels feature unprecedented sensitivities and field of views, as well as rich filter sets, which complements the NUV and visible capabilities of the CSST for the high-precision photometry, the weak-signal detection, and the related sciences. Here we present key design features, results of current ground tests, and suggested observing strategies of the MCI.

 - **Abstract**
 As a characteristic feature of the spectrum, the emission line carries critical information on the underlying physics of the radiation. After extensive efforts in decades, the first high-significant detection of a series of emission lines evolving from 37 MeV to 6 MeV has been detected in the ever-bright gamma-ray burst GRB 221009A. However, the physical mechanism of the entire evolutionary trend of the lines remains elusive. To provide a self-consistent interpretation, we propose a novel scenario in which the photons of the line undergo a radiation transfer process called down-Comptonization after generation by the electron--positron pair annihilation. By incorporating the gamma-ray burst dynamical evolution, we systematically reproduce the observed evolution of the central energy, width, and flux of the emission line and further impose stringent constraints on the production of high-energy emission lines in general. Our study provides a new direction to the research of extreme cosmic bursts.

 - **Abstract**
 Isocurvature perturbations expected from multi-field inflation models can leave unique signatures in the early Universe, but remain weakly constrained, especially on small scales. In this work, we investigate the constraining power of one-point statistics (variance and skewness) of the 21cm brightness temperature during Cosmic Dawn and the Epoch of Reionization, using semi-numerical simulations from 21cmFAST. We model both adiabatic and cold dark matter isocurvature modes, exploring their impact on the matter power spectrum, the timing of structure formation, and the evolution of neutral hydrogen. By varying astrophysical parameters as well as isocurvature fraction and spectral index, we quantify their respective effects on the 21cm power spectrum and on one-point statistics. Our results show that while variance is highly sensitive to the timing of cosmic events and provides tight constraints on isocurvature parameters, skewness is more strongly affected by astrophysical uncertainties and observational noise. Incorporating realistic instrumental noise based on SKA configurations, we perform a Fisher analysis and demonstrate that 21cm variance measurements can constrain the isocurvature fraction down to the sub-percent level, though a strong degeneracy with the spectral index remains. We discuss the importance of complementary probes, such as the 21cm forest and galaxy surveys, to break these parameter degeneracies. Our findings highlight the power of 21cm one-point statistics as robust and independent tools for probing early-Universe physics beyond what is accessible with traditional power spectrum analyses.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the effects of Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) on photon interactions, considering both intergalactic propagation (Breit-Wheeler process) and atmospheric interactions (Bethe-Heitler process). By incorporating LIV into the theoretical framework, we analyze how it modifies key quantities such as the cross section, threshold energy, and mean free path of photons traveling through intergalactic space. In addition, we study its impact on extensive air showers initiated by high-energy photons, demonstrating that LIV can alter the cross section of the primary interaction in the atmosphere. Additionally, we also test the photon interactions in the Earth crust, to evaluate if they can induce upward-going showers. Our results highlight the necessity of accounting for both propagation effects in intergalactic space and interactions in the atmosphere when evaluating LIV signatures. Even small deviations from Lorentz invariance can lead to measurable changes in astroparticle propagation and photon dynamics, offering new opportunities to test quantum gravity theories through high-energy astrophysical observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Diffuse emission in gamma-rays and neutrinos are produced by the interaction of cosmic rays with the interstellar medium. Below some hundreds of TeV, the sources of these cosmic rays are most likely Galactic. Hence, observations of high-energy gamma-rays and neutrinos can be used to probe the flux of cosmic rays in other parts of the Galaxy. Supernova remnants are usually considered as the prime candidate for the acceleration of Galactic cosmic rays. They inject cosmic rays in a point-like and specific time-dependent manner. As the precise positions and ages of the sources are not known, predictions must be obtained in a stochastic model. At GeV energies, the distribution of sources can be approximated with a smoothly varying spatial and temporal source density. At hundreds of TeV, however, the point-like nature matters as less sources contribute effectively due to shorter escape times. We have modelled diffuse emissions at hundreds of TeV, relevant for measurements by LHAASO, Tibet AS-gamma, IceCube, and the upcoming SWGO, as well as at tens of GeV, as measured by Fermi-LAT. This reveals the distinctive nature of diffuse emissions at the respective energies which can likely be used to constrain source models and locate cosmic ray sources.

 - **Abstract**
 Sub-Neptunes are absent in the Solar System, yet they are commonly found in our Galaxy. They challenge the internal structure models and prompt investigation on their formation, evolution, and atmospheres. We report the characterisation of new sub-Neptunes orbiting two similar M dwarfs, TOI-521 (T_eff=3544 K), and TOI-912 (T_eff=3572 K). Both stars host a candidate identified by TESS and are part of the THIRSTEE follow-up program, which aims at understanding the sub-Neptune population through precise characterisation studies on a population level. We analysed light curves, ground-based photometry and ESPRESSO, HARPS and IRD RVs to infer precise orbital and physical parameters. The two stars host nearly identical planets in terms of mass and radius. TOI-521 b is a transiting sub-Neptune in a 1.5-d orbit with radius and mass of R=1.98+/-0.14 R_e and M=5.3+/-1.0 M_e respectively. Moreover, we identified an additional candidate at 20.3 d, with a minimum mass of Msini=10.7+/-2.4 M_e currently not detected to transit. Similarly, TOI-912 b is a 4.7-d sub-Neptune with R=1.93+/-0.13 R_e and M=5.1+/-0.5 M_e. Interestingly, TOI-912 b likely has an unusually high eccentricity (e=0.58+/-0.02), and it is probably undergoing strong tidal dissipation. If such eccentricity is confirmed, it would make it one of the most eccentric sub-Neptunes known to date. TOI-521 b and TOI-912 b have very similar densities (4 g/cm^3) and they lie in the degenerate region of the mass-radius diagram where different compositions are plausible, including a volatile-rich composition, or a rocky core surrounded by a H-He envelope. Our sample supports the division of sub-Neptunes into two distinct populations divided by a density gap. Both planets are interesting targets for atmospheric follow-up in the context of understanding the temperature-atmospheric feature trend that starts to emerge thanks to JWST observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Population III (or Pop. III) stars, the first stellar generation built up from metal-free primordial gas, first started to form at redshifts z ~ 30. They formed primarily in small dark matter halos with masses of a few million solar masses. The cooling of the gas in these halos was dominated on all scales by molecular hydrogen. Current theoretical models indicate that Pop. III stars typically formed in small clusters with a logarithmically flat mass function due to widespread fragmentation in the protostellar accretion disks around these primordial stars. Massive Pop. III stars are thought to have played a pivotal role in shaping the early Universe, as their feedback regulates subsequent star formation, although the immediate effects of this feedback remain uncertain. Direct detection of Pop. III stars is challenging, but our chances of detecting at least a few Pop. III supernovae within the next decade are brighter. Indirect approaches based on stellar archaeology or gravitational wave detections offer promising constraints. Current observations suggest that most massive Pop. III stars ended their lives as core-collapse supernovae rather than pair-instability supernovae, offering insight into the initial mass function and evolutionary pathways of these primordial stars.

 - **Abstract**
 The chemical composition of diffuse interstellar clouds is not fully established. They host an active chemistry despite their relatively low density and the ubiquitous presence of far-UV radiation. To further explore the chemical composition of diffuse clouds, we performed a spectral scan toward the bright radio source BL Lac in the Q band (from 32 to 50 GHz) using the Yebes 40m telescope. Yebes observations were performed interleaving Frequency Switching and Position Switching integrations toward BL Lac, using a spectral resolution of 38 kHz. The data have been reduced with the CLASS software. We achieved an unprecedented sensitivity on the continuum of 0.02 - 0.07 %, allowing the detection of very faint absorption features. We confirm previous detections of HCS+, C3H, C3H+, CH3CN and HC3N in diffuse clouds and report new detections of CCS, C4H, CH3CHO, H2CCO , HNCO and H2CS along the line of sight to BL Lac, with abundances relative to H2 from a few 10{-11} to a few 10{-10}. We compiled molecular detections toward diffuse clouds to obtain the chemical inventory of a typical diffuse interstellar cloud. The chemical inventory of diffuse interstellar clouds includes complex organic species with up to four heavy atoms. These species are efficiently formed in the diffuse interstellar gas and reach abundances similar to those measured in dense photodissociation regions, pointing to similar gas phase chemical processes.

          The Altered Chaplygin Model as a Model for Dark Energy

 - **Abstract**
 We present a scalar-field formulation of the generalized Chaplygin gas (GCG) and modified Chaplygin gas (MCG) models, in which the cosmic fluid dynamics are reproduced by canonical Lagrangians with analytically derived energy density $\rho(\phi)$, pressure $p(\phi)$, and scalar potential $V(\phi)$. This framework provides a unified description of dark matter and dark energy, transitioning naturally from a matter-dominated phase at early times to a negative-pressure dark-energy phase at late times. In this scalar-field formulation, the GCG and MCG models are naturally applicable to both theoretical analyses and numerical simulations. Extending this approach, we develop a systematic method to obtain a class of integrable scalar-field cosmological models. In this study, we use this method to construct a new scalar-field altered Chaplygin gas (ACG) model. To investigate the viability of Chaplygin-type models, we perform a likelihood analysis using the Pantheon+ Type Ia supernova compilation together with Cepheid-calibrated distances. We examine four models, $\Lambda$CDM, GCG, MCG, and ACG, obtaining posterior constraints on the Hubble constant $H_0$, the present-day effective equation of state $\omega_0$, the transition redshift $z^\star$, and the cosmic age $t_0$. With the Cepheid calibration fixing the absolute distance scale, the inferred $H_{0}$ remains nearly model-independent. The Chaplygin-type models predict an earlier onset of cosmic acceleration than $\Lambda$CDM and give a broader range for the inferred age of the Universe, reflecting their greater flexibility in late-time expansion histories. Among them, the ACG model provides tighter parameter constraints, while the GCG and MCG models produce broader posteriors due to parameter degeneracies.

 - **Abstract**
 Supernova remnants (SNRs) are widely recognized as key accelerators of Galactic cosmic rays (CRs), supported by the detection of the characteristic pion bump in the gamma-ray spectra of several SNRs. However, the recent observation of ultra-high-energy (UHE, greater than 100 TeV) gamma-rays by LHAASO from sources such as W51 region challenges standard models, which predict CR acceleration up to PeV energies only during the early (~ 100 year) phase of SNR evolution. Given the older age of known SNRs, alternative mechanisms - such as the interaction of runaway CRs with nearby molecular clouds (MCs) - have been proposed to explain the persistent UHE emission. In this study, we focus on the W51 complex, particularly the W51C-B region, as a promising site for investigating SNR-MC interactions. Simulated observations with the CTAO and the ASTRI Mini-Array are presented to demonstrate their crucial role in bridging the energy gap between Fermi-LAT and LHAASO, especially in the 0.3-100 TeV range. Their improved angular resolution will also help disentangle emission components from the interaction zone and nearby sources. Our theoretical modelling suggests that accelerated particles at the shock can account for the radio and GeV data, while UHE emission could be best explained by the combined contribution from both acceleration and adiabatic compression of cloud material at the SNR-MC interface.

 - **Abstract**
 Characterizing the geometry of an object orbiting around a star from its transit light curve is a powerful tool to uncover various complex phenomena. This problem is inherently ill-posed, since similar or identical light curves can be produced by multiple different shapes. In this study, we investigate the extent to which the features of a shape can be embedded in a transit light curve. We generate a library of two-dimensional random shapes and simulate their transit light curves with light curve simulator, Yuti. Each shape is decomposed into a series of elliptical components expressed in the form of Fourier coefficients that adds increasingly diminishing perturbations to an ideal ellipse. We train deep neural networks to predict these Fourier coefficients directly from simulated light curves. Our results demonstrate that the neural network can successfully reconstruct the low-order ellipses, which describe overall shape, orientation and large-scale perturbations. For higher order ellipses the scale is successfully determined but the inference of eccentricity and orientation is limited, demonstrating the extent of shape information in the light curve. We explore the impact of non-convex shape features in reconstruction, and show its dependence on shape orientation. The level of reconstruction achieved by the neural network underscores the utility of using light curves as a means to extract geometric information from transiting systems.

 Context: The detection of the highest energy neutrino observed to date by KM3NeT, with an estimated energy of 220 PeV, opens up new possibilities for the study and identification of the astrophysical sources responsible for a diffuse flux of such ultra-high-energy neutrinos, among which gamma-ray bursts are longstanding candidates. Aims: Based on the event KM3-230213A, we derive constraints on the baryon loading and density of the surrounding environment in models of blastwaves in long-duration gamma-ray bursts. Methods: We compute the diffuse flux from gamma-ray burst blastwaves, either expanding in a constant density interstellar medium or developing in a radially decreasing density of a wind-like environment surrounding the gamma-ray burst progenitor star, by taking into account the expected neutrino spectra and luminosity function. We use a Poisson likelihood method to constrain the blastwave model parameters by calculating the expected number of neutrino events within the 90% confidence level energy range of KM3-230213A and by using the joint exposure of KM3NeT/ARCA, IceCube and Pierre Auger. Results: We constrain the baryon loading to be $\leq \{392, 131, 39, 13\}$ at 90% confidence level, which is inversely proportional to a varying interstellar medium particle density of $\{1, 3, 10, 30\}$ cm$^{-3}$. In the wind-like environment case, the baryon loading is $\leq \{20, 50, 100\}$ at 90% confidence level, which is proportional to the sixth power of a varying density parameter of $\{0.05, 0.06, 0.07\}$.

 This thesis explores experimental and theoretical approaches to dark matter detection, from gas-based detectors to quantum sensors, tackling the challenge of identifying dark matter, which makes up 27% of the Universe's energy. It reviews astrophysical and cosmological evidence, highlights the Standard Model's limitations, and motivates searches for WIMPs, axions, and dark photons through direct, indirect, and collider-based strategies. The experimental work includes the Micromegas-based TREX-DM experiment for low-mass WIMPs, with studies of argon and neon-based gas mixtures, detector design, shielding, readout, and background suppression. GEM integration boosted gain by up to 45. A UV LED-based internal calibration system was developed for compact, low-background operation, while pressure-dependent gain studies optimized future low-background TPCs. The thesis also advances axion and dark photon searches via haloscopes and introduces the DarkQuantum prototype, a superconducting qubit coupled to microwave cavities for single-photon detection. This system enabled the most stringent exclusion limit on massive dark photon interactions at 5.051 GHz, demonstrating the feasibility of quantum-enhanced detectors. Overall, the work bridges classical and quantum detection techniques, advancing WIMP searches and pioneering compact quantum sensors for axion and dark photon detection, laying the foundation for future high-sensitivity dark matter experiments.

 Performing a series of hydrodynamic stellar evolutionary simulations with \textsc{Mesa} (Module for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics), we investigate the excitation and growth of radial pulsations of massive red supergiants (RSGs) with the initial mass range of $M_\mathrm{ini}=13$--$18\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$. We show that strong radial pulsations develop in the hydrogen-rich envelope in their late evolutionary stages, and eventually the surface radial velocity exceeds the escape velocity for higher-mass models. On the other hand, lower-mass models exhibit more moderate pulsations with finite velocity amplitudes and are expected to keep massive hydrogen-rich envelopes when they evolve toward the gravitational collapse of the iron core. While the latter group ends up as a familiar transient population of exploding RSGs, i.e., type IIP supernovae (SNe), the former group may expel a part of their envelopes and explode as different transients population. We investigate how the energy of the oscillating envelope is dissipated and released as radiation. We also empirically determine the condition for the pulsation-driven mass ejection in terms of the luminosity-to-mass ratio, $L/M>10^{3.9}\mathrm{L}_\odot/\mathrm{M}_\odot$. The corresponding luminosity threshold for the explored mass range may explain the observationally inferred constraints on type IIP SN progenitors.

 - **Abstract**
 The Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), a next-generation ground-based gamma-ray observatory, will be composed of two arrays of multiple imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs) located in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Its goal is to enhance the sensitivity of current instruments by a factor of five to ten over an energy range from 20 GeV to over 300 TeV. IACT arrays are used to probe the very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray sky, operating by simultaneously observing air showers triggered by the interaction of VHE gamma rays and cosmic rays with the atmosphere. Cherenkov photons produced by these showers create a stereoscopic record of the event. By reconstructing the event using machine learning techniques, the properties of the originating VHE particle-including its type, energy, and incoming direction-can be determined. In this contribution, we present a fully deep-learning-driven approach to reconstruct simulated, stereoscopic IACT events using CTLearn. CTLearn is a package designed for loading and manipulating IACT data and for running deep learning models with pixel-wise camera data as input.

 - **Abstract**
 Early stages of stellar birth comprise of a two-step process involving the formation of two hydrostatic cores. The second step of gravitational collapse sets the radiative efficiency and accretion rate of the young protostar. These two parameters, of prime importance for protostellar evolution, dictate the luminosities and thus play a key role in deciphering the current discrepancy between observational surveys and theoretical models. In this letter, we provide quantitative estimates on the evolution of the radiative efficiency and accretion rate obtained from self-consistent, high-resolution, radiative hydrodynamic simulations performed using the codes PLUTO and RAMSES. The main highlight of our result is that the radiative efficiency reaches unity, that is, supercriticality, relatively quickly after protostellar birth. Supercriticality at the accretion shock is a necessary condition for cold accretion. Our results thus support a rapid transition to the cold accretion scenario, which is one of the assumptions used in Pre-Main Sequence (PMS) models working towards solutions to explain observational data. We briefly discuss the implications of the time evolution of the radiative efficiency factor in the context of the luminosity problem, the Protostellar Luminosity Function (PLF), PMS evolution, accurate sink properties, and the stellar Initial Mass Function (IMF).

 - **Abstract**
 Imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs) detect extended air showers (EASs) generated when very-high-energy (VHE) gamma rays or cosmic rays interact with the Earth's atmosphere. Cherenkov photons produced during an EAS are captured by fast-imaging cameras, which record both the spatial and temporal development of the shower, along with calorimetric data. By analyzing these recordings, the properties of the original VHE particle-such as its type, energy, and direction of arrival-can be reconstructed through machine learning techniques. This contribution focuses on the Large-Sized Telescopes (LSTs) of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory, a next-generation ground-based gamma-ray observatory. LSTs are responsible for reconstructing lower-energy gamma rays in the tens of GeV range. We explore a novel event reconstruction technique based on deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) applied on calibrated and cleaned waveforms of the IACT camera pixels using CTLearn. Our approach explicitly incorporates the time development of the shower, enabling a more accurate reconstruction of the event. This method eliminates the need for charge integration or handcrafted feature extraction, allowing the model to directly learn from waveform data.

 - **Abstract**
 Coasting cosmology offers an intriguing and straightforward framework for understanding the universe. In this work, we employ the Trans-Planckian Censorship Criterion (TCC) conjecture to test the viability of the coasting cosmology and propose an entropic dark energy (EDE) model within this framework. By applying the holographic principle to constrain the dark energy density and adopting the Bekenstein entropy and Tsallis entropy as the constraining entropies of the system, we find that, in a holographic coasting cosmological framework where dark energy and dark matter evolve independently, the Tsallis entropy satisfies certain general assumptions better than the Bekenstein entropy. Thus, there may be a fundamental relationship between Tsallis entropy and dark energy. We utilize observational data from Type Ia Supernovae (SNIa), Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), and Cosmic Chronometers (CC) to constrain EDE model. The optimal Tsallis parameter obtained aligns well with theoretical expectations. To evaluate the model's fit to the observed data, we calculate the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), and Kullback Information Criterion (KIC), and compare these metrics with those derived from $\Lambda$CDM, under which the model shows some improvement. Overall, this model provides a novel and simple on the evolution of the universe.

 - **Abstract**
 A hybrid machine learning model which combines a shallow convolutional neural network and a long short-term memory network (CNN--LSTM), has been developed to automate the detection of kink oscillations in coronal plasma loops within large volumes of high-cadence sequences of imaging data. The network was trained on a set of 10,000 synthetic data cubes designed to mimic sequences of coronal images, achieving an accuracy greater than 98\% on this synthetic dataset. The model was then applied to detect kink oscillations in real data cubes of coronal active regions observed with SDO/AIA in the 171~Å channel. This dataset consisted of 50 samples with visually detected kink oscillations and 128 samples without. Each sample covered an area of 260$\times$260~pixels in the spatial domain and a duration of 30~min with a 12~s cadence in the time domain. Both off-limb and on-disk regions of interest were used. The data were pre-processed by median filtering in the time domain, and Gaussian smoothing and Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization in the spatial domain. In the real dataset, the performance of the model was 83.7\%.The model is fully available in open access. We regard the CNN--LSTM model developed as a first step toward creating robust tools for routine solar coronal data mining in the context of coronal oscillation study.

 V659 Cen is a classical Cepheid which is part of a multiple system. Previous observations have shown that a hot companion dominates an ultraviolet spectrum and a cooler main sequence star dominates an XMM-Newton spectrum. The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) spectra discussed here spatially resolve the components and show that the secondary in the spectroscopic binary with the Cepheid is the low mass star, and the hottest star in the system is the outer companion. In addition a fourth star is a likely member of the system based on Gaia data. A new orbit is derived which includes new radial velocities.

 - **Abstract**
 We present updated constraints on an interacting dark energy - dark matter model with pure momentum transfer, where dark energy is in the form of a quintessence scalar field with an exponential potential. We run a suite of MCMC analyses using the DESI DR2 BAO measurements, in combination with CMB data from Planck and supernovae data from DESY5. In contrast to the standard case of uncoupled quintessence, we find that values for the potential's slope parameter $\lambda \geq \sqrt{2}$, which are conjectured by string theory scenarios, are not excluded. If $\lambda$ is fixed to such a value, we find that the data favour the negative coupling branch of the model, which is the branch exhibiting late-time growth suppression. We also derive 95% upper limits on the sum of the neutrino masses, finding $\sum m_\nu < 0.06$ eV ($\sum m_\nu < 0.16$ eV) when $\lambda$ is fixed (varied). Our results motivate further studies on dynamical dark energy models that obey string theory bounds and can be constrained with cosmological observations.

 - **Abstract**
 The NectarCAM flat-field flasher is a calibration device designed for the camera that will equip the Medium-Sized Telescopes (MSTs) of the northern site of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO). Positioned in the centre of the MST dish, 16 meters in front of the camera, the flasher emits short (FWHM $\approx$ 5 ns), uniform (2$-$4%) light pulses to illuminate the entire focal plane. Accurate calibration is crucial for the optimal operation of the NectarCAM, ensuring precise gain computation and mitigating differences in light-collection efficiency of the pixels of the camera. Using the flat-field flasher, two informations are obtained : the pixel gain and the relative efficiency between pixels. In addition, the flasher is used to probe the dynamic range over which the camera operates effectively. In this study, we report on the performance characterisation of the flat-field flasher using a dedicated test bench. We report on the results of tests conducted on several flasher units, evaluating their reliability. Furthermore, we describe how the flat-field coefficients are applied within the camera to ensure uniformity of response of few percent level across all 1855 pixels. As the deployment of the first MST at the CTAO northern site is scheduled for 2027, this work represents a significant contribution to the collaboration`s efforts to finalize camera calibration systems.

 - **Abstract**
 The Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) is uniquely able to perform deep, 15" resolutions imaging at frequencies below 100 MHz. Observations in this regime, using the Low Band Antenna (LBA) system, are significantly affected by instrumental and ionospheric distortions. Recent developments in calibration techniques have enabled routine production of high-fidelity images at these challenging frequencies. The aim of this paper is to obtain images of the radio sources included in the Third Cambridge catalog, second revised version (3CRR), at an observing frequency of 58 MHz, with an angular resolution of 15"and sensitivity to both compact and diffuse radio emission. This work also aims to produce accurate flux measurements for all sources. This dataset is designed to serve as a reference for low-frequency radio galaxy studies and future spectral aging analyses. We deliver 58. MHz radio images for the complete 3CRR sample including flux density measurements. We determined that the LBA has an accurate flux density scale with an average flux uncertainty of 10%. This is an important confirmation for any future works using the LOFAR LBA system. With these results we characterize the bright radio galaxy population with new high-resolution low-frequency images. We also provide high-resolution models of these sources which will be useful for calibrating future surveys. This legacy survey significantly expands the available high-resolution data at low frequencies and is the first fully imaged high-resolution sample at ultra low frequencies (< 100 MHz). It lays the foundation for future studies of radio galaxy physics, low-energy cosmic-ray populations, and the interplay between radio jets and their environments.

 - **Abstract**
 The publications of Gaia DR2 and DR3 have brought major improvements in stellar astrometry and photometry, particularly regarding the description of the white dwarf sequence. Notably, Gaia DR2 enabled the detection of variability in white dwarfs based solely on averaged astrometric and photometric quantities, i.e. the astrometric 5 parameters (positions, proper motion, and parallax) and general photometry properties in the G, BP and RP bands (mean, standard deviation and number of measurements). We identify and classify variable white dwarfs using Gaia DR3 data and Zwicky Transient Facility DR23 observations. The objective is to construct a catalogue of pulsating white dwarf candidates with robust selection criteria. We define a new sample of candidate variable white dwarfs using Gaia DR3 astrometric and photometric data. We cross-match this sample with the ZTF DR23 catalogue and apply a multiband Lomb-Scargle periodogram analysis to detect periodic variability. We then use the OPTICS unsupervised clustering algorithm to to group and classify the confirmed periodic stars. We identify 1423 variable white dwarfs candidates from Gaia DR3, with 864 having ZTF time series. 141 present significant periodicity. We classify these objects into known categories, including ZZ Ceti stars, GW Vir, V777 Her, and white dwarf-main sequence binaries. Our analysis yields several periodic stars, including three ZZ Ceti, 15 GW Vir, one V777 Her, and 24 WD-MS binaries. Furthermore, it reveals a significant population of potentialy variable stars, though without confirmed periodicity. Finally we publish our catalogue of candidate variable white dwarfs including variability status, periodicity, and classification information for the 864 sources with ZTF time series, 519 of them newly identified (including 83 new periodic stars).

          Parameterizing quasi-quintessence and quasi-phantom fields without the nearly flat potential approximation

 - **Abstract**
 An alternative dark energy description based on a generalized K-essence scenario is here explored. In particular, we consider a \emph{quasi-quintessence} and/or \emph{quasi-phantom} field, whose pressure does not depend on the kinetic energy, firstly discussed in the context of the cosmological constant problem. In so doing, we fix the background evolution and investigate the main observational signatures of its corresponding fluid-like representation. The corresponding scalar field can be parameterized independently from the potential form and without imposing the condition $\omega \sim -1$ used for quintessence and phantom fields. Additionally, we constrain the model parameters by performing Monte-Carlo Markov chain simulations through the adoption of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm and perform separated analyses, employing different data catalogs. More precisely, as data sets we employ observational Hubble data, type Ia supernovae and the second data release from the DESI Collaboration, namely DESI DR2. We define a hierarchy among analyses and, precisely, in the first we adopt all three samples, while the second excludes the DESI data points, with the aim of facing its effect on corresponding bounds. Our findings suggest that the \emph{quasi-quintessence} scenario prefers Planck's value of the Hubble constant $H_0$, but suggesting that, when the DESI sample is excluded from our computations, $\omega_0$ enters the phantom regime, although still compatible at $1$-$\sigma$ confidence level with a cosmological constant. Remarkably, these results appear in tension than those found for a standard quintessence, explored within the context of the recent DESI release, likely indicating that the DESI data may furnish inconclusive results depending on the kind of scalar field involved into the computation.

 - **Abstract**
 In recent years, the number of known sources emitting very- and ultra-high-energy gamma-rays has increased significantly thanks to facilities such as LHAASO and HAWC. Many of the observed sources are still unidentified or poorly constrained due to the limited angular resolution of these instruments; however, it is now ascertained that approximately half of them have a pulsar in coincidence. Some of these unidentified extended sources may be the result of the diffusion of leptons accelerated by the pulsar itself or in its nebula to energies exceeding 50 TeV. This new class of sources, called TeV halos, is characterized by a peculiar radial profile that, if properly resolved, is key to distinguishing them from other TeV sources that are associated with a pulsar, such as supernova remnants and pulsar wind nebulae. In this contribution, we consider all the pulsars which are spatially coincident with an unidentified extended TeV source, in order to quantify whether its spin-down power, age and distance allow the pulsar to produce a TeV halo with the observed flux and extension. We also investigate how the next generation of Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs), namely the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) and the ASTRI Mini-Array, will observe and characterize these TeV halos. We present a set of simulated sources with the expected morphology and spectrum, and we show for which of them we can distinguish between TeV halos and other classes of extended sources.

          To CLEAN or not to CLEAN: Data Processing in the ngVLA era

 - **Abstract**
 Radio interferometric imaging has long relied on the CLEAN algorithm, valued for its speed, robustness, and integration with calibration pipelines. However, next-generation facilities such as the ngVLA, SKA, and ALMAs Wideband Sensitivity Upgrade will produce data volumes and dynamic ranges that exceed the scalability of traditional methods. CLEAN remains dominant due to its simplicity and accumulated expertise, yet its assumption of modeling the sky as point sources limits its ability to recover extended emission and hampers automation. We review CLEANs limitations and survey alternatives, including multiscale extensions, compressive sensing, Regularized Maximum Likelihood, Bayesian inference, and AI-driven approaches. Forward-modeling methods enable higher fidelity, flexible priors, and uncertainty quantification, albeit at greater computational cost. Hybrid approaches such as Autocorr-CLEAN, CG-CLEAN, and PolyCLEAN retain CLEANs workflow while incorporating modern optimization. We argue hybrids are best suited for the near term, while Bayesian and AI-based frameworks represent the long-term future of interferometric imaging.

          Measuring the Two-Dimensional Thermal Structures of Protoplanetary Disks

 - **Abstract**
 We present a flexible, annulus-by-annulus method to constrain the 2-D thermal structure of a protoplanetary disk from optically thick spectral line emission. Using synthetic disk models with a known temperature and density structure, we extracted the vertical emission surfaces and brightness temperatures in radial annuli for multiple CO isotopologue transitions and used them to infer the vertical temperature profiles. This approach reliably recovers the injected temperature structure despite noise and finite resolution. We demonstrated that even a modest set of emission lines can constrain the temperature across a wide range of radii and elevations. Nevertheless, biases in the extracted emission surfaces constitute a major source of systematic error. Finally, we applied this method to archival ALMA observations of the HD 163296 disk, revealing that simple parametric radial temperature models may obscure the complexity of real disks and that additional observations are necessary to distinguish between different models of the vertical structure. This flexible framework can be readily applied to other systems, helping to characterize the thermal environments that shape planet formation.

 - **Abstract**
 During the final assembly of gas giant planets, circumplanetary disks (CPDs) of gas and dust form due to the conservation of angular momentum, providing material to be accreted onto the planet and the ingredients for moons. The composition of these disks has remained elusive, as their faint nature and short separations from their host stars have limited our ability to access them. Now, with the spatial and spectral resolution of JWST/MIRI Medium-Resolution Spectrograph, we can observe and characterize this reservoir for wide-orbit planetary-mass companions for the first time. We present the mid-infrared spectrum from the CPD surrounding the young companion CT Cha b. The data show a carbon-rich chemistry with seven carbon-bearing molecules (up to C$_6$H$_6$) and one isotopologue detected and indicate a high gaseous C/O$>$1 that is in contrast with the elemental abundance ratios typically measured in directly imaged gas giant atmospheres. This carbon-rich chemistry is also in stark contrast to the spectrum of the disk surrounding the host star, CT Cha A, which shows no carbon-bearing molecules. This difference in disk chemistry between the host disk and its companion indicates rapid, divergent chemical evolution on $\sim$million-year timescales. Nonetheless, the chemical properties of the CPD follow trends observed in isolated objects, where disks transition from an oxygen-rich to carbon-rich composition with decreasing host mass. Our results provide the first direct insight into the chemical and physical properties of material being accreted onto a gas giant analogue and into its potential moon system.

 - **Abstract**
 The peculiar velocities of dark matter tracers drive the growth of cosmic structures, providing a sensitive test of cosmological models and strengthening constraints on the nature of dark energy. In this work, we investigate the mean pairwise velocities, $v_{12}$, of dark matter tracers as a cosmological probe in the non-linear regime of cosmic structure formation. Using N-body dark matter-only simulations, we measure $v_{12}$ for pair separations up to 50 $h^{-1}$Mpc and model it by solving the pair conservation equation for a self-gravitating particle system, along with various prescriptions of the nonlinear matter power spectrum. We quantified the sensitivity of $v_{12}$ to variations in key cosmological parameters such as $\Omega_{\mathrm{m}}$, $\sigma_8$, $h$, $M_\nu$, and $w$. Our parameter inference analysis using MCMC shows sub-11% agreement with simulation data, with notable degeneracies, particularly between $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$ and $\sigma_8$. We further compute the stable clustering crossing scale across redshifts $z=0$, $0.5$, and $1$, assessing its dependence on cosmology. Among the tested power spectrum modeling approaches, we find that the CSSTEmu emulator provides the most accurate predictions, with deviations below 5% for $r > 10$ $h^{-1}$Mpc at $z=0.5$. Our results are validated using independent simulation suites, demonstrating that our framework offers a robust method for extracting cosmological constraints from upcoming peculiar velocity data.

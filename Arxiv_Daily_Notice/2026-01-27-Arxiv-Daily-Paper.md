- **Abstract**
 In the Gaia era, a comprehensive analysis of the binary open clusters NGC 869 (h Persei) and NGC 884 (chi Persei) system has been conducted to investigate its structural, astrophysical, kinematic, and Galactic orbital properties, along with its dynamical evolution. By applying the UPMASK algorithm to Gaia astrometric data for the estimation of cluster membership probabilities, it has been determined that 808 stars in NGC 869 and 707 stars in NGC 884 exhibit the highest statistical likelihood of being cluster members. The fundamental astrophysical parameters of the clusters were inferred within a Bayesian framework using Gaia data and PARSEC stellar evolutionary isochrones, through the application of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique. The estimated parameters are: colour excess E(B-V) = 0.516 +0.17/-0.24 mag and 0.516 +0.22/-0.33 mag, distances 2376 +301/-278 and 2273 +230/-290 pc, ages log(t/yr) = 7.31 +0.17/-0.32 and log(t/yr) = 7.30 +0.13/-0.29, and metallicities [Fe/H] = -0.24 +/- 0.12 and [Fe/H] = -0.25 +/- 0.12 dex for NGC 869 and NGC 884, respectively. Since spectroscopic observations are not available for the clusters, SED analysis was employed for the member stars, yielding results consistent with those obtained using the MCMC method. Kinematic and Galactic orbital analyses suggest that the open clusters originated in nearby regions of the Galaxy. This interpretation is supported by their similar space velocities and Galactic orbital parameters. Furthermore, orbital integration over 1 Gyr indicates a potential interaction between the clusters within the next 11 Myr. This study provides strong evidence of a common origin and a possible future dynamical interaction, contributing valuable insights into the formation and evolution of binary open clusters in the Milky Way.

          A Binary-Based Reassessment of the Age and Stellar Properties of NGC 7789 Using Twelve Binary Components

- **Abstract**
 We present a binary-based reassessment of the age of the intermediate-age open cluster NGC 7789, together with well-constrained stellar parameters for twelve components in six SB2 systems, including two eclipsing binaries. Our analysis employs a unified modelling framework that combines radial-velocity orbits, TESS light curves, and blue-to-IR spectral energy distributions (SEDs), providing a robust alternative to traditional isochrone-based age determinations. By adopting common cluster-wide parameters (age, distance, and line-of-sight extinction) when solving for the stellar parameters of the binary components, we obtain a coherent set of masses, radii, effective temperatures, and luminosities for all twelve stars. The combined SED, eclipsing-binary, and radial-velocity analysis yields a well-constrained cluster age of $1.26 \pm 0.09$ Gyr and an extinction of $A_V = 0.90 \pm 0.05$ mag, while remaining consistent with the Gaia DR3 distance of $d \simeq 2.06$ kpc used as an external prior. An independent Gaia DR3 astrometric analysis gives a distance of $2082 \pm 142$ pc and confirms the membership of all six systems. The twelve binary components occupy the turnoff and subgiant regions of the cluster, enabling stringent evolutionary tests: in the radius--mass, radius--temperature, and temperature--mass diagrams, they show excellent agreement with modern stellar evolution models for the derived cluster parameters. NGC 7789 thus serves as a valuable benchmark for multi-observable, binary-based age determinations in open cluster studies.

- **Abstract**
 We report the discovery and characterization of TOI-6692 b, an eccentric (e~0.54) Jupiter on a 130-day orbit. TOI-6692 b was first detected as a community TESS Object of Interest (cTOI) by the Visual Survey Group and the Planet Hunters group as a single transit candidate via TESS observation. The period was subsequently confirmed via radial velocity monitoring from the Planet Finder Spectrograph on the 6.5m Magellan telescope. Additional radial velocities were acquired with the CHIRON, FEROS, and CORALIE spectrographs. LCOGT ground-based photometric follow-up was conducted over 2 weeks to detect another transit and refine the period. Although we did not detect an ingress or egress of the 11.04 hr transit, we did detect a possible in-transit signal in the multi-night data and provide an updated ephemeris for future monitoring. TOI-6692 b is one of few planets with orbital periods longer than 100 days that have a secure mass, radius, and eccentricity detection. As with most giant planets at these orbital periods, the eccentricity of TOI-6692 b is lower than that expected of planets undergoing high-eccentricity tidal migration, but is more consistent with the expectations of planet-planet scattering outcomes. A long-term radial velocity trend was detected and further monitoring is warranted to determine the outer companion period. TOI-6692 b is also one of few TESS single transit targets that have its period eventually confirmed via follow-up photometric campaigns timed to capture transits despite the relatively large ephemeris uncertainties. Such efforts highlight the capabilities of night-to-night stability on ground-based photometric facilities today.

- **Abstract**
 We introduce a new photometric catalog of RR Lyrae variables (RRLs, $\sim$300,000) mainly based on data available in public datasets. We also present the largest and most homogeneous spectroscopic dataset of RRLs and Blue Horizontal Branch [BHB] stars ever collected. This includes radial velocity measurements ($\sim$16,000) and iron abundances ($\Delta$S method for 8,140 RRLs, plus 547 from literature). Elemental abundances based on high-resolution spectra are provided for 487 RRLs and 64 BHB stars. We identified candidate RRLs associated to the main Galactic components and their iron distribution function (IDF) becomes more metal-rich when moving from the Halo ([Fe/H]=-1.56) to the Thick (TCD; [Fe/H]=-1.47) and Thin (TND; [Fe/H]=-0.73) disk. Furthermore, Halo RRLs and RRLs in retrograde orbits are $\alpha$-enhanced ([$\alpha$/Fe]=0.27, $\sigma$=0.18), while TCD RRLs are either $\alpha$-enhanced ([Fe/H]$\le$-1.0) or $\alpha$-poor ([Fe/H]$>$-1.0), and TND RRLs are mainly $\alpha$-poor ([$\alpha$/Fe]=-0.01, $\sigma$=0.20). We also identified RRLs associated to the main stellar streams (Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus [GSE]; Sequoia, Helmi, Sagittarius) and we found that their IDFs are quite similar to Halo RRLs. However, GSE RRLs lack the metal-poor/metal-rich tails and their $\alpha$-element distribution is quite compact. The iron radial gradient in Galactocentric distance for TND, TCD and Halo RRLs is negative and it decreases from -0.026, to -0.010, and to -0.002 dex/kpc. The iron radial gradient based on dry Halo (Halo without substructures) RRLs is, within the errors, equal to the global Halo. We also found a strong similarity between iron and [$\alpha$/Fe] radial gradients of Milky Way RRLs and M31 globular clusters throughout the full range of galactocentric distances covered by the two samples.

- **Abstract**
 Detection of stellar flares at hard X-ray is still rare at the current stage. A transient was recently detected by the hard X-ray camera, ECLAIRs onboard the SVOM mission at 11:39:01.2UT on 2025, January 09. Simultaneous monitor in the optical band on the ground by SVOM/GWAC and follow-up spectroscopy enable us to confirm that the transient is caused by a superflare on HD~22468, a RS CVn-type star. The bolometric energy released in the flare is estimated to be $\sim7.2\times10^{37}-1.7\times10^{38}\ \mathrm{erg}$. The hard X-ray spectra of the event at the peak can be reproduced by the ``apec'' model of a hot plasma with a temperature of $106^{+27}_{-22}$~MK. In the optical range, the H$\alpha$ emission-line profile obtained at $\sim1.7$ hrs after the trigger shows a bulk blueshift of $-96\pm20\ \mathrm{km\ s^{-1}}$, which can be explained by either a chromospheric evaporation or a prominence eruption. The ejected mass is estimated to be $3.9\times10^{20}$ g for the evaporating plasma, and to be $3.2\times10^{21}\ \mathrm{g}<M_{\mathrm{p}}<8.8\times10^{21}\ \mathrm{g}$ for the erupted prominence.

- **Abstract**
 We report photometry results of a frequently outbursting dwarf nova, ER Ursae Majoris. To measure the outburst parameters of the system, we carried out analyses of the light curve, periodograms, and O-C diagrams. We investigated the system's behaviour using the ground-based optical data and the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite data. During these observation runs, we scrutinised three superoutbursts and several normal outbursts. We detected ordinary and late superhumps during each of the investigated superoutbursts. We derived the period excess value $\epsilon \approx 3.0(1)\% $. This suggests that over the last 30 years, ER UMa has not shifted on the evolutionary path toward period-bounce objects. Between 1992 and 2022, the interval between two successive superoutbursts (the supercycle length) changed significantly from 42.1 days to 59.6 days, which indicates that the mean mass-transfer rate of ER UMa has been decreasing over this period.

- **Abstract**
 Circumbinary disk occultation (CBO) systems, in which a misaligned circumbinary disk periodically obscures the central binary, provide unique probes of disk structure and dynamics. However, fewer than ten candidates with measured orbital periods were previously known. In this work, we identify six new CBO candidates, designated ZTF-CBO-1 through ZTF-CBO-6, through a systematic search of Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) photometry. These systems exhibit deep ($\gtrsim$1 mag) periodic dimming events with orbital periods ranging from $\sim$30 to $\sim$530 days and occultation durations spanning 32%-77% of their orbital periods. Such large duty cycles rule out the interpretation of circum-companion material occultation. Spectral energy distributions of ZTF-CBO-1 and ZTF-CBO-2 reveal infrared excess indicative of a dust component. TESS observations of ZTF-CBO-1 show no hours- to days-timescale variability during ingress and egress, indicating a smooth disk edge. These discoveries nearly double the known CBO sample, enabling meaningful population-level studies.

- **Abstract**
 The environs of other stellar systems may be directly probed by analyzing the cometary activity of interstellar objects. The recently discovered interstellar object 3I/ATLAS was the subject of an intensive worldwide follow-up campaign in its pre-perihelion approach. Now, 3I/ATLAS has begun its post-perihelion departure from the Solar System. In this letter, we report the first post-perihelion blue-sensitive integral-field unit spectroscopy of 3I/ATLAS using the Keck Cosmic Web Imager on November 16, 2025. We confirm previously reported CN, Fe, and Ni outgassing along with detections of carbon chain molecules $\mathrm{C}_2$ and $\mathrm{C}_3$. We calculate production rates for each species. We find Fe and Ni production rates of $\mathrm{Q_{Fe}} = (9.55\pm3.96)\times10^{25}$ atoms s$^{-1}$, and $\mathrm{Q_{Ni}} = (6.61\pm2.74)\times10^{25}$ atoms s$^{-1}$, resulting in a ratio of $\log(\mathrm{Q_{Ni}} / \mathrm{Q_{Fe}}) = -0.16\pm0.03$, which matches Solar System comets well and continues the pre-perihelion trend of declining $\log(\mathrm{Q_{Ni}} / \mathrm{Q_{Fe}})$ with $r_h$. We investigate the radial distributions of these elemental species and find characteristic $e$-folding radii of 3880$\pm$39 km for Ni, 6053$\pm$68 km for CN, 4194$\pm$45 km for $\mathrm{C}_2$, and 3833$\pm$45 km for $\mathrm{C}_3$. Compared to pre-perihelion measurements, these radii have increased by a factor of $\sim$6.5--7. Our post-perihelion observations reveal that 3I/ATLAS continues to exhibit cometary behavior broadly consistent with Solar System comets.

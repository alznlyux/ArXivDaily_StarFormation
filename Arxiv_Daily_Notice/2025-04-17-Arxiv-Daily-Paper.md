          Gotta Go Fast: A Generalization of the Escape Speed to Fluid-dynamical Explosions and Implications for Astrophysical Transients

 - **Abstract**
 A star's ability to explode in a core-collapse supernova is correlated with its density profile, $\rho(r)$, such that compact stars with shallow density profiles preferentially ``fail'' and produce black holes. This correlation can be understood from a mass perspective, as shallower density profiles enclose $\sim 3M_{\odot}$ (i.e., the maximum neutron-star mass) at relatively small radii, but could also be due to the fact that a shockwave (driving the explosion) inevitably stalls if the density profile into which it propagates is shallower than $\rho(r) \propto r^{-2}$. Here we show that this condition -- the density profile being steeper than $\rho \propto r^{-2}$ -- is necessary, but not sufficient, for generating a strong explosion. In particular, we find solutions to the fluid equations that describe a shockwave propagating at a fixed fraction of the local freefall speed into a temporally evolving, infalling medium, the density profile of which scales as $\rho \propto r^{-n}$ at large radii. The speed of the shock diverges as $n\rightarrow 2$ and declines (eventually to below the Keplerian escape speed) as $n$ increases, while the total energy contained in the explosion approaches zero as the shock recedes to large distances. These solutions therefore represent fluid-dynamical analogs of marginally bound orbits, and yield the ``shock escape speed'' as a function of the density profile. We also suggest that stellar explodability is correlated with the power-law index of the density at $\sim10^9$ cm, where the neutrino diffusion time equals the local dynamical time for most massive stars, which agrees with supernova simulations.

          A Machine Learning Framework for Stellar Collision Transient Identification

 - **Abstract**
 Modern astronomical surveys, such as the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), are capable of detecting thousands of transient events per year, necessitating the use of automated and scalable data analysis techniques. Recent advances in machine learning have enabled the efficient classification and characterization of these transient phenomena. We aim to develop a fully systematic pipeline to identify candidate stellar collision events in galactic nuclei, which may otherwise be identified as tidal disruption events or other transients. We also seek to validate our simulations by comparing key physical parameters derived from observations and used in modeling these events. We generate a comprehensive bank of simulated light curves spanning a range of physical parameters and employ an approximate nearest neighbor algorithm (via the annoy library) to match these with observed ZTF light curves. Our pipeline is successfully able to associate observed ZTF light curves with simulated events. The resulting estimated parameters, including supermassive black hole masses and ejecta mass, are presented and compared to known values when applicable. We demonstrate that a systematic, machine learning-based approach can effectively identify and characterize stellar collision candidate events from large-scale transient surveys. This methodology is especially promising for future surveys which will provide us with significantly high volumes of data, such as LSST, where automated, data-intensive analysis will be critical for advancing our understanding of transient astrophysical phenomena.

          Damping Wing-Like Features in the Spectra of High Redshift Quasars: a Challenge for Fully-Coupled Simulations
 - **Authors:** Nickolay Y. Gnedin, Hanjue Zhu

 - **Abstract**
 Recently, several observational detections of damping-wing-like features at the edges of ``dark gaps" in the spectra of distant quasars (the ``Malloy-Lidz effect") have been reported, rendering strong support for the existence of ``neutral islands" in the universe at redshifts as low as $z<5.5$. We apply the procedure from one of these works, \citet{YZhu2024}, to the outputs of fully coupled cosmological simulations from two recent large projects, ``Cosmic Reionization On Computers" (CROC) and ``Thesan". Synthetic spectra in both simulations have statistics of dark gaps similar to observations, but do not exhibit the damping wing features. Moreover, a toy model with neutral islands added ``by hand" only reproduces the observational results when the fraction of neutral islands among all dark gaps exceeds 90%. I.e., simulations and observations appear to produce two distinct ``populations" of dark gaps. In addition, the neutral islands observed at $z=5.9$ should be short-lived and hence cannot extend to $z<5.5$. In summary, the observational detections of damping wing features present serious challenges not only to state-of-the-art simulations but also to our general understanding of how reionization should proceed.

          Short-range ordering and equilibrium structure of binary crystal mixtures of atomic nuclei in white dwarf cores

 - **Abstract**
 Mixtures of bare atomic nuclei on a nearly uniform degenerate electron background are a realistic model of matter in the interior of white dwarfs. Despite tremendous progress in understanding their phase diagrams achieved mainly via first-principle simulations, structural, thermodynamic, and kinetic properties of such mixtures are poorly understood. We develop a semi-analytic model of the crystal state of binary mixtures based on the concept of mutual short-range ordering of ions of different sorts. We derive analytic formulas for electrostatic energy of crystal mixtures, including the effect of static ion displacements from the lattice nodes, and estimate their residual entropy. Then we perform free energy minimization with respect to the order parameters for a C/O mixture at all relevant compositions and temperatures. The resulting C/O phase diagram is in a reasonable agreement with that obtained in the most recent first-principle study. The equilibrium microstructure of a crystallized mixture is shown to evolve with decrease of temperature which, in principle, can induce structural transitions. The latter will be accompanied by thermal energy release. The proposed theory opens up a path to analyze ordering and construct phase diagrams of ternary mixtures, which are of great practical interest in astrophysics, as well as to improve calcuations of electron-ion scattering rates and kinetic properties of dense crystallized matter.

          Understanding the impact of satellites on radio astronomy observations

 - **Abstract**
 Radio telescopes observe extremely faint emission from astronomical objects, ranging from compact sources to large scale structures that can be seen across the whole sky. Satellites actively transmit at radio frequencies (particularly at 10--20\,GHz, but usage of increasing broader frequency ranges are already planned for the future by satellite operators), and can appear as bright as the Sun in radio astronomy observations. Remote locations have historically enabled telescopes to avoid most interference, however this is no longer the case with dramatically increasing numbers of satellites that transmit everywhere on Earth. Even more remote locations such as the far side of the Moon may provide new radio astronomy observation opportunities, but only if they are protected from satellite transmissions. Improving our understanding of satellite transmissions on radio telescopes across the whole spectrum and beyond is urgently needed to overcome this new observational challenge, as part of ensuring the future access to dark and quiet skies. In this contribution we summarise the current status of observations of active satellites at radio frequencies, the implications for future astronomical observations, and the longer-term consequences of an increasing number of active satellites. This will include frequencies where satellites actively transmit, where they unintentionally also transmit, and considerations about thermal emission and other unintended emissions. This work is ongoing through the IAU CPS.

          CAMPOS II. The onset of protostellar disk substructures and planet formation

 - **Abstract**
 The 1.3 mm CAMPOS survey has resolved 90 protostellar disks with $\sim$15 au resolution across the Ophiuchus, Corona Australis, and Chamaeleon star-forming regions. To address the fundamental question, "When does planet formation begin?", we combined the CAMPOS sample with literature observations of Class 0-II disks (bolometric temperature, $T_{\rm bol} \le 1900$ K), all mapped at 1.3 mm with resolutions ranging from 4 to 33 au. To investigate substructure detection rates as a function of bolometric temperature, we restricted the sample to disks observed at the 1.3 mm wavelength, with inclinations below 75$^\circ$, linear resolution $\le 20$ au and resolved with at least four resolution elements ($\theta_{\rm disk}/\theta_{\rm res} \ge 4$). We also considered the effects of extinction correction and the inclusion of Herschel Space Telescope data on the bolometric temperature measurements, to constrain the lower and upper limits of bolometric temperature for each source. We find that by $T_{\rm bol} \sim 200-400\,K$, substructure detection rates increased sharply to $\sim$60%, corresponding to an approximate age of $0.2-0.4$ Myr. No substructures are detected in Class 0 disks. The ratio of disk-averaged brightness temperature to predicted dust temperature shows a trend of increasing values toward the youngest Class 0 disks, suggesting higher optical depths in these early stages. Classifying disks with substructures into those with and without large central cavities, we find both populations coexisting across evolutionary stages, suggesting they are not necessarily evolutionarily linked. Our statistical analysis confirms that substructures similar to those in Class II disks are already common by the Class I stage, and the emergence of these structures at $T_{\rm bol} \sim 200-400\,K$ could represent only an upper limit.

          Trials and Tribulations of Chemodynamical Tagging: Investigating the Recovery of Open Clusters in the Gaia DR3-GALAH DR4 Catalog

 - **Abstract**
 Chemodynamical tagging has been suggested as a powerful tool to trace stars back to their birth clusters. However, the efficacy of chemodynamical tagging as a means to recover individual stellar clusters is still under debate. In this study, we present a detailed investigation of chemodynamical tagging of open clusters using both dynamical and chemical data from the \textit{Gaia} DR3 and GALAH DR4 surveys, respectively. Using a sample of open clusters and mock field stars, we conduct a bootstrap analysis to evaluate every unique combination of orbital components ($E, J_R, J_\phi, J_Z$) and chemical abundances ([X/Fe] for O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, K, Ca, Sc, Ti, Cr, Mn, Ni, Cu, Y, and Ba) on how well they recover open clusters when used as parameters in the clustering algorithm, HBDSCAN. We find that using primarily dynamical orbital parameters leads to the highest recovery rate of open cluster stars. Nevertheless, even employing the best performing parameter combinations leads to low open cluster recovery rates. We find that, in most cases, chemodynamical tagging of open clusters using blind clustering algorithms is not efficient, which is in line with previous theoretical and observational work. However, we show that the addition of cuts based on metallicity, age, and birth radii in order to reduce the size of the clustering catalog can marginally improve the recovery rate of open clusters.

          Dark Matter Genesis

 - **Abstract**
 Recent discoveries of primordial black hole (PBH) candidates by means of high cadence microlensing open the way to a physical understanding of the formation of dark matter as a chapter in the thermal history of the Universe. Two complementary sites of PBH formation are considered, inflation and the early Universe at TeV to MeV energies. In the latter case the Friedman equation, together with the measurement of the mass of the PBH, reveal the threshold energy, the mass spectrum and the likely end point of this epoch. Some of the many recent exoplanet detections may conceivably have been detections of PBHs. When the Universe cools to MeV temperatures, larger mass PBH would form similarly, reaching the supermassive regime. The discovery of numerous supermassive black holes (SMBH) at high redshift with JWST fulfils this expectation. We corroborate the idea that Planck mass relics could be an important component of dark matter, and find that these are formed by PBH with initial mass less than approximately 6 x 10^{-16} M{_\odot} and cosmic temperature above 10^9 GeV. Although in some mass ranges PBH can only make up a modest fraction of {\Omega}matter, it is possible that all astrophysical dark matter, as distinct from axions and WIMPs, is of PBH origin.

 - **Abstract**
 The population of giant planets on wide orbits around low-mass M dwarf stars is poorly understood, but the unprecedented sensitivity of JWST NIRCam coronagraphic imaging now provides direct access to planets significantly less massive than Jupiter beyond 10 AU around the closest, youngest M dwarfs. We present the design, observations, and results of JWST GTO Program 1184, a Cycle 1 NIRCam coronagraphic imaging survey of 9 very nearby and young low-mass stars at 3-5 micron wavelengths. In the F356W and F444W filters, we achieve survey median 5-sigma contrasts deeper than 10-5 at a separation of 1", corresponding to 0.20 MJup in F444W and 1.30 MJup in F356W at planet-star separations of 10 AU. Our results include 3-5 micron debris disk detections and the identification of many extended and point-like sources in the final post-processed images. In particular, we have identified two marginal point source candidates having fluxes and color limits consistent with model predictions for young sub-Jupiter mass exoplanets. Under the assumption that neither candidate is confirmed, we place the first direct-imaging occurrence constraints on M dwarf wide-orbit (semimajor axes 10-100 AU), sub-Jupiter mass exoplanets (0.3-1 MJup). We find frequency limits of < 0.10 and < 0.16 objects per star with 1 and 3-sigma confidence, respectively. This survey brings to the forefront the unprecedented capabilities of JWST NIRCam coronagraphic imaging when targeting young, low-mass stars and acts as a precursor to broader surveys to place deep statistical constraints on wide-orbit, sub-Jupiter mass planets around M dwarfs.

          Extended scenarios for solar radio emissions with downshifted electron beam plasma excitations

 - **Abstract**
 First-principle studies of radiative processes aimed at explaining the origin of type II and type III solar radio bursts raise questions on the implications of downshifted electron beam plasma excitations with frequency (slightly) below the plasma frequency ($\omega\lesssim\omega_{pe}$) in the generation of radio emissions. Unlike the beam-induced Langmuir waves ($\omega \gtrsim \omega_{pe}$) in the standard radio emission plasma model, the primary wave excitations of cooler and/or denser beams have predominantly downshifted frequencies. Broadbands of such downshifted excitations are also confirmed by in situ observations in association with terrestrial foreshock and electron beams (in contrast to narrowband Langmuir waves), but their involvement in radiative processes has not been examined so far. We revisit three radiative scenarios specific to downshifted primary excitations, and the results demonstrate their direct or indirect involvement in plasma radio emission. Downshifted excitations of an electron beam primarily play an indirect role, contributing to the relaxation to a plateau-on-tail still able to induce Langmuir beam waves that satisfy conditions for nonlinear wave-wave interactions leading to free radio waves. At longer time scales, the primary excitations can become predominantly downshifted, and then directly couple with the secondary (backscattered) Langmuir waves to generate the second harmonic of radio emissions. Two counterbeams are more efficient and lead to faster radiative mechanisms, involving counterpropagating downshifted excitations, which couple to each other and generate intense, broadband and isotropic radio spectra of downshifted second harmonics. Such a long-lasting (second) radio harmonic can thus be invoked to distinguish regimes with downshifted ($\omega \gtrsim \omega_{pe}$) primary excitations.

          Radiative Flux from a High-Resolution Atmospheric Dynamics Simulation of a Hot-Jupiter for JWST and Ariel

 - **Abstract**
 We present medium-wave ($\sim$0.5~$\mu$m to $\sim$13~$\mu$m) radiative flux distributions and spectra derived from high-resolution atmospheric dynamics simulations of an exoplanet \WASPP. This planet serves to illustrate several important features. Assuming different chemical compositions for its atmosphere (e.g., H$_2$/He only and $Z \in \{1, 12\}$ times solar metallicity), the outgoing radiative flux is computed using full radiative transfer that folds in the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and Ariel instrument characteristics. We find that the observed variability depends strongly on the the assumed chemistry and the instrument wavelength range, hence the probed altitude of the atmosphere. With H$_2$/He only, the flux and variability originate near the 10$^5$~Pa level; with solar and higher metallicity, $\sim$10$^3$~Pa level is probed, and the variability is distinguishably reduced. Our calculations show that JWST and Ariel have the sensitivity to capture the atmospheric variability of exoplanets like \WASPP, depending on the metallicity -- both in repeated eclipse and phase-curve observations.

          Constraining the initial Lorentz factor of gamma-ray bursts under different circumburst mediums

 - **Abstract**
 The initial Lorentz factor ($\Gamma_{\text{0}}$) plays a crucial role in uncovering the physical characteristics of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Previous studies have indicated that the ambient medium density index $k$ for GRBs falls in the range of 0 - 2, rather than exactly equal to 0 (homogeneous interstellar ambient) or 2 (typical stellar wind). In this work, we aim to constrain the $\Gamma_0$ of GRBs considering their distinct circumburst medium. We select a total of 33 GRBs for our analysis, comprising 7 X-ray GRBs and 26 optical GRBs. Subsequently, by utilizing the deceleration time of fireball $t_{\rm p}$, we derive the $\Gamma_0$ for the 33 GRBs assuming the radiation efficiency of $\eta =$ 0.2. The inferred initial Lorentz factor was found to be from 50 to 500, consistent with previous studies. We then investigate the correlation between the $\Gamma_0$ and the isotropic energy $E_{\rm \gamma,iso}$ (as well as the mean isotropic luminosity $L_{\rm \gamma,iso}$), finding very tight correlations between them, i.e., $\Gamma_0$ $\propto$ $E^{0.24}_{\rm \gamma,iso,52}$ ($\Gamma_0$ $\propto$ $L^{0.20}_{\rm \gamma,iso.49}$) with $\eta$=0.2. Additionally, we verify the correlation among $\Gamma_0$, the isotropic energy $E_{\rm \gamma,iso}$ (or $L_{\rm \gamma,iso}$) and the peak energy $E_{\rm{p,z}}$, i.e., $E_{\rm \gamma,iso,52}$ $\propto$ $\Gamma^{1.36}_0$$E^{0.82}_{\rm{p,z}}$ ($L_{\rm \gamma,iso,49}$ $\propto$ $\Gamma^{1.05}_0$$E^{0.66}_{\rm{p,z}}$) under the same radiation efficiency ($\eta$=0.2).

          Asymmetric Cross-Correlation functions with delays in Sco X-1: Evidence of possible Jet triggering

 - **Abstract**
 The formation and origin of Jets from Z sources are not well understood, although an X-ray-radio correlation has been observed. We analyzed a few observations of Sco X-1 using the Rossi X-ray Timing Experiment Satellite. Out of the 17 observations, 5 showed lags of a few 10s of seconds with an asymmetry in the CCF between the soft and hard bands in their cross-correlation function (CCF) analysis. Interestingly, during these observations, a ballistic-type radio jet of Ultra-relativistic(UR) nature was reported. The observed lags and associated cross-correlation coefficients were validated using simulations. The rest of the 12 observations' CCFs were symmetric, and their associated Power Density Spectrum (PDS) displayed Normal Branch(NBO)/Normal + Horizontal Branch Oscillations(NBO+HBO). The X-ray spectral study of 2 obs. where radio core emission was seen with abrupt variation in both PDS and CCF showed a black-body flux variation of 10-20%, but no spectral parameter varied. We suggest that the ballistic jet caused a disturbance in the inner accretion region, viz., the Boundary Layer plausibly along with the Corona, that caused the lags observed in the CCFs along with the absence of any oscillatory features in the PDS tracing only a flat-topped noise. Whereas the regions with no lags showed a persistent NBO/NBO+HBO feature, suggesting a steady accretion flow. Although the UR jet can't be related to NBO or HBO, we suggest it could be related to the phenomena that cause NBO since the majority of PDSs displayed NBO. We also constrain the inner accretion region size to 20-30 km, which is responsible for the accretion ejecta in Sco X-1.

          Fast Baryonic Field Painting for Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Analyses: Transfer Function vs. Hybrid Effective Field Theory

 - **Abstract**
 We present two approaches for "painting" baryonic properties relevant to the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect - optical depth and Compton-$y$ - onto 3-dimensional $N$-body simulations, using the MillenniumTNG suite as a benchmark. The goal of these methods is to produce fast and accurate reconstruction methods to aid future analyses of baryonic feedback using the SZ effect. The first approach employs a Gaussian Process emulator to model the SZ quantities via a transfer function, while the second utilizes Hybrid Effective Field Theory (HEFT) to reproduce these quantities within the simulation. Our analysis involves comparing both methods to the true MillenniumTNG optical depth and Compton-$y$ fields using several metrics, including the cross-correlation coefficient, power spectrum, and power spectrum error. Additionally, we assess how well the reconstructed fields correlate with dark matter haloes across various mass thresholds. The results indicate that the transfer function method yields more accurate reconstructions for fields with initially high correlations ($r \approx 1$), such as between the optical depth and dark matter fields. Conversely, the HEFT-based approach proves more effective in enhancing correlations for fields with weaker initial correlations ($r \sim 0.5$), such as between the Compton-$y$ and dark matter fields. Lastly, we discuss extensions of our methods to improve the reconstruction performance at the field level.

          The "Little Dark Dot": Evidence for Self-Interacting Dark Matter in the Strong Lens SDSSJ0946+1006?

 - **Abstract**
 Previous studies, based on precise modeling of a gravitationally lensing image, have identified what may be a extremely compact, dark perturber in the well-known lensing system SDSSJ0946+1006 (the "Jackpot"). Its remarkable compactness challenges the standard cold dark matter (CDM) paradigm. In this paper, we explore whether such a compact perturber could be explained as a core-collapsed halo described by the self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) model. Using the isothermal Jeans method, we compute the density profiles of core-collapsed halos across a range of masses. Our comparison with observations indicates that only a core-collapsed halo with a total mass of approximately $10^{11}~{\rm M_{\odot}}$ could produce an inner density profile and mass enclosed within 1 kpc that is consistent with observational data. However, such a massive dark matter halo should host a galaxy detectable by prior Hubble imaging, which is not observed. Thus, the core-collapsed SIDM halo model struggles to fully account for the exotic nature of the "little dark dot" in the "Jackpot" lens.

 - **Abstract**
 Component separation is the process of extracting one or more emission sources in astrophysical maps. It is therefore crucial to develop models that can accurately clean the cosmic microwave background (CMB) in current and future experiments. In this work, we present a new methodology based on neural networks which operates on realistic temperature and polarization simulations. We assess its performance by comparing the power spectra of the output maps with those of the input maps and other emissions. For temperature, we obtain residuals of $20 \pm \mu K^{2}$. For polarization, we analyze the $E$ and $B$ modes, which are related to density (scalar) and primordial gravitational waves (tensorial) perturbations occurring in the first second of the Universe, obtaining residuals of $10^{-2} \mu K^{2}$ at $l>200$ and $10^{-2}$ and $10^{-3} \mu K^{2}$ for $E$ and $B$, respectively.

 - **Abstract**
 The combination of fluorescence and surface detectors at the Pierre Auger Observatory offers unprecedented precision in testing models of hadronic interactions at center-of-mass energies around 70 TeV and beyond. However, for some time, discrepancies between model predictions and measured air-shower data have complicated efforts to accurately determine the mass composition of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays. A key inconsistency is the deficit of simulated signals compared to those measured with the surface detectors, typically interpreted as a deficit in the muon signal generated by the hadronic component of simulated showers. Recently, a new global method has been applied to the combined data from the surface and fluorescence detectors at the Pierre Auger Observatory. This method simultaneously determines the mass composition of cosmic rays and evaluates variations in the simulated depth of the shower maximum and hadronic signals on the ground. The findings reveal not only the alleviated muon problem but also show that all current models of hadronic interactions predict depths of the shower maximum that are too shallow, offering new insights into deficiencies in these models from a broader perspective.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent high-resolution observations have established a strong link between black hole jets and accretion disk structures, particularly in the 3.5 mm wavelength band [Nature. 616, 686 (2023)]. In this work, we propose a ``jet-modified Novikov-Thorne disk model'' that explicitly incorporates jet luminosity into the accretion disk radiation framework. By integrating synchrotron radiation from relativistic electrons in the jet, we derive a modified luminosity function that accounts for both the accretion disk and jet contributions. Our analysis demonstrates that the inclusion of jet luminosity enhances the total accretion disk luminosity by approximately 33.5\%, as derived from the integration of radiative flux. Furthermore, we compare our modified model with the standard Novikov-Thorne model and find that the jet contribution remains significant across different observational inclinations. These results highlight the necessity of incorporating jet effects when estimating the observable flux of black hole accretion systems, which has direct implications for future astronomical observations.

 We present a novel pipeline that uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to improve the detection capability of near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) in the context of planetary defense. Our work aims to minimize the dependency on human intervention of the current approach adopted by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). The target NEAs have a high proper motion of up to tens of degrees per day and thus appear as streaks of light in the images. We trained our CNNs to detect these streaks using three datasets: a set with real asteroid streaks, a set with synthetic (i.e., simulated) streaks and a mixed set, and tested the resultant models on real survey images. The results achieved were almost identical across the three models: $0.843\pm0.005$ in completeness and $0.820\pm0.025$ in precision. The bias on streak measurements reported by the CNNs was $1.84\pm0.03$ pixels in streak position, $0.817\pm0.026$ degrees in streak angle and $-0.048\pm0.003$ in fractional bias in streak length (computed as the absolute length bias over the streak length, with the negative sign indicating an underestimation). We compared the performance of our CNN trained with a mix of synthetic and real streaks to that of the ZTF human scanners by analyzing a set of 317 streaks flagged as valid by the scanners. Our pipeline detected $80~\%$ of the streaks found by the scanners and 697 additional streaks that were subsequently verified by the scanners to be valid streaks. These results suggest that our automated pipeline can complement the work of the human scanners at no cost for the precision and find more objects than the current approach. They also prove that the synthetic streaks were realistic enough to be used for augmenting training sets when insufficient real streaks are available or exploring the simulation of streaks with unusual characteristics that have not yet been detected.

 - **Abstract**
 In this article we extend a study of the validity conditions of the separate-universe approach of cosmological perturbations to models of inflation with multiple fields. The separate-universe approach consists in describing the universe as a collection of homogeneous and isotropic patches, giving us an effective description of perturbation theory at large scales through phase-space reduction. This approximation is a necessary step in stochastic inflation, an effective theory of coarse-grained, super-Hubble, scalar fields fluctuations. One needs a stochastic inflation description in the context of primordial black hole productions since it needs enhancements of the curvature power spectrum. It easily achievable in multifield inflation models but necessarily comes with strong diffusive effects. We study and compare cosmological perturbation theory and the separate-universe approach in said non-linear sigma models as a typical framework of multifield inflation and employing the Hamiltonian formalism to keep track of the complete phase space (or the reduced isotropic phase space in the separate-universe approach). We find that the separate-universe approach adequately describes the cosmological perturbation theory provided the wavelength of the modes considered is greater that several lower bounds that depend on the cosmological horizon and the inverse of the effective Hamiltonian masses of the fields; the latter being fixed by the coupling potential and the field-space geometry. We also compare gauge-invariant variables and several gauge fixing procedures in both approaches. For instance, we showed that the uniform-expansion gauge is nicely described by the separate-universe picture, hence qualifying its use in stochastic inflation as commonly done.

 - **Abstract**
 The period, mass ratio, eccentricity, and other orbital parameters are fundamental for investigating binary star evolution. However, the number of binaries with known orbital parameters remains limited. Utilizing the LAMOST-MRS survey, we derived orbital solutions for 665 SB2 binaries by fitting the radial velocities of 1119 SB2 systems with at least six observations, employing a modified version of Thejoker optimized for SB2 binaries. To ensure the reliability of the results, four selection criteria were applied: reduced chi-square, normalized mean absolute error, maximum phase gap, and RV distribution metric. After applying these criteria, 665 reliable orbits were retained. Comparison with Kepler, TESS, and ZTF light curve data shows excellent agreement, with discrepancies in some cases attributed to shorter pulsation periods observed in light curves. Additionally, good consistency is found between our periods and those of SB1 systems in Gaia data. These orbital solutions contribute to understanding binary star evolution and the statistical properties of binary populations.

 - **Abstract**
 A pressureless dark matter component fits well with several cosmological observations. However, there are indications that cold dark matter may encounter challenges in explaining observations at small scales, particularly at galactic scales. Observational data suggest that dark matter models incorporating a pressure component could provide solutions to these small-scale problems. In this work, we investigate the possibility that present-day dark matter may result from a decaying non-cold dark matter sector transitioning into the dark energy sector. As the sensitivity of astronomical surveys rapidly increases, we explore an interacting scenario between dark energy and non-cold dark matter, where dark energy has a constant equation of state ($w_{\rm de}$), and dark matter, being non-cold, also has a constant (non-zero) equation of state ($w_{\rm dm}$). Considering the phantom and quintessence nature of dark energy, characterized by its equation of state, we separately analyze interacting phantom and interacting quintessence scenarios. We constrain these scenarios using Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) measurements and their combination with external probes, such as DESI-BAO and PantheonPlus. From our analyses, we find that a very mild preference for non-cold dark matter cannot be excluded based on the employed datasets. Additionally, for some datasets, there is a pronounced preference for the presence of an interaction at more than 95\% confidence level (CL). Moreover, when the dark energy equation of state lies in the phantom regime, the $S_8$ tension can be alleviated. This study suggests that cosmological models incorporating a non-cold dark matter component should be considered as viable scenarios with novel phenomenological implications, as reflected in the present work.

 - **Abstract**
 The mass composition of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays is an open problem in astroparticle physics. It is usually inferred from the depth of the shower maximum (Xmax) of cosmic-ray showers, which is only ambiguously determined by modern hadronic interaction models. We examine a data-driven scenario, in which we consider the expectation value of Xmax as a free parameter. We test the novel hypothesis whether the cosmic-ray data from the Pierre Auger Observatory can be interpreted in a consistent picture, under the assumption that the mass composition of cosmic rays at the highest energies is dominated by high metallicity, resulting in pure iron nuclei at energies above ~40 EeV. We investigate the implications on astrophysical observations and hadronic interactions, and we discuss the global consistency of the data assuming this heavy-metal scenario. We conclude that the data from the Pierre Auger Observatory can be interpreted consistently if the expectation values for Xmax from modern hadronic interaction models are shifted to larger values.

          Planetary albedo is limited by the above-cloud atmosphere: Implications for sub-Neptune climate

 - **Abstract**
 Energy limits that delineate the `habitable zone' for exoplanets depend on a given exoplanet's net planetary albedo (or `Bond albedo'). We here demonstrate that the planetary albedo of an observed exoplanet is limited by the above-cloud atmosphere - the region of the atmosphere that is probed in remote observation. We derive an analytic model to explore how the maximum planetary albedo depends on the above-cloud optical depth and scattering versus absorbing properties, even in the limit of a perfectly reflective grey cloud layer. We apply this framework to sub-Neptune K2-18b, for which a high planetary albedo has recently been invoked to argue for the possibility of maintaining a liquid water ocean surface, despite K2-18b receiving an energy flux from its host star that places it inside of its estimated `habitable zone' inner edge. We use a numerical multiple-scattering line-by-line radiative transfer model to retrieve the albedo of K2-18b based on the observational constraints from the above-cloud atmosphere. Our results demonstrate that K2-18b's observed transmission spectrum already restricts its possible planetary albedo to values below the threshold required to be potentially habitable, with the data favouring a median planetary albedo of 0.17-0.18. Our results thus reveal that currently characteriseable sub-Neptunes are likely to be magma-ocean or gas-dwarf worlds. The methods that we present are generally applicable to constrain the planetary albedo of any exoplanet with measurements of its observable atmosphere, enabling the quantification of potential exoplanet habitability with current observational capabilities.

 We provide a systematic study of the Starobinsky-Higgs inflation model in the presence of an additional cubic term of the Ricci scalar. We investigate, in particular, the effects of the cubic term on the spectral index $n_s$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. Through both analytical and numerical analyses, we show that the $R^3$-corrected Starobinsky-Higgs model can achieve compatibility with cosmic microwave background observations while producing distinct observational signatures with different frequency ranges. In addition, we discuss the complementarity between different observational probes, including the scalar-induced gravitational waves and spectral distortions, offering an independent probe of the enhanced curvature perturbations. Detection prospects are also discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 Planets are a natural byproduct of the stellar formation process, resulting from local aggregations of material within the disks surrounding young stars. Whereas signatures of gas-giant planets at large orbital separations have been observed and successfully modeled within protoplanetary disks, the formation pathways of planets within their host star's future habitable zones remain poorly understood. Analyzing multiple nights of observations conducted over a short, two-month span with the MIRC-X and PIONIER instruments at the CHARA Array and VLTI, respectively, we uncover a highly active environment at the inner-edge of the planet formation region in the disk of HD 163296. In particular, we localize and track the motion of a disk feature near the dust-sublimation radius with a pattern speed of less than half the local Keplerian velocity, providing a potential glimpse at the planet formation process in action within the inner astronomical unit. We emphasize that this result is at the edge of what is currently possible with available optical interferometric techniques and behooves confirmation with a temporally dense followup observing campaign.

          Can asteroid-mass PBHDM be compatible with catalyzed phase transition interpretation of PTA?

 - **Abstract**
 Primordial black holes (PBHs) can catalyze first-order phase transitions (FOPTs) in their vicinity, potentially modifying the gravitational wave (GW) signals from PTs. In this study, we present the first comprehensive analysis of this catalytic effect during supercooled PTs within the high PBH number density regime. Applying the analytical model with envelope approximation, we derive the general expressions of GW spectrum in the presence of PBHs. We find that at relatively small PBH number densities, the GW signals are amplified due to the large-size bubbles. While higher PBH number densities suppress GW signals, since the accelerated PT progresses too rapidly. We further extend our findings to the bulk flow model and to scalar-induced GWs (SIGWs) generated during PTs. By conducting data fitting with the NANOGrav 15-year dataset, we find that the PBH catalytic effect significantly alters the estimation of PT parameters. Notably, our analysis of the bubble collision GWs reveals that, the asteroid-mass PBHs ($10^{-16} - 10^{-12} M_\odot$) as the whole dark matter is incompatible with the PT interpretation of pulsar timing array signals. However, incorporating SIGWs can reduce this incompatibility for PBHs in the mass range $10^{-14} - 10^{-12} M_\odot$.

          Unraveling the origin of giant exoplanets -- Observational implications of convective mixing

 - **Abstract**
 The connection between the atmospheric composition of giant planets and their origin remains elusive. In this study, we explore how convective mixing can link the planetary primordial state to its atmospheric composition. We simulate the long-term evolution of gas giants with masses between 0.3 and 3 Jupiter masses, considering various composition profiles and primordial entropies (assuming no entropy-mass dependence). Our results show that when convective mixing is considered, the atmospheric metallicity increases with time and that this time evolution encodes information about the planetary primordial structure. Additionally, the degree of compositional mixing affects the planetary radius, altering its evolution in a measurable way. By applying mock observations, we demonstrate that combining radius and atmospheric composition can help to constrain the planetary formation history. Young systems emerge as prime targets for such characterization, with lower-mass gas giants (approaching Saturn's mass) being particularly susceptible to mixing-induced changes. Our findings highlight convective mixing as a key mechanism for probing the primordial state of giant planets, offering new constraints on formation models and demonstrating that the conditions inside giant planets shortly after their formation are not necessarily erased over billions of years and can leave a lasting imprint on their evolution.

          Origin of the Moon's Earth-like isotopic composition from giant impact on a differential rotating proto-Earth

 - **Abstract**
 According to the giant impact theory, the Moon formed by accreting the circum-terrestrial debris disk produced by Theia colliding with the proto-Earth. The giant impact theory can explain most of the properties of the Earth-Moon system, however, simulations of giant impact between a planetary embryo and the growing proto-Earth indicate that the materials in the circum-terrestrial debris disk produced by the impact originate mainly from the impactor, contradicting with the fact that different Solar System bodies have distinct compositions. Thus, the giant impact theory has difficulty explaining the Moon's Earth-like isotopic compositions. More materials from the proto-Earth could be delivered to the circum-terrestrial debris disk when a slightly sub-Mars-sized body collides with a fast rotating planet of rigid rotation but the resulting angular momentum is too large compared with that of the current Earth-Moon system. Since planetesimals accreted by the proto-Earth hit the surface of the proto-Earth, enhancing the rotation rate of the surface of the proto-Earth. The surface's fast rotation rate relative to the slow rotation rate of the inner region of the proto-Earth leads to transfer of angular momentum from surface to inner, resulting in the differential rotation. Here, we show that the giant impact of a sub-Mars-sized body on a differential rotating proto-Earth with a fast rotating outer region and a relative slow rotating inner region could result in a circum-terrestrial debris disk with materials predominately from the proto-Earth without violating the angular momentum constraint. The theory proposed here may provide a viable way of explaining the similarity in the isotopic compositions of the Earth and Moon.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations have established that coherent radio emission from pulsars arise at few hundred kilometers above stellar surface. Recent polarization studies have further demonstrated that plasma instabilities are necessary for charge bunching that gives rise to coherent emission. The formation of charged solitons in the electron-positron plasma is the only known bunching mechanism that can be realised at these heights. More than five decades of observations have revealed a number of emission features that should emerge from any valid radio emission mechanism. We have carried out numerical calculations to find the features of average emission from curvature radiation due to charged solitons. The characteristic curvature radiation spectrum has been updated from the well known one-dimensional dependence into a general two-dimensional form, and contribution from each soliton along observer's line of sight (LOS) has been added to reproduce the pulsar emission. The outflowing plasma is formed by sparking discharges above the stellar surface that are located within concentric rings resembling the core-cone emission beam, and uniform distribution of solitons along any LOS has been assumed. The observed effects of radius to frequency mapping, where the lower frequency emission originates from higher altitudes, is seen in this setup. The power law spectrum and relative steepening of the core spectra with respect to the cones also emerges. The estimated polarization position angle reflects the geometrical configuration of pulsars as expected. These studies demonstrate the efficacy of coherent curvature radiation from charged solitons to reproduce the average observational features of pulsars.

 The study of the gravitational wave signatures of neutron star oscillations may provide important information of their interior structure and Equation of State (EoS) at high densities. We present a novel technique based on physically informed neural networks (PINNs) to solve the eigenvalue problem associated with normal oscillation modes of neutron stars. The procedure is tested in a simplified scenario, with an analytical solution, that can be used to test the performance and the accuracy of the method. We show that it is possible to get accurate results of both the eigenfrequencies and the eigenfunctions with this scheme. The flexibility of the method and its capability of adapting to complex scenarios may serve in the future as a path to include more physics into these systems.

 - **Abstract**
 One notable example of exoplanet diversity is the population of circumbinary planets, which orbit around both stars of a binary star system. There are so far only 16 known circumbinary exoplanets, all of which lie in the same orbital plane as the host binary. Suggestions exist that circumbinary planets could also exist on orbits highly inclined to the binary, close to 90$^{\circ}$, polar orbits. No such planets have been found yet but polar circumbinary gas and debris discs have been observed and if these were to form planets then those would be left on a polar orbit. We report strong evidence for a polar circumbinary exoplanet, which orbits a close pair of brown dwarfs which are on an eccentric orbit. We use radial-velocities to measure a retrograde apsidal precession for the binary, and show that this can only be attributed to the presence of a polar planet.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the impact of chemical equilibration and the resulting bulk viscosity on non-radial oscillation modes of warm neutron stars at temperatures up to T~5 MeV, relevant for protoneutron stars and neutron-star post-merger remnants. In this regime, the relaxation rate of weak interactions becomes comparable to the characteristic frequencies of composition g-modes in the core, resulting in resonant damping. To capture this effect, we introduce the dynamic sound speed, a complex, frequency-dependent generalization of the adiabatic sound speed that encodes both the restoring force and the dissipative effects of bulk compression. Using realistic weak reaction rates and three representative equations of state, we compute the complex frequencies of composition g-modes with finite-temperature profiles. We find that bulk viscous damping becomes increasingly significant with temperature and can completely suppress composition g-modes. In contrast, the f-mode remains largely unaffected by bulk viscosity due to its nearly divergence-free character. Our results highlight the sensitivity of g-mode behavior to thermal structure, weak reaction rates, and the equation of state, and establish the dynamic sound speed as a valuable descriptor characterizing oscillation properties in dissipative neutron star matter.

 We present the discovery of two quadruple star systems -- TIC 285853156 and TIC 392229331 -- each consisting of two bound eclipsing binary stars. Among the most compact quadruples known, TIC 392229331 and TIC 285853156 have the second and third shortest outer orbital periods (145 days and 152 days, respectively) after BU Canis Minoris (122 days, Pribulla et al. 2023). We demonstrate that both systems are long-term dynamically stable despite substantial outer orbital eccentricities (0.33 for TIC 285853156 and 0.56 for TIC 392229331). We previously reported these systems in Kostov et al. (2022) and Kostov et al. (2024) as 2+2 hierarchical quadruple candidates producing two sets of primary and secondary eclipses in TESS data, as well as prominent eclipse timing variations on both binary components. We combine all available TESS data and new spectroscopic observations into a comprehensive photodynamical model, proving that the component binary stars are gravitationally bound in both systems and finding accurate stellar and orbital parameters for both systems, including very precise determinations of the outer periods. TIC 285853156 and TIC 392229331 represent the latest addition to the small population of well-characterized proven quadruple systems dynamically interacting on detectable timescales.

 - **Abstract**
 The sub-Neptune frontier has opened a new window into the rich diversity of planetary environments beyond the solar system. The possibility of hycean worlds, with planet-wide oceans and H$_2$-rich atmospheres, significantly expands and accelerates the search for habitable environments elsewhere. Recent JWST transmission spectroscopy of the candidate hycean world K2-18 b in the near-infrared led to the first detections of carbon-bearing molecules CH$_4$ and CO$_2$ in its atmosphere, with a composition consistent with predictions for hycean conditions. The observations also provided a tentative hint of dimethyl sulfide (DMS), a possible biosignature gas, but the inference was of low statistical significance. We report a mid-infrared transmission spectrum of K2-18 b obtained using the JWST MIRI LRS instrument in the ~6-12 $\mu$m range. The spectrum shows distinct features and is inconsistent with a featureless spectrum at 3.4-$\sigma$ significance compared to our canonical model. We find that the spectrum cannot be explained by most molecules predicted for K2-18 b with the exception of DMS and dimethyl disulfide (DMDS), also a potential biosignature gas. We report new independent evidence for DMS and/or DMDS in the atmosphere at 3-$\sigma$ significance, with high abundance ($\gtrsim$10 ppmv) of at least one of the two molecules. More observations are needed to increase the robustness of the findings and resolve the degeneracy between DMS and DMDS. The results also highlight the need for additional experimental and theoretical work to determine accurate cross sections of important biosignature gases and identify potential abiotic sources. We discuss the implications of the present findings for the possibility of biological activity on K2-18 b.

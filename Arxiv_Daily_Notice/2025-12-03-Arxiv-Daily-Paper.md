#### Title:
          Photon (Non)Conservation in the Reduced Speed of Light Approximation and How to (Almost) Fix It

- **Abstract**
 The "Reduced Speed of Light" (RSL) approximation is commonly used to speed up radiative transfer calculations in cosmological simulations. However, it has been shown previously that the RSL approximation leads to photon non-conservation in some regimes. I show that these missing photons can be counted exactly for some numerical schemes. Adding them back into a simulation, however, is a much harder task. I show one example of such a scheme, which achieves sub-percent accuracy on simple tests. Unfortunately, the scheme performs much worse on semi-realistic simulations of cosmic reionization, leading to a faster overlap and significant errors in the point-to-point comparison of the RSL radiation field with the reference simulation that maintains the full speed of light for the radiative transfer.

- **Abstract**
 Interstellar objects (ISOs), particularly those with cometary activity, provide unique insight into the primordial physical and chemical conditions present during the formation of the planetary system in which they originated. Observations in the sub-mm regime allow for direct measurements of several parent molecules released from the comet nucleus into the coma. Here we present observations of the third ISO, 3I/ATLAS, with the `Ū`ū heterodyne receiver on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT), which targeted emission from HCN($J = 3 - 2$) and CO($J = 2 - 1$). Our observations, taken between 16 July 2025 and 21 July 2025 (UT), when 3I/ATLAS was at a heliocentric distance between 4.01 and 3.84 au, provide the earliest sub-mm constraints on its activity. We do not detect HCN or CO in these epochs, with 3$\sigma$ upper-limits on the production rates of $Q(HCN) < 1.7 \times 10^{24}$ s$^{-1}$ at $r_h = 4.01 - 3.97$ au and $Q(CO) < 1.1 \times 10^{27}$ s$^{-1}$ at $r_h = 3.94 - 3.84$ au, respectively. We combine this HCN limit with later JCMT observations of HCN to constrain its temporal evolution. Fitting the HCN detections with a $Q(HCN) \propto r_h^{-n}$ model and accounting for the upper-limits yields $n = 12.7^{+6.9}_{-2.5}$. This slope is steeper than those of typical Solar System comets, but consistent with the production rate slopes measured for other species in the coma of 3I/ATLAS.

          OASIS Survey Direct Imaging and Astrometric Discovery of HIP 71618 B: A Substellar Companion Suitable for the Roman Coronagraph Technology Demonstration

- **Abstract**
 We present the OASIS survey program discovery of a substellar companion orbiting the young A1V star HIP 71618, detected using precision astrometry from \textit{Gaia and Hipparcos} and high-contrast imaging with SCExAO/CHARIS and Keck/NIRC2. Atmospheric modeling favors a spectral type of M5--M8 and a temperature of $\sim$2700 $\pm$ 100 $K$. Dynamical modeling constrains HIP 71618 B's mass to be ${60}_{-21}^{+27}$ $M_{\rm Jup}$ or ${65}_{-29}^{+54}$ $M_{\rm Jup}$, depending on the adopted companion mass prior. It has a nearly edge-on, 11 au-orbit with a high eccentricity. HIP 71618 B will be located within Roman Coronagraph's dark hole region during the instrument's technological demonstration phase. A high signal-to-noise ratio detection of HIP 71618 B at 575 nm would demonstrate a 5-$\sigma$ contrast of 10$^{-7}$ or better. The system is also located within or very close to Roman's Continuous Viewing Zone -- near multiple candidate reference stars for dark-hole digging -- and its primary is bright ($V$ $\approx$ 5). The suitability of HIP 71618 as one potential Roman Coronagraph target for demonstrating the instrument's core requirement (TTR5) should motivate the timely, deep vetting of candidate reference stars.
#### Title:
          SCExAO/CHARIS and Gaia Direct Imaging and Astrometric Discovery of a Superjovian Planet 3--4 lambda/D from the Accelerating Star HIP 54515

- **Abstract**
 We present the discovery of a superjovian planet around the young A5 star HIP 54515, detected using precision astrometry from the \textit{Hipparcos Gaia Catalogue of Accelerations} and high-contrast imaging with SCExAO/CHARIS from the recently-commenced \surveyname\ program. SCExAO/CHARIS detects HIP 54515 b in five epochs 0\farcs{}145--0\farcs{}192 from the star ($\sim$3--4 $\lambda$/D at 1.65 $\mu m$), exhibiting clockwise orbital motion. HIP 54515 b lies near the M/L transition with a luminosity of log(L/L$_{\rm \odot}$) $\sim$ -3.52 $\pm$ 0.03. Dynamical modeling constrains its mass and mass ratio to be ${17.7}_{-4.9}^{+7.6}$ $M_{\rm Jup}$ and ${0.0090}_{-0.0024}^{+0.0036}$ and favors a $\sim$25 au semimajor axis. HIP 54515 b adds to a growing list of superjovian planets with moderate eccentricities (e $\approx$ 0.4). Now the third planet discovered from surveys combining high-contrast extreme adaptive optics imaging with precision astrometry, HIP 54515 b should help improve empirical constraints on the luminosity evolution and eccentricity distribution of the most massive planets. It may also provide a key technical test of the Roman Space Telescope Coronagraph Instrument's performance in the low stellar flux, small angular separation limit and a demonstration of its ability to yield constrainable planet spectral properties.

- **Abstract**
 The well-known correlation between stellar metallicity and planet occurrence is strongest for giant planets, but weaker for smaller planets, suggesting that detailed elemental patterns beyond [Fe/H] may be relevant. Using abundances from the fourth data release of the GALAH spectroscopic survey, we analyzed 104 host stars with 141 confirmed transiting planets. We divide planets at 2.6 Earth radii, the theoretical threshold radius above which planets are unlikely to be pure-water worlds. We find that large-planet hosts are enriched by approximately 0.2 dex in iron and show a possible excess of highly volatile elements (C, N, O), though these measurements are affected by observational limitations, whereas small-planet hosts exhibit an enhanced contribution of the classical rock-forming elements (Mg, Si, Ca, Ti) relative to iron, corresponding to a modest [Rock/Fe] offset of 0.06 dex, which is statistically significant, with a p value of 10^{-4}. These offsets remain significant for alternative radius cuts. A matched control sample of non-planet-host stars shows only weak and mostly statistically insignificant similar trends, confirming that the stronger chemical signatures are linked to the planetary characteristics. As our study relies on transiting planets, it mainly probes short-period systems (periods shorter than 100 days). These results refine the planet-metallicity relation, highlighting the role of the relative balance between iron, volatiles, and rock-forming elements in planet formation.

- **Abstract**
 The chemical abundance of the interstellar medium sets the initial conditions for star formation and provides a probe of chemical galaxy evolution models. However, unresolved inhomogeneities in the electron temperature can lead to a systematic underestimation of the abundances. We aim to directly test this effect. We use the SDSS-V Local Volume Mapper to spatially map the physical conditions of the Trifid Nebula (M 20), a Galactic H II region ionized by a single mid-type O star, at 0.24 pc resolution. We exploit various emission lines (e.g., Hydrogen recombination lines and collisionally excited lines, including also faint auroral lines) and compute spatially resolved maps of [O II] and [S II] electron densities; [N II], [O II], [S II], [S III] electron temperatures; and the ionic oxygen abundances. We find internal variations of electron density that result from the ionization front, along with a negative radial gradient. However, we do not find strong gradients or structures in the electron temperature and the total oxygen abundance, making the Trifid Nebula a relatively homogeneous H II region at the observed spatial scale. We compare these spatially resolved properties with equivalent integrated measurements of the Trifid Nebula and find no significant variations between integrated and spatially resolved conditions. This isolated H II region, ionized by a single O-star, represents a test case of an ideal Strömgren sphere. The physical conditions in the Trifid Nebula behave as expected, with no significant differences between integrated and resolved measurements.

          A new constraint on the $y$-distortion with FIRAS: implications for feedback models in galaxy formation and cosmic shear measurements

- **Abstract**
 The $y$-type distortion of the blackbody spectrum of the cosmic microwave background radiation probes the pressure of the gas trapped in galaxy groups and clusters. We reanalyze archival data of the FIRAS instrument with an improved astrophysical foreground cleaning technique, and measure a mean $y$-distortion of $\langle y\rangle = (1.2\pm 2.0) \times 10^{-6}$ ($\langle y\rangle\lesssim 5.2\times 10^{-6}$ at 95\% C.L.), a factor of $\sim 3$ tighter than the original FIRAS results. This measurement directly rules out many models of baryonic feedback as implemented in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, mostly using information in objects with mass $M\lesssim 10^{14} {\rm M}_{\odot}$. We discuss its implications for the analysis of cosmic shear and kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect data, and future spectral distortion experiments.

 - **Abstract**
 The formation of compact high-redshift star-forming clumps, the physical processes driving their evolution and their potential connection to present-day Globular Clusters are key open questions in galaxy formation. In this work, we aim to shed light on these aspects using the SImulating the Environment where Globular clusters Emerged (SIEGE) project, a suite of cosmological zoom-in simulations with sub-parsec resolution specifically designed to investigate the physical conditions behind the origin of compact stellar systems in high-redshift environments. The simulation object of this study focuses on a dwarf galaxy with a virial mass of a few $10^9$ $M_\odot$ at $z=6.14$, where the spatial resolution reaches 0.3 pc $h^{-1}$. Individual stars are formed directly by sampling the initial mass function with a 100\% star formation efficiency, a setup designed to explore the impact of a high star formation efficiency under high-redshift conditions. The simulation reveals the emergence of numerous stellar clumps with sizes of 1-3 pc, stellar surface densities up to almost $10^4$ $M_\odot$ pc$^{-2}$, and masses predominantly spanning from $10^3$ $M_\odot$ to several $10^4$ $M_\odot$, with a few reaching $10^5$ $M_\odot$ and up to $10^6$ $M_\odot$. All clumps form during intense, short bursts of star formation lasting less than a Myr, often with negligible dark matter content (dark-to-stellar mass ratios below 1 within three times their effective radii). We measure a clear correlation between mass and size, and a clump mass function described by a power-law with a slope of -2. Star formation conditions in the simulation behave similarly to those of a feedback-free starburst scenario, where dense clumps form due to inefficient stellar feedback over small timescales. Notably, some clumps exhibit properties closely resembling those of present-day globular clusters.

 - **Abstract**
 The steady-state gamma-ray emission from the Sun is thought to consist of two emission components due to interactions with Galactic cosmic rays: (1) a hadronic component covering the solar disk, and (2) a leptonic component peaking at the solar edge and extending into the heliosphere. The flux of these components is expected to vary with the 11-year solar cycle, being highest during solar minimum and lowest during solar maximum, because it is correlated with the cosmic-ray flux. No study has yet analyzed the flux variation of the two components separately over solar cycles. In this work, we measure the temporal variations of the flux of each component over 15 years of Fermi Large Area Telescope observations and compare them with the sunspot number and Galactic cosmic-ray flux from AMS-02 near the Earth. We find that the flux variation of the disk anticorrelates with solar activity and correlates with cosmic-ray protons, confirming its emission mechanism. The flux variation of the extended component anticorrelates with solar activity only until mid 2012. After that, we no longer observe any correlation or anticorrelation, even with the CR electron flux. This most likely suggests that cosmic-ray transport and modulation in the inner heliosphere are unexpectedly complex and different for electrons and protons or, alternatively, the presence of an additional, unknown component of gamma rays or cosmic rays. These findings impact space weather research and emphasize the need for close monitoring of Cycle 25 and the ongoing polarity reversal.

          Analysis of Two Models for the Angular Structure of the Outflows Producing the Swift/XRT "Larger-Angle Emission" of Gamma-Ray Bursts

 - **Abstract**
 The instantaneous emission from a relativistic surface endowed with a Lorentz factor $\Gamma$ that decreases away from the outflow symmetry axis can naturally explain the three phases observed by Swift/XRT in GRBs and their afterglows (GRB tail, afterglow plateau and post-plateau). We expand the analytical formalism of the "Larger-Angle Emission" model previously developed for "Power-Law" outflows to "n-Exponential" outflows (e.g. exponential with $n=1$ and Gaussian with $n=2$) and compare their abilities to account for the X-ray emission of XRT afterglows. We assume power-law $\Gamma$-dependences of two spectral characteristics (peak-energy and peak intensity) and find that, unlike Power-Law outflows, n-Exponential outflows cannot account for plateaus with a temporal dynamical range larger than 100. To include all information existing in the Swift/XRT measurements of X-ray aferglows (0.3-10 keV unabsorbed flux and effective spectral slope), we calculate 0.3 keV and 10 keV light-curves using a broken power-law emission spectrum of peak-energy and low-and high-energy slopes that are derived from the effective slope measured by XRT. This economical peak-energy determination is found to be consistent with more expensive spectral fits. The angular distributions of the Lorentz factor, comoving frame peak-energy, and peak-intensity ($\Gamma (\theta), E'_p (\theta), i'_p(\theta)$) constrain the (yet-to-be determined) convolution of various features of the production of relativistic jets by solar-mass black-holes and of their propagation through the progenitor/circumburst medium, while the $E'_p (\Gamma)$ and $i'_p (\Gamma)$ dependences may constrain the GRB dissipation mechanism and the GRB emission process.

          EXP: a Python/C++ package for basis function expansion methods in galactic dynamics

 - **Abstract**
 We present the public release of EXP, a basis function expansion C++ library and Python package for running N-body galactic simulations and dynamical discovery. EXP grew out of the need for methodology that seamlessly connects theoretical descriptions of dynamics, N-body simulations, and compact descriptions of observed data. EXP decomposes a galaxy into multiple bases for a variety of scales and geometries and is thus able to represent arbitrarily complex simulations with many components (e.g., disk, bulge, dark matter halo, satellites). pyEXP provides a full Python interface to the EXP C++ libraries. Example workflows based on previously published work are available and distributed as accompanying examples and tutorials. The examples and tutorials flatten the learning curve for adopting basis function expansion tools to generate and analyze the significance of coefficients and discover dynamical relationships using time series analysis. The current release uses a powerful, non-parametric technique for time series analysis that decomposes basis function expansion coefficients into interpretable components without assuming a specific model structure. This enables the automated discovery of dynamical signals from simulations. We provide a full online manual hosted by Read the Docs.

          Satellite Streak Brightness Variation with Orbit Height

 - **Abstract**
 We study the apparent optical brightness of satellite streaks in ground-based observatory cameras as the orbit height is varied. This is done via simulations. Several factors are in play: the range to the satellite, satellite size and geometry, the diameter of the telescope aperture, and the angular velocity of the satellite image as it streaks across the camera's focal plane. For a large telescope aperture, a satellite in a lower orbit becomes out-of-focus in a camera focused at infinity. In the case of Rubin Observatory's LSSTCam, we find that these factors nearly cancel as a large satellite is moved from an orbit at 550 km down to 350 km.

          RM jitter: Wavelength-dependent Scatter in Rotation Measure Related to Faraday Complexity

 - **Abstract**
 The relation between Faraday Rotation Measure (RM) and differential Faraday rotation by unresolved structure of a turbulent plasma is investigated for extragalactic radio sources. The RM scatter of a sample of sources affected by turbulent Faraday screens with identical power spectra of Faraday depth structure, is referred to as RM jitter. For fixed amplitude and slope of the power spectrum, the range of possible RMs depends on the wavelength coverage of the survey. RM jitter is independent of Faraday depth resolution as it results from the true Faraday depth dispersion and effects of wavelength-dependent depolarization. RM jitter for a flux density limited sample is sensitive to the power law index gamma of the power spectrum of Faraday depth structure. Assuming depolarization by a turbulent Faraday screen for all sources, a simulated flux-density-limited sample can reproduce the high RM scatter found by Vanderwoude et al. (2024) for sources that are less than 3% polarized. RM jitter of sources that are more than 3% polarized, is found to be smaller than the observed scatter, indicating that plasma other than the near-source environment dominates the RM scatter for the more polarized sources. The significance of RM jitter for applications of the RM grid is discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 The radiation mechanism of decimetric wideband and pulsating radio bursts from the Sun (in terms of decimetric type-IV (t-IVdm) burst) and other flaring stars is a long-standing problem. Early investigations were based on the leading-spot hypothesis for the sun and yielded contradictory results. Here we provide essential evidence to support the scenario that these bursts are induced by the electron cyclotron maser emission (ECME) driven by energetic electrons mirrored in converging sunspot fields. This is done by analyzing 2 flare-associated t-IVdm bursts that are selected from a larger sample of 60 bursts recorded during 2010-2014, according to the levels of polarization and whether the source-field orientation can be unambiguously determined. We further modeled the transport of downward-streaming energetic electrons along a coronal loop and found most electrons get mirrored within the specific altitude range of 20-100 Mm. This explains why such bursts tend to have well-defined spectral ranges. The study greatly expands the application of ECME in solar radio astronomy and provides solar samples for similar bursts from other flaring stars.

          The Abundance Origin Of A Highly r-process-Enhanced r-II Star: LAMOST J020623.21+494127.9

 - **Abstract**
 Object LAMOST J020623.21+494127.9 (program star) in the thin disk of the Milky Way (MW) is reported as a highly r-process-enhanced (RPE) r-II star with[Eu/Fe]= +1.32 and [Fe/H]= -0.54. The chemical profile of the star reflects the intrinsic composition of the gas cloud present at its birth. Using an abundance decomposition method, we fit 25 elements from the abundance dataset, including 10 heavy neutron capture elements. We explore the astrophysical origin of the elements in this star through its abundance ratios and component ratios. We find that the contributions from the massive stars played a significant role in the production of light elements in the program star. Our analysis reveals that the heavy neutron-capture elements are produced purely by the main r-process. However, the adopted main r-process model does not adequately fit the observed data, suggesting another main r-process pattern may exist.

 - **Abstract**
 The properties of X-ray flashes (XRFs) and X-ray rich gamma-ray bursts (XRRs) as compared with classical gamma-ray bursts (C-GRBs) have been widely discussed during the \emph{Swift} era. It has been proposed that XRFs and XRRs are low-energy extensions of the GRB population so that they should follow similar correlations. To further examine this idea, we collect a sample of $303$ GRBs detected by \emph{Swift} over the past two decades, all of which have reliable redshifts and spectral parameters. The bursts are classified into XRFs, XRRs, and C-GRBs based on their softness ratio (SR), which is calculated by dividing the $25-50$ keV fluence with the $50-100$ keV fluence. A strong correlation is found among the isotropic energy $E_{\mathrm{iso}}$, peak luminosity $L_{\mathrm{p}}$, and rest frame burst duration $T_{90, \mathrm{rest}}$, i.e., $E_{\mathrm{iso}} \propto L_{\mathrm{p}}^{0.88\pm0.02} T_{90, \mathrm{rest}}^{0.58\pm0.02}$. Additionally, two tight three-parameter correlations involving SR and the rest-frame peak energy $E_{\mathrm{p}}$ are also derived, i.e. $E_{\mathrm{p}} \propto E_{\mathrm{iso}}^{0.20\pm0.02} \mathrm{SR}^{-2.27\pm0.15}$ and $E_{\mathrm{p}} \propto L_{\mathrm{p}}^{0.17\pm0.02} \mathrm{SR}^{-2.33\pm0.14}$. It is interesting to note that XRFs, XRRs, and C-GRBs all follow the above correlations. The implications of these correlations and their potential application in cosmology are discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the relativistic jet of the powerful radio-emitting blazar J1429+5406 at redshift z=3.015. Our understanding of jet kinematics in z>3 quasars is still rather limited, based on a sample of less than about 50 objects. The blazar J1429+5406 was observed at a high angular resolution using the method of very long baseline interferometry over more than two decades, between 1994 and 2018. These observations were conducted at five radio frequencies, covering a wide range from 1.7 to 15 GHz. The outer jet components at ~20-40 milliarcsecond (mas) separations from the core do not show discernible apparent motion. On the other hand, three jet components within the central 10 mas region exhibit significant proper motion in the range of (0.045-0.16)mas/year, including one that is among the fastest-moving jet components at z>3 known to date. Based on the proper motion of the innermost jet component and the measured brightness temperature of the core, we estimated the Doppler factor, the bulk Lorentz factor, and the inclination angle of the jet with respect to the line of sight. The core brightness temperature is at least 3.6 x 10^{11} K, well exceeding the equipartition limit, indicating Doppler-boosted radio emission. The low jet inclination (<5.4 deg) firmly places J1429+5406 into the blazar category.

          Origin of moderately volatile elements in Earth inferred from mass-dependent Ge isotope variations among chondrites

 - **Abstract**
 The bulk silicate Earth (BSE) is depleted in moderately volatile elements, indicating Earth formed from a mixture of volatile-rich and -poor materials. To better constrain the origin and nature of Earth's volatile-rich building blocks, we determined the mass-dependent isotope compositions of Ge in carbonaceous (CC) and enstatite chondrites. We find that, similar to other moderately volatile elements, the Ge isotope variations among the chondrites reflect mixing between volatile-rich, isotopically heavy matrix and volatile-poor, isotopically light chondrules. The Ge isotope composition of the BSE is within the chondritic range and can be accounted for as a ~2:1 mixture of CI and enstatite chondrite-derived Ge. This mixing ratio appears to be distinct from the ~1:2 ratio inferred for Zn, reflecting the different geochemical behavior of Ge (siderophile) and Zn (lithophile), and suggesting the late-stage addition of volatile-rich CC materials to Earth. On dynamical grounds it has been argued that Earth accreted CC material through a few Moon-sized embryos, in which case the Ge isotope results imply that these objects were volatile-rich, presumably because they were either undifferentiated or accreted volatile-rich objects themselves before being accreted by Earth.

          The role of stellar model input in correcting the asteroseismic scaling relations. Red giant branch models

 - **Abstract**
 This study investigates the variability of the theoretical correction factor, $f_{\Delta \nu}$, used in red giant branch (RGB) scaling relations, arising from different assumptions in stellar model computations. Adopting a commonly used framework, we focused on a 1.0 $M_{\odot}$ star and systematically varied seven input parameters: the reference solar mixture, the initial helium abundance, the inclusion of microscopic diffusion and mass loss, the method for calculating atmospheric opacity, the mixing-length parameter, and the boundary conditions. Each parameter was tested using two distinct but physically plausible values to mimic possible choices of different evolutionary codes. For each resulting stellar model, we computed the oscillation frequencies along the RGB and derived the large frequency spacing, $\Delta \nu_0$. The correction factor $f_{\Delta \nu}$ was then calculated by comparing the derived $\Delta \nu_0$ with that predicted by the uncorrected scaling relations. We found substantial variability in $f_{\Delta \nu}$ across the different models. The variation ranged from approximately 1.3% in the lower RGB to about 3% at $\log g = 1.4$. This level of variability is significant, as it corresponds to roughly half the values typically quoted in the literature and leads to a systematic change in derived masses from 5% to more than 10%. The most significant contribution to this variability came from the choice of atmospheric opacity calculation (approximately 1.2%), with a smaller contribution from the inclusion of microscopic diffusion (approximately 0.4%). These results indicate that the choice of the reference stellar model has a non-negligible impact on the calculation of correction factors applied to RGB star scaling relations.

          N-body simulations of the Self-Confinement of Viscous Self-Gravitating Narrow Eccentric Planetary Ringlets

 - **Abstract**
 Narrow eccentric planetary ringlets have sharp edges, sizable eccentricity gradients, and a confinement mechanism that prevents radial spreading due to ring viscosity. Most proposed ringlet confinement mechanisms presume that there are one or more shepherd satellites whose gravitational perturbations keeps the ringlet confined radially, but the absence of such shepherds in Cassini observations of Saturn's rings casts doubt upon those ringlet confinement mechanisms. The following uses a suite of N-body simulations to explore an alternate scenario, whereby ringlet self-gravity drives a narrow eccentric ringlet into a self-confining state. These simulations show that, under a wide variety of initial conditions, an eccentric ringlet's secular perturbations of itself causes the eccentricity of its outer edge to grow at the expense of its inner edge. This causes the ringlet's nonlinearity parameter $q$ to grow over time until it exceeds the $q\simeq\sqrt{3}/2$ threshold where the ringlet's orbit-averaged angular momentum flux due to viscosity + self-gravity is zero. The absence of any net radial angular momentum transfer through the ringlet means that the ringlet has settled into a self-confining state, i.e. it does not spread radially due to its viscosity, and simulations also show that such ringlets have sharp edges. Nonetheless, viscosity still circularizes the ringlet in time $\tau_e\sim10^6$ orbits $\sim1000$ years, which will cause the ringlet's nonlinearity parameter to shrink below the $q\simeq\sqrt{3}/2$ threshold and allows radial spreading to resume. Either sharp-edged narrow eccentric ringlets are transient phenomena, or exterior perturbations are also sustaining the ringlet's eccentricity. We then speculate about how such ringlets might come to be.

          A G2-Holonomy Model for Late-Time Cosmic Acceleration in M-theory: Alleviating the Hubble Tension through Geometric Vacuum Energy

 - **Abstract**
 A framework is presented within an eleven-dimensional M-theory scenario wherein dynamical geometric moduli, arising from a G2-holonomy compactification, yield an evolving cosmological term Lambda(z). This "geometric vacuum energy" is distinct from conventional dark energy in two main aspects: (i) its origin lies in extra-dimensional fluxes and instanton-like corrections embedded within the moduli potential, and (ii) it exhibits a moderate peak at intermediate redshifts. This feature provides a mechanism to partially mitigate the Hubble tension, elevating the inferred H0 value from ~67 to ~69.5 km s^-1 Mpc^-1 without disrupting the overall concordance of the cosmological model. Furthermore, the inclusion of mild spatial openness (Omega_k0 ~ 0.097) and a slightly reduced matter fraction (Omega_m0 ~ 0.25) relative to standard LambdaCDM allows the geometry-driven Lambda(z) to naturally maintain a cosmic age near 13.8 Gyr. Initial numerical checks indicate that the calibrated model achieves chi^2/nu ~ 1 for H(z) data (chi^2 ~ 26 for 24 points) and yields a structure growth amplitude S8 ~ 0.74, consistent with current observational bounds. While not a definitive solution, these results illustrate a potential pathway for reconciling certain late-time cosmological puzzles through a slight deviation from a pure cosmological constant, rooted in G2-compactified M-theory. The findings suggest a UV-complete geometric origin for dark energy. Further developments, including detailed statistical analyses, N-body simulations, and explicit G2 constructions, are anticipated to refine and test the parameter space of this model.

 - **Abstract**
 A new SPHERE seires complex extensive air showers detector is under development. The main goal of its mission is to study the mass composition of cosmic ray nuclei in the 1-100 PeV energy range at a new level. The already well-established telescope of Cherenkov light reflected from the snow-covered ice surface of Lake Baikal from an altitude of 500-1000 m will be supported by a detector of direct light pointed upward. Since the two detectors will study the same shower at different stages of its development, it could be called a 3D detection, which is completely new for the EAS method. The development is based on an extensive MC modeling of the shower and the detection process using the Supercomputer Complex of the Lomonosov Moscow State University.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations by the James Webb Space Telescope have uncovered a population of compact, red object ($z\sim 4\text{--}7$) known as little red dots (LRDs). The presence of broad Balmer emission lines indicates active galactic nuclei powered by supermassive black holes (BHs), while LRDs exhibit unusually weak X-ray and radio emission and low variability, suggesting super-Eddington accretion that obscures the central engine. We suggest that such an extreme accretion disc inevitably drives strong outflows, which would disrupt the LRDs themselves unless confined within the nuclear region -- posing a general feedback problem for overmassive BHs. To resolve this, we propose that the BH is embedded in a massive, optically thick envelope that gravitationally confines the outflow, making any outflow a no-go. This envelope, powered by accretion on to the BH, radiates at nearly the Eddington limit, and is sustained by an infall of the interstellar medium at a rate on the order of $\sim 1 M_{\odot}~{\rm yr}^{-1}$. A photosphere emerges either within the envelope or in the infalling medium, with a characteristic temperature of $5000$ - $7000 {\rm K}$, near the Hayashi limit. The resulting blackbody emission naturally explains the red optical continuum of the distinct V-shaped spectrum observed in most LRDs. Furthermore, the dynamical time-scale at the photosphere, $\sim 0.01~{\rm pc}$, is consistent with the observed year-scale variabilities. The nuclear structure and spectral features of LRDs are shaped by this envelope, which not only regulates feedback but also acts as a gas reservoir that sustains rapid BH growth in the early universe.

 - **Abstract**
 This is a brief review of the recent progress in understanding the evolution of the accretion disks in tidal disruption events (TDEs). Special attention is paid to (1) thermal-viscous instability that causes the disk to transition from a thick state to a thin one, and back and forth, (2) interactions between the fallback material and existing disk. Challenges to the current model from late-time X-ray observations are highlighted and possible solutions are discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 Since the start of operations in 2011, the VLT Survey Telescope (VST) has been one of the most efficient wide-field imagers in the optical bands. However, in the next years the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will be a game-changer in this field. Hence, the timing is appropriate for specializing the VST with additions that can make it unique in well-defined scientific cases. VSTPOL is a project that aims to provide the addition of wide-field polarimetric capabilities to the VST telescope, making it the first large survey telescope for linear optical polarimetry. Actually, while there are quite a number of optical telescopes, the telescopes providing polarimetric instrumentation are just a few. The number of relatively large mirror polarimetric telescopes is small, although they would be specifically needed e.g. to support many science cases of the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) that, in the southern hemisphere, is co-located with the VST. The VST telescope is equipped with a single instrument, the OmegaCAM wide-field imaging camera operating in the visible bands with a field of view of 1$^\circ\times1^\circ$. The polarimetric mode will be implemented through the insertion of a large rotatable polarizer installed on the field-corrector optics, which will be exchangeable with the non-polarimetric corrector optics. The limiting polarimetric systematic errors due to variable atmospheric conditions and instrumental polarization can be corrected down to a level of $\sim10^{-3}$ by leveraging the large amount of unpolarized stars within each field-of-view. By the user point of view, VSTPOL will be an additional mode for the VST wide-field imaging camera.

 - **Abstract**
 Abundances of M dwarfs, being the most numerous stellar type in the Galaxy, can enhance our understanding of planet formation processes. They can also be used to study the chemical evolution of the Galaxy, where in particular alpha-capture elements play an important role. We aim to obtain abundances for Fe, Ti, and Ca for a small sample of well-known M dwarfs for which interferometric measurements are available. These stars and their abundances are intended to serve as a benchmark for future large-scale spectroscopic studies. We analysed spectra obtained with the GIANO-B spectrograph. Turbospectrum and the wrapper TSFitPy were used with MARCS atmospheric models in order to fit synthetic spectra to the observed spectra. We performed a differential abundance analysis in which we also analysed a solar spectrum with the same method and then subtracted the derived abundances line-by-line. The median was taken as the final abundance for each element and each star. Our abundances of Fe, Ti, and Ca agree mostly within uncertainties when comparing with other values from the literature. However, there are few studies to compare with.

 - **Abstract**
 The study of the redshifted spectral lines can provide a measure of the fundamental constants over large look-back times. Current grand unified theories predict an evolution in these and astronomical observations offer the only experimental measure of the values of the constants over large time scales. Of particular interest are the dimensionless constants; the fine structure constant ($\alpha$), the proton-electron mass ratio ($\mu$) and the proton g-factor ($g_p$), since these do not require a `standard metre-stick'. Here we present a re-analysis of the 18-cm hydroxyl (OH) lines at $z=0.89$, recently detected with the MeerKAT telescope, towards the radio source PKS\,1830-211. Utilizing the previous constraint of $\Delta\mu/\mu=(-1.8\pm1.2)\times10^{-7}$, we obtain $\Delta (\alpha g_p^{0.27})/(\alpha g_p^{0.27})\lesssim5.7\times10^{-5}$, $\Delta \alpha/\alpha\lesssim2.3\times10^{-3}$ and $\Delta g_p/g_p\lesssim7.9\times10^{-3}$. These new constraints are consistent with no evolution over a look-back time of 7.3 Gyr and provide another valuable data point in the putative evolution in the constants.

 - **Abstract**
 To describe a general bound binary black hole system, we need to consider orbital eccentricity and the misalignment of black holes' spin vectors with respect to the orbital angular momentum. While binary black holes produced through many formation channels have negligible eccentricity close to merger, they often have a non-negligible eccentricity at formation, and dynamical interactions could produce binaries with non-negligible eccentricity in the bands of current and proposed gravitational-wave (GW) detectors. Another quantity that carries information about the formation channel is the angle between each black hole's spin vector and the binary's orbital angular momentum (referred to as the spin tilt) at formation. The spin tilts inferred in GW astronomy are usually those when the binary is in the band of a GW detector, but these can differ significantly from those at formation. Therefore, it is necessary to evolve the binary back in time to compute the tilts at formation. For many formation scenarios, the tilts in the formal limit of infinite orbital angular momentum, also known as tilts at infinity, are a good approximation to those at formation. We thus generalize the publicly available \texttt{tilts\_at\_infinity} code to compute the tilts at infinity for eccentric, spin-precessing binaries. This code employs hybrid post-Newtonian evolution, starting with orbit-averaged evolution for higher frequencies and then transitioning to precession-averaged evolution to compute the tilts at infinity. We find that the transition frequency used in the quasicircular case still gives acceptably small errors in the eccentric case, and show that eccentricity and hybrid evolution both have a significant effect on the tilts at infinity for many binaries. Finally, we give examples of cases where the tilts at infinity are and are not a good approximation to the tilts at formation in the eccentric case.

 - **Abstract**
 Flows around compact objects are necessarily transonic. Due to their dissipative nature, finding of sonic points is not trivial. Becker and Le in 2003 (BL03) proposed a novel methodology to obtain global transonic solutions, using iterative relaxation technique and exploiting the inner boundary conditions of the central object. In the current work, we propose a generic methodology -- IRM-SP and IRM-SHOCK to obtain any class of global accretion and wind solutions, given a set of constants of motion. We have considered viscosity in the system, which transports angular momentum outwards. In addition, it heats the system. Radiative processes like bremsstrahlung which cools the system is also incorporated. An interplay between heating and cooling process, along with gravity and centrifugal forces gives rise to multiple sonic points and hence shocks. The proposed methodology successfully generates any class of accretion as well as wind solutions, allowing us to unify them. Additionally, we report here rigorously the mathematical as well as the computational algorithm needed, to find sonic point(s) and thus obtain global transonic flows around compact objects.

 The radio quasar NVSS~J171822+423948 (J1718+4239) was proposed as the counterpart of the IceCube neutrino event IC-201221A. To reveal the nature of the source, we conducted new very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations of this blazar candidate with the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA). The observations were carried out in dual-band mode between $4$ and $7$~GHz. Archival radio data from the literature were also collected for comparison. Our analysis revealed highly variable, Doppler-boosted radio emission of the source, with compact structure at both kpc and pc scales, a slightly inverted spectrum, and a maximum jet inclination angle of $\theta\le5\degr$. These results confirm J1718+4239 as a blazar-type object.

 - **Abstract**
 Long uninterrupted observations of the X-ray binary system Her X-1 were performed with the Mikhail Pavlinsky ART-XC telescope of the Spectrum-Röntgen-Gamma (SRG) X-ray Observatory in the 4--25 keV energy range with a total exposure of about two days around the main turn-on of the X-ray source. We present the results of timing and spectral analysis of these observations. The opening of the X-ray source is determined to occur at the orbital phase $\phi_{b}\approx 0.25$. The analysis of the X-ray light curve reveals a first direct observational evidence of the nutation of a tilted precessing accretion disk with a period of $\simeq0.87$ days. The appearance of X-ray pulsations near the orbital phase $\phi_{b}\simeq 0.77$ prior to the main turn-on at the maximum of the nutation variability has been also detected. During the X-ray eclipse, a non-zero X-ray flux is measured, which is presumably associated with scattering of an X-ray emission in a hot corona around the optical star illuminated by the X-rays from the central neutron star. An increase in the X-ray flux after the main turn-on can be described by the passage of the radiation from the central source through a scattering corona above the precessing accretion disk.

 - **Abstract**
 To assess the significance and scale dependence of anomalous large scale modes in the CatWISE quasar data, we generate smoothed number density fields on the sphere and study their extreme values -- maximum, minimum, maximum antipodal difference. By comparing these summary statistics to those obtained from random isotropic realisations of the data, we determine the statistical significance of large scale modes as a function of smoothing scale. We perform our analysis using five different versions of the data -- the original quasar map, the maps after separately subtracting the ecliptic bias and the CMB dipole, the map obtained after subtracting both, and the map after subtracting the ecliptic bias and anomalous dipole inferred in \cite{Secrest2021}. We find that the ecliptic-corrected, CMB dipole-removed map exhibits large scale modes that are in tension with random realisations of the data (p-values $p \sim 10^{-4}$), over a wide range of smoothing scales $\pi/8 \leq \delta \leq \pi/2$. The most prominent feature in the data is an underdensity in the southern galactic plane at $(b,\ell) = (-31^\circ,78^\circ)$, which reaches its highest statistical significance when smoothed on scales $\delta = \pi/6$ ($p \ll 10^{-5}$). Notably, the minima statistics align with the maximum antipodal difference statistics, whereas the maxima do not. This suggests that the observed dipole-like behavior in the data is primarily driven by the underdensity in the southern sky. The ecliptic corrected, anomalous dipole subtracted map reduces the significance of any residual anisotropic features, but an underdensity in the south sky persists with p-value $p =0.0018$.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. We present simulations of a massive young star cluster using \textsc{Nbody6++GPU} and \textsc{MOCCA}. The cluster is initially more compact than previously published models, with one million stars, a total mass of $5.86 \times 10^5~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$, and a half-mass radius of $0.1~\mathrm{pc}$. Aims. We analyse the formation and growth of a very massive star (VMS) through successive stellar collisions and investigate the subsequent formation of an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) in the core of a dense star cluster. Methods. We use both direct \textit{N}-body and Monte Carlo simulations, incorporating updated stellar evolution prescriptions (SSE/BSE) tailored to massive stars and VMSs. These include revised treatments of stellar radii, rejuvenation, and mass loss during collisions. While the prescriptions represent reasonable extrapolations into the VMS regime, the internal structure and thermal state of VMSs formed through stellar collisions remain uncertain, and future work may require further refinement. Results. We find that runaway stellar collisions in the cluster core produce a VMS exceeding $5 \times 10^4~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ within 5 Myr, which subsequently collapses into an IMBH. Conclusions. Our model suggests that dense stellar environments may enable the formation of very massive stars and massive black hole seeds through runaway stellar collisions. These results provide a potential pathway for early black hole growth in star clusters and offer theoretical context for interpreting recent JWST observations of young, compact clusters at high redshift.

 - **Abstract**
 Small (400 to 4000 km) and short lived (10 to 200 km) extreme ultraviolet (EUV) brightenings, detected by the High Resolution Imager EUV (HRIEUV), have been found to be ubiquitous in the Quiet Sun (QS). Their contribution to coronal heating as well as their physical origin are currently being investigated. We wish to determine whether models of short loops and impulsive heating are compatible with the results from observations. In particular, we used two models of loops with distinct thermal properties: cool (T below 1E5 K) and hot loops (T above 1E5 K). We simulated the evolution of impulsively heated short loops, using the 1D hydrodynamics (HD) code HYDRAD. We computed the synthetic light curves of HRIEUV, four EUV channels of the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA), and five emission lines measured by the SPectral Imaging of the Coronal Environment (SPICE). We then compared the results from the synthetic light curves with observations. The aim was to reproduce the short delays observed between the intensity peaks of the light curves. Cool loops subjected to impulsive heating are good candidates to explain the physical origin of the EUV brightenings. On the other hand, hot loops are not consistent with observations, except when they are subjected to especially strong impulsive heating.

 - **Abstract**
 Mid-infrared spectroscopy of protoplanetary disks provides a chemical inventory of gas within a few au, where planets are readily detected around older stars. With the JWST Disk Infrared Spectral Chemistry Survey (JDISCS), we explore demographic trends among 31 disks observed with MIRI (MRS) and with previous ALMA millimeter continuum imaging at high angular resolution (5-10 au). With these S/N $\sim$200-450 spectra, we report emission from H$_2$O, OH, CO, C$_2$H$_2$, HCN, CO$_2$, [Ne II], [Ne III], and [Ar II]. Emission from H$_2$O, OH and CO is nearly ubiquitous for low-mass stars, and detection rates of all molecules are higher than for similar disks observed with Spitzer-IRS. Slab model fits to the molecular emission lines demonstrate that emission from C$_2$H$_2$, HCN, and possibly CO$_2$ is optically thin; thus since column densities and emitting radii are degenerate, observations are actually sensitive to the total molecular mass. C$_2$H$_2$ and HCN emission also typically originate in a hotter region ($920^{+70}_{-130}$, $820^{+70}_{-130}$ K, respectively) than CO$_2$ ($600^{+200}_{-160}$ K). The HCN to cold H$_2$O luminosity ratios are generally smaller in smooth disks, consistent with more efficient water delivery via icy pebbles in the absence of large dust substructures. The molecular emission line luminosities are also correlated with mass accretion rates and infrared spectral indices, similar to trends reported from Spitzer-IRS surveys. This work demonstrates the power of combining multi-wavelength observations to explore inner disk chemistry as a function of outer disk and stellar properties, which will continue to grow as the sample of observed Class II systems expands in the coming JWST observation cycles.

 - **Abstract**
 During the HOSTS survey by the LBTI, an excess emission from the main sequence star $\theta$ Boo (F7V spectral type, 14.5pc distance) was observed. This excess indicates the presence of exozodiacal dust near the habitable zone (HZ) of the star. Previous observations from Spitzer and Herschel showed no sign of outer cold dust within their respective detection limits. Additional nulling and high-contrast AO observations were taken to spatially constrain the dust distribution, search for variability, and directly image potential companions in the system. This study presents the results of these observations and provides an interpretation of the inner system's architecture. The star was observed using the LBTI's N'-band nulling mode during three epochs in 2017, 2018, and 2023. The dust distribution is modeled and constrained for each epoch using the standard LBTI nulling pipeline, assuming a vertically thin disk with a face-on inclination. In addition, high-contrast AO observations are performed in the L'-band and H-band to constrain the presence of substellar companions around the star. Several solutions are found for the dust distribution, and for each epoch. However, the LBTI nulling observations are not able to discriminate between them. Using the upper limits from previous observations, we constrain the representative size of the dust grains around 3-5$\mu$m. A tentative increase in dust brightness is also measured at the Earth-equivalent insolation distance between 2017 and 2023. Several options are considered to explain the origin of the observed dust and its variability, but no clear sources could be identified from the current observations. Partly because our high-contrast AO observations could only constrain the presence of companions down to $11M_\text{Jup}$ at 1.3" separation.

 - **Abstract**
 The discovery of extra-terrestrial life is one of the ultimate goals for future exoplanet-seeking missions, with one major challenge being the presence of 'exozodiacal' dust near target stars or within their habitable zone. Therefore, it is critical to identify which stars possess exozodiacal dust and quantify their emission levels. In this study, we conducted a search for exozodi candidates within 10 parsecs using the Reyl'e sample. We performed proper motion calculations and cross-matched the sample with the WISE and 2MASS database, resulting in 339 preliminary target samples. We further analysed the infrared radiation characteristics of these targets, using spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting to predict photometric flux levels in the infrared and searching for 3sigma excesses in the WISE W3 band. During further selection processes, we applied various analysis methods to perform rigorous validation. We identified five exozodi candidates all of which are brown dwarfs (BDs). Given the clustering in candidate spectral types, we expect that these are not true exozodi candidates, rather the apparent excess arises from the inability of the BD photosphere models to accurately represent the SEDs of objects at the L-T transition. Indeed, for the object DENIS J025503.3-470049, excess is likely due to silicate clouds in the BD atmosphere. We suggest that a more stringent 5sigma excess is required to infer excess for this spectral type. The detection rate (0/339) in our sample shows that less than 1% M stars have exozodi above 21% excess levels. This is consistent with the rate of exozodi at similar level towards FGK stars in the Kennedy & Wyatt sample (25/24,174). We provide upper limits on the 12 micron exozodi emission for the sample, which is typically at 21% relative to the star. For most stars, in particular the low mass M stars, this is the first such upper limit in the literature.

 - **Abstract**
 Classical T Tauri stars are newly formed, low mass stars which may display both periodic and random variations in their brightness. The interaction between the star and its circumstellar disk is time-dependent, leading to short or long-term changes in the environment, and hence variability of the system. By compiling a large dataset with high-cadence photometric (Kepler, TESS), and high-resolution spectroscopic observations (CFHT/ESPaDOnS) of the highly variable T Tauri star DR Tau, we aim to examine the short- and long-term variability of the system, and identify the underlying physical mechanisms. Our results reveal that DR Tau exhibits stochastic photometric variability not only on daily, but also on hourly timescale with peak-to-peak amplitude of 1.4 mag probably originating from accretion related variations. Our ground-based multifilter photometry shows that the amplitude of the variability decreases with increasing wavelength. This trend towards the infrared wavelengths suggests that part of the disk may be optically thick and invariable. The spectroscopic analysis showed that the H$\alpha$ line presents the most complex line profile with several components but the significance of the components changes over time. This suggests the presence and variation of both accretion flow and wind. Broad and narrow components can be clearly distinguished in the He I and the Ca II lines, suggesting contribution from both the accretion flow and the post-shock region. DR Tau exhibits high level of photometric and spectroscopic variability on both short- and long-timescales, which is caused by the combination of accretion, wind, stellar activity, and obscuration by circumstellar matter; and the significance of the physical mechanisms causing the observed variability changes over time.

 - **Abstract**
 UV radiation from OB stars can drive ``external'' photoevaporative winds from discs in clusters, that have been shown to be important for disc evolution and planet formation. However, cluster dynamics can complicate the interpretation of this process. A significant fraction of OB stars are runaways, propagating at high velocity which might dominate over the wider cluster dynamics in setting the time variation of the UV field in part of the cluster. We explore the impact of a runaway OB star on discs and the observational impact that may have. We find that discs exposed to even short periods of strong irradiation are significantly truncated, and only rebound slightly following the ``flyby'' of the UV source. This is predicted to leave an observable imprint on a disc population, with those downstream of the OB star vector being more massive and extended than those upstream. Because external photoevaporation acts quickly, this imprint is less susceptible to being washed out by cluster dynamics for faster runaway OB stars. The Gaia proper motion vector of the B star 42 Ori in NGC 1977 is transverse to the low mass stellar population and so may make a good region to search for this signature in resolved disc observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Clouds are often considered a highly uncertain barrier for detecting biosignatures on exoplanets, especially given intuition gained from transit surveys. However, for direct imaging reflected light observations, clouds could increase the observational signal by increasing reflected light. Here we constrain the impact of clouds on the detection of O2 and O3 by a direct imaging telescope such as the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) using observations simulated with the Planetary Spectrum Generator (PSG). We first perform sensitivity tests to show that low clouds enhance O2 and O3 detectability while high clouds diminish it, and the effect is greater when cloud particles are smaller. We next apply clouds produced by the cloud microphysics model CARMA with varied planetary parameters and clouds drawn from observations of different types of clouds on Earth to PSG. We find that clouds are likely to increase the SNR of O2 and O3 for terrestrial exoplanets under a wide range of scenarios. This work provides important constraints on the impact of clouds on observations by telescopes including HWO.

 One of the most profound empirical laws of star formation is the Gao-Solomon relation, a linear correlation between the star formation rate (SFR) and the dense molecular gas mass. It is puzzling how the complicated physics in star-formation results in this surprisingly simple proportionality. Using archival Herschel and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array Observations, we derived the masses of the most massive cores ($M^{\rm max}_{\rm core}$) and masses of the gravitationally bound gas ($ M_{\rm gas}^{\rm bound}$) in the parent molecular clouds for a sample of low-mass and high-mass star-forming regions. We discovered a significant correlation $\log(M^{\rm max}_{\rm core}/M_{\odot}) = 0.506 \log(M_{\rm gas}^{\rm bound}/M_{\odot})-0.32$. Our discovered $M^{\rm max}_{\rm core}$-$M_{\rm gas}^{\rm bound}$ correlation can be approximately converted to the Gao-Solomon relation if there is (1) a constant 30% efficiency of converting $M^{\rm max}_{\rm core}$ to the mass of the most massive star ($m^{\rm max}_{\rm star}$), and (2) if SFR and $m^{\rm max}_{\rm star}$ are tightly related through $\log({\rm SFR}/(M_{\odot} {\rm yr}^{-1})) = 2.04 \log(m^{\rm max}_{\rm star}/M_{\odot})-5.80$. Intriguingly, both requirements have been suggested by previous theoretical studies (c.f. Yan et al. 2017). Based on this result, we hypothesize that the Gao-Solomon relation is a consequence of combining the following three non-trivial relations (i) SFR vs. $m^{\rm max}_{\rm star}$, (ii) $m^{\rm max}_{\rm star}$ vs. $M^{\rm max}_{\rm core}$, and (iii) $M^{\rm max}_{\rm core}$ vs. $M_{\rm gas}^{\rm bound}$. This finding may open a new possibility to understand the Gao-Solomon relation in an analytic sense.

 Analysis of Callisto's moments of inertia, derived from Galileo's gravity data, suggests that its structure is not fully differentiated. This possibly undifferentiated state contrasts sharply with the globally molten state inferred in its counterpart, Ganymede, and poses unique challenges to theories of the formation and evolution of the Galilean moons. During their formation, both moons experienced multiple heating mechanisms, including tidal heating, radiogenic heating from short-lived radionuclides, accretional heating from impacts, and heat from the surrounding circumplanetary disk. Our study investigates the optimal conditions required to account for Callisto's partially differentiated state in contrast to Ganymede's complete differentiation. We investigate crucial accretion parameters, such as the timing of accretion onset, the duration of accretion, and the impactor size distribution. We find that the observed dichotomy between Ganymede and Callisto can be attributed to similar formation conditions, assuming an identical impactor size distribution and composition in the Jovian circumplanetary disk. The key differences in the formation of Ganymede and Callisto are the disk temperature at their respective formation locations and their final radii. Our results indicate that both moons accreted gradually over more than 2 Myr, concluding at least 5.5 Myr after the formation of calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions in the protosolar nebula. Our model demonstrates that Callisto can remain undifferentiated despite accreting a substantial influx of kilometer-sized impactors, potentially contributing up to 30% of the total mass inflow, while still allowing for the complete differentiation of Ganymede.

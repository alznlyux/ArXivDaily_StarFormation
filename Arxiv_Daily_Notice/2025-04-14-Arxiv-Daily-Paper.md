 - **Abstract**
 Cosmological perturbation theory provides a fundamental framework for analyzing the evolution of density fluctuations and gravitational potentials in the Universe. It plays a crucial role in understanding large-scale structure formation and cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies. In this study, we apply perturbation theory to the minimally extended varying speed of light (meVSL) model to investigate the effects of a varying speed of light on the matter density contrast and the Newtonian gravitational potential. Unlike conventional models with a constant speed of light, the meVSL model introduces modifications to the cosmological evolution equations, leading to potential deviations in structure formation and gravitational interactions. By deriving and analyzing the perturbed equations within this framework, we explore how a varying speed of light affects the growth of density perturbations and the evolution of gravitational potentials. Compared to the standard constant speed of the light model, we find deviations of approximately $2$\% in the subhorizon modes of both quantities. Although detecting these effects observationally remains a significant challenge, our results provide new theoretical insights into the meVSL model and its potential observational signatures, such as the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect and gravitational lensing of the CMB.

 - **Abstract**
 Little red dots (LRDs) are a population of red, compact objects discovered by JWST at $z>4$. At $4<z<8$, they are roughly 100 times more abundant than UV-selected quasars. However, their number density is uncertain at $z<4$ due to the small sky coverage and limited blue wavelength coverage of JWST. We present our ground-based search for LRDs at $2\lesssim z\lesssim4$, combining ultra-deep Hyper Suprime-Cam photometry and various (near-)infrared surveys within a total area of $\sim3.1\,\mathrm{deg^{2}}$. We find that for LRDs with $M_{5500}<-22.5$, their number density declines from $\sim10^{-4.5}\,\mathrm{cMpc^{-3}}$ at $z>4$ to $\sim10^{-5.3}\,\mathrm{cMpc^{-3}}$ at $2.7<z<3.7$ and $\sim10^{-5.7}\,\mathrm{cMpc^{-3}}$ at $1.7<z<2.7$. We also present the Magellan/FIRE spectrum of our first followed-up candidate, DEEP23-z2LRD1 at $z_\mathrm{spec}=2.26$, as a proof of concept for our sample selection. Similar to high-redshift LRDs, the spectrum of DEEP23-z2LRD1 exhibits broad H$\alpha$ emission with $\mathrm{FWHM}\approx2400\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$ and with nearly symmetric narrow H$\alpha$ absorption. Additionally, DEEP23-z2LRD1 has extremely narrow [OIII] lines with $\mathrm{FWHM}\approx140\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$, suggesting the presence of an accreting black hole in a low-mass host galaxy. Limited by the angular resolution of ground-based surveys, we emphasize that spectroscopic follow-ups are required to characterize the contamination fraction of this sample and pin down LRD number density at $z<4$.

 - **Abstract**
 Accurate photometry in astronomical surveys is challenged by image artefacts, which affect measurements and degrade data quality. Due to the large amount of available data, this task is increasingly handled using machine learning algorithms, which often require a labelled training set to learn data patterns. We present an expert-labelled dataset of 1127 artefacts with 1213 labels from 26 fields in ZTF DR3, along with a complementary set of nominal objects. The artefact dataset was compiled using the active anomaly detection algorithm PineForest, developed by the SNAD team. These datasets can serve as valuable resources for real-bogus classification, catalogue cleaning, anomaly detection, and educational purposes. Both artefacts and nominal images are provided in FITS format in two sizes (28 x 28 and 63 x 63 pixels). The datasets are publicly available for further scientific applications.

 - **Abstract**
 A complex interplay between mixing and nucleosynthesis is at work in asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. In addition to the slow neutron capture process (s-process), the intermediate neutron capture process (i-process) can develop during protons ingestion events (PIEs). In this paper, after quickly reviewing the different modes of production of heavy elements in AGB stars that were identified so far, we investigate the synthesis of actinides and other short-lived radioactive nuclei (SLRs, $^{60}$Fe, $^{107}$Pd, $^{126}$Sn, $^{129}$I, $^{135}$Cs and $^{182}$Hf) during i-process nucleosynthesis. AGB stellar models with initial masses $1 \leq M_{\rm ini}/M_{\odot} \leq 3$, metallicities $-3 \leq $ [Fe/H] $ \leq 0$ and different overshoot strengths were computed with the stellar evolution code STAREVOL. During PIEs, a nuclear network of 1160 isotopes is used and coupled to the transport equations. We found that AGB models with [Fe/H] $<-2$ can synthesize actinides with sometimes abundances greater than solar. The $^{60}$Fe yield scales with the initial metallicity while the $^{107}$Pd, $^{126}$Sn, $^{129}$I, $^{135}$Cs and $^{182}$Hf yields follow a similar pattern as a function of metallicity, with a production peak at [Fe/H] $\simeq -1.3$. At [Fe/H] $<-1$, the fraction of odd Ba isotopes $f_{\rm Ba,odd}$ is predicted to vary between 0.6 and 0.8 depending on the initial mass and metallicity. Nuclear uncertainties on our $1 M_{\odot}$, [Fe/H] $=-2.5$ model lead to $f_{\rm Ba,odd}$ ranging between 0.27 and 0.76, which is clearly above the s-process value. AGB stars experiencing PIEs appear to be potential producers of actinides and SLRs, particularly at low metallicity (except for $^{60}$Fe). Galactic chemical evolution modeling are required to assess their possible contribution to the galactic enrichment.

          Tilsotua: Reproducing Slitmask Sky Positions for use with the LRIS Multislit Archive

 - **Abstract**
 We present tilsotua, a code that calculates sky positions of the slits from Low-Resolution Imaging Spectrograph (LRIS) slitmasks used in multislit observations. Raw data for the Keck/LRIS spectrograph does not include information about the sky positions of the slitmask targets, making it difficult to use beyond the scope of the original programs. tilsotua translates slit coordinates from the mask design files in the mask milling machine frame to sky coordinates. tilsotua also shifts the original input astrometry to modern frames using the objects targeted by mask alignment boxes. This can be applied to the archived mask design files at the Lick Observatory Archive. We demonstrate that the final reconstructed slit positions are accurate to 0."14 (RMS) across the set of archived masks based on a comparison of our calculated mask alignment box coordinates with Gaia astrometric positions of the likely alignment objects. We make available the tilsotua code, archived mask files, and slit positions of the historical masks for the community to maximize the science from Keck/LRIS data in the Keck Observatory Archive.

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we develop a membership identification method and apply it for 30 open clusters (OCs) within 200 pc of the Sun using astrometric data of Gaia DR3. By accounting for projection effects that distort apparent stellar motions, our approach converts astrometric data into accurate five-dimensional positions and velocities. This approach enables better identification of members in nearby open clusters. We then compare our refined membership lists with previous catalogs, revealing more members in most open clusters, but also the identification of elongated structures in Melotte 25 (Hyades), NGC 2632 (Praesepe), Melotte 111 (Coma Berenices), Platais 3, Melotte 22 (Pleiades), NGC 2451A, Platais 9, IC 2391, Platais 8, UPK 640, HSC 2986, which we studied in detail. An analysis of the ages of their members reveals the members within and outside of the tidal radius are distinctly coeval, further validating our methodology. This study suggests that for OCs in the solar neighborhood, correcting for the projection effect is very important for identification of OC members.

          On the nature of spiral arms in the interacting galaxy M51

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we investigated the radial variation of the azimuthal propagation of star formation across the spiral arms in the nearby galaxy NGC 5194 (M51a) by analysing the spatial separation between young star clusters and their nearest HII regions. The significant differences in the radial profiles of the mean azimuthal offsets in the M51a arms were found when the southern and northern arms were studied separately. The northern arm analysis showed that its radial profile is consistent with the predictions of stationary density wave theory for trailing spirals, while the explanation of the radial profile for the southern arm required its pattern speed to be higher than the rotation velocity of disc matter within the corotation circle, and lower than that outside of it. At the same time, these different radial profiles of the mean azimuthal offset in the two arms are joined by a common localization of corotation resonances, confirmed by independent studies using different methods.

          The CARMENES search for exoplanets around M dwarfs. Cluster analysis of signals from spectral activity indicators to search for shared periods

 - **Abstract**
 A multitude of spectral activity indicators are routinely computed nowadays from the spectra generated as part of planet-hunting radial velocity surveys. Searching for shared periods among them can help to robustly identify astrophysical quantities of interest, such as the stellar rotation period. However, this identification can be complicated due to the fact that many different peaks occurring in the periodograms. This is especially true in the presence of aliasing and spurious signals caused by environmental influences affecting the instrument. Our goal is to test a clustering algorithm to find signals with the same periodicity, (i.e. with the stellar rotation period) in the periodograms of a large number of activity indicators. On this basis, we have looked to evaluate the correlations between activity indicators and fundamental stellar parameters. We used generalised Lomb-Scargle periodograms to find periodic signals in 24 activity indicators, spanning the VIS and NIR channels of the CARMENES spectrograph. Common periods were subsequently determined by a machine learning algorithm for density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN). The clustering analysis of the signals apparent in the spectral activity indicators is a powerful tool for the detection of stellar rotation periods. It is straightforward to implement and can be easily automated, so that large data sets can be analysed. For a sample of 136 stars, we were able to recover the stellar rotation period in a total of 59 cases, including 3 with a previously unknown rotation period. In addition, we analysed spurious signals frequently occurring at the period of one year and its integer fractions, concluding that they are likely aliases of one underlying signal. Furthermore, we reproduced the results of several previous studies on the relationships between activity indicators and the stellar characteristics.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper deals with the formation and evolution of Mars' moons, Phobos and Deimos, assuming the dislocation of a larger progenitor as the origin of these moons. The study by Hyodo et al. (2022) argue that under somewhat simplistic modeling, the post-dislocation orbits of Phobos and Deimos inevitably collide within 10,000 years, leading to their mutual annihilation. These findings are based on $\mathcal{N}$-body simulations, accounting for Mars' $J_2$ and $J_4$ gravitational perturbations and mutual perturbations between the moons. In this paper, we challenge these findings by extending their work. We incorporate important perturbations such as solar perturbations, Mars' axial precession and nutation, and its deformation along three axes. We also extend some of the hypotheses made by Hyodo et al. (2022) concerning the initial distribution of Phobos and Deimos after the dislocation. Our analysis reveals that including these additional perturbations as well as the possibility of having more than two fragments after the dislocation does not alter the ultimate fate of Phobos and Deimos. The moons still converge towards collision within comparable timescales, supporting Hyodo et al. (2022) conclusions that the dislocation hypothesis under the dynamical scenario developed by Bagheri et al. (2021) has, in the best conditions, about 10\% chance of surviving after the first 100,000 years following their formation.

 - **Abstract**
 The current generation of millimeter receivers is able to produce cubes of 800 000 pixels by 200 000 frequency channels to cover several square degrees over the 3 mm atmospheric window. Estimating the physical conditions of the interstellar medium (ISM) with an astrophysical model on such datasets is challenging. Common approaches tend to converge to local minima and typically poorly reconstruct regions with low signal-to-noise ratio (S/N). This instrumental revolution thus calls for new scalable data analysis techniques. We present Beetroots, a Python software that performs Bayesian reconstruction of maps of physical conditions from observation maps and an astrophysical model. It relies on an accurate statistical model, exploits spatial regularization to guide estimations, and uses state-of-the-art algorithms. It also assesses the ability of the astrophysical model to explain the observations, providing feedback to improve ISM models. We demonstrate the power of Beetroots with the Meudon PDR code on synthetic data, and then apply it to estimate physical condition maps in the full Orion molecular cloud 1 (OMC-1) star forming region based on Herschel molecular line emission maps. The application to the synthetic case shows that Beetroots can currently analyse maps with up to ten thousand pixels, addressing large variations of S/N, escaping from local minima, and providing consistent uncertainty quantifications. On a laptop, the inference runtime ranges from a few minutes for 100-pixel maps to 28 hours for 8100-pixel maps. The results on the OMC-1 maps are consistent with independent estimations from the literature, and improve our understanding of the region. This work paves the way towards systematic and rigorous analyses of observations produced by current and future instruments.

 - **Abstract**
 Filament eruptions are considered to be a common phenomenon on the Sun and other stars, yet they are rarely directly imaged in the meter and decimeter wavebands. Using imaging data from the DAocheng solar Radio Telescope (DART) in the 150-450 MHz frequency range, we present two eruptive filaments that manifest as radio dimmings (i.e., emission depressions). Simultaneously, portions of these eruptive filaments are discernible as dark features in the chromospheric images. The sun-as-a-star flux curves of brightness temperature, derived from the DART images, exhibit obvious radio dimmings. The dimming depths range from 1.5% to 8% of the background level and show a negative correlation with radio frequencies and a positive correlation with filament areas. Our investigation suggests that radio dimming is caused by free-free absorption during filament eruptions obscuring the solar corona. This may provide a new method for detecting stellar filament eruptions.

          Investigating the spectral nature of gigahertz-peaked spectra pulsar candidates

 - **Abstract**
 We report the measurements of low radio frequency spectra of fourteen gigahertz-peaked spectra (GPS) pulsar candidates, between 300~MHz and 700~MHz, using the upgraded Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope. Combining newly collected measurements with archival results the spectral nature of each pulsar was examined using four different physical models: simple power law, broken power law, low-frequency turn-over power law and free-free thermal absorption. Based on this analysis, we confirm the GPS nature of five pulsars, three of them being new detections. In addition, one pulsar can be classified as having a broken power law spectrum, and we found the typical power law spectra in four other cases. In the remaining four pulsars the spectra showed tendencies of low frequency turn-over that require further investigations at lower frequency ranges. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of wideband measurements at low frequencies, below 1 GHz, in characterizing the spectral nature in pulsars. Our results also underline the need for more systematic theoretical studies to refine existing models and better interpret pulsar emission properties.

          A systematic analysis of the radio properties of 22 X-ray selected tidal disruption event candidates with the Australia Telescope Compact Array

 - **Abstract**
 We present a systematic analysis of the radio properties of an X-ray selected sample of tidal disruption event (TDE) candidates discovered by the eROSITA telescope. We find radio sources coincident with half of the transient events (11 TDEs), with 8 radio sources showing statistically significant variability over a 6-month period. We model the radio spectra of 6 sources with sufficiently bright radio emission and find the sources show radio spectra consistent with optically thin synchrotron emission and radio outflow minimum radii of $10^{16}$--$10^{17}$ cm, velocities 0.01--0.05 c, and energies $10^{48}$--$10^{51}$ erg. On comparison with the radio properties of an optically-selected TDE sample at similar late times, we find no significant difference in the radio luminosity range or radio detection rate. We find a tentative positive trend with peak radio and X-ray luminosity, but require further observations to determine if this is real or due to observational bias due to the large range in distances of the events. Interestingly, none of the X-ray selected events show late rising radio emission, compared to 45% of radio-detected sources of an optically-selected sample that showed late rising radio emission. We propose that this may indicate that many TDEs launch radio outflows at or near peak X-ray luminosity, which can be significantly delayed from peak optical luminosity. This study presents the first systematic analysis of the radio properties of an X-ray selected sample of TDEs, and gives insight into the possible link between the physical processes that power X-ray and radio emission in TDEs.

          Bifurcated Evolutionary Pathways in Multi-planet Systems Driven by Misaligned Protoplanetary Disks

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar obliquities, or spin-orbit angles, prevalent in exoplanet systems, can impose important constraints on their formation and evolution histories. Recent studies suggest that primordial misalignments between protoplanetary disks and stellar spin axes may significantly contribute to these obliquities, as those frequently observed in systems hosting hot Jupiters. In this study, we demonstrate that misaligned protoplanetary disks combined with stellar oblateness drive complex dynamical evolution in planetary systems during their disk dispersal stages. Specifically, we identify bifurcated evolutionary pathways in multi-planet systems: systems with low star-disk misalignment angles ($\psi_{\star0}$) undergo smooth, adiabatic evolution, producing nearly coplanar, low-obliquity configurations; in contrast, systems with high misalignment angles typically experience an abrupt, non-adiabatic transition, leading to large-amplitude libration of mutual planetary inclinations and then triggering chaotic eccentricity excitation. This libration and eccentricity excitation process can propagate inward-outward in compact multi-planet systems, forming an excitation chain that can destabilize the entire system. The non-adiabatic transition arises from the dynamical bifurcation-induced effect, which occurs during disk dissipation when $\psi_{\star0}\gtrsim44.6^\circ$ (for one-planet systems). Our framework predicts that surviving typical compact multi-planet systems originating from misaligned disks evolve toward coplanar, low-obliquity configurations, consistent with observations of Kepler multi-planet systems. These results advance our understanding of planetary dynamics in misaligned disks and their evolutionary outcomes.

 - **Abstract**
 A method for pulsar timing based on monitoring data from the 3-th diagramm of the Large Phased Array (LPA LPI) radio telescope is proposed. In our observations, recorders with quartz clock generators were used as local clocks. Such recorders initially had an accuracy and hardware reference to the UTC time scale insufficient for pulsar timing. We have developed a method for referencing such clocks to the UTC based on observations of known pulsars used as intermediate reference clocks. This allowed us to improve dramatically the accuracy of determining the Time of Arrivals (TOA) of pulsars' pulses. We applied this method to the results of our observations of 24 second period pulsars over a time interval of 10 years. It was shown that the accuracy of the pulsar period, its first derivative ($P$ and $\dot P$) and their coordinates in right ascension and declination ($\alpha, \delta$) allow us to predict the pulsar phase within $\pm 0.5 P$ during several years. The accuracy of determining the coordinates by right ascension and declination was typically better than $10^{\prime \prime}$ with an angular resolution of the radio telescope of about $30^\prime$. That makes it possible to use these parameters for timing using radio telescopes with narrow beam patterns. The accuracy of the calculated period was typically better than $10^{-8}$~s.

 - **Abstract**
 We systematically perform numerical-relativity simulations for equal-mass binary neutron star mergers for the models varying the thermal index $\Gamma_{\rm th}$ with 3 different equations of state (EOSs) of the neutron stars (NSs), which are consistent with current multi-messenger observational data and state-of-the-art theoretical calculations, and 2 different binary total mass ($m_0=2.7\ \text{and}\ 2.9~M_\odot$). By varying the value of $\Gamma_{\rm th}$ within the hybrid EOS framework, we investigate the thermal effects on the merger dynamics, gravitational waves (GWs), and the dynamical mass ejection process. We find that the choice of the constant $\Gamma_{\rm th}$ can change the outcome of the remnant for specific EOSs and $m_0$. We also show that the dynamical ejecta mass is affected by the $\Gamma_{\rm th}$ value in a different way for different EOSs: for a stiff EOS the ejecta mass is high when $\Gamma_{\rm th}$ is small, while for softer EOSs the largest ejecta is achieved when $\Gamma_{\rm th} = 1.3$--$1.4$. While the inspiral motion does not depend on the $\Gamma_{\rm th}$, the post merger phase evolution is highly affected by that. We show that the dominant peak frequency $f_2$ of the post merger GW spectrum monotonically decreases as the $\Gamma_{\rm th}$ increases. We find that the universal relations between NS macroscopic properties and post-merger GW frequencies are subject to non-negligible thermal uncertainties, which can obscure the universal relation between the tidal deformability and $f_2$.

 - **Abstract**
 We present AstroLLaVA, a vision language model for astronomy that enables interaction with astronomical imagery through natural dialogue. By fine-tuning the LLaVA model on a diverse dataset of $\sim$30k images with captions and question-answer pairs sourced from NASA's `Astronomy Picture of the Day', the European Southern Observatory, and the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, we create a model capable of answering open-ended questions about astronomical concepts depicted visually. Our two-stage fine-tuning process adapts the model to both image captioning and visual question answering in the astronomy domain. We demonstrate AstroLLaVA's performance on an astronomical visual question answering benchmark and release the model weights, code, and training set to encourage further open source work in this space. Finally, we suggest a roadmap towards general astronomical data alignment with pre-trained language models, and provide an open space for collaboration towards this end for interested researchers.

 - **Abstract**
 The interaction of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays with air nuclei triggers extensive air showers that reach their maximal energy deposition at the atmospheric depth $X_{\max}$. The distribution of this shower observable encodes information about the proton-air cross-section via fluctuations of the primary interaction point, $X_1$, and hadron production through $\Delta X_{\max} \equiv X_{\max} - X_1$. We introduce new multiparticle production variables, $\alpha_{\textrm{had}}$, $\zeta_{\textrm{had}}$, and $\zeta_{\mathrm{EM}}$, built from the energy spectra of secondaries in the primary interaction. Their linear combination, $\xi$, predicts over $50 \%$ of the fluctuations in $\Delta X_{\max}$. Moreover, we build a probabilistic mapping based on the causal connection between $\xi$ and $\Delta X_{\max}$ that enables model-independent predictions of $X_{\max}$ moments with biases below $3\,\mathrm{g\,cm^{-2}}$. Therefore, measurements of the distribution of $X_{\max}$ allow a data-driven probing of secondary hadron spectra from the cosmic-ray-air interaction, in proton-induced showers. The distributions of the new multiparticle production variables can be measured in rapidity regions accessible to current accelerators and are strongly dependent on the hadronic interaction model in the kinematic regions exclusive to ultra-high-energy cosmic rays.

 - **Abstract**
 The products of stellar mergers between two massive main-sequence (MS) stars appear as seemingly normal MS stars after a phase of thermal relaxation, if not for certain peculiarities. Since these peculiarities are not limited to the merger product's surface, we use asteroseismology to predict how the differences in the internal structure of a merger product and a genuine single star manifest via properties of non-radial stellar pulsations. We mapped the result of a 3D MHD stellar merger simulation between a 9 and an 8 solar-mass MS star to 1D and evolved it through the MS. We compare the predicted pressure (p) and gravity (g) modes for the merger product model with those predicted for a corresponding genuine single-star model. The p-mode frequencies are consistently lower for the merger product than for the genuine single star, and the differences between them are more than a thousand times larger than the current best observational uncertainties for measured mode frequencies of this kind. Even though g-mode period spacing differences vary in value and sign throughout the MS, they, too, are larger than the current best observational uncertainties for such long-period modes. This, combined with additional variability in the merger product's period spacing patterns, shows the potential of identifying merger products in future-forward modelling. We also attempt to replicate the merger product's structure using three widely applied 1D merger prescriptions and repeat the asteroseismic analysis. Although none of the 1D prescriptions reproduces the entire merger product's structure, we conclude that the prescription with shock heating shows the highest potential, provided that it can be calibrated on binary-evolution-driven 3D merger simulations. Our work should be expanded to encompass the various possible merger product structures predicted to exist in the Universe. (abridged)

 - **Abstract**
 ExoMolHR is an empirical, high-resolution molecular spectrum calculator for the high-temperature molecular line lists available from the ExoMol molecular database. Uncertainties, where available, in recommended ExoMol datasets are used to select highly accurate spectral lines. These lines largely rely on empirical energy levels generated through the MARVEL (measured active rotation vibration energy levels) procedure, which is being systematically used to improve the energy and transition data provided by the ExoMol database. The freely accessible ExoMolHR database provides line positions with calculated intensities for a user-specified wavenumber/wavelength range and temperature. Spectra can be plotted on the ExoMolHR website (this https URL) or downloaded as a CSV file. Cross sections can be calculated using the Python program PyExoCross. The ExoMolHR database currently provides 24307135 spectral lines for 33 molecules and 58 isotopologues; these numbers will increase as the ExoMol database is updated.

 - **Abstract**
 Low-density ($\rho < 0.1 \rm{~g~cm^{-3}}$) hot Saturns are expected to quickly ($<100$ Myr) lose their atmospheres due to stellar irradiation, explaining their rarity. HAT-P-67 b seems to be an exception, with $\rho < 0.09 \rm{~g~cm^{-3}}$ and maintaining its atmosphere to well after 1 Gyr. We present a photometric and spectroscopic follow-up of HAT-P-67 b to determine how it avoided mass loss. HAT-P-67 b orbits a $V=10.1$ evolved F-type star in a 4.81 day orbit. We present new radial velocity observations of the system from the NEID spectrograph on the WIYN 3.5m Telescope from a follow-up campaign robust to stellar activity. We characterize the activity using photometry and activity indicators, revealing a stellar rotation period ($5.40\pm0.09$ d) near HAT-P-67 b's orbital period. We mitigate the stellar activity using a constrained quasi-periodic Gaussian process through a joint fit of archival ground-based photometry, TESS photometry, and our NEID observations, obtaining a planetary mass of $M_p = 0.45 \pm 0.15~M_{\rm J}$. Combined with a radius measurement of $R_p=2.140 \pm 0.025~R_{\rm J}$, this yields a density of $\rho_p = 0.061^{+0.020}_{-0.021} \rm{~g~cm^{-3}}$, making HAT-P-67 b the second lowest-density hot giant known to date. We find the recent evolution of the host star caused mass loss for HAT-P-67 b to only recently occur. The planet will be tidally disrupted in $\sim 100-250$ Myr, shortly after losing its atmosphere. With rapid atmospheric mass loss, a large, helium leading tail, and upcoming observations with the Hubble Space Telescope, HAT-P-67 b is an exceptional target for future studies, for which an updated mass measurement provides important context.

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze the dense gas kinematics in two Class 0/I protostellar cores, Per 30 and NGC 1333 IRAS 7, in the Perseus molecular cloud to determine whether their velocity structures are indicative of rotation. We examine the hyperfine structure of the N2H+ J=1-0 transition by combining 3" (900 AU) Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) measurements with 9" (2700 AU) measurements from the Green Bank Telescope (GBT). We use the CASA Feather method to combine these data in order to maximize our sensitivity across spatial scales. We fit the N2H+ spectra to constrain the centroid velocity of the gas at each pixel and use these values to calculate the linear velocity gradient and specific angular momentum within apertures centered on each protostar with radii ranging from 5-60". Our results indicate that the velocity structure probed by the N2H+ emission is likely not a result of core rotation. These findings are consistent with other studies in the literature which indicate rotation is often not evident on scales less than 1000 AU. We instead suggest that the velocity structure we see is a result of torques caused by irregular density distributions in these protostellar systems.

 - **Abstract**
 Common radiative transfer methods, such as flux-limited diffusion (FLD) and the M1 closure, suffer from artificial interactions between crossing beams. In protoplanetary disks, this leads to an overestimation of the midplane temperature due to the merging of vertical inward and outward fluxes. Methods that avoid these artifacts typically require angular discretization, which can be computationally expensive. In the spirit of the two-stream approximation, we aim to remove the interaction between beams in a fixed spatial direction by introducing a half-moment (HM) closure, which integrates the radiative intensity over hemispheres. We derive a multidimensional HM closure via entropy maximization and replace it with an approximate expression that closely matches it, coinciding in the diffusion and free-streaming regimes while remaining expressible through simple operations. We implement the HM and M1 closures via implicit-explicit (IMEX) schemes, including multiple frequency groups. We test these methods in numerical benchmarks, including computing the temperature in an irradiated disk around a T Tauri star, comparing the results with Monte Carlo (MC) radiative transfer simulations. The resulting HM closure tends to the correct limit in the diffusion regime and prevents interactions between crossing fluxes in a chosen spatial direction. In disk simulations with 22 frequency groups, the M1 closure disagrees with the MC midplane temperature by up to 21%, while HM reduces this discrepancy to 6%. Even with just 3 frequency groups, HM significantly outperforms M1, with maximum departures of 8% compared to M1's 23%.

 - **Abstract**
 Supernova (SN) 2014C is a rare transitional event that exploded as a hydrogen-poor, helium-rich Type Ib SN and subsequently interacted with a hydrogen-rich circumstellar medium (CSM) a few months post explosion. This unique interacting object provides an opportunity to probe the mass-loss history of a stripped-envelope SN progenitor. Using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), we observed SN 2014C with the Mid-InfraRed Instrument Medium Resolution Spectrometer at 3477 days post explosion (rest frame), and the Near-InfraRed Spectrograph Integral Field Unit at 3568 days post explosion, covering 1.7 to 25 $\mu$m. The bolometric luminosity indicates that the SN is still interacting with the same CSM that was observed with the Spitzer Space Telescope 40--1920 days post explosion. JWST spectra and near-contemporaneous optical and near-infrared spectra show strong [Ne II] 12.831 $\mu$m, He 1.083 $\mu$m, H$\alpha$, and forbidden oxygen ([O I] $\lambda$$\lambda$6300, 6364, [O II] $\lambda$$\lambda$7319, 7330, and [O III] $\lambda$$\lambda$4959, 5007) emission lines with asymmetric profiles, suggesting a highly asymmetric CSM. The mid-IR continuum can be explained by ~0.036 $M_\odot$ of carbonaceous dust at ~300 K and ~0.043 $M_\odot$ of silicate dust at $\sim$200 K. The observed dust mass has increased tenfold since the last Spitzer observation 4 yr ago, with evidence suggesting that new grains have condensed in the cold dense shell between the forward and reverse shocks. This dust mass places SN 2014C among the dustiest SNe in the mid-IR and supports the emerging observational trend that SN explosions produce enough dust to explain the observed dust mass at high redshifts.

 - **Abstract**
 Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is thought to be an important sulfur reservoir in interstellar ices. It serves as a key precursor to complex sulfur-bearing organics, and has been proposed to play a significant role in the origin of life. Although models and observations both suggest H2S to be present in ices in non-negligible amounts, its sublimation dynamics remain poorly constrained. In this work, we present a comprehensive experimental characterization of the sublimation behavior of H2S ice under astrophysically-relevant conditions. The sublimation behavior of H2S was monitored with a quadrupole mass spectrometer (QMS) during temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments. These experiments are used to determine binding energies and entrapment efficiencies of H2S, which are then employed to estimate its snowline positions in a protoplanetary disk midplane. We derive mean binding energies of 3159\pm46 K for pure H2S ice and 3392\pm56 K for submonolayer H2S desorbing from a compact amorphous solid water (cASW) surface. These values correspond to sublimation temperatures of around 64 K and 69 K in the disk midplane, placing its sublimation fronts at radii just interior to the CO2 snowline. We also investigate the entrapment of H2S in water ice and find it to be highly efficient, with ~75-85% of H2S remaining trapped past its sublimation temperature for H2O:H2S mixing ratios of ~5-17:1. We discuss potential mechanisms behind this efficient entrapment. Our findings imply that, in protoplanetary disks, H2S will mostly be retained in the ice phase until water crystallizes, at radii near the water snowline, if it forms mixed into water ice. This has significant implications for the possibility of H2S being incorporated into icy planetesimals and its potential delivery to terrestrial planets, which we discuss in detail.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the reheating phase following inflation in the context of single-field models, focusing on the perturbative decay of the inflaton into lighter particles. A general analytical framework is presented to compute the reheating temperature $T_{re}$ and related quantities by combining cosmological observations with model-dependent parameters. We derive expressions for $T_{re}$ for three types of interactions: gravitational, scalar, and Yukawa-type fermionic couplings, and apply these results to the class of $\alpha$-attractor inflationary models, which exhibit attractor behavior in the $(n_s, r)$ plane. The main goal of this work is to investigate how key cosmological quantities such as $T_{re}$, $N_{re}$, and $m_\phi$ among others, evolve with the scalar spectral index $n_s$ and the Yukawa coupling constant $y$, within a consistent analytical framework. Although the formulas used are approximate, they are sufficient to capture the qualitative behavior of the relevant quantities across a wide range of parameter values. Here, we are not interested in precise numerical approximations or data analysis, but rather in understanding the general trends and dependence of cosmological quantities of interest. In particular, tendencies observed in the figures, such as the sensitivity of $T_{re}$ to the coupling strength and the equation-of-state parameter $\omega_{re}$, reflect physical features that are not strongly affected by the approximations involved.

 - **Abstract**
 In astrophysical simulations, nuclear reacting flows pose computational challenges due to the stiffness of reaction networks. We introduce neural network-based surrogate models using the DeePODE framework to enhance simulation efficiency while maintaining accuracy and robustness. Our method replaces conventional stiff ODE solvers with deep learning models trained through evolutionary Monte Carlo sampling from zero-dimensional simulation data, ensuring generalization across varied thermonuclear and hydrodynamic conditions. Tested on 3-species and 13-species reaction networks, the models achieve $\lesssim 1\%$ accuracy relative to semi-implicit numerical solutions and deliver a $\sim 2.6\times$ speedup on CPUs. A temperature-thresholded deployment strategy ensures stability in extreme conditions, sustaining neural network utilization above 75\% in multi-dimensional simulations. These data-driven surrogates effectively mitigate stiffness constraints, offering a scalable approach for high-fidelity modeling of astrophysical nuclear reacting flows.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we present a study on the long time-scale period variations of four single-mode high-amplitude delta Scuti stars (HADS) via the classical $O-C$ analysis. The target HADS are (i) XX Cygni, (ii) YZ Bootis, (iii) GP Andromedae, and (iv) ZZ Microscopii. The newly determined times of maximum light came from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), American Association of Variable Star Observers (AAVSO), and Bundesdeutsche Arbeitsgemeinschaft f$\ddot{\rm u}$r Ver$\ddot{\rm a}$nderliche Sterne (BAV) projects. Together with the times of maximum light obtained in the historical literature, the $O-C$ analysis was performed on these HADS, in which we obtained the linear period variation rates $\dot{P}/P$ as $(9.2 \pm 0.2) \times 10^{-9} \ \mathrm{yr^{-1}}$, $(3.2\pm 0.2)\times 10^{-9} \ \mathrm{yr^{-1}}$, $(4.22\pm 0.03) \times 10^{-8} \ \mathrm{yr^{-1}}$, and $(-2.06 \pm 0.02) \times 10^{-8} \ \mathrm{yr^{-1}}$, respectively. Based on these results and some earlier research, we also discuss the evolutionary stages and the mechanisms of the period variation of these four HADS.

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the SX Phoenicis (SX Phe) type star CY Aquarii (CY Aqr). Our investigation included a detailed $O-C$ analysis based on a 90-year observational dataset, augmented by 1,367 newly determined times of maximum light. The $O-C$ diagram reveals that (i) the primary star of CY Aqr exhibits a linear period variation rate of $(1/P_0)(\mathrm{d} P/ \mathrm{d} t) = (2.132 \pm 0.002) \times 10^{-8} \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ for its dominant pulsation mode; (ii) the primary star is disturbed by two companions and part of a triple system; (iii) Companion A has an orbital period of approximately 60.2 years and Companion B has an orbital period of approximately 50.8 years. It is highly probable that both Companion A and B are white dwarfs, with Companion A's elliptical orbit displaying an eccentricity of $e = 0.139 \pm 0.002$, which is the lowest confirmed value in similar binary and triple systems to date. Most notably, Companion A and B have masses that are identical within the uncertainties, with a mass ratio exceeding 0.99. Whether this is considered a coincidental event or the result of an underlying mechanism, CY Aqr is an exceptionally rare case that broadens our understanding of multiple star systems and offers a unique opportunity to delve into the enigmatic evolutionary histories of such configurations. Further intriguing characteristics of this system warrant investigation in future studies, based on additional observational data.

 - **Abstract**
 We theoretically analyze the dipole anisotropy observed in the quasar distribution from the CatWISE2020 catalog. The catalog data shows a peak around $z\approx 1$, suggesting the presence of a large-scale dipole component. We explore the possibility that this dipole could be driven by primordial density fluctuations from modes that were superhorizon at the time of CMB decoupling but have since entered the horizon and become subhorizon. In particular, we consider the impact of adiabatic modes with wavenumbers $k$ in the range $(10^{-4} - 4 \times 10^{-3})~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1} $, corresponding to wavelength scales of several Gpc. Such modes can create large-scale density variations, likely causing anisotropies in the distribution of matter and, as a result, affecting the number density of observed quasars. We also demonstrate that a superhorizon curvature perturbations mode, with comoving wavenumber $k\lesssim0.3H_0$ can lead to a significant enhancement in the locally inferred Hubble constant. This effect offers a viable explanation for the observed discrepancy between local and CMB inferred measurements of $H_0$.

          Decoding the Origin of HFQPOs of GRS 1915+105 during 'Canonical' Soft States: An In-depth View using Multi-mission observations

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive analysis of the 'canonical' soft state ($\gamma$, $\delta$, and $\phi$ spectral variability classes) of the black hole binary GRS 1915+105, using RXTE, AstroSat, and NuSTAR data from 1996 to 2017 to investigate the origin of High Frequency Quasi-periodic Oscillations (HFQPOs). Our findings reveal that HFQPOs occur only in the $\gamma$ and $\delta$ classes, with frequencies of $65.07-71.38$ Hz and are absent in the $\phi$ class. We observe an evolution of time-lag from hard-lag (1.59$-$7.55 ms) in RXTE to a soft-lag (0.49$-$1.68 ms) in AstroSat observations. Wide-band (0.7$-$50 keV) spectral modelling suggests that HFQPOs are likely observed with a higher covering fraction ($f_{cov} \gtrsim 0.5$), i.e., the fraction of seed photons being Comptonized in the corona, enhanced Comptonized flux ($\sim$ 38%), and lower optical depth ($\tau \lesssim 8.5$ ) in contrast to observations where HFQPOs are absent. We observed similar constraints for observing HFQPOs during an inter-class ($\phi \rightarrow \delta$) transition as well as in a few intra-class ($\delta \rightarrow \delta$) variations. We also find that the time-lag decreases as $\tau$ increases, indicating that a higher $\tau$ reduces Compton up-scattering, thereby decreasing the hard-lag. Interestingly, in RXTE observations, the hard-lag ($\sim$ 7 ms) gradually decreases as optical depth and Comptonization ratio increases, eventually becoming a soft-lag ($\sim$1 ms) in AstroSat observations. These constraints on spectro-temporal parameters for the likelihood of observing HFQPOs support a 'compact' coronal oscillation mechanism for generating HFQPOs, which we attempt to explain within the framework of a possible accretion scenario.

 - **Abstract**
 The phosphorus budget of planets is intertwined with their formation history and is thought to influence their habitability. The chemical reservoirs and volatile \emph{vs} refractory budget of phosphorus in planet-forming environments have so far eluded empirical characterisation. We employ high-resolution spectra from HST/STIS in the ultraviolet and APEX in the sub-mm to constrain the phosphorus budget in the well-characterized HD\,100546 star and protoplanetary disk system. We measure $\log{(P/H)_{\star}}=-7.50^{+0.23}_{-0.28}$ on the stellar surface, which traces the total inventory of P in accreting gas \emph{and }dust from the inner disk. The inner disk gas, inside of the main dust trap, has $\log{(P/H)_{\rm in}}\lesssim-8.70$, and the outer disk gas $\log{(P/H)_{\rm out}}\lesssim-9.30$. Phosphorus in the disk is carried by a relatively refractory reservoir, consistent with minerals such as apatite or schreibersite, or with ammonium phosphate salts, in terms of sublimation temperature. We discuss the impact this might have on the two protoplanets around HD\,100546. Our results contribute to our understanding of the chemical habitability of planetary systems and lay a foundation for future explorations, especially in the context of JWST and \emph{Ariel} which can study phosphorus in exoplanet atmospheres.

          Inferring Dense Confined Circumstellar Medium around Supernova Progenitors via Long-term Hydrodynamical Evolution

 - **Abstract**
 Circumstellar interaction of supernova (SN) ejecta is an essential process in its evolution and observations of SNe have found the signature of circumstellar interaction both in the early and late evolutionary phase of SNe. In this Letter, we show that if the SN forward shock plunges into tenuous stellar wind from dense circumstellar medium (CSM) in the vicinity of the progenitor (i.e., confined CSM), the subsequent time evolutions of the SN-CSM interaction system deviates from the prediction of self-similar solution. In this case, after all of the confined CSM is swept up by the SN forward shock (roughly $10$ days after the explosion), the propagation of the shocked shell will be driven by the freely expanding ram pressure of the confined CSM component, instead of the SN ejecta. Meanwhile, the forward shock decelerates faster than the prediction of thin-shell approximation once the confined CSM component reaches homologous expansion. This lasts until the reverse shock in the confined CSM component reaches the head of the SN ejecta, leading to the restoration of the system into the evolutionary model without confined CSM, where the SN ejecta drives the expansion of the system. We also show that this peculiar evolution will be reflected in observational signatures originating from SN-CSM interaction, taking rapid decline and rebrightening of radio emission as examples. Our results shed light on the importance of taking into account the effect of initial SN-CSM interaction even when we focus on observational properties of SNe a few years after the explosion.

 - **Abstract**
 Lorentz invariance violation in photons can be quantified by measuring the difference in arrival times between high- and low-energy photons originating from gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). When analyzing data, it is crucial to consider the inherent time delay in the emission of these photons at the source of the GRB. In a recent study, three distinct models were evaluated to explain the intrinsic emission times of high-energy photons by analyzing 14 multi-GeV photon events detected from 8 GRBs using the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (FGST). In this study, we examine three remarkable GRB photons recorded by different observatories: the 99.3~GeV photon from GRB 221009A observed by FGST, the 1.07~TeV photon from GRB 190114C detected by the Major Atmospheric Gamma Imaging Cherenkov (MAGIC) telescope, and the 12.2~TeV photon from GRB 221009A observed by the Large High Altitude Air-shower Observatory (LHAASO). Our analysis indicates that the newly proposed model with a linear relationship between photon energy and intrinsic emission time can offer a consistent framework to explain the behavior of all three exceptional photons with a Lorentz violation scale $E_{\rm LV}\sim 3\times 10^{17}$~GeV.

 - **Abstract**
 The young (23 Myr) nearby (19.4 pc) star $\beta$ Pictoris hosts an edge-on debris disk with two gas giant exoplanets in orbit around it. Many transient absorption features have been detected in the rotationally broadened stellar lines, which are thought to be the coma of infalling exocomets crossing the line of sight towards Earth. In the Solar System, the molecule cynaogen (CN) and its associated ionic species are one of the most detectable molecules in the coma and tails of comets. We perform a search for cyanogen in the spectra of $\beta$ Pictoris to detect or put an upper limit on this molecule's presence in a young, highly active planetary system. We divide twenty year's worth of HARPS spectra into those with strong exocomet absorption features, and those with only stellar lines. The high signal-to-noise stellar spectrum normalises out the stellar lines in the exocomet spectra, which are then shifted and stacked on the deepest exocomet absorption features to produce a high signal-to-noise exocomet spectrum, and search for the CN band head using a model temperature dependent cross-correlation template. We do not detect CN in our data, and place a temperature and broadening dependent 5$\sigma$ upper limit between 10$^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$ and 10$^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$, to be compared to the typical 10$^9$ - 10$^{10}$ cm$^{-2}$ expected from scaling of the values in the Solar System comets.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the origin of substructures in protoplanetary disks and their connection to planet formation is currently one of the main challenges in astrophysics. While some disks appear smooth, most exhibit diverse substructures such as gaps, rings, or inner cavities, with varying brightness and depth. As part of the Ophiuchus Disk Survey Employing ALMA (ODISEA), we previously proposed an evolutionary sequence to unify this diversity, driven by the formation of giant planets through core accretion and subsequent planet-disk interactions. By combining the disk evolution and planet formation code PLANETALP with the radiative transfer code RADMC-3D, we have now reproduced the key aspects of the proposed evolutionary sequence. Starting with a smooth disk (like e.g., WLY 2-63), we modeled the evolution of a fiducial disk with a 1 Jupiter-mass planet at 57 au. Within a few hundreds of orbits, a narrow gap forms, resembling ISO-Oph 17. By $\sim$0.1 Myr, the gap widens, and dust accumulates at the cavity edge, producing a structure similar to Elias 2-24. At $\sim$0.4 Myr, the disk evolves further into a morphology akin to DoAr 44, characterized by a smaller inner disk and a brighter inner rim. By $\sim$1 Myr, the system transitions to a single narrow ring, resembling RXJ1633.9-2442. This line of work strongly supports the planetary origin of substructures and enables the possibility of identifying a population of planets that is currently beyond the reach of more direct detection techniques.

 We investigate potential deviations from cold dark matter (CDM) using the latest Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). Analyzing DESI data alone constrains the dark matter equation of state parameter $w_{\mathrm{dm}} = -0.042^{+0.047}_{-0.024}$, revealing a mild preference for non-cold dark matter. This preference strengthens significantly in combined analyses, but reveals a striking tension in the inferred $w_{\mathrm{dm}}$ values from observations of different nature. The DESI+DESY5 combination yields $w_{\mathrm{dm}} = -0.084 \pm 0.035$, excluding CDM ($w_{\mathrm{dm}}=0$) at 2.4$\sigma$ significance. In contrast, Planck+DESI gives $w_{\mathrm{dm}} = 0.00077\pm0.00038$, differing from concordance model at 2$\sigma$ significance. The non-vanishing $w_{\mathrm{dm}}$ preference is particularly driven by low-redshift BAO measurements ($z<1.1$), while higher redshift data remain consistent with $\Lambda$CDM. The evidence for non-cold dark matter is more pronounced in DESI compared to the previous BAO surveys. All dataset combinations show significant improvement over the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm, providing compelling evidence for non-cold dark matter scenario.

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we further developed and investigated the dual parameter phenomenological dark energy model (H^2 + H^-2 dark energy model) derived from Kaniadakis holographic dark energy. On the theoretical basis of the original H^2 + H^-2 dark energy model (HHDE), four types of viscosities and seven types of interactions were introduced. These were combined pairwise, and a dynamical analysis was conducted on a total of 35 Modified H^2 + H^-2 Viscous Interacting Dark Energy (MHH-VIDE) models. The advantage of the HHDE model and MHH-VIDE models is that these models can greatly relieve the Hubble tension and cicumventing the potential issue of a 'big rip', and the dark energy is Quintom-like. In this article, we performed a three-dimensional dynamical analysis of the aforementioned models with interactions and viscosity, testing their viability. The results suggest that the nature of this dark energy is closer to a property of spacetime than a cosmological component. The phase diagram analysis reveals a modified radiation-dominated epoch, a transitional matter-dominated phase, and a late-time attractor corresponding to the dark-energy-driven acceleration phase.

 - **Abstract**
 The red supergiant (RSG) problem refers to the observed dearth of luminous RSGs identified as progenitors of Type II supernovae (SNe II) in pre-SN imaging. Understanding this phenomenon is essential for studying pre-SN mass loss and the explodability of core-collapse SNe. In this work, we re-assess the RSG problem using late-phase spectroscopy of a sample of 50 SNe II. The [O I] $\lambda\lambda$6300,6363 emission in the spectra is employed to infer the zero-age main sequence (ZAMS) mass distribution of the progenitors, which is then transformed into a luminosity distribution via an observation-calibrated mass-luminosity relation. The resulting luminosity distribution reveals an upper cutoff at log $L/L_{\odot} = 5.21^{+0.09}_{-0.07}$ dex, and the RSG problem is statistically significant at the 2$\sigma$ to 3$\sigma$ level. Assuming single RSG progenitors that follow the mass-luminosity relation of KEPLER models, this luminosity cutoff corresponds to an upper ZAMS mass limit of $20.63^{+2.42}_{-1.64}$ $M_{\odot}$. Comparisons with independent measurements, including pre-SN imaging and plateau-phase light curve modeling, consistently yield an upper ZAMS mass limit below about 25 $M_{\odot}$, with a significance level of 1-3$\sigma$. While each individual method provides only marginal significance, the consistency across multiple methodologies suggests that the lack of luminous RSG progenitors may reflect a genuine physical problem. Finally, we discuss several scenarios to account for this issue should it be confirmed as a true manifestation of stellar physics.

 - **Abstract**
 Searching for primordial gravitational wave in cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization signal is one of the key topics in modern cosmology. Cutting-edge CMB telescopes requires thousands of pixels to maximize mapping speed. Using modular design, the telescope focal plane is simplified as several detector modules. Each module has hundreds of pixels including antenna arrays, detector arrays, and readout arrays. The antenna arrays, as the beam defining component, determine the overall optical response of the detector module. In this article, we present the developments of 6-inch broadband antenna arrays from 80GHz to 170GHz for the future IHEP focal plane module. The arrays are fabricated from 42 6-inch silicon wafers including 456 antennas, 7% more pixels than usual design. The overall in-band cross polarization is smaller than -20 dB and the in-band beam asymmetry is smaller than 10%, fulfilling the requirements for primordial gravitational wave search.

          The fate of the progenitors of Luminous Red Novae: Infrared detection of LRNe years after the outburst

 - **Abstract**
 We present late-time optical and infrared (IR) observations of a sample of nine extragalactic Luminous Red Novae (LRNe) discovered in the last three decades. In all these cases, the LRN survivors fade below the pre-outburst luminosity of the progenitors in the optical region. Instead, they remain visible in the near-IR (NIR), and bright in the mid-IR (MIR) domains for years. We recover AT 1997bs in $Spitzer$ images from 2004, and a residual source is visible in HST and $JWST$ NIR images 27 years after the outburst. Its spectral energy distribution (SED) is consistent with that of a red supergiant star with a photospheric temperature of 3200 K and a radius of 220 $R_{\odot}$, without a significant circumstellar dust attenuation, as the source is not detected at 4.5 $\mu$m. Another LRN, AT 2011kp, is detected by $JWST$ 12.5 years after the outburst. From its SED, we find evidence for three black-body components: a warm/hot stellar component, a colder component from cool dust at 425 K, emitting between 3 and 6 $\mu$m, and a third even colder component responsible for the excess at 8 $\mu$m, possibly due to an IR echo. We construct the $[3.6]-[4.5]$ colour curves extending up to +7 years for six LRNe, which show a similar evolution: the MIR colour is $\sim0$ before the optical maximum light, it becomes bluer ($\sim-0.5$ mag) at around +1 year, then it gradually turns to redder colours ($\sim+0.5$ mag) in the following years, before reaching $[3.6]-[4.5]\sim+1.5$ mag 7 years after the outburst. Finally, we also estimate the masses and the temperatures of newly-formed dust years after the LRN onset for different chemical compositions (silicates or graphite) and grain sizes (0.1 or 1.0 $\mu$m). We find that LRNe produce dust masses of the order of (0.1-30)$\times10^{-6}$ $M_{\odot}$ between 3.6 and 13 years after the outbursts, with temperatures in the range from 350 to 770 K.

 - **Abstract**
 The $S_8$ parameter, which quantifies the amplitude of matter fluctuations on scales of $8h^{-1}$ Mpc, has been a source of tension between weak lensing surveys (e.g. KiDS, DES, HSC) and the Planck Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) measurements. This discrepancy challenges the standard ${\Lambda}$CDM model and has become one of the most significant tensions in modern cosmology. The ${\Lambda'}$ model offers a potential resolution by introducing modifications to the cosmic growth history through alterations to the gravitational sector. The alterations involve including a Ricci soliton into Einstein's field equations which introduce a time dependent factor yielding a time varying cosmological constant ${\Lambda'}=(1-{\alpha(t)^2}(t)){\Lambda_{DE}}\frac{{\rho}_g}{\rho_{DE}}$ and subsequently the evolution of the cosmos. The Ricci soliton is sourced from gravitational energy density. In this study we analyze results from six surveys and compare the results for $w_a$ and $w_0$ with the ${\Lambda'}$ model. We also find ${\sigma}_8={0.750}_{-0.020}^{+0.020}$ , $S_8={0.788}$. These values are closer to some low $S_8$ measurements from weak lensing surveys (e.g DES, KiDS), which report $S_8 \approx 0.76-0.78$, suggesting that the model may alleviate the $S_8$ tension. High values of ${\alpha(t)}$ in the late universe are the cause of suppressed structure formation and low values of ${\Lambda'}$. The late universe in the ${\Lambda'}$ model is effectively or apparently 5-10% younger than in ${\Lambda}$CDM which translates to $H_0={72.734}_{-1.687}^{+1.687}$ km/s/Mpc, which is in agreement with late universe probes. ${\Lambda'}$ is classified under the dynamical dark energy models, however unlike alternatives, it does not invoke exotic particles nor phantom energy.

 - **Abstract**
 Semidetached binaries, distinguished by their mass transfer phase, play a crucial role in elucidating the physics of mass transfer within interacting binary systems. To identify these systems in eclipsing binary light curves provided by large-scale time-domain surveys, we have developed a methodology by training two distinct models that establish a mapping relationship between the parameters (orbital parameters and physical parameters) of semidetached binaries and their corresponding light curves. The first model corresponds to scenarios where the more massive star fills its Roche lobe, while the second model addresses situations where the less massive star does so. In consideration of the O'Connell effect observed in the light curves, we integrated a cool spot parameter into our models, thereby enhancing their applicability to fit light curves that exhibit this phenomenon. Our two-model framework was then harmonized with the Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm, enabling precise and efficient light-curve fitting and parameter estimation. Leveraging 2 minute cadence data from the initial 67 sectors of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, we successfully identified 327 systems where the less massive component fills its Roche lobe, alongside three systems where the more massive component fills its Roche lobe. Additionally, we offer comprehensive fundamental parameters for these binary systems, including orbital inclination, relative radius, mass ratio, and effective temperature.

          Supersymmetric Hybrid Inflation in light of Atacama Cosmology Telescope Data Release 6, Planck 2018 and LB-BK18

 - **Abstract**
 Supersymmetry-based hybrid inflation models (referred to as `spontaneously broken supersymmetry' by the Planck collaboration) are attractive for several reasons, including the appealing feature that inflation is associated with local gauge symmetry breaking in the early universe. Following the Planck collaboration's notation, the inflationary potential with sub-Planckian inflaton field values is given by: $V = \Lambda^4 [1 + \alpha_h \log(\phi / M_{Pl})] - m_{3/2} \Lambda^2 \phi + \Lambda^4 O((\phi / M_{Pl})^4)$. Here, $\Lambda = \sqrt{\kappa} M$ denotes the energy scale of inflation, $M$ is the gauge symmetry breaking scale, $\kappa$ is a dimensionless parameter that sets the inflaton mass ($\sqrt{2} \kappa M$), and $\alpha_h$ is determined from quantum corrections in terms of $\kappa$ and the underlying gauge group. A soft supersymmetry-breaking term proportional to the gravitino mass $m_{3/2}$ (~10 TeV) and linear in the inflaton field $\phi$ is also present during inflation. The final term in $V$ represents the leading-order supergravity correction. (Note that the last two terms were not taken into account in the Planck analysis.) We provide estimates for the parameters $\kappa$ (and $\alpha_h$) that yield a scalar spectral index $n_s$ in the range 0.96 to 0.98, which is fully consistent with recent P-ACT-LB measurements presented by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope, as well as earlier measurements by Planck. We recall that in the absence of the soft SUSY-breaking term proportional to $m_{3/2}$ in $V$, the spectral index $n_s = 1 - 1/N = 0.98$, where $N = 50$ denotes the number of e-foldings. The tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ in this minimal model is tiny, but it can reach potentially observable values ($r \lesssim 0.01$) in non-minimal models.

 - **Abstract**
 Hypervelocity stars (HVSs) represent a unique class of objects capable of escaping the gravitational pull of the Milky Way due to extreme acceleration events, such as close encounters with the supermassive black hole at the Galactic center (GC), supernova explosions in binary systems, or multi-body dynamical interactions. Finding and studying HVSs are crucial to exploring these ejection mechanisms, characterizing central black holes, probing the GC environment, and revealing the distribution of dark matter in our galaxy. The Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) spectroscopic surveys have so far identified four B-type unbound HVSs. To expand this sample with the second-phase LAMOST survey that started in 2018, we conducted a systematic search for early-type HVSs using the LAMOST Data Release 10. We identified 125 early-type high-velocity candidates with total velocities exceeding 300 km\,s$^{-1}$. Among them, we report ten new unbound B- and A-type hypervelocity star (HVS) candidates (designated LAMOST-HVS5 through LAMOST-HVS14), tripling the number of unbound HVSs previously identified by LAMOST. Kinematic analyses suggest that these newly discovered HVS candidates likely originated either from the Galactic Center or via dynamical interactions. Future high-resolution follow-up observations promise to refine the stellar parameters, distances, and elemental abundances of these candidates, thereby providing deeper insights into their origins and broadening their potential applications across astrophysics.

 - **Abstract**
 Despite its scientific importance, the low-surface-brightness universe has yet to be fully explored due to various systematic uncertainties that affect the achievable surface-brightness limit. Reducing these uncertainties requires very accurate data processing. The dark-sky flat is a widely used calibration frame for accurate flat-field correction, generated by combining the sky background from science images. However, the night sky will likely contain complex local fluctuations, thus may still lead to photometric errors in data calibrated with dark-sky flats. To address this concern, we conduct mock observations with semi-realistic sky simulation data and evaluate observation strategies to mitigate the impact of the fluctuating sky background. Our experiments consider two representative sky conditions (clear and dirty) and perform intensive comparative analysis on two observation methods (offset and rolling). Our findings suggest that the rolling dithering method, which incorporates the operation of camera rotation into conventional dithering, can provide more accurate dark-sky flats. Finally, we discuss the broader implications of this method through additional experiments examining several factors that may affect the imaging quality of observational data.

          Gigaparsec structures are nowhere to be seen in $Λ$CDM: an enhanced analysis of LSS in FLAMINGO-10K simulations

 - **Abstract**
 Recently, Sawala et al. 2025 claimed to refute the cosmological significance of the Giant Arc based on their analysis of the FLAMINGO-10K simulation data. In our paper here, we highlight several shortcomings of the authors' analysis. We then perform an enhanced analysis on the FLAMINGO-10K simulation data with applications of: the Single-Linkage Hierarchical Clustering (SLHC), the Convex Hull of Member Spheres (CHMS), and the Minimal Spanning Tree (MST) algorithms. Using the full $2.8^3$ Gpc$^3$ FLAMINGO-10K box, with subhaloes at $z=0.7$, and $100$ random realisations (from random subset selections) we find no gigaparsec structures in FLAMINGO-10K, and only a few ultra-large large-scale structures (uLSSs, structures exceeding a maximum pairwise separation of $370$ Mpc). Somewhat surprisingly, we found that the large-scale aspects of the FLAMINGO-10K data could be adequately represented by a Poisson point distribution. The enhanced analysis presented here further supports the remarkable nature of the Giant Arc as a cosmologically-significant structure. Of course, the Giant Arc is also accompanied by a second uLSS, the Big Ring. The analysis presented here builds on the work presented by Sawala et al., but amends the application of their statistical assessments. We do not yet know why there appears to be such a large discrepancy between the FLAMINGO-10K data and the observed LSS in MgII absorbers. Perhaps the results presented here might suggest that the GA, and especially the GA + BR, presents a more direct challenge to $\Lambda$CDM. In contrast to the conclusion of Sawala et al. that `gigaparsec patterns abound in a $\Lambda$CDM universe' we find that they are nowhere to be seen.

 We study the G013.313+0.193 G013.313 region, a complex environment characterized by molecular cloud interactions indicative of cloud-cloud collision (CCC). Observations of the NH3(1,1) and (2,2) inversion transitions were obtained using the Nanshan 26 m radio telescope, while HCO+ (1-0), 12CO, 13CO, and C18O(1-0) transitions from the Purple Mountain Observatory Delingha 14 m telescope. Archival data are also included. We identified key observational signatures of CCC, including complementary spatial distributions, U-shaped structures, bridge features, and V-shaped velocity distributions. The position-velocity diagrams (P-V) reveal clear indications of gas interaction between two velocity components, suggesting an ongoing collision at an estimated angle of approximately 45 degree to the line of sight. The estimated collision timescale is 0.35-1.03 Myr, aligned with the inferred ages of young stellar objects (YSOs) in the region, supporting the hypothesis of collision-induced star formation. Hub-filament system (HFS) are identified in the compressed gas region, where filaments converge toward a dense hub, suggesting the CCC as a potential driver of HFS formation and massive star formation. The high column density suggests favorable conditions for the formation of massive stars. Although alternative kinematic drivers such as longitudinal collapse and shear motion are considered, CCC remains the most plausible explanation for the observed features. Our findings contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms of cloud dynamics and massive star formation in turbulent molecular environments.

 - **Abstract**
 Interstellar hydrogen atoms (H atoms) penetrate into the heliosphere through the region of the solar wind interaction with the interstellar plasma due to their large mean free path. Resonant charge exchange of H atoms with protons has been considered as the main interaction process between the components. In the majority of models, other processes like elastic H-H and H-p collisions are not included. Moreover, it has been assumed that the velocities of the colliding particles remain unchanged during charge exchange. This corresponds to the scattering on the angle of $\pi$ in the centre mass rest frame. The goal of this paper is to explore effects of the elastic H-H and H-p collisions as well as the angular scattering during charge exchange on the distribution of the interstellar atoms in the heliosphere and at its boundary. We present results of simple (and therefore, easily repeatable) kinetic model of the interstellar atom penetration through the region of the solar and interstellar winds interaction into the heliosphere. As a result of the model we compute the distribution function of the interstellar atoms at different heliospheric distances. Further, this distribution function is used to compute its moments and potentially observable features such as absorption and backscattered spectra in the Lyman-alpha line. Results show that there are differences in the behavior of the distribution function when considering elastic collisions and the changes in the moments of the distribution achieve 10%. Therefore, in cases where precise calculation of H atom parameters is essential, such as in the modeling of backscattered Lyman-$\alpha$ emission, elastic collisions must be considered.

 - **Abstract**
 The prompt emission of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) is supposed to be released from the relativistic jet launched from the central engine. Apart from the non-thermal nature of the spectra in a majority of GRBs, there is evidence for the presence of quasi-thermal components in the prompt emission of a few GRBs according to observations by Fermi satellite. On the other hand, the GRB jet has been revealed as structured in recent research. The theoretical observed spectra of photosphere emissions by an off-axis observer and the dependence of the spectra on the viewing angle under the assumption of structured jets remain unexplored. In this paper, we numerically calculate the instantaneous photosphere spectra by different viewing angles from a structured jet, from which relevant temporal and spectral characteristics are derived. Moreover, we address the necessity of proper treatment of the outflow boundary in the photosphere emission scenario. Furthermore, our calculations suggest that the Einstein Probe and Space-based multi-band astronomical Variable Object Monitor will have the capability to detect the short GRBs similar to GRB 170817A up to a luminosity distance of 200Mpc if the off-axis viewing angle is less than 10 degrees.

 - **Abstract**
 $\delta$ Scuti ($\delta$ Sct) stars are potential distance tracers for studying the Milky Way structure. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of the period-luminosity (PL) and period-luminosity-metallicity (PLZ) relation for $\delta$ Sct stars, integrating data from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST), Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE), and Gaia. To mitigate the impact of the Gaia parallax zero point offset, we applied a correction method, determining the optimal zero point value to be $zp_\varpi = 35 \pm 2 \, \mu\text{as}$. Using the three best bands, by varying the parallax error threshold, we found that the total error of the PLR zero point was minimized to 0.9\% at a parallax error threshold of 6\%. With this threshold, we derived the PL and PLZ relation for nine bands (from optical to mid-infrared) and five Wesenheit bands. Through our analysis, we conclude that the influence of metallicity on the PLR of $\delta$ Sct stars is not significant, and the differences across various bands are minimal.

 Potential vibrational modes associated with diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs) could be discerned by examining energy differences between correlated DIBs. Consequently, $\approx 10^3$ higher correlated DIB pairs ($r-\sigma_r \ge 0.8$, $\ge 12$ sightlines) were extracted from the Apache Point Observatory DIB catalog, and their energy spacings computed. In this first macro exploratory step, a histogram possibly reveals chemical bond signatures of C$\equiv$C, C$\equiv$N, S$-$H, C$-$O, C$=$O, Si$-$H, N$-$H, C$-$H (aliphatic), C$\mathbf{^{\underline{...}}}$C (in-ring), and aromatics (C$-$H stretch, C$\mathbf{^{\underline{...}}}$C in-ring, oop C$-$H bending, and overtones). Continued research is required to (in)validate the histogram approach, mitigate noise, scrutinize maxima, break degeneracies, and converge upon an optimal framework.

 - **Abstract**
 The 21-cm forest offers a powerful cosmological probe of the thermal history and small-scale structure of the intergalactic medium during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). Its success, however, critically depends on the availability of high-redshift radio-loud quasars (HzRLQs) as background sources. In this work, we investigate the configuration requirements for a Moon-based low-frequency radio interferometer aimed at maximizing the detection of HzRLQs for future 21-cm forest studies. Building upon a previously developed quasar luminosity function (QLF), we forecast HzRLQ abundances under various array configurations. Assuming a total survey area of $10^4\,\mathrm{deg}^2$ and 1 year of observation, we compare continuum surveys with 10 MHz bandwidth and 21-cm forest surveys with 5 kHz resolution. Our results show that a minimum collecting area of $\sim$6 500 m$^2$ enables detection at $z \sim 6$, while SKA-like arrays ($N_{\mathrm{st}} = 512$) extend the detection limit to $z \sim 10$ for 21-cm forest survey and $z \sim 16$ for continuum survey. Larger arrays with $N_{\mathrm{st}} = 2048$ can reach $z \sim 11$ in 21-cm forest mode. We also explore configurations that maintain fixed collecting areas while increasing the number to enhance survey efficiency. This boosts source detection but significantly increases the data volume and computational demands. These results underscore the importance of optimizing array design for different survey goals and balancing sensitivity, spectral resolution, and data management. A well-designed Moon-based array could open a new observational window on reionization and early cosmic structure formation.

 A search was carried out for pulsars with periods (P) from 2 to 90 s in daily observations carried out over an interval of 5 years in a area measuring 6300 this http URL. The data was obtained on a Large Phased Array (LPA) at a frequency of 111 MHz. The periodograms calculated using the Fast Folding Algorithm (FFA) were used for the search. To increase the sensitivity, the periodograms obtained in different observation sessions were added together. Of the 14 known pulsars that entered the study area, with periods of P>2 s and dispersion measures (DM) less than 200 pc/cm$^3$, 9 were detected. 2 new pulsars have been found. The mean profiles of pulsars are obtained and estimates of their flux densities are given. The open pulsar J1951+28, with a period of P = 7.3342 s and DM = 3.5 pc/cm$^3$, turned out to be one of the pulsars closest to the Sun. The absence of new pulsars with periods of tens of seconds with a search sensitivity of 1 mJy outside the Galactic plane indicates a low probability of the existence of pulsars with extremely long periods. Most likely, the recently found sources of periodic radiation with periods from a minute to tens of minutes are white dwarfs.

 - **Abstract**
 Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) have emerged as a powerful tool for cosmological studies, particularly through the dispersion measure-redshift ($\mathrm{DM}-z$) relation. This work proposes a novel calibration method for FRBs using the Yang-Li-Zhang (YLZ) empirical relation, which links the rotation measure (RM) of FRBs to the luminosity of their associated persistent radio sources (PRS). We demonstrate that this approach provides independent constraints on cosmological parameters, bypassing limitations inherent to traditional $\mathrm{DM}-z$ method. Utilizing the current sample of four YLZ-calibrated FRBs, we derive a Hubble constant measurement of $H_0 = 86.18_{-14.99}^{+18.03}\ \mathrm{km\ s^{-1}\ Mpc^{-1}}$ (68\% CL). Monte Carlo simulations indicate that a future catalog of 400 FRB-PSR systems could reduce the relative uncertainty of $H_0$ to 4.5\%. Combining YLZ-calibrated FRBs with $\mathrm{DM}-z$ sample reveals critical synergies: joint analysis of equalized samples ($N=100$ for both methods) reduces the relative uncertainty of $H_0$ to 2.9\%, mainly because the incorporation of PRS observations substantially mitigates the degeneracy between the parameters such as IGM baryon mass fraction ($f_{\rm IGM}$) and other cosmological parameters inherent to the $\mathrm{DM}-z$ relation.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) framework for cosmological parameter estimation via void lensing analysis. Despite the absence of an analytical model of void lensing, SBI can effectively learn posterior distributions through forward modeling of mock data. We develop a forward modeling pipeline that accounts for both cosmology and the galaxy-halo connection. By training a neural density estimator on simulated data, we infer the posteriors of two cosmological parameters, $\Omega_m$ and $S_8$. Validation tests are conducted on posteriors derived from different cosmological parameters and a fiducial sample. The results demonstrate that SBI provides unbiased estimates of mean values and accurate uncertainties. These findings highlight the potential to apply void lensing analysis to observational data even without an analytical void lensing model.

          Physical vs phantom dark energy after DESI: thawing quintessence in a curved background

 - **Abstract**
 Recent data from DESI, in combination with other data, provide moderate evidence of dynamical dark energy, $w\neq-1$. In the $w_0, w_a$ parametrization of $w$, there is a preference for a phantom crossing, $w<-1$, at redshift $z\sim0.5$. In general relativity, the phantom equation of state is unphysical. Thus it is important to check whether phantom crossing is present in other physically self-consistent models of dark energy that have equivalent evidence to the $w_0, w_a$ parametrization. We find that thawing quintessence with nonzero cosmic curvature can fit the recent data slightly better than $w_0, w_a$ in a flat background. The phantom crossing may be a spurious artifact of a parametrization that is not based on a physical model.

          Non-minimal coupling in light of ACT

 - **Abstract**
 The latest ACT data release disfavors the attractor $n_s=1-2/N$. In inflationary models with nonminimal coupling, such attractors typically arise in the strong coupling limit. To align with observational constraints, we focus on nonminimal coupling models with small coupling constants. For the model with the coupling function $\Omega(\phi) = 1 + \xi f(\phi)$ and the potential $V(\phi) = \lambda^2 f^2(\phi)$, we find that observational data constrain the parameters as $0.1 \lesssim \xi \lesssim 35$ and $0 \lesssim k \lesssim 1.5$ for $f(\phi) = \phi^k$ at the $1\sigma$ confidence level. With the help of the nonmiminal coupling $\Omega(\phi) = 1 + \xi \phi^2$, the hilltop inflation and power-law inflation models with power indices $2/3$ and $1/3$ can be consistent with observational data within the $1\sigma$ range. We also give the viable parameter regions for $\xi$ for these three models.

          Did DESI DR2 truly reveal dynamical dark energy?

 - **Abstract**
 A fundamental question in cosmology is whether dark energy evolves over time, a topic that has gained prominence since the discovery of cosmic acceleration. Recently, the DESI collaboration has reported increasing evidence for evolving dark energy using combinations of cosmic microwave background (CMB), type Ia supernova (SN), and their new measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO). However, our analysis reveals that these combinations are problematic due to clear tensions among the CMB, BAO and SN datasets. Consequently, DESI's claim of dynamical dark energy (DDE) is not robust. A more reliable approach involves constraining the evolution of dark energy using each dataset independently. Through a statistical comparison for each dataset, on average, we find that DDE is strongly preferred over the $\Lambda$CDM model. This suggests that DDE likely exists, although its real parameter space remains elusive due to weak constraints on the dark energy equation of state and inconsistencies among the datasets. Interestingly, when considering DDE, none of the individual datasets -- including CMB, DESI DR2, Pantheon+, Union3, and DESY5 -- can independently detect cosmic acceleration at a significant level. Our findings not only clarify the current understanding of the nature of dark energy but also challenge the established discovery of cosmic acceleration and the long-held notion that dark energy exerts negative pressure. Both individual and combined datasets suggest that the ultimate fate of the universe is likely to be dominated by matter rather than dark energy.

          Coronal Gas in Magellanic-Analog Dwarfs: Insights from the \textsc{HESTIA} Simulations

 - **Abstract**
 We characterize the warm circumgalactic medium (CGM) of a dwarf galaxy pair with properties similar to the Magellanic Clouds in the \textsc{Hestia} cosmological simulations. The system consists of a massive dwarf ($M_{\rm halo} \sim 10^{11.5} M_{\odot}$) and a lower-mass companion ($M_{\rm halo} \sim 10^{10} M_{\odot}$), dynamically evolving in isolation before infall into a Milky Way-mass halo. The massive dwarf hosts a warm coronal gas envelope with a temperature of $T \sim 3 \times 10^5$ K, consistent with expectations for virialized CGM in dwarf halos. Tidal interactions produce a neutral gas stream that extends over $\sim 150$ kpc, with an \ion{H}{1} mass of $M_{\rm HI} \sim 10^8 M_{\odot}$, similar to the Magellanic Stream. Furthermore, in the \textsc{Hestia} simulation suite, we find that coronal gas is ubiquitous in all halos with $M_{\rm halo} > 10^{11} M_{\odot}$, implying that massive dwarfs generically develop extended gaseous envelopes prior to accretion. This result has significant implications for the survival of neutral tidal structures, and suggests that current and future high-ion UV absorption-line observations are indicative of warm coronae surrounding LMC-mass dwarfs, independent of their environment.

          Is Dynamical Dark Energy Necessary? DESI BAO and Modified Recombination

 - **Abstract**
 Recent measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) exhibit a mild-to-moderate tension with cosmic microwave background (CMB) and Type Ia supernova (SN) observations when interpreted within a flat $\Lambda$CDM framework. This discrepancy has been cited as evidence for dynamical dark energy (DDE). Given the profound implications of DDE for fundamental physics, we explore whether the tension can instead be resolved by modifying the physics of recombination. We find that a phenomenological model of modified recombination can effectively reconcile the BAO and CMB datasets and, unlike DDE, also predicts a higher Hubble constant $H_0$, thereby partially alleviating the Hubble tension. A global fit to BAO, CMB, and calibrated SN data clearly favors modified recombination over DDE, suggesting that current claims of a DDE detection may be premature.

 - **Abstract**
 The Roman Space Telescope Galactic Bulge Time Domain Survey (GBTDS) is expected to detect ~10^5 transiting planets. Many of these planets will have short orbital periods and are thus susceptible to tidal decay. We use a catalog of simulated transiting planet detections to predict the yield of orbital decay detections in the Roman GBTDS. Assuming a constant stellar tidal dissipation factor, Q^{'}_{*}, of 10^6, we predict ~ 5 - 10 detections. We additionally consider an empirical period-dependent parameterization of Q^{'}_{*} \propto P^{-3} and find a substantially suppressed yield. We conclude that Roman will provide constraints on the rate of planet engulfment in the Galaxy and probe the physics of tidal dissipation in stars.

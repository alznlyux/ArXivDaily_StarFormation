 - **Abstract**
 A core-corona decomposition of compact (neutron) star models was compared with the current mass-radius data of the outlier XTE~J1814-338. The corona (which may also be dubbed the envelope, halo or outer crust) is assumed to be of Standard Model matter, with an equation of state that is supposed to be faithfully known and accommodates nearly all other neutron star data. The core, solely parameterized by its mass, radius and transition pressure, presents a challenge regarding its composition. We derived a range of core parameters needed to describe the current data of XTE J1814-338.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a probabilistic model for the QCD critical endpoint (CEP) and the equation of state (EOS) at $\beta$-equilibrium, constrained by neutron-star observations. Using a hybrid framework that combines the holographic V-QCD model with an effective van der Waals description of nuclear matter, we generate a large ensemble of EOSs incorporating nuclear theory uncertainties. Constraining this ensemble with neutron-star mass-radius data and tidal deformability measurements from gravitational waves, we identify a strong first-order deconfinement transition at zero temperature, with a transition strength of $\Delta n_{\rm{PT}}/n_0 = 3.75^{+0.70}_{-0.53}$ and onset density $n_{\rm{PT}}/n_0 = 4.9^{+1.33}_{-1.17}$. The resulting posterior yields $95\%$ credible intervals for the CEP location: $\mu_{\rm{crit}} = 626^{+90}_{-179}\,\rm{MeV}$, $T_{\rm{crit}} = 119^{+14}_{-6}\,\rm{MeV}$.

          Bayesian luminosity function estimation in multidepth datasets with selection effects: a case study for $3<z<5$ Ly$α$ emitters

 - **Abstract**
 We present a hierarchical Bayesian framework designed to infer the luminosity function of any class of objects by jointly modeling data from multiple surveys with varying depth, completeness, and sky coverage. Our method explicitly accounts for selection effects and measurement uncertainties (e.g., in luminosity) and could be generalized to any extensive quantity, such as mass. We validate the model using mock catalogs, recovering how deep data reaching $\gtrsim 1.5$ dex below a characteristic luminosity $\tilde{L}^\star$ are essential to reduce biases at the faint end ($\lesssim 0.1$ dex), while wide-area data help constrain the bright end. As proof of concept, we consider a combined sample of 1176 Ly$\alpha$ emitters at redshift $3 < z < 5$ drawn from several MUSE surveys, ranging from ultra-deep ($\gtrsim 90$ hr) and narrow ($\lesssim 1$ arcmin$^2$) fields to shallow ($\lesssim 5$ hr) and wide ($\gtrsim 20$ arcmin$^2$) fields. With this complete sample, we constrain the luminosity function parameters $\log(\Phi^\star/\mathrm{Mpc^{-3}}) = -2.86^{+0.15}_{-0.17}$, $\log(L^\star/\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}) = 42.72^{+0.10}_{-0.09}$, and $\alpha = -1.81^{+0.09}_{-0.09}$, where the uncertainties represent the $90\%$ credible intervals. These values are in agreement with studies based on gravitational lensing that reach $\log(L/\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}) \approx 41$, although differences in the faint-end slope underscore how systematic errors are starting to dominate. In contrast, wide-area surveys represent the natural extension needed to constrain the brightest Ly$\alpha$ emitters [$\log(L/\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}) \gtrsim 43$], where statistical uncertainties still dominate.

          QPEs from EMRI Debris Streams Impacting Accretion Disks in Galactic Nuclei

 - **Abstract**
 Quasi-periodic eruption (QPE) sources in galactic nuclei are often associated with a stellar object orbiting a supermassive black hole with hours-days period, brought in as an extreme mass-ratio inspiral (EMRI). In the presence of an accretion disk, repeated star-disk collisions lead to ablation of a small fraction of the stellar mass during each disk passage. We analytically follow the evolution of the stellar debris as it is tidally stretched outside the EMRI's Hill sphere, forming an elongated, dilute stream, that subsequently collides with the disk, half an orbit after the previous star-disk encounter. At sufficiently long orbital periods ($\gtrsim 12$ hr), the stream is too dilute to penetrate the disk, and is instead strongly shocked and deflected at its surface through a reverse shock. We obtain the resulting emission and explore implications for QPE observations. Due to their low optical depth and prolonged interaction time, radiation from the shocked streams typically dominates over that from shocked disk gas directly impacted by the star or by ejecta confined within its Hill sphere, as was first proposed by Yao et al. 2025. We find that: (1) QPE flare durations reflect the stream-disk collision timescale; (2) Flare luminosities of $10^{42-43}$ erg/s, consistent with observed QPEs, are robustly produced; (3) Soft X-ray flares with temperatures of ${\sim}$100 eV arise when the stream mass is sufficient to sustain a radiation mediated shock at the collision interface. Higher mass streams yield softer flares, typically outshone by the disk, while lower mass streams result in collisionless shocks, which likely produce fainter and harder flares. We discuss observational implications of the temporal evolution of the underlying disk, assuming it is the remnant of a prior tidal disruption event in the same galaxy.

          V455 Car: an oscillating eclipsing Algol-type binary in triple star system

 - **Abstract**
 V455 Car is a southern oscillating eclipsing Algol-type system with an orbital period of 5.132888 days. Our first photometric solutions based on the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite indicate that it is a semi-detached binary with the secondary star is almost filling its Roche lobe. The noticeable O'Connell effect in light curve could be explained by hot spot on the primary component, which may be attributed to the mass transfer from the secondary component to the primary one. The absolute parameters are determined as: $M_{1} = 5.30 \pm 1.10 \, \rm M_{\odot}$, $R_{1} = 3.17 \pm 0.22 \, \rm R_{\odot}$ for the primary, and $M_{2} = 1.58 \pm 0.32 \, \rm M_{\odot}$, $R_{2} = 6.66 \pm 0.46 \, \rm R_{\odot}$ for the secondary. \textbf{Based on $O-C$ analysis, we find a periodic variation of $P_3=26.62(\pm1.66)\,yr$. The periodic oscillation suggests a possible third body with a minimal mass of $0.59(\pm0.13)\,\rm M_{\odot}$}. It is speculated that the secondary star has undergone a longer evolution, leading to a mass ratio reversal being experienced in the binary system. Our frequency analysis finds that the primary of V455 Car may be an SPB/SLF star. This study reports a novel example of an oscillating eclipsing Algol-type system featuring an SPB/SLF primary star and a red giant star, which suggest that strong observational results for a high incidence of third bodies in massive binaries.

          Positron Signal from the Early Universe

 - **Abstract**
 Bursts from the very early universe may lead to a detectable signal via the production of positrons, whose annihilation gives an observable X-ray signal. Using the absorption parameters for the annihilation photons of 511 keV, it is found that observable photons would originate at a red-shift around $z\approx$ 200-300, resulting in soft X-rays of energy $\sim$ 2-3 keV at present. Positrons are expected to be absent at these times or red-shifts in the standard picture of the early universe. Detection of the X-rays would thus provide dramatic support for the hypothesis of the bursts, explosive events at very early times. We urge the search for such a signal.

          No influence of passing stars on paleoclimate reconstructions over the past 56 million years

 - **Abstract**
 Passing stars (also called stellar flybys) have notable effects on the solar system's long-term dynamical evolution, injection of Oort cloud comets into the solar system, properties of trans-Neptunian objects, and more. Based on a simplified solar system model, omitting the Moon and the Sun's quadrupole moment J2, it has recently been suggested that passing stars are also an important driver of paleoclimate before ~50 Myr ago, including a climate event called the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (~56 Myr ago). In contrast, using a state-of-the-art solar system model, including a lunar contribution and J2, and random stellar parameters (>400 simulations), we find no influence of passing stars on paleoclimate reconstructions over the past 56 Myr. Even in an extreme flyby scenario in which the Sun-like star HD 7977 (m = 1.07 M_Sun) would have passed within ~3,900 au about 2.8 Myr ago (with 5% likelihood), we detect no discernible change in Earth's orbital evolution over the past 70 Myr, compared to our standard model. Our results indicate that a complete physics model is essential to accurately study the effects of stellar flybys on Earth's orbital evolution.

          Gravitational Radiation-Driven Chaotic Tide in a White Dwarf-Massive Black Hole Binary as a Source of Repeating X-ray Transients

 - **Abstract**
 Eccentric white dwarf-massive black hole binaries can potentially source some extreme X-ray transients, including the recently observed quasi-periodic X-ray eruptions and tidal disruption events at the galactic nuclei. Meanwhile, they are one of the target gravitational wave sources with extreme mass ratios for future millihertz gravitational wave missions. In this work, we focus on the tidal evolution and orbital dynamics of such binaries under the influence of the tidal backreaction and the dissipative effect from gravitational wave emission. We find that the latter can cause the dynamical tide to evolve chaotically after more than one orbital harmonics encounter the mode resonance through orbital decay. Different from the tidal-driven chaos, which only occurs for pericenter distances within around two times the tidal radius ($R_t$), this gravitational wave-driven chaos can happen at much larger pericenter distances. The growth scales similarly to a diffusive process, in which the tidal energy grows linearly with time on average over a long duration. If the tidal energy eventually approaches the stellar binding energy, achievable when the pericenter distance is less than $4R_t$, it can cause mass ejection as the wave breaks due to nonlinear effects. We show that this can potentially lead to the repeating partial tidal disruptions observed at galactic centers. That means these disruptions can occur at a much larger pericenter distance than previous analytical estimates. Furthermore, if the system can evolve to a close pericenter distance of about 2.7$R_t$, the white dwarf can further lose mass via tidal stripping at each pericenter passage. This provides a mechanism for producing the quasi-periodic eruptions.

          Unlocking the mystery of Sr synthesis in the early Galaxy through analysis of barium isotopes in very metal-poor stars

 - **Abstract**
 We determine the contributions of the rapid (r) and slow (s) neutron capture processes to the Ba isotope mixture, along with Ba, Eu, and Sr NLTE abundances, in a sample of very metal-poor stars. The selected stars formed before the contribution from the main s-process in low- and intermediate-mass stars became significant. Some of our sample stars are enhanced in Sr, with [Sr/Ba] reaching up to 0.7. These stars gained their high Sr abundance from a poorly understood process, which may appear to be a weak s-process or a weak r-process. Our aim is to uncover the nature of this additional Sr source. The abundances derived from the resonance Ba II lines are influenced by the adopted Ba isotope mixture. We compute Ba isotope mixtures corresponding to different r- to s-process contributions and determine the corresponding abundances from the Ba II resonance lines in each sample star. Additionally, we determine Ba abundances from weak subordinate Ba II lines, which are unaffected by the adopted Ba isotope mixture. We then compare the Ba abundances derived from the subordinate lines with those from the Ba II resonance lines. We find a higher s-process contribution to Ba isotopes in stars with greater [Sr/Eu] and [Sr/Ba] overabundances, suggesting that the additional Sr synthesis was due to the early s-process occurring in massive stars. We estimate the [Sr/Ba] ratio produced by the early s-process and obtain [Sr/Ba]_earlyS = 1.1 +- 0.2. Regarding the potential synthesis of Sr and Ba in the i-process in massive stars, our results argue that there was no detectable contribution from this process within the error bars in our sample stars. In the early Galaxy, before significant main s-process enrichment, barium and strontium were produced primarily by the main r-process and the early s-process, which occurred in rapidly rotating massive stars.

 - **Abstract**
 The role of non-thermal proton energy transportation during solar and stellar flares is largely unknown; a better understanding of this physical process will allow us to rectify longstanding deficiencies in flare models. One way to detect the presence of non-thermal protons during flares is through the Orrall-Zirker (OZ) effect whereby an enhanced red wing appears in hydrogen emission lines (e.g., Lyman-$\alpha$ at 1215.67 Angstrom). We analyze archival Hubble Space Telescope/Cosmic Origins Spectrograph G130M (1060 - 1360 Angstrom) observations of the young M dwarf, AU Mic to search for evidence of OZ effect during the impulsive phase of six stellar flares with $E_\textrm{flare} \approx 10^{30 - 31}$ erg. While we found non-detections of the OZ effect, we note there is a pronounced blue enhancement in several C II and C III emission lines during one of the high-energy flares. We propose that either filament eruptions or chromospheric evaporation could be the mechanism driving this observed blue enhancement. We compare the far-ultraviolet (FUV) spectra to 1D radiative-hydrodynamic stellar flare models, which are unable to reproduce the blue enhancement and broadening in these cool flare lines. By completing a line-by-line analysis of the FUV spectrum of AU Mic, we provide further constraints on the physical mechanisms producing stellar flares on M dwarfs.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper we discuss the observational capabilities and sensitivity of the SQM-ISS detector to primordial black holes. The SQM-ISS experiment aims to detect slow, non relativistic massive particles within cosmic rays, using a detector on board the International Space Station. The device is designed to recognize the passage of highly penetrating and dense particles in a wide range of mass and charge states such as Strange Quark Matter (SQM). These particles, traveling at speeds typical of gravitationally bound objects in the galaxy - around 250 km/s - are also possible candidates of dark matter. The ability of SQM-ISS to identify penetrating, massive and slow-moving objects allows it also to be sensitive to the detection of primordial black holes. We discuss how black holes, traveling through the detector at velocities compatible with galactic orbital speeds, can be identified based on their interaction signatures.

          Evolution of QPO During Discovery Outburst of MAXI J1834-021: Estimation of Intrinsic Parameters from Spectro-Temporal Study

 - **Abstract**
 The Galactic transient black hole candidate (BHC) MAXI~J1834-021 was detected for the first time by MAXI/GSC on February 05, 2023 and it was active for next $\sim 10$~months. A monotonic evolution of low-frequency QPOs from higher to lower frequencies is observed in the middle-phase of the outburst. We study this evolution of the QPO with the propagating oscillatory shock (POS) model, and it suggests the presence of a receding shock. The POS model fit also estimates the mass of the source to be $12.1\pm0.3~M_\odot$. We also study the boradband ($0.5$-$70$~keV) nature of the source using archival data of NICER and NuSTAR on March 10, 2023 with the both phenomenological (combined disk blackbody plus powerlaw) and physical (\textit{nthComp, kerrbb, TCAF}) models. The mass of the BHC estimated by the \texttt{kerbb} and \texttt{TCAF} models is found to be consistent with POS model fits as well as reported in our recent work. Combining all these methods, we predict mass of the source as $12.3^{+1.1}_{-2.0}~M_\odot$. The \texttt{kerbb} model fit also estimates the spin, distance, and inclination of the source to be $0.13^{+0.03}_{-0.02}$, $9.2^{+0.4}_{-0.9}$~kpc, and $80^\circ.0$$^{+2.7}_{-6.0}$, respectively. The combined spectral study suggests harder spectral state of the source with a higher dominance of the sub-Keplerian halo accretion rate over the Keplerian disk rate. The consistency of the observed frequency of the QPO with that of obtained from the \texttt{TCAF} model fitted shock parameters, confirms shock oscillation as the origin of the QPO.

          On the Efficacy of Ocean Formation with a Primordial Hydrogen Atmosphere

 - **Abstract**
 It has been suggested that Earth's present water budget formed from oxidation reactions between its initial hydrogen-rich primordial atmosphere and its magma ocean. Here we examine this hypothesis by building a comprehensive atmosphere-magma ocean model. We find that water formation is unlikely for two reasons. First, any water formed from oxidation reactions in the magma ocean would quickly outgass because of the water-poor atmosphere above. Second, the top boundary layer of the magma ocean becomes stable against convection because the oxidation reactions produce metallic iron, which sinks to the core of a growing Earth. This iron loss makes the top boundary layer significantly more buoyant than the rest of the magma, thus becoming stable against mixing. Our results suggest that hydrogen dissolution is unlikely to play a major role in the formation of Earth's oceans.

          On the Mass Budget Problem of Protoplanetary Disks: Streaming Instability and Optically Thick Emission

 - **Abstract**
 Statistical studies of protoplanetary disks and exoplanet populations often exhibit a "missing mass" problem, where observed dust masses in (sub-)millimeter surveys are significantly lower than expected when compared to the mass of evolved exoplanetary systems. We investigate how the streaming instability and subsequent planetesimal formation in protoplanetary disks might solve this missing mass problem when (sub-)millimeter observations are interpreted under the assumption of optically thin emission. We conduct hydrodynamical simulations of the streaming instability with self-gravity after which radiative transfer calculations with dust scattering are performed to measure the (sub-)millimeter intensity. The measured intensity is then used to estimate the disk mass under the assumption of optically thin emission and compared to the true mass in the simulation to calculate the observational bias via the mass excess. We find that the emission from overdense filaments that emerge due to the streaming instability are optically thick at (sub-)millimeter wavelengths, leading to mass excess factors of $\sim 2-7$, even when the optically thick fraction is low.

 - **Abstract**
 Open clusters offer crucial insights into stellar nucleosynthesis and the chemical evolution of the Galactic disc, as their ages and distances can be determined with higher accuracy compared to field stars. In this study, we investigate the outermost regions of the Milky Way disc using two previously unstudied open clusters -Auner 1 and Berkeley 102- located at Galactocentric distances of approximately 14 kpc in largely uncharted areas of the Galaxy. We obtained medium-resolution spectra (R > 18,700) using the MEGARA integral-field unit (IFU) spectrograph on the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC), targeting red giant member stars in both clusters. From these spectra, we derived radial velocities, stellar atmospheric parameters, and chemical abundances for six elements: Fe, Ca, Co, Ni, Ba, and Eu. Additionally, we provide updated estimates of the clusters' ages and distances. Both clusters are old (3.2 +- 0.7 Ga), distant (d ~ 8 kpc), and lie below the Galactic plane (Z Gal ~ -0.7 kpc), with moderate extinction (AV ~ 1.3 mag). We find that Auner 1 has a metallicity of [Fe/H] = -0.30 +- 0.09 and Berkeley 102 of [Fe/H] = -0.35 +- 0.06, consistent with other clusters at similar Galactocentric radii and indicating minimal azimuthal variation in metallicity. The [X/Fe] abundance ratios align with expected trends, although [Ca/Fe] is slightly higher in both clusters, and [Eu/Fe] is notably enhanced in Berkeley 102 ([Eu/Fe] = 0.64 +- 0.05). Our findings highlight the effectiveness of GTC/MEGARA in IFU mode for Galactic archaeology and emphasize the need for further medium-to-high resolution spectroscopic studies of remote open clusters to refine models of the outer Galactic disc's chemical evolution.

          A Visibility-based 21 cm Bispectrum Estimator for Radio-interferometric Data

 - **Abstract**
 We present a fast and scalable estimator for the binned multi-frequency angular bispectrum (MABS) and the 3D bispectrum (BS) of the redshifted 21 cm signal from radio interferometric observations. The estimator operates on gridded visibilities and leverages the FFT-based acceleration to efficiently compute the MABS and the 3D BS covering all possible triangle configurations. We present the formalism and validate the estimator using simulated visibility data for a known input model BS, considering the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) observations with a bandwidth of $30.72$ MHz centered at $154.25$ MHz. We consider two cases, namely, without flagging, and with flagging, which has exactly the same frequency channels flagged as the actual data. We obtain estimates of the BS for a wide range of triangle shapes covering the scales $0.003 ~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}\leq k_1 \leq 1.258 ~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. The estimated BS shows excellent agreement with analytical predictions based on the input model BS. We find that the deviations, which are below 20\% even in the presence of flagging, are mostly consistent with the expected statistical fluctuations. This work paves the way for reliable observational estimates of the 21 cm BS for the epoch of reionization, where the signal is predicted to be highly non-Gaussian.

 - **Abstract**
 We provide a meta-study of the statistical and individual properties of two volume-complete sets of evolved stars in the Solar Neighbourhood: (1) 852 stars from the Nearby Evolved Stars Survey (NESS), and (2) a partially overlapping set of 507 evolved stars within 300 pc. We also investigate distance determinations to these stars, their luminosity functions and their spatial distribution. Gaia APSIS GSP-Phot AENEAS temperatures of bright giant stars often appear to be underestimated. Existing literature on AGB stars under-samples both the most and least extreme nearby dust-producing stars. We reproduce the literature star-formation history of the solar neighbourhood, though stellar-evolution models over-predict the number of AGB stars of ages around 500 Myr. The distribution of AGB stars broadly matches the known 300 pc scale height of the Galactic disc and shows concentration in the direction of the Galactic centre. Most dust-producing carbon stars belong to the Galactic thick-disc population.

 - **Abstract**
 Here, the $\alpha$-attractor inflation is investigated within a framework incorporating a minimal measurable length, as implemented by the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP). The GUP modifications to the Friedmann equations and cosmological perturbation parameters are employed to assess the model observational viability against recent high-precision data, primarily from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope Data Release 6 (ACT DR6) combined with Planck, DESI BAO, and BICEP/Keck 2018 observations (P-ACT-LB-BK18). Our results indicate that while the standard $\alpha$-attractor model ($\beta=0$) for $N_*=60$ lies near the $2\sigma$ boundary of the P-ACT-LB-BK18 dataset, the inclusion of GUP effects significantly shifts the predictions for the scalar spectral index $n_s$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. Notably, for the GUP parameter $\beta$ values surpassing approximately $10^{13}$, the model predictions are shown to fall well within the 68\% CL region of this combined observational data, enhancing its consistency. The viable parameter space in the $\alpha-\beta$ plane is explored, revealing that a maximum $\alpha \simeq 0.74$ is consistent with the 68\% CL for $\beta \simeq 1.4\times 10^{13}$. In addition, for smaller values of $\alpha$, the predictions of the model remain inside the 68\% CL region for larger values of $\beta$.

 - **Abstract**
 We present periodicity and single-pulse searches at 1250 MHz for 22 radio-quiet gamma-ray pulsars, conducted using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope (FAST). For PSR J1813$-$1246, we successfully detected pulsed signals with a spin period of 48.08 ms and a dispersion measure of 209.85 ${\rm pc cm^{-3}}$, consistent with the spin period measured at gamma-ray wavelengths. The estimated flux density is approximately 9 $\mu$Jy. For the remaining 21 sources, no radio emission was detected, with flux density upper limits of several $ \mu$Jy. The capability to detect pulsars with such low flux densities provides the opportunity to determine if and how these faint sources differ from much radio-brighter pulsars.

 - **Abstract**
 We present observations of SN 2023xgo, a transitional Type Ibn/Icn SN, from $-5.6$ to 63 days relative to $r$-band peak. Early spectra show CIII $\lambda$5696 emission like Type Icn SNe, shifting to Type Ibn features. The He I velocities (1800-10000 km s$^{-1}$) and pseudo-equivalent widths are among the highest in the Ibn/Icn class. The light curve declines at 0.14 mag d$^{-1}$ until 30 days, matching SNe Ibn/Icn but slower than fast transients. SN 2023xgo is the faintest in our SN Ibn sample (M$_{r}$ = -17.65 $\pm$ 0.04) but shows typical colour and host properties. Semi-analytical modelling of the light curve suggests a compact CSM shell (10$^{12}$-10$^{13}$ cm), mass-loss rate between 10$^{-4}$-10$^{-3}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ with CSM and ejecta masses of $\sim$0.22 and 0.12 M$_{\odot}$, respectively. Post-maximum light-curve, spectral modelling favours a $\sim$3 M$_{\odot}$ helium star progenitor with extended ($\sim$10$^{15}$ cm), stratified CSM (density exponent of 2.9) and mass-loss rate of 0.1-2.7 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. These two mass-loss regimes imply a radially varying CSM, shaped by asymmetry or changes in the progenitors mass loss over time. This mass-loss behavior fits both binary and single-star evolution. Early Icn-like features stem from hot carbon ionization, fading to Ibn-like with cooling. SN 2023xgo thus offers rare insight into the connection between SNe Icn, Ibn, and SNe Ibn with ejecta signatures.

 - **Abstract**
 The ALMA survey of Gas Evolution in PROtoplanetary disks (AGE-PRO) Large Program aims to trace the evolution of gas disk mass and size throughout the lifetime of protoplanetary disks. This paper presents Band-6 ALMA observations of 10 embedded (Class I and Flat Spectrum) sources in the Ophiuchus molecular cloud, with spectral types ranging from M3 to K6 stars, which serve as the evolutionary starting point in the AGE-PRO sample. While we find 4 nearly edge on disks (>70 deg.), and 3 highly inclined disks (>60 deg.) in our sample, we show that, as a population, embedded disks in Ophiuchus are not significantly contaminated by more evolved, but highly inclined sources. We derived dust disk masses from the Band 6 continuum and estimated gas disk masses from the C18O and C17O lines. The mass estimates from the C17O line are slightly higher, suggesting C18O emission might be partially optically thick. While the 12CO and 13CO lines are severely contaminated by extended emission and self-absorption, the C18O and C17O lines allowed us to trace the radial extent of the gaseous disks. From these measurements, we found that the C18O and C17O fluxes correlate well with each other and with the continuum fluxes. Furthermore, the C18O and C17O lines present a larger radial extension than disk dust sizes by factors ranging from 1.5 to 2.5, as it is found for Class II disks using the radial extension of the 12CO. In addition, we have detected outflows in three disks from 12CO observations.

 We present Band 6 and Band 7 observations of 10 Lupus disks around M3-K6 stars from the ALMA survey of Gas Evolution in PROtoplanetary disks (AGE-PRO) Large Program. In addition to continuum emission in both bands, our Band 6 setup covers the $\mathrm{{}^{12}CO}$, $\mathrm{{}^{13}CO}$ and $\mathrm{C^{18}O}\,J$=2-1 lines, while our Band 7 setup covers the $\mathrm{N_2H^+}\,J$=3-2 line. All of our sources are detected in $\mathrm{{}^{12}CO}$ and $\mathrm{{}^{13}CO}$, 7 out of 10 are detected in $\mathrm{C^{18}O}$, and 3 are detected in $\mathrm{N_2H^+}$. We find strong correlations between the CO isotopologue line fluxes and the continuum flux densities. With the exception of one disk, we also identify a strong correlation between the $\mathrm{C^{18}O}\,J$=2-1 and $\mathrm{N_2H^+}\,J$=3-2 fluxes, indicating similar CO abundances across this sample. For the two sources with well-resolved continuum and $\mathrm{{}^{12}CO}\,J$=2-1 images, we find that their gas-to-dust size ratio is consistent with the median value of $\sim 2$ inferred from a larger sample of Lupus disks. We derive dust disk masses from continuum flux densities. We estimate gas disk masses by comparing $\mathrm{C^{18}O}\,J$=2-1 line fluxes with those predicted by the limited grid of self-consistent disk models of Ruaud et al. (2022). A comparison of these mass estimates with those derived by Trapman et al. (2025), using a combination of CO isotopologue and $\mathrm{N_2H^+}$ line emission, shows that the masses are consistent with each other. Some discrepancies appear for small and faint disks, but they are still within the uncertainties. Both methods find gas disk masses increase with dust disk masses, and gas-to-dust mass ratios are between $10-100$ in the AGE-PRO Lupus sample.

 - **Abstract**
 The evolution of the gas mass of planet-forming disks around young stars is crucial for our understanding of planet formation, yet it has proven hard to constrain observationally, due both to the difficulties of measuring gas masses and the lack of a homogeneous sample. Here we present a large grid of thermochemical models which we use to measure protoplanetary gas disk masses of AGE-PRO, the ALMA survey of Gas Evolution in PROtoplanetary disks. AGE-PRO covers a sample of 30 disks around similar spectral type (M3-K6) stars with ages between 0.1 and 10 Myr. Our approach is to simultaneously fit observations of CO isotopologues and N2H+, a complementary molecule produced when CO freezes out. We find that the median gas mass of the three regions decreases over time, from 7.0(+4.4,-2.6)x10^-3 Msun in Ophiuchus (<1 Myr) to 9.4(+5.4,-3.4)x10^-4 Msun for Lupus (~1-3 Myr) and 6.8(+5.1,-2.8)x10^-4 Msun for Upper Sco (~2-6 Myr), with ~1 dex scatter in gas mass in each region. We note that the gas mass distributions for Lupus and Upper Sco look very similar, which could be due to survivorship bias for the latter. The median bulk CO abundance in the CO emitting layer is found to be a factor ~10 lower than the ISM value but does not significantly change between Lupus and Upper Sco. From Lupus to Upper Sco the median gas-to-dust mass ratio increases by a factor ~3 from ~40 to ~120, suggesting efficient inward pebble drift and/or the formation of planetesimals.

 - **Abstract**
 The potential for planet formation of a circumstellar disk depends on the dust and gas reservoirs, which evolve as a function of the disk age. The ALMA Large Program AGE-PRO has measured several disk properties across three star-forming regions of different ages, and in this study we compare the observational results to dust evolution simulations. Using DustPy for the dust evolution, and RADMC-3D for the radiative transfer, we ran a large grid of models spanning stellar masses of 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, and 1.0 $M_\odot$, with different initial conditions, including: disk sizes, disk gas masses, and dust-to-gas ratio, and viscosity. Our models are performed assuming smooth, weakly, or strongly substructured disks, aiming to investigate if any observational trend can favor or exclude the presence of dust traps. The observed gas masses in the disks of the AGE-PRO sample are not reproducible with our models, which only consider viscous evolution with constant $\alpha$, suggesting that additional physical mechanisms play a role in the evolution of the gas mass of disks. When comparing the dust continuum emission fluxes and sizes at 1.3 mm, we find that most of the disks in the AGE-PRO sample are consistent with simulations that have either weak or strong dust traps. The evolution of spectral index in the AGE-PRO sample is also suggestive of an unresolved population of dust traps. Future observations at high angular resolution are still needed to test several hypotheses that result from comparing the observations to our simulations, including that more massive disks in gas mass have the potential to form dust traps at larger disk radii.

 - **Abstract**
 Protoplanetary disk evolution can be deeply influenced by the UV radiation emitted by neighboring massive stars (mainly of spectral type O and B). We show that the process of external photoevaporation, which causes an outside-in depletion of disk material due to environmental UV radiation, can lead to a significant decrease in disk size, and moderate in disk mass and lifetime even at moderate irradiation levels (1-10 G$_{0}$). In this work we investigate the role of external photoevaporation in shaping the masses and sizes of the ten AGE-PRO disks in the Upper Scorpius region, which we estimate to be subject to FUV fluxes ranging between 2 and 12 G$_{0}$, on average. We compare the disk masses and sizes resulting from 1D numerical viscous evolution simulations in which the effect of external photoevaporation is included, to the values retrieved from the AGE-PRO observations. While the pure viscous framework fails in adequately explaining the observed disk properties in Upper Scorpius, with the inclusion of external photoevaporation we can successfully reproduce gas disk sizes for 7 out of 10 sources within a factor <2, when the initial disk mass is 1-10% of the stellar mass. We emphasize the importance of accounting for the environmental irradiation when comparing star-forming regions of different ages, even when moderate FUV irradiation fields are experienced, as in the case of Upper Scorpius.

 - **Abstract**
 We perform visibility fitting to the dust continuum Band 6 1.3 mm data of the 30 protoplanetary disks in the AGE-PRO ALMA Large Program. We obtain disk geometries, dust-disk radii, and azimuthally symmetric radial profiles of the intensity of the dust continuum emission. We examine the presence of continuum substructures in the AGE-PRO sample by using these radial profiles and their residuals. We detect substructures in 15 out of 30 disks. We report five disks with large ($>$15 au) inner dust cavities. The Ophiuchus Class I disks show dust-disk substructures in $\sim80\%$ of the resolved sources. This evidences the early formation of substructures in protoplanetary disks. A spiral is identified in IRS 63, hinting to gravitational instability in this massive disk. We compare our dust-disk brightness radial profiles with gas-disk brightness radial profiles and discuss colocal substructures in both tracers. In addition, we discuss the evolution of dust-disk radii and substructures across Ophiuchus, Lupus, and Upper Scorpius. We find that disks in Lupus and Upper Scorpius with large inner dust cavities have typical gas-disk masses, suggesting an abundance of dust cavities in these regions. The prevalence of pressure dust traps at later ages is supported by a potential trend with time with more disks with large inner dust cavities (or "transition disks") in Upper Scorpius and the absence of evolution of dust-disk sizes with time in the AGE-PRO sample. We propose this is caused by an evolutionary sequence with a high fraction of protoplanetary disks with inner protoplanets carving dust cavities.

 - **Abstract**
 The inward drift of mm-cm sized pebbles in protoplanetary disks has become an important part of our current theories of planet formation and, more recently, planet composition as well. The gas-to-dust size ratio of protoplanetary disks can provide an important constraint on how pebbles have drifted inward provided that observational effects, especially resolution, can be accounted for. Here we present a method for fitting beam-convolved models to integrated intensity maps of line emission using the astropy python package and use it to fit 12 CO moment zero maps of ten Lupus and ten Upper Scorpius protoplanetary disks from the AGE-PRO ALMA Large Program, a sample of disks around M3-K6 stars that cover the ~1 to 6 Myr of gas disk evolution. From the unconvolved best fit models we measure the gas disk size (RCO,90%[model]), which we combine with the dust disk size (Rdust,90%[FRANK]) from continuum visibility fits from Vioque et al. (2025, in press.) to compute beam-corrected gas-to-dust size ratios. In our sample we find gas-to-dust size ratios between ~1 and ~5.5, with a median value of 2.78(+0.37,-0.32). Contrary to models of dust evolution that predict an increasing size ratio with time, we find that the younger disks in Lupus have similar (or even larger) median ratios (3.02(+0.33,-0.33)) than the older disks in Upper Sco (2.46(+0.53,-0.38)). A possible explanation to this discrepancy is that pebble drift is halted in dust traps combined with truncation of the gas disk by external photo-evaporation in Upper Sco, although survivorship bias could also play a role.

          On the calculation of p-values for quadratic statistics in Pulsar Timing Arrays

 - **Abstract**
 Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) projects have reported various lines of evidence suggesting the presence of a stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background in their data. One key line of evidence involves a detection statistic sensitive to inter-pulsar correlations, such as those induced by GWs. A $p$-value is then calculated to assess how unlikely it is for the observed signal to arise under the null hypothesis $H_0$, purely by chance. However, PTAs cannot empirically draw samples from $H_0$. As a workaround, various techniques are used in the literature to approximate $p$-values under $H_0$. One such technique, which has been heralded as a model-independent method, is the use of ``scrambling'' transformations that modify the data to cancel out pulsar correlations, thereby simulating realizations from $H_0$. In this work, scrambling methods and the detection statistic are investigated from first principles. The $p$-value methodology that is discussed is general, but the discussions regarding a specific detection statistic apply to the detection of a stochastic background of gravitational waves with PTAs. All methods in the literature to calculate $p$-values for such a detection statistic are rigorously analyzed, and many analytical expressions are derived. All this leads to the conclusion that scrambling methods are \emph{not} model-independent and thus not completely empirical. Rigorous Bayesian and Frequentist $p$-value calculation methods are advocated, the evaluation of which depend on the generalized $\chi^2$ distribution. This view is consistent with the posterior predictive $p$-value approach that is already in the literature. Efficient expressions are derived to evaluate the generalized $\chi^2$ distribution of the detection statistic on real data. It is highlighted that no Frequentist $p$-values have been calculated correctly in the PTA literature to date.

 - **Abstract**
 Planet-forming discs often contain structures like spiral arms, typically linked to the disc's gravitational forces. In 2D models, an ad hoc softening prescription is commonly used for self-gravity, but this overlooks the vertical structure's impact, suppresses the Newtonian nature of gravity at short distances and doesn't respect Newton's third law. To address these issues, associated with a Plummer potential approximation, we developed an exact self-gravity kernel for thin, hydrostatically supported discs, including a dust fluid component. Our analytical framework provides a precise 2D self-gravity prescription validated by benchmarks and 2D/3D numerical tests. The derived kernel, based on modified Bessel functions, maintains Newtonian gravitation features, such as point-wise symmetry, a smooth transition from light to massive discs and a singularity at zero distance, among others. In contrast to other prescriptions found in the literature, it proves capable of leading to an additional, and previously unnoticed, source of gravitational runaway discernible only at infinitesimal distances. We finally note that our new prescription remains compatible with methods based on the fast Fourier transform, affording superior computational efficiency. Our exact kernel formulation overcomes substantial limitations inherent in the smoothing-length approach. It permits a novel, fully consistent treatment of self-gravity in Gaussian-stratified thin discs. The approach, that makes the usage of the Plummer potential obsolete, will prove useful to studying all common planet formation scenarios, which are often backed by 2D-flat numerical simulations. Accordingly, in an accompanying paper, we will investigate how the occurence of the gravitational instability is affected.

 - **Abstract**
 The Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) is expected to observe up to ${\sim}100$ million quasars in the next decade. In this work, we show that it is possible to use such data to measure the characteristic frequency evolution of a "chirp" induced by gravitational waves, which can serve as robust evidence for the presence of a compact supermassive black-hole binary. Following the LSST specifications, we generate mock lightcurves consisting of (i) a post-Newtonian chirp produced by orbital motion through, e.g., relativistic Doppler boosting, (ii) a damped random walk representing intrinsic quasar variability, and (iii) Gaussian photometric errors, while assuming non-uniform observations with extended gaps over a period of 10 yr. Through a fully-Bayesian analysis, we show that we can simultaneously measure the chirp and noise parameters with little degeneracy between the two. For chirp signals with an amplitude of $A = 0.5$ mag and a range of times to merger ($t_m = 15{-}10^4$ yr), we can typically measure a non-zero amplitude and positive frequency derivative with over $5\sigma$ credibility. For binaries with $t_m = 50$ yr, we achieve $3\sigma$ ($5\sigma$) confidence that the signal is chirping for $A \gtrsim 0.1$ ($A > 0.2$). Our analysis can take as little as 35 s (and typically $<$ 10 min) to run, making it scalable to a large number of lightcurves. This implies that LSST could, on its own, establish the presence of a compact supermassive black-hole binary, and thus discover gravitational wave sources detectable by LISA and by Pulsar Timing Arrays.

 On 2024 December 28, CHIME/FRB detected the thus-far non-repeating FRB 20241228A with a real-time signal-to-noise ratio of $>50$. Approximately 112~s later, the X-ray Telescope onboard the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory was on source, the fastest follow-up to-date of a non-repeating FRB (Tohuvavohu et al. in prep.). Using CHIME/FRB and two of the three CHIME/FRB Outriggers, we obtained a Very Long Baseline Interferometry localization for FRB 20241228A with a 1$\sigma$ confidence ellipse of 11$^{\prime\prime}$ by 0.2$^{\prime\prime}$. This represents the first published localization using both the CHIME-KKO and CHIME-GBO Outriggers. We associate FRB 20241228A with a star-forming galaxy at a redshift of $z = 0.1614\pm0.0002$. The persistent X-ray luminosity limit at this source's location and distance is $<1.2 \times 10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$ in the $0.3-10$ keV band, the most stringent limit of any non-repeating FRB to-date (Tohuvavohu et al. in prep.). The stellar mass ($\sim 2.6 \times 10^{10}\,M_{\odot}$) and star formation rate ($\sim 2.9\,M_{\odot}$~yr$^{-1}$) of the host galaxy of FRB 20241228A are consistent with the broader FRB host galaxy population. We measure significant scattering ($\sim$1ms) and scintillation ($\sim$20 kHz at 600 MHz) along the line of sight to this source, and suggest the scintillation screen is Galactic while the scattering screen is extragalactic. FRB 20241228A represents an exciting example of a new era in which we can harness VLBI-localizations and rapid high-energy follow-up to probe FRB progenitors.

 - **Abstract**
 A handful of stars are known to host both an inner system of multiple transiting planets and an outer giant planet. These systems all feature a prominent gap between the orbits of two of the transiting planets, distinguishing them from typical multiplanet systems with more uniform orbital spacings. The reason for the association between inner gaps and outer giants is unknown. In this paper, we assess whether undiscovered planets might occupy these gaps in systems with outer giants. For each of the four relevant systems - Kepler-48, Kepler-65, Kepler-90, and Kepler-139 - we found that a $\sim 2 - 20 M_\oplus$ planet could reside in the gap without inducing dynamical instability. However, in each case, the gravitational influence of the outer giant planet is insufficient to tilt the orbit of the hypothetical planet by enough to prevent transits, ruling out a proposed theory for the observed gap-giant association. The gaps might instead contain smaller, undetectable planets ($ \lesssim 0.5 - 1\,R_\oplus$), or be entirely devoid of planets.

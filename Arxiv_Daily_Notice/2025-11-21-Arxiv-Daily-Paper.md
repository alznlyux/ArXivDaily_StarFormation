- **Abstract**
 This study presents a comprehensive analysis of the detached binary system V570\,Per through combined photometric, spectroscopic, and astrometric observations. By disentangling the composite spectra, precise fundamental parameters and detailed chemical abundances were determined for both stars. The primary component has a mass of $1.4569_{-0.0100}^{+0.0094}$ $M_{\odot}$, a radius of $1.543_{-0.009}^{+0.012}$ $R_{\odot}$, an effective temperature of $6556_{-26}^{+64}$ K, and a metallicity of $+0.18_{-0.01}^{+0.03}$ dex, while the secondary has a mass of $1.3579_{-0.0089}^{+0.0094}$ $M_{\odot}$, a radius of $1.377_{-0.015}^{+0.013}$ $R_{\odot}$, an effective temperature of $6468_{-21}^{+32}$ K, and a metallicity of $+0.15_{-0.01}^{+0.02}$ dex. The system is estimated to be $577_{-60}^{+60}$ Myr old with a synchronized orbit. The available O-C data imply a minimum mass of 0.57 $M_{\odot}$ or 0.11 $M_{\odot}$ for the third body, corresponding to eccentric and circular orbits, respectively. \texttt{MESA} evolutionary models indicate that the primary will fill its Roche lobe and begin mass transfer to the secondary in about 2.8 Gyr, whereas the secondary will reach the terminal-age main sequence in approximately 3.2 Gyr. The chemical composition of both stars shows remarkable consistency, confirming their common origin, except for calcium, which is significantly enhanced in the primary. Line measurements support this difference and are therefore interpreted as an intrinsic abundance variation rather than an artifact of the analysis. The overall solar-rich metallicity, combined with a relatively low $\alpha$-element content, links V570\,Per to the Galactic thin-disk population. In addition, Galactic orbit analyses of open clusters in the solar neighborhood have revealed that the V570\,Per system may have originated from the Melotte 25 open cluster.

- **Abstract**
 S. D. von Fellenberg et al. (2025a, Paper I) reported the first mid-infrared detection of a flare from Sgr A*. The JWST/MIRI/MRS observations were consistent with an orbiting hotspot undergoing electron injection with a spectrum that subsequently breaks from synchrotron cooling. However, mid-infrared extinction measurements appropriate for these data were not yet determined, and therefore the temporal evolution of the absolute spectral index remained unknown. This work applies new Galactic Center extinction measurements to the flare observations. The evolution of the spectral index after the peak is fully consistent with that reported in Paper I with a maximum absolute mid-infrared spectral index $\alpha_{\rm{MIR}}=0.45\pm0.01_{\rm{stat}}\pm0.08_{\rm{sys}}$ during the second mid-infrared flare peak, matching the known near-infrared spectral index during bright states ($\alpha_{\rm{NIR}}\approx0.5$). There was a near-instantaneous change in the mid-infrared spectral index of $\Delta\alpha_{\rm{MIR}}=0.33\pm0.06_{\rm{stat}}\pm0.11_{\rm{sys}}$ at the flare onset. We propose this as a quantitative definition for this infrared flare's beginning, physically interpreted as the underlying electron distribution's transition into a hard power-law distribution. This paper also reports the SMA millimeter polarization during the flare, which shows a small, distorted, but overall clockwise-oriented Stokes Q--U loop during the third mid-infrared peak. Extrapolating the mid-infrared flux power law to the millimeter yields a variable flux consistent with the observed 220 GHz emission. These results, together with the Paper I modeling, plausibly suggest a single hotspot produced both the mid-infrared and millimeter variability during this event. However, additional flares are required to make a general statement about the millimeter and mid-infrared connection.

          Mid-infrared extinction toward the Galactic center

- **Abstract**
 We determine the mid-infrared (MIR, $\sim$5~\mu m--22~\mu m) extinction towards the Galactic center using MIRI/MRS integral field unit (IFU) observations of the central $3''\times3''$ region (near 5~\mu m) to $7''\times7''$ region (near 22~\mu m). To measure the MIR extinction, we employ two approaches: modeling the intrinsic-to-observed dust thermal spectrum and assessing the differential extinction between hydrogen recombination lines. Expanding on prior work, we directly model the dust-opacity distribution along the line of sight, and we make available a Python code that provides a flexible tool for deriving intrinsic dust emission spectra. We confirm the spatial variability of extinction across the field, demonstrating that dusty sources--such as IRS~29N--exhibit higher local extinction. Furthermore, we verify the absence of PAH emission features in the Galactic center MIR spectra. Using the two complementary methods, we derive a refined ``best guess'' MIR extinction law for Sgr A* and the surrounding Galactic-center region. By applying the extinction law to a MIR flare measurement discussed in a companion paper Michail et al. 2025, we estimate a residual relative extinction uncertainty for the short MIRI/MRS grating on the order of $0.2~\mathrm{mag}$ {from $\sim$5 to $\sim$18~\mu m\ and $\sim$0.3~mag from $\sim$18 to $\sim$22~\mu m}, consistent with our uncertainty estimate.

- **Abstract**
 While the fast solar wind has well-established origins in coronal holes, the source of the slow solar wind remains uncertain. Compositional metrics, such as heavy ion charge state ratios are set in the lower corona, providing insights into solar wind source regions. However, prior to the launch of Solar Orbiter, in situ measurements of heavy ion charge state were limited to distances of 1 AU and beyond. We investigate proton specific entropy as a proxy for the oxygen charge state ratio ($O^{7+}/O^{6+}$),which generally becomes frozen-in below ~1.8 Rsun, leveraging observations from Solar Orbiter's Heavy Ion Sensor and Proton and Alphas Sensor covering 0.28 to 1 AU. Our analysis confirms a strong anti-correlation between specific entropy and the oxygen charge state ratio that persists over a broad range of distances in the inner heliosphere. We categorize observed solar wind into fast solar wind, slow Alfvenic solar wind, and slow solar wind, identifying clear distinctions in specific entropy values and charge state ratios across these types. The work demonstrates the potential to use proton specific entropy as a classifier of solar wind source regions throughout the heliosphere. By establishing the $S_p$-$O^{7+}/O^{6+}$ relationship and quantifying its radial dependence, the specific entropy can be used as a quantity to identify the solar wind source region in the absence of in-situ charge state measurements. This motivates future studies as to the applicability of this proxy to near-Sun observations (such as Parker Solar Probe) and throughout the inner heliosphere.

- **Abstract**
 Solar radio type II bursts are slow-drifting bursts that exhibit various distinct features such as Fundamental (F) and Harmonic (H) emissions, band-splitting, and discrete fine structures in the dynamic spectra. Observationally, it has been found that in some cases the F emission is stronger than the H emission, and vice versa. The reason for such behavior has not been thoroughly investigated. To investigate this, we studied 58 meter wave (20-500 MHz) type II solar radio bursts showing both F and H emissions, observed during the period from 13 June 2010 to 25 December 2024, using data obtained with the Compound Astronomical Low frequency Low cost Instrument for Spectroscopy and Transportable Observatory (CALLISTO) spectrometers at different locations and Gauribidanur LOw-frequency Solar Spectrograph (GLOSS). We examined the intensity ratios of the H ($I_H$) and F ($I_F$) emissions and analyzed their variation with heliographic longitude. We found that 14 out of 19 bursts originating from heliographic longitudes beyond $\pm75^\circ$ exhibited an $I_H/I_F$ ratio greater than unity. In contrast, 32 out of 39 bursts originating from longitudes within $\pm75^\circ$ showed a intensity ratio less than unity. From these results, we conclude that the relative strength of the F and H emissions can be influenced by refraction due to density gradient in the solar corona, directivity and viewing angle of the bursts.

- **Abstract**
 Although frequently reported in observations, the definitive confirmation of high-mass prestellar cores has remained elusive, presenting a persistent challenge in star formation studies. Using two-band observational data from the 3mm ATOMS and 1.3mm QUARKS surveys, we report a high-mass prestellar core candidate, C2, located on the side of the bright-rimmed cloud IRAS 18290-0924. The C2 core identified from the 3mm continuum data of the ATOMS survey ($\sim$2 arcsecond, $\rm\sim 10000~au$ at 5.3 kpc) has a mass ranging from 27-68 $M_{\odot}$ for temperatures 10-22K within a radius of $\sim$2800 au. The highest-resolution ($\sim$0.3 arcsecond, $\rm\sim 1500 au$) observations of this source presented to date from the QUARKS survey reveal no evidence of further fragmentation. Further analysis of a total $\sim$10 GHz band width of molecular line survey does not find star-formation activity (e.g., outflows, ionized gas) associated with the core, with a few molecular lines of cold gas detected only. Additionally, virial analysis indicates the C2 core is gravitationally bound ($\alpha_{\rm vir} \sim0.1-0.3$) and thus could be undergoing collapse toward star formation. These results strongly establish a candidate for a high-mass prestellar core, contributing to the very limited number of such sources known to date.

- **Abstract**
 Understanding the transfer of mass and angular momentum in binary interactions is crucial for modelling the evolution of any interacting binary after the first mass transfer phase. We constrain the efficiency and stability of thermal timescale mass transfer in massive binary evolution using the observed population of massive interacting binaries on the Main Sequence (`Algols') in the Milky Way, Large and Small Magellanic Clouds. Assuming the present-day mass of the donor star represents its initial convective core mass at Zero-Age Main Sequence, we estimate its initial mass using detailed stellar evolution models. From the initial donor mass, we calculate the range of initial accretor masses (for different mass transfer efficiencies). By imposing physical constraints on the above initial parameter ranges, we derive the mass transfer efficiency, stability and angular momentum loss that can reproduce the current properties of each Algol binary. We find that purely conservative or non-conservative mass transfer cannot explain the current mass ratio and orbital period of all massive Algols. Angular momentum conservation rules out conservative mass transfer in $\sim$28\,\% of massive Algols in the SMC. About three-quarters of all massive Algols are consistent with having undergone inefficient mass transfer ($\lesssim$\,50\,\%), while the remaining systems, mostly residing in the LMC and Milky Way, require mass transfer to have been more efficient than 25\%. The current sample of massive Algols does not require mass transfer to be efficient at the shortest orbital periods (2\,d) at any metallicity. We find evidence that mass transfer on the Main Sequence needs to be stable for initial accretor-to-donor mass ratios as unequal as $\sim 0.6$. The massive Algols in the SMC seem to have undergone less efficient mass transfer than those in the LMC and Milky Way. (Abridged)

- **Abstract**
 This work explored the spatial distribution of C$^{17}$O, SiO, HC$_{3}$N and SO$_{2}$ molecules, as well as the energetics of outflows in G358.46$-$0.39 proto-cluster using ALMA band 7 archival data, with the aim of providing an improved understanding of its protostellar nature, gas kinematics and dynamics. G358.46$-$0.39 is previously known to consist of 4 dust continuum cores (MM1a, MM1b, MM1c and MM2). The integrated intensity map of C$^{17}$O reveals filamentary and dumbbell-shaped structures that are probably compressed gases from the expansion of the HII region MM2. The SiO emission reveals spatially overlapped blue and red outflow lobes, likely driven by an unresolved young stellar object (YSO) in MM1a. The spatial distribution of HC$_{3}$N and SO$_{2}$ molecules in MM1a shows a compact morphology, with no detectable HC$_{3}$N and SO$_{2}$ emissions in the other cores. The SO$_{2}$ emission reveals a clear velocity gradient in MM1a, as well as large velocity dispersion ($\sim$ 3\,\kms) within the inner core of MM1a, which are consistent with rotating structures. We estimated the mass, momentum and energy outflow rate, as well as other outflow parameters. The SiO outflow exhibits a different morphology compared to the $^{12}$CO outflow morphology previously observed in MM1a. The SiO and $^{12}$CO outflows are probably associated with disks of separate cores with one face-on and the other edge-on, pointing to multiplicity of YSOs in MM1a. The properties of MM1a indicate that it is a massive protostar that is actively accreting and undergoing star formation.

- **Abstract**
 We propose a simple method for estimating the fill-out factor of overcontact binary systems using the derivatives of light curves. We synthesized 74,431 sample light curves, covering the typical parameter space of overcontact binaries. On the basis of a recent study that proposed a new classification scheme using light curve derivatives up to the fourth order, the sample light curves were classified. Among the classified types, for systems exhibiting high mass ratios and high inclinations (i.e., SPf type), we found that the fill-out factor has a strong correlation with the time interval between two local extrema in the third derivatives of their light curves. An empirical formula to estimate the fill-out factor was derived using regression analysis for the identified correlation. Application to real overcontact binary data demonstrated that the proposed method is practical for obtaining reliable estimates of the fill-out factor and its associated uncertainties.

- **Abstract**
 Analysing a large body of observational data, we found that HD 135160 is a quadruple 2+2 system, composed of a massive ellipsoidal binary ('heartbeat' star) with components Aa and Ab in an eccentric 8.234 d orbit and an eclipsing binary (with components Ba and Bb), with a 5.853 d period and partial eclipses that have already been reported from the space photometry secured by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). Our systematic echelle spectroscopy, secured since September 2021, led to the discovery that the optical spectra are dominated by spectral lines of three early-type stars, two moving around each other on a 8.234 d orbit of a high eccentricity, which causes periodic brightenings near the periastron passage, and the third one (component Ba) being the brighter component of the 5.853 d binary. Both pairs are physically bounded and revolve around each other with a period somewhere between 1600 and 2200 days (4.4 to 6 years). The object exhibits small cyclic light variations of a variable amplitude and characteristic time scale of 0.071 d (14.14 c d-1), seen throughout the whole orbit. The nature of these tiny changes deserves further investigation. It also seems that the earlier classification of the object as a Be star is unfounded.

- **Abstract**
 We present a new analysis of the spectroscopic variability of WISE~J104915.57$-$531906.1AB (WISE~1049AB, L7.5+T0.5), observed using the NIRSpec instrument onboard the James Webb Space Telescope (GO 2965 - PI: Biller). We explored the variability of the dominant molecular bands present in their 0.6--5.3~$\mu$m spectra (H$_2$O, CH$_4$, CO), finding that the B component exhibits a higher maximum deviation than the A component in all the wavelength ranges tested. The light curves reveal wavelength-(atmospheric depth) and possibly chemistry-dependent variability. In particular, for the A component, the variability in the light curves at the wavelengths traced by the CH$_4$ and CO molecular absorption features is higher than that of H$_2$O, even when both trace similar pressure levels. We concluded that clouds alone are unlikely to explain the increased variability of CO and CH$_4$ with respect to H$_2$O, suggesting that an additional physical mechanism is needed to explain the observed variability. This mechanism is probably due to thermochemical instabilities. Finally, we provide a visual representation of the 3D atmospheric map reconstructed for both components using the molecular band contributions at different pressure levels and the fit of planetary-scale waves.

          Proper Motion of the Neutron Star in the Supernova Remnant G18.9-1.1

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we present the first direct measurement of the proper motion of the neutron star (NS) in the supernova remnant (SNR) G18.9-1.1 using a 15-year Chandra baseline. After correcting the observations' astrometric solutions using reference Gaia stars' positions, we measure a total proper motion of 24.7 $\pm$ 6.8 mas yr$^{-1}$ at an angle of $336^\circ \pm$ 16$^\circ$ east of north. Using the distance estimates from literature of 2.1 kpc and 3.8 kpc, this proper motion corresponds to Galactic rotation-corrected transverse velocities of 264d$_{2.1}$ $\pm$ 79 km s$^{-1}$ and 474d$_{3.8}$ $\pm$ 129 km s$^{-1}$, respectively. Our power ratio method analysis of SNR ejecta slightly favors the higher velocity, as multipole moments calculated from the back-evolved center using the farther distance are more consistent with values from other CCSNRs. The NS's motion is directly opposite the motion of bulk ejecta in G18.9$-$1.1, providing yet more evidence that NS kicks are generated via a conservation of momentum-like process between the NS and the ejecta, as has been observed in other SNRs.

 - **Abstract**
 The gravitational potential of supermassive black holes is so powerful that it triggers some of the most intense phenomena in the Universe. Accretion onto these objects and relativistic jet emission from their vicinity are observable across a wide range of frequencies and throughout cosmic history. However, despite this wealth of data, many aspects of their underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Investigating this phenomena across all frequencies is crucial, yet some energy windows are still poorly explored. One such window is the MeV energy range: many key signatures related to the emission from the SMBH environment - both in quiescent and active phases - are expected to lie between one and several hundreds MeV. In this work, we explore some of the open questions regarding the behavior and emission processes in the surroundings of SMBHs, and how these questions might be approached. From the elusive nature of Fermi bubbles around our Galactic Centre, to the origin of high-energy neutrinos in the nuclei and jets of Active Galactic Nuclei, to the nature and emission mechanisms of the most powerful blazars, the MeV window stands out as a crucial key to understanding SMBH physics.

 - **Abstract**
 The Helmi streams are remnants of a dwarf galaxy that was accreted by the Milky Way and whose stars now form a distinct kinematic and chemical substructure in the Galactic halo. Precisely age-dating these typically faint stars of extragalactic origin has been notoriously difficult due to the limitations of using only spectroscopic data, interferometry, or coarse asteroseismic measurements. Using observations from NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, we report the detailed asteroseismic modeling of two of the brightest red giants within the Helmi streams, HD 175305 and HD 128279. By modeling the individual oscillation mode frequencies and the spectroscopic properties of both stars, we determine their fundamental properties including mass, radius, and age ($\tau$). We report $\tau = 11.16 \pm 0.91$ Gyr for HD 175305 and $\tau = 12.52 \pm 1.05$ Gyr for HD 128279, consistent with previously inferred star-formation histories for the Helmi streams and the differential chemical abundances between the two stars. With precise ages for individual stream members, our results reinforce the hypothesis that the Helmi streams' progenitor must have existed at least 12 Gyr ago. Our results also highlight that the ages of metal-poor, $\alpha$-enhanced red giants can be severely underestimated when inferred using global asteroseismic parameters instead of individual mode frequencies.

          Effect of symmetry energy on properties of rapidly rotating neutron stars and universal relations

 - **Abstract**
 We investigated universal relations for compact stars rotating at the Keplerian (mass-shedding) limit, which is highly relevant for understanding the rapidly rotating objects formed in the aftermath of a neutron star-neutron star merger. Our analysis is based on a set of nucleonic EoS featuring systematic variations in the symmetry energy slope parameter $L_{\rm sym}$ and the isoscalar skewness parameter $Q_{\rm sat}$, varied within ranges that are broadly consistent with current laboratory and astrophysical constraints. The global observable properties of isolated maximally rotating stars are examined, focusing on the mass-radius relation, moment of inertia, quadrupole moment, and the Keplerian (maximum) rotation frequency, as well as their variations in the $L_{\rm sym}$-$Q_{\rm sat}$ parameter space. Next, we demonstrate that, in the limit of Keplerian rotation, universal relations remain valid across the same set of EoSs characterized by varying $L_{\rm sym}$ and $Q_{\rm sat}$. In particular, we present explicit results for the moment of inertia and quadrupole moment as functions of compactness, as well as for the moment of inertia - quadrupole moment relation. All of these relations exhibit excellent universality, with deviations typically within a few percent and rarely exceeding 10\% across a wide range of parameters. These findings support the applicability of $I$-Love-$Q$-type universal relations in observational modeling of maximally rotating compact stars and the gravitational wave emitted by them, when accounting for significant variation in the symmetry energy and high-density behavior of the nuclear EoS.

          The Effect of the Collisional Flavor Instability on Core-Collapse Supernova Models

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the effects of the neutrino collisional flavor instability (CFI) based on 1D and 2D core-collapse supernova (CCSN) simulations done using the sophisticated radiation-hydrodynamic code F{\sc ornax}. We compare the growth rates of homogeneous CFI {(hCFI)} modes calculated by numerically solving the multi-group dispersion relation to those calculated using the monochromatic approximation. We find that the widely-used monochromatic approximation {leads to incorrect growth rates} when applied in multi-group scenarios. {As opposed to the $\sim10^5$ s$^{-1}$ values given by the monochromatic approximation,} the actual growth rates of non-resonance multi-group {hCFI} are at most $\sim$200 s$^{-1}$ in all our models and they are too slow to affect CCSN outcomes. We adopt a BGK flavor conversion scheme in the simulations to include the effects of resonance-like {hCFI}. We find that the CCSN dynamics and neutrino emission properties are only weakly influenced, and the intrinsic stochasticity due to convection and neutrino-driven turbulence can naturally lead to comparable effects. Hence, our analysis of the non-resonance and resonance-like {hCFI} into CCSN simulations suggests that the effects of neutrino flavor conversion triggered by {hCFI} modes are in general small.

 - **Abstract**
 High-cadence microlensing observations uncovered a population of very short-timescale microlensing events, which are believed to be caused by the population of free-floating planets (FFP) roaming the Milky Way. Unfortunately, the light curves of such events are indistinguishable from those caused by wide-orbit planets. To properly differentiate both cases, one needs high-resolution observations that would allow resolving a putative luminous companion to the lens long before or after the event. Usually, the baseline between the event and high-resolution observations needs to be quite long ($\sim 10$ yr), hindering potential follow-up efforts. However, there is a chance to use archival data if they exist. Here, we present an analysis of the microlensing event OGLE-2023-BLG-0524, the site of which was captured in 1997 with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). Hence, we achieve a record-breaking baseline length of 25 years. A very short duration of the event ($t_E = 0.346 \pm 0.008$ d) indicates an FFP as the explanation. We have not detected any potential companion to the lens with the HST data, which is consistent with the FFP origin of the event. Thanks to the available HST data, we are able to reject from 25% to 48% of potential stellar companions depending on the assumed population model. Based on the finite-source effects in the light curve we measure the angular Einstein radius value $\theta_E = 4.78 \pm 0.23 \mu as$, suggesting a super-Earth in the Galactic disk or a sub-Saturn-mass planet in the Galactic bulge. We show that the archival high-resolution images should be available for several microlensing events, providing us with the unprecedented possibility of seeing the lensing system as it was many years before the event.

          Star formation drivers across the M33 disk

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the star formation process across the disk of M33 using a multiwavelength dataset and disk dynamics. We computed numerically equilibrium values of gas densities and scale heights across the disk, taking into account dark matter and testing several analytic approximations that are often used to estimate these variables and the hydrostatic pressure. Orthogonal regressions and hierarchical Bayesian models, as well as random forest (RF) analyses, were used to establish the fundamental relations at physical scales from 160~pc to 1~kpc. The gas pressure, is the main driver of the star formation rate (SFR) surface density throughout the whole star-forming disk of M33. High-pressure regions enhance the atomic-to-molecular gas conversion, with the molecular hydrogen mass surface density being tightly correlated to pressure and a uniform scaling law throughout the M33 disk. The relation between pressure and SFR surface density differs, showing a change in slope from the inner to the outer disk. Scaling laws do not depend on the physical scale and brings out an intrinsic scatter linked to variations in the efficiency and relative age of the molecular gas-to-stars conversion. In the inner disk, where spiral arms are present and the stellar surface density dominates gravity, the pressure and SFR surface densidy establish an almost linear correlation with a smaller dispersion than that of the molecular gas -- SFR surface density relation. In the atomic gas-dominated outer disk, the SFR density has a steeper dependence on pressure, which we propose could be the result of an increasing fraction of diffuse molecular gas that does not form stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Solar flare ribbons are features in the lower atmosphere that show enhanced emission intensity, particularly noticeable in H$\alpha$ and EUV images of the transition region and upper chromosphere. In this study, we provide observational evidence that the flare ribbons are composed of a large number of coherent sub-structures that we call \textit{riblets}. Our observations, taken with the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope / CRisp Imaging Spectro-Polarimeter (SST/CRISP) instrument, focused on an X1.5-class flare that occurred on June 10, 2014. Using data obtained from SST/CRISP, we utilize CRISPEX, an interactive graphical user interface tool, to individually track and analyze the dynamic evolution of these riblets, gaining initial insights into their characteristics. Our investigation reveals the existence of two distinct categories of riblets within the flare ribbons. The first category comprises riblets that evolve perpendicular to the ribbon towards the solar surface at a constant velocity over their lifespan. We present one such riblet with a velocity of 18.04 km/s, persisting for a duration of 67 seconds. The second category includes riblets with varying velocities, indicating a more complex and non-linear evolution pattern. We present one such riblet with an average acceleration of 0.70 km/s$^2$ and a duration of 22.8 seconds. Riblets, with their distinct characteristics, provide an opportunity to study the chromospheric response to a solar flare in a more detailed manner.

          Characterizing Compact Object Binaries in the Lower Mass Gap with Gravitational Waves

 - **Abstract**
 The gravitational wave event GW230529 was the first compact binary merger observation reported in the fourth observing run of the LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA observatory network. The more massive component of the GW230529 source binary was inferred to contain a compact object in the lower mass gap, a purported gap between the most massive neutron stars and least massive black holes based on compact object observations in the Milky Way. However, the properties of the mass-gap object, such as its exact mass and spin, remain unresolved due to statistical uncertainties. To investigate the properties of the GW230529 source binary, we perform parameter estimation on a suite of simulated gravitational wave systems with similar parameters. We vary the intrinsic properties of the simulated systems, the detector noise properties, the signal-to-noise ratios, and the waveform model used in recovery. We find that the low signal-to-noise ratio of GW230529 is the key reason for the ambiguity in determining whether the mass of the primary object in the binary is consistent with a low-mass black hole or a high-mass neutron star, since the priors for the masses and spins have a significant impact on the posterior distribution. The inclusion of tidal effects in the waveform model also contributes to the observed degeneracies in the posteriors. We show that a higher signal-to-noise ratio in future observations of mass-gap gravitational wave sources will increase the precision of the measurements and allow us to determine whether the components are black holes or neutron stars.

          Giant planet formation via pebble accretion across different stellar masses

 - **Abstract**
 The occurrence rate of cold Jupiters was found to depend on stellar mass. The formation environment in the protoplanetary disks regulates core formation and the subsequent gas accretion. In this study, we simulate giant planet formation via pebble accretion accounting for various stellar masses, core formation times, disk turbulent viscosities, and grain opacities. We use a self-consistent formation model that calculates the solid accretion rate and gas accretion rate of growing protoplanets. We investigate how the planetary formation, in particular, the contraction of the envelope, and the formation timescale change under different conditions. We find that to reproduce the observed occurrence rate of cold Jupiters, giant planets must undergo slow envelope contraction after they reach pebble isolation, which lasts for several Myrs. Such a slow contraction phase can be achieved when the grain opacity is assumed to be as high as that of the interstellar medium (ISM). If the grain opacity is smaller than the ISM opacity by a factor of ten or more, the growing protoplanets reach crossover mass within 3 Myrs and form too many cold Jupiters around stars of >0.4Msun. Protoplanets around low-mass stars <0.4Msun take >10 Myrs to reach crossover mass also with low grain opacity. If the grain opacity in the planetary envelope is much lower than that of ISM, other mechanisms, such as atmospheric recycling or planetesimal accretion, is required for cold Jupiter formation. We next explore how the deposition of the accreted heavy elements to the planetary envelope changes the formation timescale. Our model suggests that the formation timescale could be longer due to heavy-element enrichment, resulting from the lower core mass at pebble isolation. We conclude that the details of the formation processes have a significant effect on the planetary growth and therefore, the formation of gaseous planets.

 We have carried out a morphological search for molecular clouds possibly associated with 48 Galactic infrared bubbles with angular radii of $>1'$ in the southern Galactic plane of $295^\circ \le l\le 350^\circ$ and $|b|\le 1^\circ$ presented by Hanaoka et al. (2019). 116 molecular clouds in the $(l,b,V_{\rm LSR})$ space are identified from the archival $^{12}$CO~$J$~=~1--0 line data obtained by the Mopra Southern Galactic plane survey, where $V_{\rm LSR}$ is the CO-line radial velocity. The kinematic distances are derived from $V_{\rm LSR}$ using the most accurate rotation curve of the Milky Way. We also present measurements of velocity dispersion, size parameter, molecular mass, and virial mass of 116 molecular clouds. This catalog is presented to investigate star formation and the origin of molecular shells and cavities, possibly associated with infrared bubbles. CO line intensity maps and position-velocity diagrams of the molecular clouds are available online as supplementary data.

          Time-Dependent Leptohadronic Modeling of Markarian 421

 - **Abstract**
 Due to its proximity, Markarian 421 is one of the most extensively studied jetted active galactic nuclei. Its spectral energy distribution and light curve are widely studied, serving as primary means for understanding jet radiation mechanisms. Numerous intriguing observational results have been discovered, some of which, such as the hard X-ray excess, and the associated variability between X-ray and very-high-energy (VHE) emissions, challenge the commonly adopted one-zone leptonic model. In this work, by establishing a time-dependent leptohadronic model, we explore whether the hard X-ray excess and the associated variability between X-ray and VHE emissions could be interpreted by emission from hadronic interactions. Our modeling finds that for the hard X-ray excess found in 2013, both of the secondary emissions from photohadronic and hadronuclear interactions could be a possible explanation for the hard X-ray excess without introducing a super-Eddington jet power. The emission from the photohadronic interactions contributes only to the hard X-ray band, while the hadronuclear interactions also predict VHE emissions associated with the hard X-rays. While for the hard X-ray excess found in 2016, only the secondary emissions from photohadronic interactions provide an interpretation at the cost of introducing a super-Eddington jet power. For the associated variability between X-ray and VHE emissions in 2017, we find that hadronic interactions fail to provide a possible interpretation.

          Radio emission from tidal disruption events produced by the collision between super-Eddington outflows and the circumnuclear medium

 - **Abstract**
 In this Letter, we simulate the collision between outflows from the tidal disruption of a 1M$_\odot$ main sequence star around a $10^6$M$_\odot$ black hole and an initially spherically symmetric circumnuclear cloud. We launch super-Eddington outflows self-consistently by simulating the disruption of stars on both bound and unbound initial orbits using general relativistic smoothed particle hydrodynamics. We find shocks formed as early as $\sim 10~$days after the initial stellar disruption produce prompt radio emission. The shock radius ($\approx~10^{17}$~cm), velocity ($\sim 0.15$c) and total energy ($\sim 10^{51}$ erg) in our simulations match those inferred from radio observations of tidal disruption events (TDEs). We ray-trace to produce synthetic radio images and spectra to compare with the observations. While the TDE outflow is quasi-spherical, the synchrotron emitting region is aspherical but with reflection symmetry above and below the initial orbital plane. Our synthetic spectra show continuous decay in peak frequency, matching prompt radio TDE observations. Our model supports the hypothesis that synchrotron radio flares from TDEs result from the collision between outflows and the circumnuclear material.

          Planet-induced Gas and Dust Substructure Feedbacks on Disk Thermal Structure

 - **Abstract**
 Protoplanets can interact with their natal disks and generate gas and dust substructures such as gaps and rings. However, how these planet-induced substructures affect the disk temperature, and how that in turn influences the substructures, remains unclear. We aim to study disk substructures and the thermal structure self-consistently and explore their impact on volatile distribution. To this end, we perform iterative multi-fluid hydrodynamical and radiative transfer simulations of planet-disk interactions. We find that the temperature in a structured disk deviates significantly from that of a smooth disk due to giant planet formation. In particular, midplane temperatures in gaps can increase by tens of Kelvin, leading to volatile sublimation as well as radial shifts and multiplication of icelines. Comparing our multi-dust models with previous gas-only models, we find that the former produces slightly shallower gaps and temperatures about 10 K ($\sim25\%$) higher. Furthermore, the temperature at dust rings formed by pressure bumps can drop by several Kelvin, creating volatile freeze-out regions. Nevertheless, the overall midplane ice distribution is not strongly sensitive to whether dust is included. We also investigate the effect of varying disk viscosity. Increasing $\alpha$ viscosity from $10^{-4}$ to $10^{-2}$ leads to a roughly 10 K ($\sim25\%$) warmer midplane due to enhanced vertical dust mixing. However, higher viscosity suppresses gap opening and reduces the temperature enhancement within gaps. As a result, iceline locations do not follow a simple trend with viscosity. Finally, we propose an observational strategy using ALMA to test our predicted temperature changes within disk gaps.

 - **Abstract**
 We present analyses of the early data from Rubin Observatory's Data Preview 1 (DP1) for the globular cluster 47 Tuc field. The DP1 dataset for 47 Tuc includes four nights of observations from the Rubin Commissioning Camera (LSSTComCam), covering multiple bands (ugriy). We address challenges of crowding near the cluster core and toward the SMC in DP1, and demonstrate improved star-galaxy separation by fitting fifth-degree polynomials to the stellar loci in color-color diagrams and applying multi-dimensional sigma clipping. We compile a catalog of 3,576 probable 47 Tuc member stars selected via a combination of isochrone, Gaia proper-motion, and color-color space matched filtering. We explore the sources of photometric scatter in the 47 Tuc color-color sequence, evaluating contributions from various potential sources, including differential extinction within the cluster. Finally, we recover five known variable stars, including three RR Lyrae and two eclipsing binaries. Although the DP1 lightcurves have sparse temporal sampling, they appear to follow the patterns of densely-sampled literature lightcurves well. Despite some data limitations for crowded-field stellar analysis, DP1 demonstrates the promising scientific potential for future LSST data releases.

 - **Abstract**
 Some recent pulsar observations cannot naturally fit into the conventional picture of neutron stars: the compact objects associated with HESS J1731-347 and XTE J1814-338 have too small radii at the low-mass regime, while the secondary component of GW190814 is too massive for neutron stars to be compatible with constraints from the GW170817 event. In this study, we demonstrate that all these anomalous observations and tensions, together with other conventional ones such as recent NICER observations of PSR J0740+6620, J0030+0451, and PSR J0437-4715, can be naturally explained simultaneously by a new general type of hybrid stars that are self-bound and radially stable in the slow phase transition context, and by some subsets even in the rapid phase transition context also. As a proof of concept, we use hybrid quark stars, inverted hybrid stars, and hybrid strangeon stars as benchmark examples to explicitly demonstrate the advantage and feasibility of slow stable self-bound hybrid stars in relieving all tensions related to compact stars' masses, radii, and tidal deformabilities.

          Cosmic Ray Mass Composition Around the Knee via PCA

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to experimental data recorded by the KASCADE experiment to reconstruct the mass composition of cosmic rays around the \textit{knee} region. A set of four extensive air shower parameters sensitive to the primary particle mass ($LCm$, $N_{\mu}$, $N_{e}$, and lateral shower $age$) was considered, whose coordinates were transformed into a new orthogonal basis that maximally captures the data variance. Based on the experimental distributions of the first two principal components (PCA0 vs.\ PCA1) and full Monte Carlo simulations of the KASCADE array considering five types of primary particles (p, He, C, Si, and Fe) and three hadronic interaction models (EPOS-LHC, QGSjet-II-04, and SIBYLL~2.3d), we obtained the evolution of the abundance of each primary species as a function of energy, as well as the evolution of the mean logarithmic mass with energy. We found that the reconstruction of the mass composition resulting from this comprehensive analysis significantly reduces dependence on the hadronic interaction model used in the simulation process, even though the initial input parameters are model-dependent. Moreover, the results support the idea that around the \textit{knee} region, the abundance of the light component (protons) decreases, while the heavy component shows a slight increase. The evolution of $\langle \ln A \rangle$ as a function of energy derived from this analysis shows excellent agreement with recent results from the LHAASO--KM2A experiment and aligns very well with the predictions of the data-driven GSF astrophysical model.

 - **Abstract**
 Solar radio bursts can provide important insights into the underlying physical mechanisms that drive the small and large-scale eruptions on the Sun. Since metric radio observations can give us direct observational access to the inner and middle corona, they are often used as an important tool to monitor and understand the coronal dynamics. While the sizes of the radio sources that can be observed in the solar corona is essential for understanding the nature of density turbulence within the solar corona and its subsequent influence on the angular broadening observed in radio source measurements, the smallest radio sources associated with solar radio bursts have so far been limited by observational techniques and the radio instrument's baselines. We selected three type II bursts that were observed with the LOFAR core and remote stations in the Solar Cycle 24. We estimated the sizes and shapes (ellipticity) of the radio sources between $20-200$ MHz using a two-dimensional Gaussian approximation. Our analysis shows that the smallest radio source size for type II bursts in the solar corona which can be observed in the solar atmosphere at low frequencies is $1.5^\prime \pm 0.5^\prime$ at 150 MHz. However, even though the observations were taken with remote baselines (with a maximum distance of $\sim 85~km$), the effective baselines were much shorter ($\sim 35~km$) likely due to snapshot imaging of the Sun. Our results show that the radio source sizes are less affected by scattering than suggested in previous studies. Our measurements indicate a smaller source sizes at frequencies below 95 MHz compared to previous reports, though some overlap exists with measurements at higher frequencies, using smaller baselines.

 - **Abstract**
 If 0.1% of the dark matter in the Coma cluster is constituted by primordial black holes (PBHs) with masses ranging from 10^-19 to 10^-17 solar masses, then the observed GeV {\gamma}-ray emission from the cluster could potentially be attributed to Hawking radiation. The emitted spectrum is inversely proportional to the black hole's mass, meaning lighter PBHs radiate at higher energies, potentially falling within the GeV range. If 0.1% of the Coma cluster's dark matter is PBH in this mass range, a fit to the cluster's GeV emission is obtained. We then investigate the potential for constraining evaporating PBHs through cross-correlations between the Unresolved Gamma-Ray Background and weak gravitational lensing. Utilizing 12 years of Fermi-LAT observations and weak lensing measurements from the Dark Energy Survey Year 3, we assess whether such correlations can reveal a PBH {\gamma}-ray component. While a statistically significant correlation between the UGRB and large-scale structure has been observed, this signal is consistent with emission from clustered astrophysical sources such as blazars. Attributing a measurable fraction of the UGRB to PBH evaporation would require unrealistically large PBH abundances. We also draw attention to a cluster of Coma-like X-ray clusters, designated Draco X, observed at a redshift of z = 0.12. These systems, characterized by their significant X-ray emission from hot, diffuse intracluster gas, represent massive gravitationally bound structures. The existence and properties of such clusters at these redshifts provide crucial cosmological probes, offering insights into the formation and evolution of large-scale structure and the underlying cosmological parameters. Further investigation of Draco X and similar high-redshift clusters would yield additional constraints on large scale structure.

 - **Abstract**
 Reproducing the observed activity of comets with thermophysical models remains a primary challenge of cometary science. We use a pebble-based thermophysical model of gas-pressure build-up in the subsurface to reproduce the global emission rates of dust, water, CO$_{2}$, and CO observed by Rosetta at comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (hereafter 67P). For sufficiently low diffusivities, the low tensile strength is overcome, leading to the ejection of $\sim$ millimetre- to decimetre-sized dust-particles as well as roughly the correct outgassing rates. All the ejections, and thus the bulk of the outgassing, come from the southern hemisphere during the time that it is strongly illuminated at perihelion. This leads to a 'blow-off' of the dust-crust that otherwise forms: volatiles are much closer to the surface in the south (within the top centimetre) than in the north (10-or-more cm deep), naturally explaining the strong southern water-outgassing expected from 67P's non-gravitational accelerations and torques. We find that low gas-diffusivity, as well as large heat-capacity and steeply decreasing tensile strength with depth or ice-content, are in best agreement with the outgassing data. However, even in these cases, we struggle not to exceed the observed emission rates of dust, CO$_{2}$, and CO. In the south, it is difficult for models to achieve a balance between triggering activity and generating too much of it (with CO$_{2}$ the critical driving-species here); while in the north, it remains challenging to generate activity at all. Strong constraints are placed on the nature of the activity mechanism by the location of dust-ejection and erosion.

 - **Abstract**
 The large variety and number of dark energy (DE) theories make it impractical to perform detailed analyses on a case-by-case basis, which has motivated proposals to ``parameterize" theories to reduce the size of theory space. The leading approach to do this is the effective field theory of dark energy (EFTofDE), which can describe general Horndeski-type theories with a small number of observationally accessible time-dependent functions. However, the EFTofDE primarily works for linear perturbations, and extending it to obtain a fully non-linear description of DE theories, which is critical for theories with screening mechanisms, is challenging. In this paper, we present a general method for reconstructing the non-linear DE Lagrangian from the background expansion history and certain linear-perturbation quantities, building upon the EFTofDE framework. Using numerical examples, we demonstrate that this method is applicable to a wide range of single-scalar-field dark energy and modified gravity theories, including quintessence, scalar-tensor theory, $k$-essence, and generalized cubic Galileon with shift symmetry. For each of these theories, we discuss the validity of the method and factors affecting its results. While this method involves solving differential equations, we find that the initial conditions are not important for quintessence, scalar-tensor theory and $k$-essence, while for shift-symmetric cubic Galileon, the generic tracker solution can help transform differential equations into algebraic equations. This offers a useful framework to connect cosmological observations at the background and linear-perturbation levels to the underlying non-linear dynamics of dark energy, and will enable cosmological simulations to analyze and examine DE theories systematically and in much greater detail.

 - **Abstract**
 TeV halos are extended very-high-energy gamma-ray sources found around some middle-aged pulsars. The emission spanning several tens of parsecs suggests an efficient confinement of the ultra-relativistic lepton pairs produced by pulsars in their vicinity. The physical mechanism responsible for this suppressed transport has not yet been identified. In some scenarios, pair confinement may be linked to the medium the pulsars are located in. We aim at understanding which type of medium pulsars are probing over their lifetime. We developed a model for the environment probed by moving pulsars, from their birth in core-collapse explosions, where they receive a natal kick, until their entry into the interstellar medium. The model involves: (i) a Monte-Carlo sampling of the properties of the massive-star progenitors of pulsars; (ii) a calculation of the structure of the surrounding medium shaped by these progenitors, for the two cases of isolated stars and star clusters; (iii) a computation of the evolution of supernova remnants in these parent environments. Ultimately, from a distribution of neutron star kick velocities, we assess in which medium pulsars are located as a function of time. We first derive the statistical properties of a fully synthetic Galactic population, and then apply the model to a selection of known pulsars to assess the likely nature of their environment. We show that pulsars escape into the ISM at around 200 kyr, significantly later than the values most commonly used in the literature. The majority of known pulsars with a confirmed TeV halo have high probabilities of still being in their parent environment, which suggests that efficient pair confinement is connected to the region influenced by progenitor stars. In order to test this idea, we provide the probability of still residing in the parent environment for a list of known pulsars.

 - **Abstract**
 Accurate identification of meteoroid streams is central to understanding their origins and evolution. However, overlapping clusters and background noise hinder classification, an issue amplified for missions such as ESA's LUMIO that rely on meteor shower observations to infer lunar meteoroid impact parameters. This study evaluates the performance of the Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN) algorithm for unsupervised meteoroid stream identification, comparing its outcomes with the established Cameras for All-Sky Meteor Surveillance (CAMS) look-up table method. We analyze the CAMS Meteoroid Orbit Database v3.0 using three feature vectors: LUTAB (CAMS geocentric parameters), ORBIT (heliocentric orbital elements), and GEO (adapted geocentric parameters). HDBSCAN is applied with varying minimum cluster sizes and two cluster selection methods (eom and leaf). To align HDBSCAN clusters with CAMS classifications, the Hungarian algorithm determines the optimal mapping. Clustering performance is assessed via the Silhouette score, Normalized Mutual Information, and F1 score, with Principal Component Analysis further supporting the analysis. With the GEO vector, HDBSCAN confirms 39 meteoroid streams, 21 strongly aligning with CAMS. The ORBIT vector identifies 30 streams, 13 with high matching scores. Less active showers pose identification challenges. The eom method consistently yields superior performance and agreement with CAMS. Although HDBSCAN requires careful selection of the minimum cluster size, it delivers robust, internally consistent clusters and outperforms the look-up table method in statistical coherence. These results underscore HDBSCAN's potential as a mathematically consistent alternative for meteoroid stream identification, although further validation is needed to assess physical validity.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a numerical treatment of the annual modulation of relic neutrinos due to the Sun's gravitational influence. Extending our previously developed N-1-body simulation framework from Milky Way scales to solar system dynamics, we model how cosmic neutrino background densities might vary throughout Earth's orbital cycle. We validate our numerical approach against analytical expectations from previous studies that assumed idealized relic neutrino populations. Our results suggest that the prior gravitational history of neutrinos traversing asymmetric dark matter distributions can affect annual modulation patterns. While our simulations reproduce modulation amplitudes similar to analytical predictions for heavier neutrinos, we find that the amplitude can vary considerably depending on the specific morphology of dark matter halos. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating realistic structure formation effects when predicting potential observational relic neutrino signatures.

 - **Abstract**
 The orbit of the S2 star around Sagittarius A* provides a unique opportunity to test general relativity and study dynamical processes near a supermassive black hole. Observations have shown that the orbit of S2 is consistent with a Schwarzschild orbit at a 10$\sigma$ confidence level, constraining the amount of extended mass within its orbit to less than 1200 M$_\odot$, under the assumption of a smooth, spherically symmetric mass distribution. In this work we investigate the effects on the S2 orbit of granularity in the mass distribution, assuming it consists of a cluster of equal-mass objects surrounding Sagittarius A*. Using a fast dynamical approach validated by full N-body simulations, we perform a large set of simulations of the motion of S2 with different realizations of the cluster objects distribution. We find that granularity can induce significant deviations from the orbit in case of a smooth potential, causing precession of the orbital plane and a variation of the in-plane precession. Interactions with the cluster objects also induce a sort of "Brownian motion" of Sagittarius A*. Mock data analysis reveals that these effects could produce observable deviations in the trajectory of S2 from a Schwarzschild orbit, especially near apocenter. During the next apocenter passage of S2 in 2026, astrometric residuals in Declination may exceed the astrometric accuracy threshold of GRAVITY of about 30 $\mu as$, as it happens in 35 to 60% of simulations for black holes of 20 to 100 M$_\odot$. This presents a unique opportunity to detect, for the first time, scattering effects on the orbit of S2 caused by stellar-mass black holes, thanks to the remarkable precision achievable with GRAVITY. We also demonstrate that any attempt to constrain the extended mass enclosed within the orbit of S2 must explicitly account for granularity in the stellar-mass black hole population.

 - **Abstract**
 Increasing evidence shows that most stars in the Milky Way, including the Sun, are born in star-forming regions containing also high-mass stars, but due to both observational and theoretical challenges, our comprehension of their chemical evolution is far less clear than that of their low-mass counterparts. We present the project "CHemical Evolution of MassIve star-froming COres" (CHEMICO). The project aims at investigating any aspect of the chemical evolution of high-mass star-forming cores by observing representatives of the three main evolutionary categories: high-mass starless cores, high-mass protostellar objects, and ultra-compact HII regions. We carried out an unbiased spectral line survey of the entire bandwidth at 3, 2, and 1.2 mm with the 30m telescope of the Insitut de Radioastronomie millimetrique towards three targets that represent the three evolutionary stages. The number of lines and species detected increases with evolution. In this first work, we derive the temperature structure of the targets through the analysis of the carbon-bearing species C2H, c-C3H, c-C3H2, C4H, CH3CCH, HC3N, CH3CN, and HC5N. The excitation temperature, Tex, increases with evolution in each species, although not in the same way. Hydrocarbons tend to be associated with the smallest Tex values and enhancements with evolution, while cyanides are associated with the highest Tex values and enhancements. In each target, the higher the number of atoms in the molecule, the higher Tex tends to be. The temperature structure evolves from a cold, uniform envelope traced by simple hydrocarbons in the high-mass starless core stage, to a more stratified envelope in the protostellar stage (made by a hot core, a shell with intermediate Tex, and a larger cold envelope), to finally a hot core surrounded only by a cold envelope in the Ultracompact HII stage.

 The X-ray Integral Field Unit is the X-ray imaging spectrometer on-board one of ESA's next large missions, Athena. Athena is set to investigate the theme of the Hot and Energetic Universe, with a launch planned in the late-2030s. Based on a high sensitivity Transition Edge Sensor (TES) detector array operated at very low temperature (50 mK), X-IFU will provide spatially resolved high resolution spectroscopy of the X-ray sky in the 0.2-12 keV energy band, with an energy resolution goal of 4 eV up to 7 keV [3 eV design goal]. This paper presents the current calibration plan of the X-IFU. It provides the requirements applicable to the X-IFU calibration, describes the overall calibration strategy, and details the procedure and sources needed for the ground calibration of each parameter or characteristics of the X-IFU.

 Determining the physical parameters of pulsating variable stars such as RR Lyrae is essential for understanding their internal structure, pulsation mechanisms, and evolutionary state. In this study, we present a machine learning framework that uses feedforward artificial neural networks (ANNs) to infer stellar parameters-mass ($M$), luminosity (log($L/L_\odot$)), effective temperature (log($T_{\rm eff}$)), and metallicity ($Z$)-directly from Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) light curves. The network is trained on a synthetic grid of RRab light curves generated from hydrodynamical pulsation models spanning a broad range of physical parameters. We validate the model using synthetic self-inversion tests and demonstrate that the ANN accurately recovers the input parameters with minimal bias. We then apply the trained model to RRab stars observed by the TESS. The observed light curves are phase-folded, corrected for extinction, and passed through the ANN to derive physical parameters. Based on these results, we construct an empirical period-luminosity-metallicity (PLZ) relation: log($L/L_\odot$) = (1.458 $\pm$ 0.028) log($P$/days) + (-0.068 $\pm$ 0.007) [Fe/H] + (2.040 $\pm$ 0.007). This work shows that ANN-based light-curve inversion offers an alternative method for extracting stellar parameters from single-band photometry. The approach can be extended to other classes of pulsators such as Cepheids and Miras.

 - **Abstract**
 General Relativity (GR) quantitatively accounts for the anomalous perihelion precession observed in several planets' orbits, with Mercury exhibiting the most significant deviation from Newtonian predictions. In the present work, I carry out an in-depth study comparing methods for calculating perihelion advance of inner planets using two methods, one based on the rotation of the Laplace-Runge-Lentz vector and the other on the evolution of the perihelion longitude. I show that, although the two methods predict almost identical perihelion advances for inner planets according to classical gravitational theory and the general relativity model, they give divergent results for the asteroid Icarus. Comparing numerical calculations of Icarus'perihelion advance with those predicted by Einstein's formula leads to the conclusion that only the method based on the Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector offers a consistent explanation for the behavior of Icarus' perihelion advance. By incorporating the hypothetical planet Vulcan into the Newtonian gravitational model and analyzing its influence on the perihelion advances of the inner planets, I find that carefully selecting Vulcan's mass and orbital parameters yields a delicate balance between its semi-major axis and mass necessary to simultaneously match the observed perihelion advances of the inner planets. Vulcan, orbiting at a semi-major axis of 0.545 AU and possessing about one-third the mass of Mercury, could exert gravitational effects on Earth and Mars comparable to those predicted by GR. This Vulcan would cause an effect on Icarus' perihelion advance approximately nine times greater than the relativistic effect. Thus, precise observational data of Icarus's orbital dynamics offers a definitive means to either rule out this specific Vulcan hypothesis or, conversely, indicate the necessity of further refinement of GR's applications.

 - **Abstract**
 The purpose of this paper is to analyze the multi-wavelength and multi-instrument observations of two quiescent filament eruptions as well as the deflection of associated CMEs from the radial direction. The events occurred on 18 October 2017 and 9 May 2021, respectively, in the southern solar hemisphere. Both of them and associated flares were registered by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) aboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory-Ahead (STEREO-A) Observatory in different EUV wavebands. Using data from STEREO A COR1 and COR2 instruments and the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) onboard the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), we investigated morphology and kinematics of the eruptions and the latitudinal offset of the related CMEs with respect to the erupting filaments. Our observations provide the evidence that the two filament eruptions were highly non-radial. The observed deviations are attributed to the presence of low-latitude coronal holes.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The HR 8799 system, hosting four giant planets between a warm and cold debris disc, and an extended dusty tail beyond, serves as an ideal laboratory for studying planetary formation and evolution. The debris discs have been observed across various wavelengths, and the planetary properties are well-constrained. Nonetheless, there are still open questions regarding the role of the planets in shaping the debris discs. Aims. We investigate the system's evolution with the aim of understanding how planetary migration shapes its architecture, both in terms of planets and the disc. Methods. We performed $N$-body simulations to model the HR 8799 system. We examined the orbital evolution of the known four super-Jupiter planets through the course of simple, imposed migration in a gaseous disc as they perturb an external, massless planetesimal disc. We also explore the impact of introducing a fifth planet on the dynamical and morphological aspects of the disc. Results. The planets migrate outward as a result of their imposed interactions with the gaseous disc while maintaining their resonant configuration. This outward migration excites the planetesimal disc, producing a transient scattered population. While a four-planet system partially reproduces the observed cavity between the star and the cold debris disc, the inclusion of a fifth low-mass planet appears to be crucial for better reproducing key morphological aspects of the cold debris disc. Conclusions. This model provides a novel explanation for the architecture of HR 8799. Outward planetary migration, combined with mean motion resonant interactions and a fifth, low-mass planet, can effectively replicate the observed planetary architecture and cold debris disc characteristics. Our findings underscore the potential important role of planetary migration in shaping debris discs.

          The Effect of Weak Cosmic Ray Heating Events on the Desorption of $\rm H_2$

 - **Abstract**
 The typical amount of molecular hydrogen (${\rm H_2}$) in interstellar ices is not known, but significant freeze-out of ${\rm H_2}$ on dust grains is not expected. However, chemical models ubiquitously predict large amounts of $\rm H_2$ freeze-out in dense cloud conditions, and specialized treatments are needed to control the $\rm H_2$ population on grains. Here we present a numerical desorption model where the effect of weak heating events induced by cosmic rays (CRs) that heat grains to temperatures of a few tens of Kelvin at high frequencies is included, improving upon earlier desorption models that only consider strong heating events (maximum grain temperature close to 100 K) that occur at a low frequency. A temperature of a few tens of Kelvin is high enough to induce efficient desorption of $\rm H_2$, but we find that even the weak heating events do not occur often enough to lead to significant $\rm H_2$ desorption. Taking the weak heating events into account does affect the predicted abundances of other lightly-bound species, but the effect is restricted to low column densities. We make here the canonical assumption that the grains are spherical with a radius of 0.1 $\mu$m. It is conceivable that in the case of a grain size distribution, weak heating events could provide a boost to $\rm H_2$ desorption coming off small grains, which are the most numerous. Further studies are still required to better quantify the role of CRs in the desorption of $\rm H_2$ and other weakly bound species.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the protoplanetary disk lifetimes using a large sample of young stellar objects in nearby clusters. To investigate the final phase of disk dissipation, we selected 32 clusters, located within 500 pc and aged between 1 and 100 Myr, with membership determined using Gaia data. The Age and mass information of the sources are obtained through spectral energy distribution (SED) analysis and using evolutionary models of various ages. Using the IR data from 2MASS and WISE catalogues, we employ three methods to identify disks across the different wavelength regimes (1.1- 22 $\mu$m). We find that disk fraction consistently decreases as stellar systems age, a trend observed across all wavelengths included in this study. However, there is an increase in the time scale of disk decay as wavelength increases, with characteristic timescales of $\tau_{\text{short}}$ = 1.6 $\pm$ 0.1 Myr for shorter wavelengths (1.6-4.6 $\mu$m) versus $\tau_{\text{W3}}$ = 4.4 $\pm$ 0.3 Myr for 12 $\mu$m. This supports the idea that outer disk regions evolve more slowly. Notably, we detect infrared excesses at 12 $\mu$m and 22 $\mu$m in relatively older systems ($>$10 Myr), with some disks with estimated ages up to $\sim$ 100 Myr. Among these, we identify a population of full disks that persist beyond the typical dissipation timescale. We also observe that the median mass of disk-hosting stars decreases from 0.62 $M_\odot$ to 0.27 $M_\odot$ in clusters younger and older than 40 Myr, respectively, indicating slower disk dissipation around lower-mass stars. We identify 33 transitional disk candidates using various color-color diagrams. Using LAMOST DR8 optical spectra and H-alpha equivalent widths, we identify possible accretors and estimate their mass accretion rates, finding most are younger than 10 Myr.

 Context: Weak gravitational lensing is a key cosmological probe for current and future large-scale surveys. While power spectra are commonly used for analyses, they fail to capture non-Gaussian information from nonlinear structure formation, necessitating higher-order statistics and methods for efficient map generation. Aims: To develop an emulator that generates accurate convergence maps directly from an input power spectrum and wavelet l1-norm without relying on computationally intensive simulations. Methods: We use either numerical or theoretical predictions to construct convergence maps by iteratively adjusting wavelet coefficients to match target marginal distributions and their inter-scale dependencies, incorporating higher-order statistical information. Results: The resulting kappa maps accurately reproduce the input power spectrum and exhibit higher-order statistical properties consistent with the input predictions, providing an efficient tool for weak lensing analyses.

 - **Abstract**
 Advances in optical astrometry allow us to infer the non-radial kinematic structure of the Universe directly from observations. Here I use a supervised machine learning neural network method to predict 1.57 million redshifts based on several photometric and metadata classifier parameters from the unWISE mid-infrared database and from Gaia. These estimates are used to divide the sample into three redshift bins: 1-2, 2-3, and $>3$. For each subset, all available Gaia proper motions are used in a global vector spherical harmonic solution to degree 3 (30 fitting vector functions). I find significant differences in a few fitted proper motion patterns at different redshifts. The largest signals are seen in the comparison of the vector spherical harmonic fits for the 1-2 and 2-3 redshift bins. The significant harmonics include a rigid spin, a dipole glide from the north Galactic pole to the south and an additional quadrupole distortion. Validation tests with filtered subsamples indicate that the detected effect can be caused by hidden systematic errors in astrometry. The results are verified by using an independent source of redshifts and computing the observer's Galactocentric acceleration. This study offers a new observational test of alternative cosmological models.

 - **Abstract**
 The obliquity between the stellar spin axis and the planetary orbit, detected via the Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect, is a tracer of the formation history of planetary systems. While obliquity measurements have been extensively applied to hot Jupiters and short-period planets, they remain rare for cold and long-period planets due to observational challenges, particularly their long transit durations. We report the detection of the RM effect for the 19-hour-long transit of HIP 41378 f, a temperate giant planet on a 542-day orbit, observed through a worldwide spectroscopic campaign. We measure a slight projected obliquity of 21 $\pm$ 8 degrees and a significant 3D spin-orbit angle of 52 $\pm$ 6 degrees, based on the measurement of the stellar rotation period. HIP 41378 f is part of a 5-transiting planetary system with planets close to mean motion resonances. The observed misalignment likely reflects a primordial tilt of the stellar spin axis relative to the protoplanetary disk, rather than dynamical interactions. HIP 41378 f is the first non-eccentric long-period (P>100 days) planet observed with the RM effect, opening new constraints on planetary formation theories. This observation should motivate the exploration of planetary obliquities across a longer range of orbital distances through international collaboration.

 - **Abstract**
 We present \textbf{GeQuLEP} (Germanium-based Quantum Sensors for Low-Energy Physics), a conceptual design for an advanced quantum sensing platform integrating high-purity germanium (Ge) crystals with engineered phononic crystal cavities. At cryogenic temperatures, these cavities naturally host dipole-bound states, effectively forming quantum dots coupled to radio-frequency quantum point contact (RF-QPC) readout systems. This innovative coupling approach promises ultra-sensitive phonon-mediated charge detection through phonon-induced charge displacement. GeQuLEP is specifically designed to achieve exceptionally low detection thresholds, theoretically enabling single primary phonon sensitivity with anticipated energy depositions as low as \textbf{0.00745~eV}. This unprecedented sensitivity, if realized experimentally, would provide unique access to searches for low-mass dark matter down to the keV/$c^2$ mass range via nuclear and electronic recoils. Additionally, GeQuLEP aims to facilitate the real-time detection of solar \textit{pp} neutrinos through coherent elastic neutrino--nucleus scattering (CE$\nu$NS). By combining phonon-based quantum transduction with quantum-classical hybrid readout schemes, the GeQuLEP architecture represents a scalable, contact-free phonon spectroscopy design that could significantly advance the capabilities of ultra-low-energy rare-event detection at the quantum limit.

 - **Abstract**
 Kinetic misalignment, one of the most compelling scenarios for the non-thermal generation of axion dark matter, is generally accompanied by axion fragmentation, a process in which the energy of the axion condensate is transferred to its perturbations. The dynamics of fragmentation, at least in the context of dark matter production, have so far been studied semi-analytically using perturbation theory. In this work, we present the first classical lattice simulation of kinetic axion fragmentation in the context of dark matter production, focusing on parameters relevant to the QCD axion. Our findings indicate that the non-perturbative dynamics captured by the lattice lead to a significantly broader spectrum of axion fluctuations, with a sustained transfer of energy to mildly relativistic modes and with smaller occupation numbers compared to the linear approximation. As a consequence, the final dark matter abundance is typically O(1) lower than in the linear approximation, which is itself O(1) lower than the zero-mode-only prediction. This broadening and suppression of the spectrum could have a significant impact on axion mini-halo formation, one of the main experimental handles on kinetic fragmentation.

          Dynamical origin of Theia, the last giant impactor on Earth

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmochemical studies have proposed that Earth accreted roughly 5-10% of its mass from carbonaceous (CC) material, with a large fraction delivered late via its final impactor, Theia (the Moon-forming impactor). Here, we evaluate this idea using dynamical simulations of terrestrial planet formation, starting from a standard setup with a population of planetary embryos and planetesimals laid out in a ring centered between Venus and Earth's orbits, and also including a population of CC planetesimals and planetary embryos scattered inward by Jupiter. We find that this scenario can match a large number of constraints, including i) the terrestrial planets' masses and orbits; ii) the CC mass fraction of Earth; iii) the much lower CC mass fraction of Mars, as long as Mars only accreted CC planetesimals (but no CC embryos); iv) the timing of the last giant (Moon-forming) impact; and v) a late accretion phase dominated by non-carbonaceous (NC) bodies. For this scenario to work, the total mass in scattered CC objects must have been ~ 0.2 - 0.3 M$_{\oplus}$ , with an embryo-to-planetesimal mass ratio of at least 8, and CC embryos in the ~ 0.01 - 0.05 M$_{\oplus}$ mass range. In that case, our simulations show there are roughly 50-50 odds of Earth's last giant impactor (Theia) having been a carbonaceous object - either a pure CC embryo or an NC embryo that previously accreted a CC embryo. Our simulations thus provide dynamical validation of cosmochemical studies.

          Neutrino mass tension or suppressed growth rate of matter perturbations?

 - **Abstract**
 Assuming a minimal $\Lambda$CDM cosmology with three massive neutrinos, the joint analysis of Planck cosmic microwave background data, DESI baryon acoustic oscillations, and distance moduli measurements of Type Ia supernovae from the Pantheon+ sample sets an upper bound on the total neutrino mass, $\sum m_\nu \lesssim 0.06$-$0.07$ eV, that lies barely above the lower limit from oscillation experiments. These constraints are mainly driven by mild differences in the inferred values of the matter density parameter across different probes that can be alleviated by introducing additional background-level degrees of freedom (e.g., by dynamical dark energy models). However, in this work we explore an alternative possibility. Since both $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$ and massive neutrinos critically influence the growth of cosmic structures, we test whether the neutrino mass tension may originate from the way matter clusters, rather than from a breakdown of the $\Lambda$CDM expansion history. To this end, we introduce the growth index $\gamma$, which characterizes the rate at which matter perturbations grow. Deviations from the standard $\Lambda$CDM value ($\gamma \simeq 0.55$) can capture a broad class of models, including non-minimal dark sector physics and modified gravity. We show that allowing $\gamma$ to vary significantly relaxes the neutrino mass bounds to $\sum m_\nu \lesssim 0.13$-$0.2$ eV, removing any tension with terrestrial constraints without altering the inferred value of $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$. However, this comes at the cost of departing from standard growth predictions: to have $\sum m_\nu \gtrsim 0.06$ eV one needs $\gamma > 0.55$, and we find a consistent preference for $\gamma > 0.55$ at the level of $\sim 2\sigma$. This preference increases to $\sim 2.5$-$3\sigma$ when a physically motivated prior $\sum m_\nu \ge 0.06$ eV from oscillation experiments is imposed.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an updated measurement of the diffuse astrophysical neutrino flux using Baikal-GVD cascade data collected between April 2018 to March 2024. In this period, the detector grew from 15% to 55% of its baseline cubic kilometer configuration. The diffuse astrophysical neutrino flux is detected with a statistical significance of 5.1 $\sigma$. Assuming a single power law model of the astrophysical neutrino flux with identical contribution from each neutrino flavor, the following best-fit parameter values are found: the spectral index $\gamma_{astro}$ = 2.64$^{+0.09}_{-0.11}$ and the flux normalization $\phi_{astro}$ = 4.42$^{+2.31}_{-1.29}\times10^{-18} \text{GeV}^{-1}\text{cm}^{-2}\text{s}^{-1}\text{sr}^{-1}$ per one flavor at 100 TeV. These results are broadly consistent with IceCube measurements.

 - **Abstract**
 We identify a new class of time periodic attractor solutions in scalar field cosmology, which we term Cosmological Frequency Combs (CFC). These solutions arise in exponential quintessence models with a phantom matter background and exhibit coherent phase-locked oscillations in the scalar field's normalized variables. We demonstrate that such dynamics induce modulations in observables like the Hubble parameter and growth rate, offering a dynamical mechanism to even address the H0 tension exactly. Our results uncover a previously unexplored phase of cosmic acceleration, linking the concept of frequency combs to large scale cosmological evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have transformed natural language understanding through vast datasets and large-scale parameterization. Inspired by this success, we present SpecCLIP, a foundation model framework that extends LLM-inspired methodologies to stellar spectral analysis. Stellar spectra, akin to structured language, encode rich physical and chemical information about stars. By training foundation models on large-scale spectral datasets, our goal is to learn robust and informative embeddings that support diverse downstream applications. As a proof of concept, SpecCLIP involves pre-training on two spectral types--LAMOST low-resolution and Gaia XP--followed by contrastive alignment using the CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) framework, adapted to associate spectra from different instruments. This alignment is complemented by auxiliary decoders that preserve spectrum-specific information and enable translation (prediction) between spectral types, with the former achieved by maximizing mutual information between embeddings and input spectra. The result is a cross-spectrum framework enabling intrinsic calibration and flexible applications across instruments. We demonstrate that fine-tuning these models on moderate-sized labeled datasets improves adaptability to tasks such as stellar-parameter estimation and chemical-abundance determination. SpecCLIP also enhances the accuracy and precision of parameter estimates benchmarked against external survey data. Additionally, its similarity search and cross-spectrum prediction capabilities offer potential for anomaly detection. Our results suggest that contrastively trained foundation models enriched with spectrum-aware decoders can advance precision stellar spectroscopy.

 - **Abstract**
 We show that enhancement of the axion relic abundance compared to the standard misalignment contribution generically leads to the production of nonzero momentum axion modes, resulting in warm dark matter behavior and enhanced isocurvature perturbations. It leads to universal constraints on the axion parameter space that are independent of detailed model assumptions and cosmological history. For models enhancing relic abundance with gradient axion modes, observations of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest impose a lower bound on the axion decay constant, $f_a \gtrsim 10^{15} {\rm GeV}\,(10^{-18}{\rm eV}/m_a)$, from the free-streaming effect. For models relying on the delay of coherent axion oscillations, we obtain a slightly weaker bound, $f_a \gtrsim 10^{14} {\rm GeV}\,(10^{-18}{\rm eV}/m_a)$. We make relatively conservative choices to establish these universal bounds but also provide scaling parameters that can be calibrated for stronger constraints in concrete models and updated as observations improve.

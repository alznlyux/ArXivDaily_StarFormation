          Tracing the W3/W4/W5 and Perseus complex dynamical evolution with star clusters

 - **Abstract**
 The Perseus complex offers an ideal testbed to study cluster formation and early evolution as it hosts two major hierarchical structures (namely LISCA I and LISCA II) and the W3/W4/W5 (W345) region characterized by recent star formation. This work aims to provide a full characterization of the population of star clusters in the W345 region, in terms of their structural, photometric, and kinematic properties. Clusters are then used to probe the dynamical properties of the W345 region and, on a larger scale, to investigate the evolution of the Perseus complex. We used Gaia DR3 data to search for star clusters in the W345 region and characterize them in terms of their density structure, ellipticity, internal dynamical state, and ages. We identified five stellar clusters belonging to the W345 complex. The three younger clusters are still partially embedded in the gas and show evidence of expansion, while the older ones cleared the surrounding gas. We also found that YSOs trace the parent gas structure and possibly its kinematics. Thanks to the 6D information available for star clusters, we followed their orbital evolution to assess the formation conditions and evolution of the complex. When accounting for the Galactic potential, we find that the Perseus complex is not dispersing. The observed expansion might be a projection effect due to stars orbiting the Galaxy at different velocities. In addition, we find that the LISCA I and W345 systems formed some $20-30$ Myr ago just a few hundred parsecs away, while LISCA II was originally $\simeq 0.75-1$ kpc apart. Finally, we also assessed the impact of spiral arm perturbations by constructing tailored Galactic potential which matches the observed Galactic spiral arm structure. We find spiral structures drag star clusters toward higher-density regions, possibly keeping clusters closer for longer than the unperturbed, axisymmetric case.

          Stellar ejection velocities from the binary supernova scenario: A comparison across population synthesis codes

 - **Abstract**
 The vast majority of binary systems are disrupted at the moment of the first supernova, resulting in an unbound compact object and companion star. These ejected companion stars contribute to the observed population of runaway stars. Therefore, an understanding of their ejection velocities is essential to interpreting observations, particularly in the Gaia era of high-precision astronomy. We present a comparison of the predicted ejection velocities of disrupted binary companions in three different population synthesis codes: COSMIC, COMPAS, and binary_c, which use two independent algorithms for the treatment of natal kicks. We confirm that, despite the codes producing different pre-supernova evolution from the same initial conditions, they each find the ejection velocities of secondary stars from disrupted binaries are narrowly distributed about their pre-supernova orbital velocity. We additionally include a correction to the derivation included in Kiel & Hurley 2009 that brings it into agreement with methods from other works for determining post-supernova binary orbital parameters. During this comparison, we identified and resolved bugs in the kick prescriptions of \textit{all three} codes we considered, highlighting how open-science practices and code comparisons are essential for addressing implementation issues.
#### Title:
          Colors and Dynamics of a Near-Sun Orbital Asteroid Family: 2021 PH27 and 2025 GN1

 - **Abstract**
 We observed the dynamically similar near-Sun asteroids 2021 PH27 and 2025 GN1 for their optical colors. These objects have the lowest known semi-major axes of any asteroids. 2021 PH27 has the largest general relativistic effects of any known solar system object. The small semi-major axis and very close passage to the Sun suggests the extreme thermal and gravitational environment should highly modify these asteroids' surfaces. From g', r', i' and z'-band imaging, we find the colors of 2021 PH27 to be between the two major asteroid types the S and C classes (g'-r'= 0.58 +- 0.02, r'-i'=0.12 +- 0.02 and i'-z'=-0.08 +- 0.05 mags). With a spectral slope of 6.8 +-0.03 percent per 100nm, 2021 PH27 is a X-type asteroid and requires albedo or spectral features to further identify its composition. We find the dynamically similar 2025 GN1 also has very similar colors (g'-r'=0.55 +-0.06 and r'-i'=0.14 +-0.04) as 2021 PH27, suggesting these objects are fragments from a once larger parent asteroid or 2021 PH27 is shedding material. The colors are not blue like some other near-Sun asteroids such as 3200 Phaethon that have been interpreted to be from the loss of reddening substances from the extreme temperatures. There is no evidence of activity or a large amplitude period for 2021 PH27, whereas 2025 GN1 might have a more significant rotational light curve. 2025 GN1 may have a very close encounter or hit Venus in about 2155 years and likely separated from 2021 PH27 in about the last 10 kyrs.

          Uncertainties in the Inference of Internal Structure: The Case of TRAPPIST-1 f

 - **Abstract**
 We use the TRAPPIST-1 system as a model observation of Earth-like planets. The densities of these planets being 1-10% less than the Earth suggest that the outer planets may host significant hydrospheres. We explore the uncertainty in water mass fraction from observed mass and radius. We investigate the interior structure of TRAPPIST-1 f using the open-source solver MAGRATHEA and varying assumptions in the interior model. We find that TRAPPIST-1 f likely has a water mass fraction of 16.2% $\pm$ 9.9% when considering all possible core mass fractions and requires 6.9% $\pm$ 2.0% water at an Earth-like mantle to core ratio. We quantify uncertainties from observational precision, model assumptions, and experimental and theoretical data on the bulk modulus of planet building materials. We show that observational uncertainties are smaller than model assumptions of mantle mineralogy and core composition but larger than hydrosphere, temperature, and equation of state assumptions/uncertainties. Our findings show that while precise mass and radius measurements are crucial, uncertainties in planetary models can often outweigh those from observations, emphasizing the importance of refining both theoretical models and experimental data to better understand exoplanet interiors.

          Bracketing the soliton-halo relation of ultralight dark matter

 - **Abstract**
 In theories of ultralight dark matter, solitons form in the inner regions of galactic halos. The observational implications of these depend on the soliton mass. Various relations between the mass of the soliton and properties of the halo have been proposed. We analyze the implications of these relations, and test them with a suite of numerical simulations. The relation of Schive et al. 2014 is equivalent to $(E/M)_{\rm sol}=(E/M)_{\rm halo}$ where $E_{\rm sol (halo)}$ and $M_{\rm sol (halo)}$ are the energy and mass of the soliton (halo). If the halo is approximately virialized, this relation is parametrically similar to the evaporation/growth threshold of Chan et al. 2022, and it thus gives a rough lower bound on the soliton mass. A different relation has been proposed by Mocz et al. 2017, which is equivalent to $E_{\rm sol}=E_{\rm halo}$, so is an upper bound on the soliton mass provided the halo energy can be estimated reliably. Our simulations provide evidence for this picture, and are in broad consistency with the literature, in particular after accounting for ambiguities in the definition of $E_{\rm halo}$ at finite volume.

 - **Abstract**
 Context: Dimethyl sulfide (DMS; CH$_3$SCH$_3$) is an organosulfur compound that has been suggested as a potential biosignature in exoplanetary atmospheres. In addition to its tentative detections toward the sub-Neptune planet K2-18b, DMS has been detected in the coma of the 67/P comet and toward the galactic center molecular cloud G+0.693-0.027. However, its formation routes have not been characterized yet. Aims: In this work, we have investigated three gas-phase reactions (CH$_3$SH + CH$_3$OH$_2^+$, CH$_3$OH + CH$_3$SH$_2^+$, and the CH$_3$ + CH$_3$S radiative association), aiming at characterizing DMS formation routes in shocked molecular clouds and star-forming regions. Methods: We have performed dedicated quantum and kinetics calculations to evaluate the reaction rate coefficients as a function of temperature to be included in astrochemical models. Results: Among the investigated processes, the reaction between methanethiol (CH$_3$SH) and protonated methanol (CH$_3$OH$_2^+$)(possibly followed by a gentle proton transfer to ammonia) is a compelling candidate to explain the formation of DMS in the galactic center molecular cloud G+0.693-0.027. The CH$_3$ + CH$_3$S radiative association does not seem to be a very efficient process, with the exclusion of cold clouds, provided that the thiomethoxy radical (CH$_3$S) is available. This work does not deal directly with the possible formation of DMS in the atmosphere of exoplanets. However, it clearly indicates that there are efficient abiotic formation routes of this interesting species.

          LTDE: The Lens Time Delay Experiment I. From pixels to light curves

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitationally lensed quasars offer a unique opportunity to study cosmological and extragalactic phenomena, using reliable light curves of the lensed images. This requires accurate deblending of the quasar images, which is not trivial due to the small separation between the lensed images (typically $\sim1$ arcsec) and because there is light contamination by the lensing galaxy and the quasar host galaxy. We propose a series of experiments aimed at testing our ability to extract precise and accurate photometry of lensed quasars. In this first paper, we focus on evaluating our ability to extract light curves from simulated CCD images of lensed quasars spanning a broad range of configurations and assuming different observational/instrumental conditions. Specifically, the experiment proposes to go from pixels to light curves and to evaluate the limits of current photometric algorithms. Our experiment has several steps, from data with known point spread function (PSF), to an unknown spatially-variable PSF field that the user has to take into account. This paper is the release of our simulated images. Anyone can extract the light curves and submit their results by the deadline. These will be evaluated with the metrics described below. Our set of simulations will be public and it is meant to be a benchmark for time-domain surveys like Rubin-LSST or other follow-up time-domain observations at higher temporal cadence. It is also meant to be a test set to help develop new algorithms in the future.

 - **Abstract**
 Imaging reconstruction of interferometric data is a hard ill-posed inverse problem. Its difficulty is increased when observing the Galactic Center, which is obscured by a scattering screen. This is because the scattering breaks the one-to-one correspondence between images and visibilities. Solving the scattering problem is one of the biggest challenges in radio imaging of the Galactic Center. In this work we present a novel strategy to mitigate its effect and constrain the screen itself using multiobjective optimization. We exploit the potential of evolutionary algorithms to describe the optimization landscape to recover the intrinsic source structure and the scattering screen affecting the data. We successfully recover both the screen and the source in a wide range of simulated cases, including the speed of a moving screen at 230 GHz. Particularly, we can recover a ring structure in scattered data at 86 GHz. Our analysis demonstrates the huge potential that recent advancements in imaging and optimization algorithms offer to recover image structures, even in weakly constrained and degenerated, possibly multi-modal settings. The successful reconstruction of the scattering screen opens the window to event horizon scale works on the Galactic Center at 86G Hz up to 116 GHz, and the study of the scattering screen itself.

 - **Abstract**
 We describe the CHIME All-sky Multiday Pulsar Stacking Search (CHAMPSS) project. This novel radio pulsar survey revisits the full Northern Sky daily, offering unprecedented opportunity to detect highly intermittent pulsars, as well as faint sources via long-term data stacking. CHAMPSS uses the CHIME/FRB datastream, which consists of 1024 stationary beams streaming intensity data at $0.983$\,ms resolution, 16384 frequency channels across 400--800\,MHz, continuously being searched for single, dispersed bursts/pulses. In CHAMPSS, data from adjacent east-west beams are combined to form a grid of tracking beams, allowing longer exposures at fixed positions. These tracking beams are dedispersed to many trial dispersion measures (DM) to a maximum DM beyond the Milky Way's expected contribution, and Fourier transformed in time to form power spectra. Repeated observations are searched daily to find intermittent sources, and power spectra of the same sky positions are incoherently stacked, increasing sensitivity to faint persistent sources. The $0.983$\,ms time resolution limits our sensitivity to millisecond pulsars; we have full sensitivity to pulsars with $P > 60\,$ms, with sensitivity gradually decreasing from $60$ ms to $2$\,ms as higher harmonics are beyond the Nyquist limit. In a commissioning survey, data covering $\sim 1/16$ of the CHIME sky was processed and searched in quasi-realtime over two months, leading to the discovery of eleven new pulsars, each with $S_{600} > 0.1$\,mJy. When operating at scale, CHAMPSS will stack $>$1\,year of data along each sightline, reaching a sensitivity of $\lesssim 30\, \mu$Jy for all sightlines above a declination of $10^{\circ}$, and off of the Galactic plane.

 - **Abstract**
 We build slowly rotating anisotropic neutron stars using the Hartle-Thorne formalism, employing three distinct anisotropy models--Horvat, Bowers-Liang, and a covariant model--to characterize the relationship between radial and tangential pressure. We analyze how anisotropy influences stellar properties such as the mass-radius relation, angular momentum, moment of inertia, and binding energy. Our findings reveal that the maximum stable mass of non-rotating stars depends strongly on the anisotropy model, with some configurations supporting up to 60% more mass than their isotropic counterparts with the same central density. This mass increase is most pronounced in the models where the anisotropy grows toward the star's surface, as seen in the covariant model. Furthermore, slowly rotating anisotropic stars adhere to universal relations for the moment of inertia and binding energy, regardless of the chosen anisotropy model or equation of state.

          Thawing quintessence and transient cosmic acceleration in light of DESI

 - **Abstract**
 Recent analysis of the DESI Collaboration challenges the $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model, suggesting evidence for a dynamic dark energy. These results are obtained in the context of generic parameterizations of the dark energy equation of state (EoS), which better fit the data when they exhibit an unphysical phantom behavior in the past. In this paper, we briefly analyze how ambiguous this latter conclusion can be in light of the background degeneracy between EoS parameterizations and minimally coupled quintessence scenarios. We then investigate whether the current observational data can be accommodated with a non-phantom, thawing dark energy EoS, typical of a broad class of quintessence models. We show that the thawing behavior of this EoS outperforms the CPL parameterization and is statistically competitive with $\Lambda$CDM while predicting cosmic acceleration as a transient phenomenon. Such a dynamic behavior aligns with theoretical arguments from string theory and offers a way out of the trans-Planckian problem that challenges the ever-accelerated $\Lambda$CDM paradigm.

          Supermassive Binaries in Ultralight Dark Matter Solitons

 - **Abstract**
 Ultralight (or fuzzy) dark matter (ULDM) is an alternative to cold dark matter. A key feature of ULDM is the presence of solitonic cores at the centers of collapsed halos. These would potentially increase the drag experienced by supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries, changing their merger dynamics and the resulting gravitational wave background. We perform detailed simulations of high-mass SMBH binaries in the soliton of a massive halo. We find more rapid decay than previous simulations and semi-analytic approximations. We confirm expectations that the drag depends strongly on the ULDM particle mass, finding masses greater than $10^{-21}$ eV could potentially alleviate the final parsec problem and that ULDM may even suppress gravitational wave production at lower frequencies in the pulsar timing band.

          Measurement of the Temperature Dependence of the Refractive Index of CdZnTe

 - **Abstract**
 We have been developing a CdZnTe immersion grating for a compact high-dispersion mid-infrared spectrometer (wavelength range 10--18 $\mu$m, spectral resolution $R = \lambda/\Delta \lambda > 25,000$, operating temperature $T < 20$ K). Using an immersion grating, the spectrometer size can be reduced to $1/n$ ($n$: refractive index) compared to conventional diffraction gratings. CdZnTe is promising as a material for immersion gratings for the wavelength range. However, the refractive index $n$ of CdZnTe has not been measured at $T < 20$ K. We have been developing a system to precisely measure $n$ at cryogenic temperatures ($T \sim 10$ K) in the mid-infrared wavelength range. As the first result, this paper reports the temperature dependence of $n$ of CdZnTe at the wavelength of 10.68 $\mu$m. This system employs the minimum deviation method. The refractive index $n$ of CdZnTe is measured at temperatures of \( T = 12.57, 22.47, 50.59, 70.57, \text{ and } 298 \, \text{K} \). We find that $n$ of CdZnTe at $\lambda =$ 10.68 $\mu$m is $2.6371 \pm 0.0022$ at $12.57 \pm 0.14$ K, and the average temperature dependence of $n$ between 12.57 $\pm$ 0.14 K and 70.57 $\pm$ 0.23 K is $\Delta n/\Delta T = (5.8 \pm 0.3) \times 10^{-5}$ K$^{-1}$.

 - **Abstract**
 The rising phase of the 2023-24 outburst of the recently discovered bright transient black hole candidate Swift J1727.8-1613 was monitored by \textit{Insight}-HXMT. We study the evolution of hard ($4$-$150$ keV) and soft ($2$-$4$ keV) band photon count rates, the hardness ratio (HR), and QPO frequencies using daily observations from the HXMT/LE, ME, and HE instruments between August 25 and October 5, 2023. The QPO frequency is found to be strongly correlated with the soft-band X-ray count rates, and spectral photon indices. In contrast, a strong anti-correlation is observed between HR and QPO frequency, as well as between HR and photon index. Based on the evolution of the QPO frequency, the rising phase of the outburst is subdivided into six parts, with parts 1-5 fitted using the propagating oscillatory shock (POS) solution to understand the nature of the evolution from a physical perspective. The best-fitted POS model is obtained with a black hole mass of $13.34\pm0.02~M_\odot$. An inward-propagating shock with weakening strength (except in part 4) is observed during the period of our study. The POS model-fitted mass of the source is further confirmed using the QPO frequency ($\nu$)-photon index ($\Gamma$) scaling method. From this method, the estimated probable mass of Swift J1727.8-1613 is obtained to be $13.54\pm1.87~M_\odot$.

          Accretion Flow Properties of MAXI J1834-021 During Its Double-Outbursts In 2023

 - **Abstract**
 The Galactic transient black hole candidate MAXI J1834-021 exhibited `faint' outbursting activity for approximately $10$ months following its discovery on February 5, 2023. We study the evolution of both the temporal (hard and soft band photon count rates, hardness ratios, and QPO frequencies) and spectral properties of the source using NICER data between March 7 and October 4, 2023. The outburst profile and the nature of QPOs suggest that the source underwent a mini-outburst following the primary outburst. A monotonic evolution of low-frequency QPOs from higher to lower frequencies is observed during the primary outbursting phase. Both phenomenological (diskbb plus powerlaw) and physical (Two Component Advective Flow) model fitted spectral studies suggest that during the entire epoch, the source remained in harder spectral states, with a clear dominance of nonthermal emissions from the `hot' Compton cloud. The 2023 outbursting activity of MAXI J1834$-$021 can be classified as a combination of double `failed' outbursts, as no softer spectral states were observed.

          Detection of X-ray Polarization in the Hard State of IGR J17091-3624: Spectro-Polarimetric Study with IXPE and NuSTAR Data

 - **Abstract**
 The class-transition Galactic X-ray binary IGR J17091--3624 was simultaneously monitored by the IXPE and NuSTAR satellites. We present a detailed spectro-polarimetric study of the source using data from both satellites covering the period from March 7-10, 2025. A polarimetric analysis in the $2$-$8$~keV band using a model-independent method reveals a significant detection of polarization degree (PD) of $(11.3\pm2.35)\%$ at a polarization angle (PA) of $82^\circ.7\pm5^\circ.96$ (significant at $>4\sigma$). The model-dependent polarization analysis using the polconst and polpow models yields consistent values of PD and PA. In both methods, an energy-dependent increasing trend of PD is observed. In the $6$-$8$~keV band, a maximum PD of $(29.9\pm8.46)\%$ is detected at a PA of $88^\circ.0\pm8^\circ.15$ (significant at $>3\sigma$) . The joint spectral analysis using IXPE and NuSTAR data in the $2$-$70$~keV band was performed with four different sets of phenomenological and physical models. Our results indicate a strong dominance of non-thermal photons originating from a `hot' Compton cloud, suggesting that the source was in a hard spectral state. Spectral fitting with the physical kerrbb and TCAF models provides an estimate of the black hole mass $M_{\rm BH} = 14.8^{+4.7}_{-3.4}~M_\odot$ and dimensionless spin parameter $a^* \sim 0.54$.

 - **Abstract**
 A heliocentric dust ring on Venus orbit was discovered following observations by the Helios spacecraft, and then confirmed thanks to observations by STEREO and the Parker Solar Probe. The impact risk it poses needs to be evaluated for any spacecraft crossing the ring. This study aims to provide a first model of the dust ring, in terms of distribution of particles (including size distribution), velocity, density of the ring, and deduce a first estimation of the impact risk to spacecrafts crossing the ring. We seek to describe the orbits of dust particles in the ring. We explore a first simple model, that leads us to propose a second, more elaborate, model. This model is then populated by particles that we integrate for 2000 years. We demonstrate that the dust ring will persist over the next 2000 years, only slightly extending radially and perpendicularly to the Venus orbital plane. We show that particles tend to accumulate at Venus orbit, but that along it the differences in density is negligible. We compute the number of particles we can expect to find in the ring. Finally, as an example, we apply this model to Bepi-Colombo to obtain a first estimate of the impact flux in function of radius and mass, for radii between 2 $\mu$m and 2 cm (i.e. for masses between 10^-2 kg and 10^-14 kg). We also present the impact velocity and direction of impacts with respect to Bepi-Colombo. We are able to conclude that the ring seems to present a low risk for spacecrafts using Venus as a gravity assist.

 Radio astronomy is part of radio science that developed rapidly in recent decades. In the research of radio astronomy, pulsars have always been an enduring popular research target. To find and observe more pulsars, large radio telescopes have been built all over the world. In this paper, we present our studies on pulsars in M15 and NGC 6517 with FAST, including monitoring pulsars in M15 and new pulsar discoveries in NGC 6517. All the previously known pulsars in M15 were detected without no new discoveries. Among them, M15C was still detectable by FAST, while it is assumed to fade out due to precession [1]. In NGC 6517, new pulsars were continues to be discovered and all of them are tend to be isolated pulsars. Currently, the number of pulsars in NGC 6517 is 17, much more than the predicted before [2].

 Context. The emerging population of inert black hole binaries (BHBs) provides a unique opportunity to constrain black hole (BH) formation physics. These systems are composed of a stellar-mass BH in a wide orbit around a non-degenerate star with no observed Xray emission. Inert BHBs allow for narrow constraints to be inferred on the natal kick and mass loss during BH-forming core-collapse events. Aims. In anticipation of the upcoming BLOeM survey, we aim to provide tight constraints on BH natal kicks by exploiting the full parameter space obtained from combined spectroscopic and astrometric data to characterize the orbits of inert BHBs. Multi-epoch spectroscopy from the BLOeM project will provide measurements of periods, eccentricities, and radial velocities for inert BHBs in the SMC, which complements Gaia astrometric observations of proper motions. Methods. We present a Bayesian parameter estimation framework to infer natal kicks and mass loss during core-collapse from inert BHBs, accounting for all available observables, including the systemic velocity and its orientation relative to the orbital plane. The framework further allows for circumstances when some of the observables are unavailable, such as for the distant BLOeM sources which preclude resolved orbits. Results. With our new framework, we are able to distinguish between BH formation channels, even in the absence of a resolved orbit. In cases when the pre-explosion orbit can be assumed to be circular, we precisely recover the parameters of the core-collapse, highlighting the importance of understanding the eccentricity landscape of pre-explosion binaries, both theoretically and observationally. Treating the near-circular, inert BHB, VFTS 243, as a representative of the anticipated BLOeM systems, we constrain the natal kick to less than 27 km/s and the mass loss to less than 2.9 Msun within a 90% credible interval.

 Constant-roll inflation is a distinctive class of phenomenological inflationary models in which the inflaton's rate of roll remains constant. It provides an exact solution that is compatible with the latest observational constraints and offers a natural framework for enhancing the curvature power spectrum, which is relevant to the formation of primordial black holes. In this paper, I review constant-roll inflation in memory of Alexei Starobinsky.

          Thermal Evolution and Mass Loss on Short-Period, Low-Mass Planets During FU Orionis Outbursts

 - **Abstract**
 Ultra-short-period (USP) planets represent a unique class of exoplanets characterized by their tight orbits and relatively low masses, with some also exhibiting unusually high iron fractions. Previous work (Becker et al, 2021) proposed a dynamical pathway wherein planets can migrate inward due to drag from sub-Keplerian gas during episodic FU Orionis (FU Ori) outbursts, an abrupt accretion phenomenon exhibited by young stellar objects, thereby potentially populating USP orbits. However, the implications of this migration process on the structural and compositional evolution of these planets remain unexplored. In this work, we model the response of a planet's surface material to the high disk temperatures characteristic of an FU Ori event and compute the fraction of an Earth-like planet's mass that will be lost due to vaporization and subsequent turbulent diffusion of gaseous molecules during the FU Ori event. We find that low-mass planets may lose a substantial fraction of their mantle mass during FU Ori events, potentially contributing to the observed prevalence of low-mass, iron-rich USP planets.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper derives and summarizes the analytical conditions for lunar ballistic capture and constructs ballistic lunar transfers based on these conditions. We adopt the Sun-Earth/Moon planar bicircular restricted four-body problem as the dynamical model to construct lunar transfers. First, the analytical conditions for ballistic capture are derived based on the relationship between the Keplerian energy with respect to the Moon and the angular momentum with respect to the Moon, summarized in form of exact ranges of the Jacobi energy at the lunar insertion point. Both sufficient and necessary condition and necessary condition are developed. Then, an optimization method combined with the analytical energy conditions is proposed to construct ballistic lunar transfers. Simulations shows that a high ballistic capture ratio is achieved by our proposed method (100$\%$ for direct insertion and $99.15\%$ for retrograde insertion). Examining the obtained ballistic lunar transfers, the effectiveness of the analytical energy conditions is verified. Samples of our obtained lunar transfers achieves a lower impulse and shorter time of flight compared to two conventional methods, further strengthening the advantage of our proposed method.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we analyze the ongoing brightening of the poorly studied symbiotic star V4141 Sgr and examine its long-term variability. We present new low-resolution spectroscopic observations of the system in its bright state and combine them with multi-color photometric data from our observations, ASAS-SN, ATLAS, and Gaia DR3. To investigate its long-term evolution, we also incorporate historical data, including photographic plates, constructing a light curve spanning more than a century. Our analysis reveals that V4141 Sgr has undergone multiple outbursts, with at least one exhibiting characteristics typical of "slow" symbiotic novae. The current outburst is characterized by the ejection of optically thick material and possibly bipolar jets, a phenomenon observed in only a small fraction of symbiotic stars. These findings establish V4141 Sgr as an intriguing target for continued monitoring.

 - **Abstract**
 RZ Cha is a detached eclipsing binary containing two slightly evolved F5 stars in a circular orbit of period 2.832 d. We use new light curves from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) and spectroscopic orbits from Gaia DR3 to measure the physical properties of the component stars. We obtain masses of 1.488 +/- 0.011 Msun and 1.482 +/- 0.011 Msun, and radii of 2.150 +/- 0.006 Rsun and 2.271 +/- 0.006 Rsun. An orbital ephemeris from the TESS data does not match published times of mid-eclipse from the 1970s, suggesting the period is not constant. We measure a distance to the system of 176.7 +/- 3.7 pc, which agrees with the Gaia DR3 value. A comparison with theoretical models finds agreement for metal abundances of Z = 0.014 and Z = 0.017 and an age of 2.3 Gyr. No evidence for pulsations was found in the light curves. Future data from TESS and Gaia will provide more precise masses and constraints on any changes in orbital period.

 - **Abstract**
 V596 Pup is a detached eclipsing binary containing two A1 V stars in a 4.596 d period orbit with a small eccentricity and apsidal motion, previously designated as VV Pyxidis. We use new light curves from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) and published radial velocities to determine the physical properties of the component stars. We find masses of 2.098 +/- 0.021 Msun and 2.091 +/- 0.018 Msun, and radii of 2.179 +/- 0.008 Rsun and 2.139 +/- 0.007 Rsun. The measured distance to the system is affected by the light from a nearby companion star; we obtain 178.4 +/- 2.5 pc. The properties of the system are best matched by theoretical predictions for a subsolar metallicity of Z = 0.010 and an age of 570 Myr. We measure seven significant pulsation frequencies from the light curve, six of which are consistent with delta Scuti pulsations and one of which is likely of slowly-pulsating B-star type.

          An accreting dwarf star orbiting the S-type giant star pi1 Gru

 - **Abstract**
 Aims. We aim to characterize the properties of the inner companion of the S-type AGB star pi1 Gru, and to identify plausible future evolution scenarios for this triple system. Methods. We observed pi1 Gru with ALMA and VLT/SPHERE. In addition, we collected archival photometry data and used the Hipparcos-Gaia proper motion anomaly. We derive the best orbital parameters from Bayesian inference. Results. The inner companion, pi1 Gru C was located at 37.4 +/- 2.0 mas from the primary in June-July 2019 (projected separation of 6.05 +/- 0.55 au at 161.7 +/- 11.7 pc). The best orbital solution gives a companion mass of 0.86 (+0.22/-0.20) Msun (using the derived mass of the primary), and a semi-major axis of 7.05 (+0.54/-0.57) au. This leads to an orbital period of 11.0 (+1.7/-1.5) yr. The best solution is an elliptical orbit with eccentricity e = 0.35 (+0.18/-0.17), but a circular orbit cannot be totally excluded. The close companion can either be a K1V (F9.5V/K7V) star or a white dwarf. The ultraviolet and millimeter continuum photometry are consistent with the presence of an accretion disk around the close companion. The ultraviolet emission could then either originate in hot spots in an overall cooler disk, or also from a hot disk in case the companion is a white dwarf. Conclusions. Though the close companion and the AGB star are interacting, and an accretion disk is observed around the companion, the mass-accretion rate is too low to cause a Ia supernova but could produce novae every ~900 yr. Short wavelength spatially resolved observations are needed to further constrain the nature of the C companion. Searches for close-in companions similar to this system will help to better understand the physics of mass- and angular-momentum transfer, and orbital evolution in the late evolutionary stages.

          Hint towards inconsistency between BAO and Supernovae Dataset: The Evidence of Redshift Evolving Dark Energy from DESI DR2 is Absent

 - **Abstract**
 The combination of independent cosmological datasets is a route towards precision and accurate inference of the cosmological parameters if these observations are not contaminated by systematic effects. However, the presence of unknown systematics present in differrent datasets can lead to a biased inference of the cosmological parameters. In this work, we test the consistency of the two independent tracers of the low-redshift cosmic expansion, namely the supernovae dataset from Pantheon$+$ and the BAO dataset from DESI DR2 using the distance duality relation which is a cornerstone relation in cosmology under the framework of General Relativity. We find that these datasets violate the distance duality relation and show a signature of redshift evolution, hinting toward unaccounted physical effects or observational artifacts. Coincidentally this effect mimics a redshift evolving dark energy scenario when supernovae dataset and DESI datasets are combined without accounting for this inconsistency. Accounting for this effect in the likelihood refutes the previous claim of evidence of non-cosmological constant as dark energy model from DESI DR2, and shows a result consistent with cosmological constant with $w_0= -0.92\pm 0.08$ and $w_a= -0.49^{+0.33}_{-0.36}$. This indicates that the current conclusion from DESI DR2 in combination with Pantheon$+$ is likely due to the combination of two inconsistent datasets resulting in precise but inaccurate inference of cosmological parameters. In the future, tests of this kind for the consistency between different cosmological datasets will be essential for robust inference of cosmological parameters and for deciphering unaccounted physical effects or observational artifacts from supernovae and BAO datasets.

 - **Abstract**
 Using 15 years of data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT), we performed a comprehensive analysis on the gamma-ray binary HESS J0632+057. Its spectrum in 0.1-300 GeV band is well described by a power law model with an index of $2.40\pm0.16$, leading to an energy flux of (5.5$\pm$1.6$)\times$ 10$^{-12}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. The GeV Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) of HESS J0632+057 hints for a spectral turn-over between $\sim$10-100 GeV. Orbital analysis reveals a flux enhancement during the phase range of 0.2-0.4, consistent with the X-ray and TeV light curves, indicating an origin of a common particle population. We carried out six deep radio observations on HESS J0632+057 with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST), evenly distributed across its orbit, reaching a detection sensitivity of 2$\mu$Jy. However, no radio pulsation was detected within these observations. The absence of radio pulsation may be attributed to the dense stellar wind environment of HESS J0632+057.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observational advances, such as Gaia DR3 GSP-Spec, have highlighted the potential of chemical abundances in tracing and revealing the structure of spiral arms. Building on these studies, we aim to trace the Milky Way's inner spiral arms using chemical abundance data from the Gaia-ESO Survey (GES). By mapping over-densities in [Fe/H] and [Mg/Fe], we seek to identify spiral arms in both radial and vertical planes, detect substructures, and compare our results with recent Galactic chemical evolution models. We used chemical abundance data from the Gaia-ESO Survey to create spatial maps of [Fe/H], [Mg/H], and [Mg/Fe] excess across the Galactic inner disc. We compared our results with the spiral arm models proposed by Spitoni et al. (2023) and Barbillon et al. (2024). For the first time, the inner spiral arms were revealed using chemical abundance patterns. We detected [Fe/H] enhancements and [Mg/Fe] under-abundances that consistently trace the Scutum and Sagittarius arms. A connecting spur between these arms is observed in the [Mg/H] plane. The alignment between our observations and the results of our 2D chemical evolution models reinforces the significance of spiral arm transits in driving both azimuthal and radial variations in chemical abundances. Our results confirm that spiral arms can be traced using stellar chemical abundances with GES data, providing a new perspective on the structure of the inner Galaxy. The consistency between enhanced [Fe/H] and lower [Mg/Fe] ratios, as observed in previous studies, further strengthens the reliability of our findings. The observed spur, bifurcation, and vertical substructures align well with recent models and studies, indicating that chemical maps can significantly contribute to our understanding of Galactic spiral arms.

          Dynamical tides in neutron stars with first-order phase transitions: the role of the discontinuity mode

 - **Abstract**
 During the late stages of a binary neutron star inspiral, dynamical tides induced in each star by its companion become significant and should be included in complete gravitational-wave (GW) modeling. We investigate the coupling between the tidal field and quasi-normal modes in hybrid stars and show that the discontinuity mode ($g$-mode)--intrinsically associated with first-order phase transitions and buoyancy--can rival the contribution of the fundamental $f$-mode. We find that the $g$-mode overlap integral can reach up to $\sim 10\%$ of the $f$-mode value for hybrid star masses in the range 1.4-2.0$M_{\odot}$, with the largest values generally associated with larger density jumps. This leads to a GW phase shift due to the $g$-mode of $\Delta \phi_g \lesssim 0.1$-$1$ rad (i.e., up to $\sim$5\%-10\% of $\Delta \phi_f$), with the largest shifts occurring for masses near the phase transition. At higher masses, the shifts remain smaller and nearly constant, with $\Delta \phi_g \lesssim 0.1$ rad (roughly $\sim 1\%$ of $\Delta \phi_f$). These GW shifts may be relevant even at the design sensitivity of current second-generation GW detectors in the most optimistic cases. Moreover, if a $g$-mode is present and lies near the $f$-mode frequency, neglecting it in the GW modeling can lead to systematic biases in neutron star parameter estimation, resulting in radius errors of up to $1\%-2\%$. These results show the importance of dynamical tides to probe neutron stars' equation of state, and to test the existence of dense-matter phase transitions.

 - **Abstract**
 It has been suggested that a gravitational slingshot from the hypothetical Planet 9 (P9) could explain the unusually large velocity of meteor CNEOS 2014-01-08. I show that this explanation does not work because P9 can at most provide an insignificant 0.25 km/s of the object's 42 km/s asymptotic heliocentric velocity and at most a 7.6 degree deflection due to P9's low orbital speed and non-zero radius. Furthermore, the hypothesis requires an encounter with two planets that is trillions of times more unlikely than CNEOS 2014-01-08 simply being fast from the beginning.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent Baryonic Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) are mildly discrepant ($2.2\sigma$) with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) when interpreted within $\Lambda$CDM. When analyzing these data with extended cosmologies this inconsistency manifests as a $\simeq3\sigma$ preference for sub-minimal neutrino mass or evolving dark energy. It is known that the preference for sub-minimal neutrino mass from the suppression of structure growth could be alleviated by increasing the optical depth to reionization $\tau$. We show that, because the CMB-inferred $\tau$ is negatively correlated with the matter fraction, a larger optical depth resolves a similar preference from geometric constraints. Optical depths large enough to resolve the neutrino mass tension ($\tau\sim0.09)$ also reduce the preference for evolving dark energy from $\simeq3\sigma$ to $\simeq1.5\sigma$. Conversely, within $\Lambda$CDM the combination of DESI BAO, high-$\ell$ CMB and CMB lensing yields $\tau = 0.090 \pm 0.012$. The required increase in $\tau$ is in $\simeq3-5\sigma$ tension with Planck low-$\ell$ polarization data when taken at face value. While there is no evidence for systematics in the large-scale Planck data, $\tau$ remains the least well-constrained $\Lambda$CDM parameter and is far from its cosmic variance limit. The importance of $\tau$ for several cosmological measurements strengthens the case for future large-scale CMB experiments as well as direct probes of the epoch of reionization.

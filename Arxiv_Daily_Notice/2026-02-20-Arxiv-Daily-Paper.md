- **Abstract**
 OB stars generally form in open clusters within the Milky Way's thin disk, so when they are found at high Galactic latitudes, it is thought that they were ejected from their birth clusters during the past few tens of millions of years. Using Gaia Data Release 3 (hereafter DR3) data, we traced the kinematic trajectories of 39 high-latitude B-type stars and 447 Galactic open clusters with high-quality astrometry to search for moments of past intersection. In cases where we found matching trajectories, we also considered the clusters' HR diagrams to confirm parent-orphan pairs have matching ages. Further analysis of the clusters' core environments allowed us to determine a probable ejection mechanism. Through these paternity tests, we have identified possible origins for five of these orphaned B-type stars. Here we present the likely travel times, ejection velocities, and a discussion of the runaway mechanism for each case. We also identify one star whose trajectory did not bring it near the disk during the time period of our analysis, and we discuss its possible origins as well.

- **Abstract**
 Shock chemistry is an excellent tool to shed light on the formation and destruction mechanisms of complex organic molecules (COMs). The L1157-mm outflow is the only low-mass protostellar outflow that has extensively been studied in this regard. Using the data taken as part of the PRODIGE (PROtostars & DIsks: Global Evolution) large program, we aim to map COM emission and derive the molecular composition of the protostellar outflow driven by the Class 0 protostar NGC1333 IRAS4B1 to introduce it as a new laboratory to study the impact of shocks on COM chemistry. In addition to typical outflow tracers such as SiO and CO, outflow emission is seen from H2CO, HNCO, and HC3N, as well as from the COMs CH3OH, CH3CN, and CH3CHO, and even from deuterated species such as DCN, D2CO, and CH2DOH. Maps of integrated intensity ratios between CH3OH and DCN, D2CO, and CH3CHO reveal gradients with distance from the protostar. Intensity ratio maps of HC3N and CH3CN with respect to CH3OH peak in the southern lobe where temperatures are highest. Rotational temperatures derived towards two positions, one in each lobe, are found in the range ~50-100 K. Abundances with respect to CH3OH are higher by factors of a few than for the L1157-B1. In conclusion, for the first time, we securely detected the COMs CH3CN, CH3CHO, and CH2DOH in the IRAS 4B1 outflow, serendipitously with limited sensitivity and bandwidth. Targeted observations will enable the discovery of new COMs and a more detailed analysis of their emission. Morphological differences between molecules in the IRAS 4B1 outflow lobes and their relative abundances provide first proof that this outflow is a promising new laboratory for shock chemistry, which will offer crucial information on COM formation and destruction as well as outflow structure and kinematics.

- **Abstract**
 We investigate the multiband photometric properties of seven supernovae (SNe) showing double-peaked light-curve evolution and prominent shock-cooling emission, observed by the Wide Field Survey Telescope (WFST) during its first year of operation. By jointly employing an analytic early shock-cooling model and the Arnett radioactive-diffusion model, we fit the bolometric light curves and infer ejecta masses in the range $1.1$-$2.6 M_\odot$, consistent with a transitional population between ultra-stripped supernovae (USSNe) and normal stripped-envelope supernovae (SESNe). The envelope masses are estimated to be $M_{\rm env}=0.1$-$0.4 M_\odot$, while the progenitors are constrained to be yellow or blue supergiants (YSGs/BSGs) with radii of $R=120$-$300 R_\odot$. Using empirical relations, we estimate progenitor luminosities of $L=10^{4.6}$-$10^{4.9} L_\odot$, corresponding to zero-age main-sequence (ZAMS) masses of $8$-$20 M_\odot$. Theoretical models suggest that such progenitors are more naturally produced through binary evolution channels, as single-star evolutionary pathways are unable to yield ejecta masses this low.
#### Title:
          Interstellar Formation of Thioethanal (CH$_{3}$CHS). Gas-Phase and Ice-Surface Mechanisms involving Secondary Sulfur Products

- **Abstract**
 The formation pathways of sulfur-bearing species in the interstellar medium are crucial to understand astrochemical processes in cold molecular clouds and to gain new insights about the sulfur budget in these regions. We aim to explore the recently detected, thioethanal (CH$_{3}$CHS) formation mechanisms from thioethanol (CH$_{3}$CH$_{2}$SH) as a precursor in addition to secondary sulfur products. The electronic structure methods and density functional theory for both gas-phase and ice-grain surface environments is employed. To mimic interstellar ice-mantles, we use medium (W6) and large amorphized (W22) water clusters as implemented in Binding Energy Evaluation protocol. A barrierless formation mechanism for CH$_{3}$CHS under low-temperature interstellar conditions is identified, in the gas phase. Surface environments modulate activation barriers in a site-specific manner, elucidated through both Langmuir-Hinshelwood and Eley-Rideal initiated surface reaction pathways. Compared to oxygen analogs, sulfur chemistry enables alternate pathways due to weaker S-H bonding, with a competing route forming ethane-1,1-di-thiol (CH$_{3}$CH(SH)SH), on the ice-grain surface, potentially reducing CH$_{3}$CHS yields. The first accurate binding energy for thioethanol on water ice is also reported, confirming its greater volatility than ethanol. The proposed mechanism offers a tentative hypothesis for the apparent mutual exclusive detections of the CH$_{3}$CH$_{2}$SH and CH$_{3}$CHS in TMC-1, Orion, and Sgr B2(N), that further requires validation through quantitative astrochemical modeling and also to distinguish this chemical differentiation from observational sensitivity limitations. These qualitative findings highlight the multifaceted chemical behavior of sulfur-bearing organics in the interstellar medium and support CH$_{3}$CH(SH)SH as promising astro-chemical targets.

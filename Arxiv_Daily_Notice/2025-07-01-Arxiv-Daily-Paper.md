 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive exploration of hierarchical triple black hole (BH) systems to address the "initial separation" problem in gravitational wave astrophysics. This problem arises because isolated BH binaries must have extremely small initial separations to merge within a Hubble time via gravitational wave (GW) emission alone, separations at which their stellar progenitors would have merged prematurely. Using a modified JADE secular code incorporating GW energy loss, we systematically investigate a seven-dimensional parameter space: masses of three BHs (5-100 $M_\odot$ inner binary, 1-200 $M_\odot$ tertiary), inner/outer semimajor axes (1-200 AU and 100-10,000 AU), outer orbit eccentricity (0-0.9), and mutual inclination (40°-80°). We employed an adaptive MCMC approach sampling the merger/nonmerger transition boundary across nearly 15 million simulations. Results reveal merger-conducive regions correspond to asymmetric inner binary masses, large inner separations where von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai (ZLK) mechanism operates effectively without relativistic precession suppression, small outer separations providing stronger perturbations, and large outer eccentricities bringing the tertiary closer at pericenter. Merger probability correlates positively with mutual inclination. We developed a classification scheme for nonmerging systems based on GW emission and ZLK oscillations. A trained neural network predicts merger outcomes with 99% ROC score and 95% accuracy (99.7% for high-confidence predictions), enabling rapid population synthesis. Validation against N-body integrations showed 87% qualitative agreement, confirming our methodology captures essential triple BH dynamics while enabling unprecedented-scale exploration of configurations resolving the initial separation problem.

 - **Abstract**
 The LISA datastream will be populated by large instrumental and astrophysical noises, both potentially exhibiting long-term non-stationarities. Modelling and inferring on them is a challenging task, central for accurate signal reconstruction. In this paper, we introduce $\texttt{bahamas}$, a codebase designed to characterize noises and stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds (SGWBs) in LISA. $\texttt{bahamas}$ adopts a time-frequency data representation, based on the Short Time Fourier Transform, to accurately describe the signal temporal evolution and accommodate for the presence of data gaps. In addition, $\texttt{bahamas}$ supports a variety of SGWB spectral models proposed in literature, enabling joint inference on them. Posterior sampling leverages No-U-Turn sampling an efficient variant of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, inheriting the cross-hardware capabilities provided by NumPyro (CPU/GPU/TPU). We benchmark $\texttt{bahamas}$ performances on a simple test case, and present ongoing developments to appear in future releases.

          Simulation-based population inference of LISA's Galactic binaries: Bypassing the global fit

 - **Abstract**
 The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is expected to detect thousands of individually resolved gravitational wave sources, overlapping in time and frequency, on top of unresolved astrophysical and/or primordial backgrounds. Disentangling resolved sources from backgrounds and extracting their parameters in a computationally intensive "global fit" is normally regarded as a necessary step toward reconstructing the properties of the underlying astrophysical populations. Here, we show that it is possible to infer the properties of the most numerous population of LISA sources - Galactic double white dwarfs - directly from the frequency (or, equivalently, time) strain series, by using a simulation-based approach that bypasses the global fit entirely. By training a normalizing flow on a custom-designed compression of simulated LISA frequency series from the Galactic double white dwarf population, we demonstrate how to infer the posterior distribution of population parameters (e.g., mass function, frequency, and spatial distributions). This allows for extracting information on the population parameters from both resolved and unresolved sources simultaneously and in a computationally efficient manner. Our approach to target population properties directly can be readily extended to other source classes (e.g., massive and stellar-mass black holes, extreme mass ratio inspirals), provided fast simulations are available, and to scenarios involving non-Gaussian or non-stationary noise (e.g., data gaps).

 - **Abstract**
 Microquasars, compact binary systems with an accreting stellar-mass black hole or neutron star, are promising candidates for high-energy particle acceleration. Recently, the LHAASO collaboration reported on the detection of $>100$ TeV $\gamma$-ray emission from five microquasars, suggesting that these sources are efficient particle accelerators. In microquasars, high-energy $\gamma$-rays can be produced in large-scale jets or winds. In this work, we explore the X-ray, $\gamma$-ray and neutrino emission from SS 433, V4641 Sgr and GRS 1905+105. We consider leptonic and hadronic scenarios to explain the spectra observed by LHAASO and other high-energy $\gamma$-ray detectors. We estimate the neutrino flux associated with the hadronic component and investigate the detectability of neutrinos from these sources in current and future neutrino telescopes. We find that among the three sources, V4641 Sgr has the best prospects of observation with a combined next-generation neutrino telescopes.

          Implications for dark energy of cosmic transparency in light of DESI data

 - **Abstract**
 The distance duality relation (DDR) between luminosity and angular diameter distances holds if gravity is described by a metric theory and the universe is transparent. Recent cosmological inferences using Type Ia supernovae (SNe~Ia), baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) and the cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations have suggested that dark energy may evolve in time. We test how the assumption of distance duality impacts dark energy inference. Marginalizing over the absolute SNe~Ia luminosity, we find no deviation from the DDR, independent of the SN~Ia compilation used, or the assumed dark energy model. This corresponds a maximum deviation in the SN~Ia luminosity of $\Delta m \sim 0.05$ mag at the highest redshift. Allowing for deviations in the DDR increases the errors in the dark energy equation of state parameters (EoS) by 30-50$\%$. For the Pantheon+ compilation the constraints on dark energy are within $2\sigma$ of $\Lambda$CDM when applying a more realistic minimum redshift cut $z_{\rm min} >0.023$. We constrain possible physical scenarios that can impact cosmic transparency, specifically photon-axion mixing and the presence of (gray) intergalactic (IG) dust, in the latter case limiting the dust density to $\Omega_{\rm dust}<2 \times 10^{-4}$ at 95\% C.L. When using the local Cepheid calibration of the SNe~Ia absolute luminosity, a significant deviation from the DDR relation (for which $\epsilon=0$) is preferred. However, the best fit parameter value $\epsilon = -0.091 \pm 0.024$ requires the SNe~Ia to be brighter than the case with DDR valid, therefore, neither of the physical scenarios which dim the SNe can explain the high $H_0$. Constraints on the photon-axion interaction length scale suggest a limit on the coupling constant of $g_{a\gamma} < 10^{-12}\,{\rm GeV}^{-1}$.

          On beam characterization of ground-based CMB radio telescopes using UAV-mounted sources: application to the QUIJOTE TFGI and plans for LSPE-Strip

 - **Abstract**
 The Large Scale Polarization Explorer (LSPE) project, funded by the Italian Space Agency (ASI), includes the development of LSPE-Strip, a ground-based radio telescope for observing Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies. LSPE-Strip, nearing its construction phase, will operate from the Teide Observatory in Tenerife, employing 49 coherent polarimeters at 43 GHz to deliver critical data on CMB anisotropies and 6 channels at 95 GHz as atmospheric monitor. On-site characterization of such advanced instruments is crucial to detect possible systematic effects, such as gain fluctuations, beam distortions, and pointing errors, that can compromise performance by introducing spurious polarizations or radiation collection from unintended directions. To address these challenges, a drone-mounted Q-band test source for on-site characterization of LSPE-Strip's polarimeter array was developed. Modern Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) offer a flexible approach for antenna pattern measurements, yet their use in high-frequency radio astronomy is not consolidated practice. In October 2022, a UAV-based measurement campaign was conducted with the TFGI instrument on the second QUIJOTE telescope in Tenerife, in collaboration with the Instituto de Astrofisica de Canarias. This pioneering effort aimed to validate UAV-based beam characterization methods and assess QUIJOTE's performance under operational conditions. Preliminary results demonstrated high measurement accuracy, leveraging QUIJOTE's dual-receiver configuration for beam validation. These findings provide valuable insights for optimizing UAV systems in preparation for LSPE-Strip's future characterization.

 - **Abstract**
 Classical Cepheids are key astrophysical laboratories for studying stellar structure and evolution, and for calibrating the cosmic distance scale. Despite major progress, uncertainties remain regarding their masses, luminosities, distances, and the role of processes like core overshooting, rotation, and mass loss. The high-precision data from ESA Gaia's third data release offer an opportunity to address these issues. This study aims to estimate the structural parameters and distances of a sample of Classical Cepheids using non-linear convective pulsation models. It also tests the consistency of Gaia parallaxes, constrains the Mass Luminosity relation, and investigates the dependence of the projection factor (p-factor) on pulsation period. We analysed 46 Cepheids with precise Gaia DR3 photometry and radial velocities. Model fitting was performed by comparing predicted and observed light curves in Gaia G, GBP, and GRP bands, and radial velocity curves. Distances from the models were compared with Gaia parallaxes, including published corrections. Predicted masses and luminosities were used to constrain the ML relation; radial velocities allowed independent pfactor estimates. Distances show statistical agreement with Gaia parallaxes, requiring no additional global offset. Inferred masses and luminosities are consistent with evolution models including mild core overshooting, mass loss, or rotation. No significant period dependence of the pfactor is found, with a constant value of p = 1.22+/-0.05, consistent with recent studies. Results also agree with the Period-Wesenheit-Metallicity relation from Gaia DR3.

 - **Abstract**
 The UTMOST-NS pulsar timing programme operated at the Molonglo Observatory Synthesis Telescope from April 2021 to June 2023, observing 173 pulsars with an average cadence of 50 pulsars per day. An overview of the programme is presented, detailing the hardware, software, and observing strategy. Pulsar timing results are discussed, focusing on timing noise and glitches. It is shown that the scaling of residuals due to timing noise with pulsar parameters and observing timespan is consistent with earlier studies, and that the recovered timing noise parameters remain consistent as the observing timespan is increased. Second frequency derivatives are investigated, and it is shown that the uncertainty on $\ddot{\nu}$ is sensitive to the frequency cutoff in the timing noise model, varying by three-fold approximately depending on whether Fourier modes with frequency lower than the reciprocal of the observing timespan are included. We measure 39 non-zero values of $\ddot{\nu}$ when considering both models with and without low-frequency modes. An analytic scaling relating anomalous braking indices to timing noise amplitude is also validated. Glitches in the sample are discussed, including three detected by an ``online'' glitch detection pipeline using a hidden Markov model (HMM). In total 17 glitches are discussed, one of which, in PSR J1902+0615, has not been reported elsewhere. An ``offline'' glitch search pipeline using the HMM framework is used to search for previously undetected glitches. Systematic upper limits are set on the size of undetected glitches. The mean upper limit is $\Delta\nu^{90\%}/\nu = 6.3 \times 10^{-9}$ at 90\% confidence.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new, state-of-the-art computation of the Diffuse Supernova Neutrino Background (DSNB), where we use neutrino spectra from multi-dimensional, multi-second core collapse supernova simulations - including both neutron-star and black-hole forming collapses - and binary evolution effects from modern population synthesis codes. Large sets of numerical results are processed and connected in a consistent manner, using two key quantities: the mass of the star's Carbon-Oxygen (CO) core at an advanced pre-collapse stage - which depends on binary evolution effects - and the compactness parameter, which is the main descriptor of the post-collapse neutrino emission. The method enables us to model the neutrino emission of a very diverse, binary-affected population of stars, which cannot unambiguously be mapped in detail by existing core collapse simulations. We find that including black hole-forming collapses enhances the DSNB by up to 50% at energies greater than 30-40 MeV. Binary evolution effects can change the total rate of collapses and generate a sub-population of high core mass stars that are stronger neutrino emitters. However, the net effect on the DSNB is moderate - up to a 15% increase in flux - due to the rarity of these super-massive cores and to the relatively modest dependence of the neutrino emission on the CO core mass. The methodology presented here is suitable for extensions and generalizations, and therefore it lays the foundation for modern treatments of the DSNB.

 - **Abstract**
 Inspired by recent observations suggesting that the retrograde precession of the brown dwarf binary 2M1510 AB is consistent with induction by a polar circumbinary planet, we investigate the formation of such planets by studying the evolution of a primordial misaligned circumbinary disc around a brown dwarf binary. Analytical calculations show that a critical tilt angle of $i_{\rm crit} \gtrsim 50^\circ$ for moderately eccentric binaries is needed for polar alignment of circumbinary discs in systems with low disc-to-binary angular momentum ratios. For higher ratios, this angle converges to the Kozai-Lidov instability threshold of $\sim 39^\circ$. We identify disc parameters, such as viscosity ($\alpha = 10^{-4}$) and aspect ratio ($H/r = 0.05$), that enable polar alignment within typical disc lifetimes. Notably, a circumbinary disc around a low-mass binary, such as a brown dwarf binary, will require more time to achieve polar alignment compared to higher-mass systems. A hydrodynamical simulation confirms that an initially inclined disc around a brown dwarf evolves towards a polar state, creating favorable conditions for polar planet formation. Using these results, we finish by placing 2M1510 AB into a wider context and speculate why such a polar circumbinary configuration has not been identified before.

          A dynamical coherency gate for state recovery: Statistical requiem for the long arc of cislunar orbital mis-prediction

 - **Abstract**
 We present a statistically grounded methodology for recovering physically consistent initial conditions from historical two-line element sets (TLEs), enabling accurate long-arc trajectory reconstruction for distant and highly eccentric Earth satellites. The approach combines numerical averaging of osculating orbital elements with Gaussian-mixture-model (GMM) filtering with robust fallback strategies to isolate a dynamically coherent subset of mean elements at a common reference epoch. From this filtered ensemble, a representative osculating element is reconstructed, yielding a recovered Cartesian state vector with predictive capability far exceeding that of raw TLE-based propagations and existing approaches. We apply this method to the case of OGO-1 (1964-054A), a spacecraft launched into a cislunar orbit and tracked intermittently over five decades. Despite large observational gaps and significant secular evolution, our recovered state, used within an unscented Kalman filter (UKF), accurately reproduces the full trajectory, including its atmospheric reentry in August 2020, to within one day of the true decay time. This result demonstrates the viability of filtered TLE statistics as a proxy for precise orbit determination, particularly in dynamical regimes where resonances and long-period perturbations dominate. The techniques presented here provide a framework for trajectory reconstruction and prediction using only publicly available data and are broadly applicable to the study of high-altitude debris objects and legacy space missions whose original tracking and covariance data are unavailable.

          Timing results of 22 years for PSR J0922+0638

 - **Abstract**
 We conducted a timing analysis of PSR J0922+0638 (B0919+06) using data from the Nanshan 26 m radio telescope and the MeerKAT telescope, spanning from January 2001 to March 2023. During this 22-year period, we discovered a previously unreported small glitch (glitch 1) before the well-known large glitch (glitch 2), occurring at ${\rm MJD} \sim 53325(3)$, with a frequency jump amplitude of $\Delta \nu/\nu \sim 0.79(6) \times 10^{-9}$. We also identified ten slow glitch events, half of which were newly detected. These slow glitches occurred quasi-periodically, with an average interval of approximately 553(21) days, fractional frequency changes ranging from $\Delta \nu/\nu \sim 1.13(1) \times 10^{-9}$ to $4.08(5) \times 10^{-9}$, and a maximum fractional change in the first derivative of the frequency of $\Delta \dot{\nu}/\dot{\nu} \sim -4.6 \times 10^{-3}$. Additionally, our timing noise analysis reveals a change in the spectral index for noise power before and after glitch 2, with values of $-6.0$ and $-5.3$, respectively, likely due to this large glitch. Throughout the entire observation period, the first derivative of the spin frequency ($\dot{\nu}$) showed a periodic structure. The possible modulation period was estimated to be 537(24) days before the 700-day data gap at MJD 56716 and 600(58) days afterward. We discuss the periodic oscillations in pulsar rotation as a possible manifestation of spin-down noise and quasi-periodic slow glitches.

          Bayesian constraints on quark and neutron stars from multi-messenger observations

 - **Abstract**
 We constrain the quark matter equation of state (EOS) with color superconductivity (2SC, 2SC+s, CFL phases) and QCD corrections using Bayesian inference informed by multi-messenger observations from the NICER pulsars, HESS J1731-347 and GW170817. Our results reveal that the bag constant $B$ = 47$\text{--}$55 MeV/fm$^{3}$ are tightly constrained, the QCD correction strength $a_4$ is phase-dependent ($a_4 \approx$ 0.9 for 2SC, $\sim$0.6 for 2SC+s). A large surface tension is required for 2SC phase ($\sigma \gtrsim 95$ MeV/fm$^2$) according to the stability constraints of ${^{266}\mathrm{Hs}}$. The mass-radius relations support quark stars as explanations for HESS J1731-347. The squared speed of sound converges to $c^2/3$, ruling out extreme stiffening. The inferred maximum quark star mass $M_{\mathrm{max}}< 2.28M_\odot$ (90\% confidence level) rules out the secondary component of GW190814 (2.59$\pm$0.08$M_\odot$) as a quark star. In particular, the quark stars (2SC phase) is strongly favored when including HESS J1731-347 data with the bayes factor $B_{\text{2SC, NS}}$ = 10.6, but neutron stars are moderately preferred with $B_{\text{NS, 2SC}}$ = 3.22 if HESS J1731-347 data is excluded. This demonstrates low-mass compact objects critically discriminate between quark matter phases and between quark and neutron-star models.

 - **Abstract**
 Low multipoles ($l$) in cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature anisotropies have shown some `peculiarities' when examined since the release of the full sky CMB maps, using a variety of tests. In this paper, we concern ourselves with the very first peculiarities seen in CMB data viz., a breakdown of statistical isotropy in the form of axiality and planarity of these low-$l$ modes, and preferred alignments among them. We scrutinize the latest CMB data from ESA's Planck mission, PR4, to evaluate the current status of these deviations. We employ the Power tensor method which allows an invariant characterization of the distribution of power in a given multipole, and apply it to probe the first sixty multipoles i.e., $l=2$ to 61. We find that there are significant number of modes that are intrinsically anisotropic with a cumulative probability of $0.3\%$. However since the planarity study reveals that those modes that are unusually planar are subset of these anisotropic modes, we conclude that they may not be intrinsically planar. The quadrupole is still well aligned with the octopole. Besides, $l=3$, higher multipoles aligned with quadrupole are found to be insignificant. Interestingly, the collective alignment axis of the first sixty multipoles is found to be broadly closer to the axis of dipole, quadrupole, octopole and other modes aligned with $l=2$.

 - **Abstract**
 Maps of cosmic microwave background (CMB) are extracted from multi-frequency observations using a variety of cleaning procedures. However, in regions of strong microwave emission, particularly in the galactic plane from our own galaxy Milky Way and some extended or point sources, the recovered CMB signal is not reliable. Thus, a galactic mask is provided along with the \emph{cleaned} CMB sky for use with that CMB map which excises sky regions that may still be potentially contaminated even after cleaning. So, to avoid bias in our inferences, we impose such a foreground mask. In this paper, we analyze a cleaned CMB map from Planck PR4 to probe for any foreground residuals that may still be present \emph{outside} the galactic mask where the derived CMB sky is considered clean. To that end, we employ a local cross-correlation coefficient statistic where we cross-correlate widely used foreground templates that trace galactic synchrotron, free-free, and thermal dust emission from our galaxy with the cleaned CMB sky. Using simulations, we find that few regions of the derived CMB sky are still contaminated and have to be omitted. Based on this study, we derived a mask that could be used in conjugation with the standard mask to further improve the purpose of galactic masks.

 - **Abstract**
 The primary scientific objective of this Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) Science Case Development Document (SCDD) is to measure planetary rotation rates of transiting exoplanets to determine the structure, composition, circulation, and aerosol properties of their planetary atmospheres. For this analysis, HWO would obtain spectroscopic phase curves for planets with orbital periods of 5 - 20+ days, to assess tidal locking radius assumptions. Extending phase curve studies out to longer orbital periods than accessible with current and near-future telescopes will enable detailed investigation of atmospheric structure, composition, and circulation for planets that are much cooler than the more highly irradiated planets accessible with JWST phase curve observations (i.e., Teq < 500 K for HWO versus 1400 K <= Teq <= 2600 K for JWST). Broad wavelength coverage extending from the UV to the NIR would capture both reflected light and thermal emission, enabling HWO to conduct comprehensive characterization of planetary atmospheres. UV observations would probe high altitudes, thereby providing valuable insights into atmospheric (dis)equilibrium, aerosol properties, and the effects of photochemical processes on atmospheric composition. We also discuss the role of polarimetry in the classification of aerosols and the associated role they play in the atmospheric energy budget that directly ties them to the chemistry and circulation structure of the atmosphere.

 - **Abstract**
 The association between long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) and core-collapse supernovae (SNe) has been well established since the discovery of SN 1998bw, which was linked to the low-luminosity LGRB 980425. However, long-term monitoring of several well-localized, low-redshift LGRBs has yielded compelling evidence for the absence of accompanying supernovae. Notably, two long bursts, GRB 211211A and GRB 230307A, show signatures consistent with kilonova emission from compact binary mergers, indicating that at least some long events may originate from progenitors other than core-collapse supernovae. In this study, we conduct a comparative analysis of two samples of LGRBs, i.e., LGRBs with and without supernova associations, to investigate the differences that may reveal intrinsic distinctions in their progenitors. A detailed examination of their prompt emission properties, host galaxy environments, and event rates is performed. While the two samples exhibit considerable overlap in most observed properties, a significant discrepancy in their event rate is revealed. LGRBs without supernova association have an event rate that aligns well with the star formation rate, whereas that of SN-associated LGRBs differs significantly. It indicates that LGRBs without a supernova association may constitute a distinct subclass with intrinsically different progenitors.

 - **Abstract**
 PSR J0537$-$6910 is the most frequently glitching pulsar, exhibiting large glitches at a rate of roughly thrice per year. It displays a negative long-term effective braking index $n' = -1.234(9)$ and roughly constant positive frequency second derivatives extending all the way from one glitch to the next. We use the published RXTE and NICER timing data (i) to explore whether `persistent shifts' (non-relaxing parts of the glitch $\Delta\dot{\nu}$ in the spin-down rate, like those observed in the Crab pulsar) can explain the negative effective braking index; (ii) to ascribe part of the inter-glitch relaxation at constant frequency second derivative $\ddot{\nu}$ to internal torques due to the coupling between the observed surface and the interior of the neutron star like deduced for the Vela pulsar; (iii) to demonstrate, as a proof of concept, that after taking account of the persistent shifts and internal torques, the true braking index $n$ associated with the pulsar braking torque is $n\sim 3 $, and (iv) to explore various empirical or model dependent correlations between glitch parameters and the time to the next glitch. The average persistent shift derived for PSR J0537$-$6910 is in agreement with the persistent shift values for the Crab pulsar. By applying the crustquake model, we infer a broken plate size of $D=80$ m, similar to the value obtained for the minimum glitch size observed in the Crab pulsar. The inter-glitch $\ddot{\nu}$ values inferred for the internal torques are commensurate with those in the Vela pulsar. Delineating the effects of persistent shifts and inter-glitch relaxation due to internal torques as observed in the Crab, Vela and other pulsars, we obtained a true braking index value $n=2.75(47)$ for PSR J0537$-$6910, similar to braking indices observed from other young pulsars. PSR J0537$-$6910 is not a likely source of gravitational waves.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we employ two model-independent approaches, including redshift binning method and polynomial interpolation method, to reconstruct dark energy (DE) equation of state (EoS) $w(z)$ and DE density function $f(z)$. Our analysis incorporates data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) data release 2, Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) distance priors from Planck 2018 and Atacama Cosmology Telescope data release 6, and three Type Ia supernovae (SN) compilations (PantheonPlus, Union3, and DESY5). To ensure model independence, we adopt three redshift binning schemes (n=3, 4, 5) and three polynomial interpolation schemes with the same number of nodes (n=3, 4, 5). Our main conclusions are as follows: 1) After taking into account DESI data, there is a clear trend that DE should evolve with redshift (with deviations from the cosmological constant reaching at least a $2.13\sigma$ confidence level), indicating that current observations favor a dynamical DE. 2) In the redshift range $0.5 < z < 1.5$, the DE EoS w(z) exhibits a decreasing trend and crosses the phantom divide $w=-1$, suggesting quintom-like behavior. 3) The DE density f(z) first increases at low redshift, reaching a hump around $z\approx 0.5$, and then decreases at $0.5 < z < 1.5$, with a rapid decrease at $z>1.0$. 4) For $z > 1.5$, current data are insufficient to place strong constraints on the evolution of DE, resulting in large uncertainties in the DE reconstruction. It must be emphasized that, these four main conclusions are independent of specific reconstruction models, and are insensitive to the choice of SN compilations.

 - **Abstract**
 The transient Galactic source MAXI J1744-294 went into an outburst in 2025 for the very first time. We study the spectral properties of this source during this outburst using archival data from the XRISM satellite for both of its Resolve and Xtend instruments. We have analyzed the source during one epoch, on March 03, 2025, or MJD 60737, on which XRISM data were available. Using both phenomenological and physical model fitting approaches for continuum emissions, along with line emission and interstellar absorption models, we analyzed the spectral data in the broad 2-10 keV energy band. From our spectral analysis, we have found the existence of multiple iron lines, which are different components of the Fe XXV emission. These line complexes arise from two highly ionized plasmas with ionization rate ~ 10000 erg cm/s with distinct turbulent velocities: one broad (vturb ~ 2513 km/s) from hot gas at the inner accretion disk, and one narrow (vturb ~ 153 km/s ) scattered by nearby photoionized gas. The source is a moderately spinning black hole with a spin of 0.63-0.70, a mass of 5.7-10.1 Solar masses, and a disk inclination angle of 19-24 degrees. The spectral model fitted parameters suggest that the source is in the soft spectral state. The source is situated in a crowded field near the Galactic center, resulting in a very high hydrogen column density.

          Resolving the negative neutrino mass with cosmic birefringence

 - **Abstract**
 The recent measurement of baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO) by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) reveals a mild tension with observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) within the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model. This discrepancy leads to a preference for a total neutrino mass that is lower than the minimum value inferred from neutrino oscillation experiments. Alternatively, this tension can be eased within $\Lambda$CDM by assuming a higher optical depth ($\tau \simeq 0.09$), but such a value conflicts with large-scale CMB polarization data. We point out that cosmic birefringence, as suggested by recent Planck reanalyses, resolves this discrepancy if the birefringence angle varies significantly during reionization. Specifically, we consider the fact that the measured cosmic birefringence angle $\beta_0=0.34\pm0.09\,(1\,\sigma)\,$deg has the phase ambiguity, i.e., the measured rotation angle is described by $\beta=\beta_0+180n\,$deg ($n\in \mathbb{Z}$). We show that cosmic birefringence induced by axion-like particles with nonzero $n$ suppresses the reionization bump, allowing a higher $\tau$ consistent with data. We provide a viable parameter space where the birefringence effect simultaneously accounts for the low-$\ell$ polarization spectra, the Planck $EB$ correlations, and the elevated value of $\tau$, suggesting a key role for cosmic birefringence in current cosmological tensions.

 - **Abstract**
 During the Cosmic Dawn (CD), the HI 21-cm optical depth ($\tau$ ) in the intergalactic medium can become significantly large. Consequently, the second and higher-order terms of $\tau$ appearing in the Taylor expansion of the HI 21-cm differential brightness temperature ($\delta T_{\rm b}$ ) become important. This introduces additional non-Gaussianity into the signal. We study the impact of large $\tau$ on statistical quantities of HI 21-cm signal using a suite of standard numerical simulations that vary X-ray heating efficiency and the minimum halo mass required to host radiation sources. We find that the higher order terms suppress statistical quantities such as skewness, power-spectrum and bispectrum. However, the effect is found to be particularly strong on the non-Gaussian signal. We find that the change in skewness can reach several hundred percent in low X-ray heating scenarios. For moderate and high X-ray heating models changes are around $\sim40\%$ and $60\%$, respectively, for $M_{\rm h,min}=10^{9}\, {\rm M}_{\odot}$. This change is around $\sim 75\%$, $25\%$ and $20\%$ for low, moderate and high X-ray heating models, respectively, for $M_{\rm h,min}=10^{10}\, {\rm M}_{\odot}$. The change in bispectrum in both the halo cutoff mass scenarios ranges from $\sim 10\%$ to $\sim 300\%$ for low X-ray heating model. However, for moderate and high X-ray heating models the change remains between $\sim 10\%$ to $\sim 200\%$ for both equilateral and squeezed limit triangle configuration. Finally, we find that up to third orders of $\tau$ need to be retained to accurately model $\delta T_{\rm b}$, especially for capturing the non-Gaussian features in the HI 21-cm signal.

 - **Abstract**
 The circumstellar environments of PNe are wonderful chemically rich astrophysical laboratories in which the ionization of atoms and the formation of simple and complex molecules can be studied. The new high-sensitivity receivers open the possibility to carry out deep observations, essential to unveil weak atomic and molecular spectra in the mm range. The main goal of this work is to study the emission lines detected in the spectra of the bright C-rich PNe IC 418 and NGC 7027 and to identify all those emission features associated with radio recombination lines (RRLs) of light elements. We aim to analyze the RRLs detected on each source, and to model the sources and derive their physical parameters. This work allows us to provide the most complete and updated catalog of RRLs in space, carried out at 2, 3 and 7 mm with the IRAM 30m and the Yebes 40m radio telescopes. We compare these observational data sets with synthetic models produced with the radiation transfer code Co3RaL. Our observations reveal the presence of several H and He I RRLs at mm wavelengths in the spectra of IC 418 and NGC 7027 and also of HeIIi RRLs in the spectrum of NGC 7027. Many of these lines had remained undetected until now due to their weakness and the lack of high-sensitivity observations at these frequencies. The data also confirm the absence of molecular emission towards IC 418, above a detection level of ~3 mK [Tmb]. These mm observations represent the most extended RRL line survey of two C-rich PNe carried out so far, with most of the lines never reported before. These extremely complete catalogs evidence the importance of high-sensitivity observations and are expected to be very helpful in the line identification process in mm observations, in particular for still unknown or poorly characterized molecular species existing in the vicinity of ionized environments.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational systems in astrophysics often comprise a body -- the primary -- that far outweights the others, and which is taken as the centre of the reference frame. A fictitious acceleration, also known as the indirect term, must therefore be added to all other bodies in the system to compensate for the absence of motion of the primary. In this paper, we first stress that there is not one indirect term but as many indirect terms as there are bodies in the system that exert a gravitational pull on the primary. For instance, in the case of a protoplanetary disc with two planets, there are three indirect terms: one arising from the whole disc, and one per planet. We also highlight that the direct and indirect gravitational accelerations should be treated in a balanced way: the indirect term from one body should be applied to the other bodies in the system that feel its direct gravitational acceleration, and only to them. We point to situations where one of those terms is usually neglected however, which may lead to spurious results. These ideas are developed here for star-disc-planets interactions, for which we propose a recipe for the force to be applied onto a migrating planet, but they can easily be generalized to other astrophysical systems.

 - **Abstract**
 Space-based gravitational wave (GW) detectors, such as LISA, are expected to detect thousands of Galactic close white dwarf binaries emitting nearly monochromatic GWs. In this study, we demonstrate that LISA is reasonably likely to detect higher harmonic GW signals, particularly the $(l, |m|) = (3, 3)$ mode, from a limited sample of nearby close white dwarf binaries, even with small orbital velocities $v/c$ of order $10^{-3}$. The amplitudes of these post-Newtonian modes provide robust probes of mass asymmetry in such systems, making them valuable observational targets, especially in mass-transferring binaries. Long-term, coordinated detector operations will further improve the prospects for detecting these informative signals.

          Thermal Inertia Controls on Titan's Surface Temperature and Planetary Boundary Layer Structure

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding Titan's planetary boundary layer (PBL) -- the lowest region of the atmosphere influenced by surface conditions -- remains challenging due to Titan's thick atmosphere and limited observations. Previous modeling studies have also produced inconsistent estimates of surface temperature, a critical determinant of PBL behavior, often without clear explanations grounded in surface energy balance. In this study, we develop a theoretical framework and apply a three-dimensional dry general circulation model (GCM) to investigate how surface thermal inertia influences surface energy balance and temperature variability across diurnal and seasonal timescales. At diurnal timescales, lower thermal inertia surfaces exhibit larger temperature swings and enhanced sensible heat fluxes due to inefficient subsurface heat conduction. In contrast, at seasonal timescales, surface temperature variations show weak sensitivity to thermal inertia, as atmospheric damping tends to dominate over subsurface conduction. The PBL depth ranges from a few hundred meters to 1,000 m on diurnal timescales, while seasonal maxima reach 2,000--3,000 m, supporting the interpretation from a previous study that the Huygens probe captured the two PBL structures. Simulated seasonal winds at the Huygens landing site successfully reproduce key observed features, including near-surface retrograde winds and meridional wind reversals within the lowest few kilometers, consistent with Titan's cross-equatorial Hadley circulation. Simulations at the planned Dragonfly landing site predict shallower thermal PBLs with broadly similar wind patterns. This work establishes a physically grounded framework for understanding Titan's surface temperature and boundary layer variability, and offers a unified explanation of Titan's PBL behavior that provides improved guidance for future missions.

          What Prevents Resolving the Hubble Tension through Late-Time Expansion Modifications?

 - **Abstract**
 We demonstrate that Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) observations impose the critical constraint for resolving the Hubble tension through late-time expansion modifications. Applying the Fisher-bias optimization framework to cosmic chronometers (CC), baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) from DESI DR2, Planck CMB, and Pantheon+ data, we find that: (i) deformations in $H(z \lesssim 3)$ (via $w(z)$ reconstruction) can reconcile tensions between CC, Planck, DESI BAO, and SH0ES measurements while maintaining or improving fit quality ($\Delta\chi^2 < 0$ relative to $\Lambda$CDM); (ii) In the neighborhood of Planck best-fit $\Lambda$CDM model, no cosmologically viable solutions targeting $H_0 \gtrsim 69$ satisfy SNe Ia constraints. MCMC validation confirms the maximum achievable $H_0 = 69.09\pm0.30$ ($\chi^2_{\rm BF} \approx \chi^2_{\Lambda\rm CDM}$) across all data combinations, indicating that the conflict between late-time $w(z)$ modifications and SNe Ia observations prevents complete resolution of the Hubble tension.

          On the validity of separate-universe approach in transient ultra-slow-roll inflation

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the breakdown of the separate-universe approximation during transitions in transient ultra-slow-roll inflation by analyzing the evolution of the comoving curvature perturbation ${\cal R}$ and its conjugate momentum $\Pi$. It is well known that spatial gradient terms lead to a failure of this approximation, particularly at the transition from slow-roll to ultra-slow-roll phase. We show that a similar breakdown also occurs during the second transition back to slow-roll when considering the evolution of $\Pi$. Interestingly, while the homogeneous solution for $\Pi$ accurately captures the dynamics across the first transition, it is the homogeneous solution for ${\cal R}$ that becomes valid across the second. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the spatial curvature term introduced in the extended $\delta N$ formalism of \cite{Artigas:2024ajh} can be interpreted as arising from the contribution of $\Pi$ to the energy density perturbation. Importantly, this modification of the local Hubble parameter is valid only when the first slow-roll parameter is both small and strictly constant.

 We present the first radio--continuum detection of the circumstellar shell around the well-known WN8 type Wolf-Rayet star WR16 at 943.5\,MHz using the \ac{ASKAP} \ac{EMU} survey. At this frequency, the shell has a measured flux density of 72.2$\pm$7.2\,mJy. Using previous \ac{ATCA} measurements at 2.4, 4.8, and 8.64~GHz, as well as the \ac{EMU} observations of the star itself, we determine a spectral index of $\alpha\,=\,+0.74\pm0.02$, indicating thermal emission. We propose that the shell and star both exhibit thermal emission, supported by the its appearance in near-infrared and H$\alpha$ observations. The latest \textit{Gaia} parallax is used to determine a distance of 2.28$\pm$0.09\,kpc. This star is well-known for its surrounding circular nebulosity, and using the distance and an angular diameter of 8\farcm42, we determine the shell size to be 5.57$\pm$0.22~pc. We use the \textit{Gaia} \acp{PM} of WR16 to determine peculiar velocities of the star as $V_{\alpha}(pec) =$ --45.3$\pm$5.4\,\kms\ and $V_{\delta}(pec) =$ 22.8$\pm$4.7\,\kms, which indicates that the star is moving in a north-west direction, and translates to a peculiar tangential velocity to be 50.7$\pm$6.9\,\kms. We also use these \acp{PM} to determine the shell's origin, estimate an age of $\sim 9500\pm 1300$\,yr, and determine its average expansion velocity to be $280\pm40$\,\kms. This average expansion velocity suggests that the previous transitional phase is a \ac{LBV} phase, rather than a \ac{RSG} phase. We also use the measured flux at 943.5~MHz to determine a mass-loss rate of $1.753\times 10^{-5}~M_\odot~$yr$^{-1}$, and use this to determine a lower-limit on ionising photons of $N_{UV} > 1.406\times 10^{47}~$s$^{-1}$.

We show how spectropolarimetric data can strengthen or discard binary black hole candidates on solid grounds, and present what kind of instrument could perform this task. Namely, a high spectral resolution polarimeter operating from the far-ultraviolet (FUV) to the near-infrared (NIR), such as the POLLUX prototype, would perfectly fit within the payload of the Habitable Worlds Observatory and help revolutionize the study of extragalactic objects.

 - **Abstract**
 Mitigating data gaps in Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) light curves (LCs) holds immense value for its application in cosmological research because it provides more precise measurements of the parameter of interest of the two-dimensional Dainotti relation which is a relation among the end time of the plateau emission, Ta, its respective luminosity, La which is calculated from the fluxes at the end of the plateau, Fa. This study extends the work done by arXiv:2305.12126; arXiv:2412.20091v4 on the 545 GRB sample by introducing six different models: Deep Gaussian Process (DGP), Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN), Hybrid model of Convolutional Neural Network with Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-LSTM), Bayesian Neural Network (BNN), Polynomial Curve Fitting and Isotonic Regression. Our findings demonstrate that Isotonic Regression achieves the highest uncertainty reduction for all three parameters (36.3% for log Ta, 36.1% for log Fa, and 43.6% for {\alpha}) outperforming all the other models. The CNN- LSTM model shows consistent improvements across all GRB parameters with the lowest outlier rate for {\alpha} (0.550%), surpassing the performance of the LSTM model in arXiv:2412.20091v4. The DGP model offers reliable uncertainty reduction across all parameters and improves upon the single-layer GP baseline. These advancements are essential for using GRBs as theoretical model discriminators via the parameters of their LCs and standard candles in cosmology, investigating theoretical models, and predicting GRB redshifts through recent cutting-edge machine-learning analysis (arXiv:2411.10736,arXiv:2405.02263; arXiv:2410.13985).

          Is convective turbulence the only exciting mechanism of global p modes in the Sun?

 - **Abstract**
 In solar-like oscillators, acoustic waves are excited by turbulent motion in the convective envelope and propagate inward, generating a variety of standing pressure modes. When combining together the power of several solar acoustic modes, an excess not compatible with pure stochastic excitation was found in some studies. This could be the signature of a second mode excitation source. With over 27 years of helioseismic data from the Sun as a star observations by the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SoHO), we aim to study the variation in mode energy over this period, covering solar Cycles 23, 24, and the beginning of Cycle 25. We focus on the possible sources of high peaks in the mode-energy time series, i.e. instrumental problems or other exciting mechanisms, such as flares or Coronal Mass Ejections. We reconstruct the energy time series for each mode with a sampling time of 1.45 days. By combining the small-time-scale variations in energy for several low-degree modes in the 2090-3710uHz range, we study the correlation between the modes and their compatibility with the hypothesis that modes are only stochastically excited by convection. The observed excitation rate significantly deviates from what would be expected in the case of a purely stochastic excitation. Our results indicate that this energy excess cannot be only attributed to instrumental effects and does not exhibit a cyclic variation. Although high-energy excesses are occasionally associated with observations of flares or CMEs, no consistent pattern could be identified. The excitation is slightly more frequent for modes probing the upper layer of the convective zone. Furthermore, the energy supply rate seems to vary over time with the mean value following a modulation that can match the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO) observed in other solar indicators, and the variance being anti-correlated with the cycle.

 - **Abstract**
 The phase diagrams of ultralight dark matter (DM), modeled as a self-gravitating Bose-Einstein condensate with axionlike interaction, are studied. We classify stable, metastable, and unstable DM states over a wide range of condensate wave function amplitudes. It is shown that the axionlike interaction causes instability and an imaginary speed of sound at low amplitudes, whereas, in a specific high-amplitude band, DM attains a stable state capable of forming a dense solitonic core and suppressing quantum fluctuations in the surrounding galactic DM halo. These findings are corroborated by evaluating thermodynamic functions for DM in the dwarf galaxy NGC2366 and its hypothetical analogs with different core-to-halo mass ratios. Distinct DM phase compositions respond differently to fluctuation-induced partial pressure, resulting in a first-order phase transition in a certain range of an interaction parameter. While the DM properties in NGC2366 lie within the supercritical regime, the phase transition nonetheless provides a thermodynamic marker separating stable from unstable DM configurations. Once a dense core forms - reaching a threshold of about 12% of the total mass - the enhanced gravitation stabilizes the DM halo against fluctuations, while the internal pressure ensures core stability. In particular, we find that NGC2366's dense DM comprises roughly 19% of the DM mass while occupying only 4.7% of its total volume.

 - **Abstract**
 Observational manifestations of disturbances in a protoplanetary disk caused by a collision with a massive planet are studied. It is assumed that the planet moves along a parabolic trajectory that intersects the disk plane near the star. Gas-dynamic simulation is performed using the finite volume method on a long time scale. On its basis, images of the disk observed from the pole and edge-on are constructed in the infrared and submillimeter ranges. A wide range of planet orbit parameters is considered. The approach of the planet was considered both prograde and retrograde with the respect to the disk rotation. Calculations have shown that in the images of the disk seen pole-on, two spiral arms can be observed in case of the prograde fall, and one with retrograde case. In the case of observations of a disk whose plane is inclined at a small angle to the line of sight, distortions of the disk plane can be noticeable. In addition, a gas tail is extended from the disk in the direction of the planet's motion, which can also be identified in observations.

 We present a comprehensive thermodynamic derivation and observational validation of the third-order galaxy correlation function, extending the seminal work of Iqbal et al [ 1, 2]. Using the statistical mechanics framework for gravitating systems, we derive the governing partial differential equation and provide explicit analytical solutions. Our enhanced framework includes: (1) comparison with N-body simulations and SDSS/BOSS galaxy survey data showing excellent agreement (\c{hi}2/dof = 1.27), (2) systematic methodology for determining model parameters from observational constraints, (3) detailed analysis of scale-dependent behaviour across linear and nonlinear regimes, (4) direct connections to standard cosmological parameters ({\sigma}8, {\Omega}m, fN L), (5) comprehensive treatment of redshift-space distortions, and (6) analysis of observational systematics. We demonstrate that our third-order correlation parameter b3 provides independent constraints complementary to two-point analyses, with potential to break degeneracies in dark energy and modified gravity studies. Explicit quantitative limitations regarding cosmic expansion effects and equilibrium assumptions are provided, along with comparisons to alternative methodologies and extensions for next-generation surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 The low equilibrium temperatures of temperate sub-Neptunes lead to extremely long chemical timescales in their upper atmospheres, causing the abundances of chemical species to be strongly shaped by atmospheric transport. Here, we used a three-dimensional (3D) general circulation model involving a passive tracer to investigate the atmospheric circulation and 3D transport of temperate gas-rich sub-Neptunes, using K2-18b as an example. We model K2-18b as a synchronous or asynchronous rotator, exploring spin-orbit resonances (SOR) of 2:1, 6:1, and 10:1. We find that the strong absorption of CO$_2$ and CH$_4$ induces a detached convective zone between 1 and 5 bar, resulting in strong vertical mixing at these levels. The upper atmosphere is dominated by eastward winds (an equatorial superrotating jet present in all simulations), leading to warmer evening terminators and approximately 20% higher passive tracer mass mixing ratios compared to the morning terminators. Rotation rates have minimal impact on the strength of global mean vertical mixing, but significantly influence the latitudinal distribution of passive tracers. For synchronous, 2:1 SOR, and 6:1 SOR simulations, passive tracers are more abundant in the upwelling branches at latitudes within 60$^\circ$, while for the 10:1 SOR simulation, strong transient eddies at high latitudes (>70$^\circ$) between 0.1 to 1 bar can transport passive tracers upward from the deep atmosphere, making them more abundant there, despite their alignment with the downwelling branch of the large-scale circulation. This study focuses on the atmospheric dynamics and its influence on passive tracer transport, while a follow-up paper will incorporate active chemical species.

 - **Abstract**
 The viability of the star count (Wolf) method is assessed as a means of constraining the near-infrared (NIR) extinction law toward the Corona Australis molecular cloud. Using deep $JHK_S$ photometry from the VISIONS survey, extinction maps with 1 arcmin spatial resolution are constructed. The derived extinction ratios are $A_J/A_H=1.73\pm0.07$, $A_H/A_{K_S}=1.70\pm0.11$, and $A_J/A_{K_S}=3.02\pm0.22$, which are consistent with Galactic literature means. Assuming a power-law form ($A_\lambda \propto \lambda^{-\alpha}$) for the NIR extinction law, we derive indices of $\alpha\approx 2.0$ across all wavelength combinations, with no statistically significant wavelength dependence throughout the NIR wavelength range. While spatial variations in extinction properties are tentatively observed across the cloud, concerns persist regarding the impact of photometric completeness, and the role of reference field selection. Continued research is required to refine the approach, and scrutinize the veracity of potential extinction law variations over a more expansive region of sky.

 - **Abstract**
 The center of our galaxy hosts Sagittarius~A*, a supermassive compact object of $\sim 4.3\times 10^6$ solar masses, usually associated with a black hole. Nevertheless, black holes possess a central singularity, considered unphysical, and an event horizon, which leads to loss of unitarity in a quantum description of the system. To address these theoretical inconsistencies, alternative models, collectively known as exotic compact objects, have been proposed. In this paper, we investigate the potential detectability of signatures associated with non-rotating exotic compact objects within the Sgr~A* polarized flares dataset, as observed through GRAVITY and future instruments. We examine a total of eight distinct metrics, originating from four different categories of static and spherically symmetric compact objects: Black Holes, Boson stars, Fluid spheres, and Gravastars. Our approach involves utilizing a toy model that orbits the compact object in the equatorial plane, at the Schwarzschild-Keplerian velocity. Using simulated astrometric and polarimetric data with present GRAVITY and future GRAVITY+ uncertainties, we fit the datasets across all metrics examined. We evaluated the detectability of the metric for each dataset based on the resulting $\chi^2_\mathrm{red}$ and BIC-based Bayes factors. Plunge-through images of ECOs affect polarization and astrometry. With GRAVITY's present uncertainties, only a compact boson-star model is discernible. GRAVITY+'s improved sensitivity allows detection of most exotic compact object models. However, enhancing the astrophysical complexity of the hot spot model diminishes these outcomes. Presently, GRAVITY's uncertainties limit us to detecting just one exotic compact object metric. With GRAVITY+'s enhanced sensitivity, we can expect to uncover additional exotic compact object models and use Sgr~A* as a laboratory for fundamental physics.

 The Vera C. Rubin Observatory recently released Data Preview 1 (DP1) in advance of the upcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), which will enable boundless discoveries in time-domain astronomy over the next ten years. DP1 provides an ideal sandbox for validating innovative data analysis approaches for the LSST mission, whose scale challenges established software infrastructure paradigms. This note presents a pair of such pipelines for variability-finding using powerful software infrastructure suited to LSST data, namely the HATS (Hierarchical Adaptive Tiling Scheme) format and the LSDB framework, developed by the LSST Interdisciplinary Network for Collaboration and Computing (LINCC) Frameworks team. This note presents a pair of variability-finding pipelines built on LSDB, the HATS catalog of DP1 data, and preliminary results of detected variable objects, two of which are novel discoveries.

 - **Abstract**
 This work aims to demonstrate that two arrays of Lumped Element Kinetic Inductance Detectors (LEKIDs), when employed in filled array configuration and separated by an external linear polarizer oriented at 45 degrees, can achieve the precision required by next-generation cosmological experiments. The focus here is on validating their ability to meet stringent uncertainty requirements, in particular for polarization angle reconstruction. To achieve this, the uncertainties in the reconstruction of the polarization angle have been characterized in the laboratory using a dedicated closed-circuit 100 mK dilution cryostat. This is optically coupled to a Martin-Puplett interferometer and a custom-designed sky simulator equipped with both photometric and polarized sources, allowing one to reproduce realistic ground-based observation conditions. This experimental setup allows us to generate intensity and polarization maps with diffraction-limited resolution, allowing us to determine the polarization angles and their associated uncertainties. The results show performance in line with expectations for the next generation CMB experiments. The polarization angle was reconstructed with an uncertainty of 6.5 arcmin.

 - **Abstract**
 We forecast the impact of direct radial acceleration measurements, based on two redshift measurements of the same target one decade apart, on constraining the Yukawa correction to the Newtonian potential in the Milky Way. The Galaxy's matter distribution is modeled as the sum of a spherical bulge, a spherical dark matter halo, and two axially symmetric disks. Considering a sample of 165 Milky Way globular clusters, we find that the precision of next-generation spectrographs ($\sim$ 10 cm s$^{-1}$) is not sufficient to provide competitive constraints compared to rotation curve data using the same baryonic matter distribution. The latter sample only becomes competitive for a precision better than 0.6 cm s$^{-1}$. On the other hand, we find that adopting a population of $1.3 \times 10^5$ RR Lyrae stars as targets, a precision of $\sim$ 10 cm s$^{-1}$ can achieve constraints on the Yukawa parameters as strong as with the rotation curves.

          A planet-host ratio relation to synthesize microlensing and transiting exoplanet demography from Roman

 - **Abstract**
 The NASA Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (Roman) will be the first survey able to detect large numbers of both cold and hot exoplanets across Galactic distances: ~1,400 cold exoplanets via microlensing and ~200,000 hot, transiting planets. Differing sensitivities to planet bulk properties between the microlensing and transit methods require relations like a planet mass-radius relation (MRR) to mediate. We propose using instead a planet-host ratio relation (PHRR) to couple directly microlensing and transit observables. Unlike the MRR, a PHRR uses parameters that are always measured and so can leverage the full Roman exoplanet sample. Using 908 confirmed exoplanets from the NASA Exoplanet Archive, we show that transit depth, $\delta$, and planet-host mass ratio, $q$, obey a PHRR that is continuous over all planet scales. The PHRR is improved by including orbital period, $P$, and host effective temperature, $T_{\star}$. We compare several candidate PHRRs of the form $\delta (q,T_\star, P)$, with the Bayesian Information Criterion favouring power-law dependence on $T_\star$ and $P$, and broken power-law dependence on $q$. The break in $q$ itself depends on $T_\star$, as do the power-law slopes in $q$ either side of the break. The favoured PHRR achieves a fairly uniform $50\%$ relative precision in $\delta$ for all $q$. Approximately $5\%$ of the sample has a transit depth that is strongly under-predicted by the PHRR; around half of these are associated with large stars ($R_\star > 2.5 \, R_{\odot}$) potentially subject to Malmquist bias.

          Recurring region for neutron-star observables

 - **Abstract**
 In this letter, we report a new phenomena of recurring regions when relating observables for hybrid neutron stars and hybrid neutron-star mergers. To describe dense matter within hybrid stars, we introduce a percolation to vary the size and characteristics of the deconfinement phase transition to quark matter. Before and after the percolation, we keep the hadronic and quark phases the same, described by different realistic models for the equation of state of beta-equilibrated, charge-neutral, zero-temperature matter. When solving spherical and deformed equations for neutron stars in general relativity, we find that: no matter the size or characteristics of the percolation region, or the order of the phase transition on either side (hadronic and quark), as long as we minimize the average sound speed from the beginning of the percolation region to the central density for a given star, we can produce equations of state that cross through the same, small recurring region within mass-radius and mass-tidal deformability diagrams. Our findings provide a new way to produce hybrid equations of state for dense matter that match a given observation of neutron stars or neutron star mergers.

          Tidal Inflation is Stronger for Misaligned Neptune-Sized Planets Than Aligned Ones

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations have revealed an intriguing abundance of polar-orbiting Neptune-sized planets, many of which exhibit unusually inflated radii. While such misaligned orbits point to a complex dynamical history, the connection between their orbital orientations and planetary structures remains poorly understood. In this study, we analyze a sample of 12 misaligned and 12 aligned planets using structure models that incorporate tidal heating. We use various statistical tests to demonstrate with at least $90\%$ confidence that misaligned planets experience more tidally-induced radius inflation compared to aligned planets. This inflation likely stems from their dynamically active histories, which often place them in close-in, eccentric, and highly inclined orbits. We further present a case study of WASP-107~b, an exceptionally inflated polar Neptune, and model its history using a simple coupled orbital and radius evolution approach. Our results place constraints on the planet's tidal quality factor that agree with recent JWST observations.

          Constraining self-interacting ultrahigh-energy neutrinos by cosmic microwave background spectral distortion

 - **Abstract**
 The neutrino telescopes have firmly established the existence of ultra-high-energy (UHE) neutrinos. Observations of these neutrinos offer a unique probe of neutrino self-interactions. This work investigates how the self-interacting neutrinos, mediated by scalar bosons, inject energy into the medium through radiative scattering with the cosmic neutrino background, leaving an imprint on the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) spectrum. The energy injection into plasma in redshift ranges, $5\times10^4\lesssim z\lesssim2\times10^6$ and $ z\lesssim5\times10^4$, leads to $\mu$-type and $y$-type of CMB spectral distortions, respectively. Using observational constraints from Cosmic Background Explorer/Far Infrared Absolute Spectrophotometer (COBE/FIRAS) and projected sensitivities from Primordial Inflation Explorer (PIXIE) experiments for $\mu$-type and $y$-type CMB distortions, we derive the stringent upper bounds on the self-interaction coupling strength as a function of mediator mass for neutrino interactions. We focus on flavor-specific self-interaction related to muon neutrinos and sub-GeV mass mediators ($m_{\phi}$). We find the upper bound on the self-interaction coupling strength to be $\sim 3.1\times 10^{-5}$ for the muon neutrino, considering UHE muon neutrino energy to be 1 PeV and PIXIE projected upper bounds on $\mu$-type CMB spectral distortion. The bound remains constant till the mediator mass reaches the center of mass energy, and after that, it gets relaxed and becomes proportional to the mediator mass. We have also compared our results with existing bounds in the literature. Our findings indicate that CMB spectral distortion could play a decisive role in exploring neutrino physics beyond the standard model of particle physics, and future missions like PIXIE can provide valuable insights.

- **Abstract**
 Centaurus A (CenA) and M83 form one of the most massive galaxy pairs in the nearby Universe. Although their observed heliocentric velocities suggest motion that is not obviously indicative of mutual attraction, this work presents evidence that CenA and M83 are in fact infalling toward each other, exhibiting a dynamical interaction analogous to the binary-like motion of the Milky Way and Andromeda in the Local Group (LG). Using the Timing Argument (TA), calibrated with analog galaxy pairs from the AbacusSummit simulation, we estimate the total mass of the CenA/M83 system under the assumption that the line-of-sight (LoS) velocity is dominated by motion toward the system's barycenter. This yields a total mass of $(6.36 \pm 1.30) \cdot 10^{12}\, M_\odot$. The inferred mass agrees well with independent estimates based on virial mass measurements and $K$-band luminosity--to-mass ratios. Together, the consistent bound signature and robust mass determination highlight the CenA/M83 system as a compelling nearby analog to the LG. Further discussion of NGC 4945 as a main perturber (as the Large Magellanic Could) for the CenA is also discussed.

- **Abstract**
 We present thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) Compton-$y$ parameter maps constructed from two years (2019-2020) of observations with the South Pole Telescope (SPT) third-generation camera, SPT-3G, combined with data from the Planck satellite. Using a linear combination (LC) pipeline, we obtain a suite of reconstructions that explore different trade-offs between statistical sensitivity and suppression of astrophysical contaminants, including minimum-variance, CMB-deprojected, and CIB-deprojected $y$-maps. We validate these maps through different statistical techniques such as auto- and cross-power spectra with large-scale structure tracers as well as stacking on cluster locations. These tests are used to understand the balance between noise and astrophysical foreground residuals (such as the CIB) in combination with the recovery of the tSZ signal for different maps. For example, results from stacking at the location of clusters confirm the robustness of the recovered tSZ signal over the $\sim 1500\: {\rm deg}^2$ SPT-3G survey field used in this analysis. The high-resolution and low-noise maps produced here provide an important cosmological tool for future studies, including measurements of the Compton-$y$ map power spectrum, cross-correlations with other tracers of the large-scale structure, detailed modeling of cluster pressure profiles, and study of the thermodynamic state of the baryons in the Universe.

- **Abstract**
 Pair-instability supernovae leave behind no compact remnants, resulting in a predicted gap in the distribution of stellar black-hole masses. Gravitational waves from binary black-hole mergers probe the relevant mass range and analyses of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA catalog (GWTC-4) indicate a possible mass cutoff at $40$-$50M_\odot$. However, the robustness of this result is yet to be tested. To this end, we simulate a comprehensive suite of gravitational-wave catalogs with full Bayesian parameter estimation and analyze them with parametric population models. For catalogs similar to GWTC-4, confident identification of a cutoff is not guaranteed, but GWTC-4 results are compatible with the best constraints among our simulations. Conversely, spurious false identification of a cutoff is unlikely. For catalogs expected by the end of the O4 observing run, uncertainty in the cutoff mass is reduced by $\gtrsim20\%$, but a cutoff at $40$-$50M_\odot$ yields only a lower bound on the $^{12}\mathrm{C}(\alpha,\gamma)^{16}\mathrm{O}$ reaction rate, which in terms of the S-factor at $300\,\mathrm{keV}$ may be $S_{300}\gtrsim125\,\mathrm{keV}\,\mathrm{b}$ at $90\%$ credibility by the end of O4. Relative uncertainties on the Hubble parameter $H_0$ from gravitational-wave data alone can still be up to $100\%$. We also analyze GWTC-4 with the nonparametric PixelPop population model, finding that some mass features are more prominent than in parametric models but a sharp cutoff is not required. However, the parametric model passes a likelihood-based predictive test in GWTC-4 and the PixelPop results are consistent with those from our simulated catalogs where a cutoff is present. We use the simple focus of this study to emphasize that such tests are necessary to make astrophysical claims from gravitational-wave catalogs going forward.

- **Abstract**
 The development of molecular complexity during stellar and planetary formation owes much to the interaction of gas and dust. When the first astrochemical models including solid-state chemistry were developed more than forty years ago, data from dedicated laboratory experiments were limited. Since then, many groups have developed specific experimental setups to address this issue, but astrochemical models have rarely been directly confronted with these new results. We want to demonstrate whether it is possible to use rate-equation-type astrochemical models developed in the context of the Interstellar Medium to compare them with laboratory astrophysics experiments. In this work, we use the case of low-temperature hydrogenation of CO, which is known to lead to methanol, among other molecules. We carried out 9 experiments, varying the experimental parameters such as temperature and dose. We give quantitative results and take care of detailing the vocabulary used in the experiments. We use astrochemical codes, NAUTILUS, pyRate and MONACO, to reproduce our experimental conditions, which requires good control of the change of vocabulary and scales, especially for fluxes and time scales. This work demonstrates that it is possible to use different astrochemical codes to compare modelling results directly with the output of experiments. There are discrepancies between models and experiments, as well as between models, but a fair agreement is achieved. We discuss the possible origin of the differences, which could originate from the chemical network or the difference in the description of physical processes.

          ALMA Band1 observations of the rhoOphW filament I. Enhanced power from excess microwave emission at high spatial frequencies

- **Abstract**
 The rhoOphW photo-dissociation region (PDR) is an example source of bright excess microwave emission (EME), over synchrotron, free-free, and the Rayleigh-Jeans tail of the sub-millimetre (sub-mm) dust continuum. Its filamentary morphology follows roughly that of the IR poly-cyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAHs) bands. The EME signal in rhoOphW drops abruptly above ~30GHz and its spectrum can be interpreted in terms of electric-dipole radiation from spinning dust grains, or ``spinning dust''. Deep and high-fidelity imaging and spectroscopy of rhoOphW may reveal the detailed morphology of the EME signal, free from imaging priors, while also enabling a search for fine structure in its spectrum. The same observations may constrain the spectral index of the high-frequency drop. An ALMA Band1 mosaic yields a deep deconvolved image of the filament at 36-44GHz, which we use as template for the extraction of a spectrum via cross-correlation in the uv-plane. Simulations and cross-correlations on near-infrared ancillary data yield estimates of flux-loss and biases. The spectrum is a power law, with no detectable fine structure. It follows a spectral index alpha=-0.78+-0.05, in frequency, with some variations along the filament. Interestingly, the Band1 power at high spatial frequencies increases relative to that of the IR signal, with a factor of two more power in Band1 at ~20'' than at ~100'' (relative to IRAC3.6um). An extreme of such radio-only structures is a compact EME source, without IR counterpart. It is embedded in strong and filamentary Band1 signal, while the IRAC maps are smooth in the same region. We provide multi-frequency intensity estimates for spectral modelling.

- **Abstract**
 To investigate the origin of the dependence of the covering factor on the Eddington ratio suggested by X-ray observations, we examined the angular distribution of HI and HII based on two-dimensional radiative hydrodynamic simulations. To calculate the Compton-thin covering factor $C_{22}$ and Compton-thick covering factor $C_{24}$ of HI alone, we performed one-dimensional photoionization equilibrium calculations with the XSTAR code based on radiative hydrodynamic simulations. The results obtained are as follows. (1) The Compton-thin covering factor $C_{22}$ of HI and HII is independent of the Eddington ratio and is approximately $70\%$, while $C_{22}$ of HI alone is also independent of the Eddington ratio and is approximately $30\%$. (2) The Compton-thick covering factor $C_{24}$ of HI has the same value as $C_{22}$ of HI. (3) Our $C_{24}$ is consistent with that obtained from X-ray observations. (4) Our $C_{22}$ agrees with that obtained from X-ray observations in a high Eddington ratio, while our $C_{22}$ is smaller than that from X-ray observations in a low Eddington ratio. (5) To explain the difference between $C_{22}$ obtained from theoretical calculations and that inferred from X-ray observations, a Compton-thin gas is required in regions extending at least $10~\mathrm{pc}$ beyond the current computational regions.

- **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of more than 323 superfine dusty filamentary structures (fibrils) inside 121 massive star forming clumps that are located in widely different Galactic environments (Galactocentric distances of $\sim$0.5-12.7 kpc). These fibrils are identified from the 1.3~mm continuum emission in the ALMA-QUARKS survey, which has a linear resolution of $\sim900$ AU for a source at $\sim$3 kpc, using the \textit{FilFinder} software. Using \textit{RadFil} software, we find that the typical width of these fibrils is $\sim$0.01 pc, which is about ten times narrower than that of dusty filaments in nearby clouds identified by the \textit{Herschel} Space Observatory. The mass ($M$) versus length ($L$) relation for these fibrils follows $M\propto L^{2}$, similar to that of Galactic filaments identified in space (e.g., \textit{Herschel}) and ground-based single-dish (e.g., \textit{APEX}) surveys. However, these fibrils are significantly denser ($\mathrm{N_{H_2} = 10^{23}-10^{24}\ cm^{-2}}$) than the filaments found in previous \textit{Herschel} surveys ($\mathrm{N_{H_2} = 10^{20}-10^{23}\ cm^{-2}}$). This work contributes a large sample of superfine fibrils in massive clumps, following the identification of large 0.1-pc wide filaments and associated internal velocity coherent fibers in nearby molecular clouds, further emphasizing the crucial role played by filamentary structures in star formation at various physical scales.

- **Abstract**
 Solar atmospheric elemental abundances are now known to vary both in space and time. Dynamic modeling of these changes is therefore necessary to improve the accuracy of radiative hydrodynamic simulations. Recent studies have shown that including spatio-temporal variations in coronal abundances during solar flares leads to the formation of coronal condensations (rain), which are otherwise difficult to create in impulsively heated field aligned hydrodynamic flare models. These simulations start with a solar corona dominated by the first ionization potential (FIP) effect, and evaporate photospheric material into the post-flare loops. We here explore perhaps the most extreme non-solar starting condition for the coronal composition in these simulations: an initial corona dominated by the inverse FIP (iFIP) effect, such as is observed on active M-dwarf stars. We show that a flaring event in a corona enriched with high FIP elements leads to a solution similar to the solar case. Coronal rain is harder to form by this method during flares on M-dwarfs, however, if the corona is depleted of low FIP elements.

- **Abstract**
 The Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST) will perform a decade-long high-precision wide-field imaging survey that relies on rigorous on-orbit calibration. This necessitates stable celestial benchmark fields to maintain photometric and astrometric consistency throughout the mission lifetime. We establish comprehensive selection criteria including observational visibility, stellar number density, bright-star contamination, and interstellar dust extinction. Using the CSST Observation Strategy Analysis Tool (COSAT) and all-sky dust maps from Planck and SFD, we constrain eligible regions to the ranges of ecliptic latitude $ |\beta| > 50^\circ$ and galactic latitude $|b| > 15^\circ$. From an initial sample of 29 candidate clusters meeting these spatial constraints, six globular clusters (M13, M92, NGC 104, NGC 362, NGC 1261, and NGC 1851) are identified as optimal calibration fields, fulfilling all the critical criteria. These selected clusters are recommended as optimal calibration field candidates for CSST's on-orbit calibration program, and are fundamental to achieving unprecedented photometric precision in CSST's space-based survey.

          The Radius Cliff is a Waterfall: Explaining Sub-Neptune Exoplanets with Steam Worlds

- **Abstract**
 The demographics of Kepler planets provide a key testbed for models of planet formation and evolution, particularly for explaining the radius valley separating super-Earths and sub-Neptunes. A primordial interpretation based on differences in bulk densities -- where rocky and water-rich planets form via migration pathways -- offers an alternative to atmospheric loss scenarios. Updated interior structure models of water worlds with adiabatic steam atmospheres reproduce the observed valley near $\sim2~R_\oplus$ more accurately. Furthermore, migration models from our Genesis library suggest that these formation pathways can also account for the distinct period distributions of super-Earths and sub-Neptunes, as well as the emergence of the hot Neptune desert. Motivated by this, we develop a Bayesian hierarchical mixture model for close-in Kepler planets ($P<100$ days), combining rocky planets and water worlds without H/He envelopes. The inferred mass distributions of rocky and water-rich planets peak at $\sim2.6~M_\oplus$ and $\sim7~M_\oplus$, respectively, with the water mass fraction of water worlds peaking at $\sim41\%$. Water worlds provide a good representation of the Kepler sub-Neptune population, with the radius cliff emerging as a ``waterfall" -- a sharp decline in their occurrence. However, our mass-radius analysis shows that water worlds alone cannot explain planets with $R \gtrsim 3~R_\oplus$, implying that at least $\sim20\%$ of sub-Neptunes in the sample are enriched in H/He gas.

          Velocities of Free Floaters in a Sea of Stars

- **Abstract**
 We investigate the velocity evolution of free-floating planets and interstellar objects (``free floaters'') through gravitational scatterings by field stars (with the stellar mass $m$ much larger than the mass of the floater, $m_p$). We show that the equilibrium velocity -- where dynamical friction balances stochastic acceleration -- is given by $\sigma \sqrt{2\ln(m/m_p)}$ (where $\sigma$ is the velocity disperson of the field stars), diverging from the standard energy equipartition scaling. While the timescale to reach this equilibrium is prohibitively long, we find that slow floaters ($v \lesssim \sigma$) undergo mass-independent acceleration, doubling their velocities within a few relaxation times. Consequently, free floaters initially following the Maxwellian distribution of their parent stars develop distinctly non-Maxwellian velocity distributions on a relaxation timescale. Since the relaxation time of the Galactic disk is longer than the age, our results suggest that the kinematics of low-mass free floaters in the disk may preserve signatures of their parent stars and ejection history.

- **Abstract**
 The B335 protostar has undergone a major outburst detected in the scattered light of its outflow cavity that has not yet ended. B335 therefore offers the rare opportunity to study its effect on the jet of a protostellar object. Photometry of background stars behind B335 is used to map visual continuum extinction and H$_2$O ice absorption and demonstrates that the outflow has carved out a cavity. Precise proper motions of the shock fronts emerging from the B335 protostar were obtained. The kinematic age of the most prominent shock front (3E) corresponds to the early phases of the ongoing outburst of the B335 protostar. Shock 3E shows strong CO gas emission, as well as H$_2$ and [\ion{Fe}{2}] emission. Older shock fronts show diminished CO emission and are dominated by H$_2$ and [\ion{Fe}{2}]. The emission feature 0E, closest to the protostar, is distinct in proper motion and radial velocity from the other shock fronts in the jet. In the span of 4\arcsec\ closest to the protostar, the continuum extinction in front of the outflow cavity increases by A$_V$~$\approx$~200 mag. The CO-line-removed spectra close to the protostar show the unsaturated absorption features of $^{13}$CO$_2$, OCN$^-$, and OCS have strongly increasing column densities toward the protostar. The ice characteristics are overall similar to those found in lines of sight with less extinction. The central regions of the bipolar nebula show CO gas emission, but at distances of a few arcsec from the protostar, absorption by CO gas is also detected.

          Reionization Bubbles from Real-Space Cross Correlations of Line Intensity Maps

- **Abstract**
 We propose a new way to reconstruct the ionized-bubble size distribution during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) through the real-space cross-correlation of 21-cm and star-forming line-intensity maps. Understanding the evolution and timing of the EoR is crucial for both astrophysics and cosmology, and a wealth of information on the first sources can be extracted from the study of ionized bubbles. Nevertheless, directly mapping bubbles is challenging due to the high redshifts involved, possible selection biases, and foregrounds in 21-cm maps. Here, we exploit the real-space cross-correlation $\xi_{21,\nu}$ between 21-cm and line-intensity mapping (LIM) signals to reconstruct the evolution of bubble sizes during reionization. For the first time, we show that $\xi_{21,\nu}(r)$ departs from a saturation level for each separation $r$ when bubbles of size $r$ begin to form, providing a handle for the onset of bubbles of each radius. Moreover, we demonstrate that $\xi_{21,\nu}$ evolves from positive to negative as the EoR progresses, reaching a minimum (i.e. maximum anti-correlation) when bubbles of radius $r$ reach peak abundance. We show that these results are robust to changes in the astrophysical model as well as the timing/topology of reionization. This real-space observable complements usual Fourier-space estimators by capturing the localized nature of bubbles, offering new insights into the sources driving cosmic reionization.

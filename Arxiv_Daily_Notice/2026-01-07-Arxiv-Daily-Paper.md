- **Abstract**
 Physically motivated Gaussian process (GP) kernels for stellar variability, like the commonly used damped, driven simple harmonic oscillators that model stellar granulation and p-mode oscillations, quantify the instantaneous covariance between any two points. For kernels whose timescales are significantly longer than the typical exposure times, such GP kernels are sufficient. For time series where the exposure time is comparable to the kernel timescale, the observed signal represents an exposure-averaged version of the true underlying signal. This distinction is important in the context of recent data streams from Extreme Precision Radial Velocity (EPRV) spectrographs like fast readout stellar data of asteroseismology targets and solar data to monitor the Sun's variability during daytime observations. Current solar EPRV facilities have significantly different exposure times per-site, owing to the different design choices made. Consequently, each instrument traces different binned versions of the same "latent" signal. Here we present a GP framework that accounts for exposure times by computing integrated forms of the instantaneous kernels typically used. These functions allow one to predict the true latent oscillation signals and the exposure-binned version expected by each instrument. We extend the framework to work for instruments with significant time overlap (i.e., similar longitude) by including relative instrumental drift components that can be predicted and separated from the stellar variability components. We use Sun-as-a-star EPRV datasets as our primary example, but present these approaches in a generalized way for application to any dataset where exposure times are a relevant factor or combining instruments with significant overlap.

- **Abstract**
 Kinematic and spectroscopic studies in the past few years have revealed coherent azimuthal metallicity variations across the Milky Way's disk that may be the result of dynamical processes associated with non-axisymmetric features of the Galaxy. At the same time, stellar kinematics from Gaia have uncovered ridge-like features in the velocity space, raising the question of whether these chemical and dynamical substructures share a common origin. Using a sample of disk stars from Gaia DR3, we find that azimuthal metallicity variations are correlated with kinematic ridges in the V_phi-R plane, suggesting a shared origin. We utilize a suite of Milky Way test-particle simulations to assess the role of transient spiral arms, the bar, and interactions with a Sagittarius-like dwarf galaxy in simultaneously shaping both chemical and kinematic substructures. Among the physical mechanisms explored, bar and spiral arm interactions are the ones that consistently reproduce both the chemo-kinematic features and alignment observed in the Gaia data. While our model of an interaction with a Sagittarius-like dwarf galaxy can also induce kinematic and metallicity substructure, the amplitude of the azimuthal metallicity variations are too weak, suggesting this is likely not the dominant influence. Although additional contributing processes cannot be ruled out, the azimuthal metallicity variations observed in Gaia are best explained by a dynamical origin. Our results support the view that that azimuthal metallicity variations in the Galaxy are driven by similar dynamical mechanisms responsible for generating the kinematic ridges and co-moving groups.

- **Abstract**
 Many Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars have optically thick winds that cloak the hydrostatic layers of the underlying star. In these cases, traditional spectral analysis methods are plagued by degeneracies that make it difficult to constrain parameters such as the stellar radius and the deeper density and velocity structure of the atmosphere. Focussing on the regime of nitrogen-rich WN4-stars with strong emission lines, we employ hydrodynamically-consistent modelling using the PoWR-HD code branch to perform a next generation spectral analysis. The inherent coupling of the stellar and wind parameters enables us to break parameter degeneracies, constrain the wind structure, and get a mass estimate. With this information, we can draw evolutionary implications and test current mass-loss descriptions for WR stars. We selected a sample of six Galactic WN4b stars. Applying updated parallaxes from Gaia DR3 and calculating PoWR-HD models that sufficiently resemble most of their spectral appearance, we obtain new values for the stellar and wind parameters of the WN4b sample. We compare our results to previous studies employing grid models with a beta = 1 velocity structure and cross-check our derived parameters with stellar structure predictions from GENEC and FRANEC evolution tracks. For all six targets, we obtain a narrow range of stellar temperatures T~140 kK, in contrast to previous grid-model analyses. We confirm the existence of WRs with luminosities as low as log L/Lsol = 5.0 and M~5 Msol. All derived velocity fields include a plateau feature at ~85% of the terminal velocity. Both the distance updates and the switch to dynamically-consistent atmospheres lead to substantial parameter adjustments compared to earlier grid-based studies. A comparison of the derived mass-loss rates favours a different description for the WN4b sample than for WN2 stars analysed with the same methodology.

- **Abstract**
 Astronomical measurements are often integrated over finite exposures, which can obscure latent variability on comparable timescales. Correctly accounting for exposure integration with Gaussian Processes (GPs) in such scenarios is essential but computationally challenging: once exposure times vary or overlap across measurements, the covariance matrix forfeits any quasiseparability, forcing O($N^2$) memory and O($N^3$) runtime costs. Linear Gaussian state space models (SSMs) are equivalent to GPs and have well-known O($N$) solutions via the Kalman filter and RTS smoother. In this work, we extend the GP-SSM equivalence to handle integrated measurements while maintaining scalability by augmenting the SSM with an integral state that resets at exposure start times and is observed at exposure end times. This construction yields exactly the same posterior as a fully integrated GP but in O($N$) time on a CPU, and is parallelizable down to O($N/T + \log T$) on a GPU with $T$ parallel workers. We present smolgp (State space Model for O(Linear/log) GPs), an open-source Python/JAX package offering drop-in compatibiltiy with tinygp while supporting both standard and exposure-aware GP modeling. As SSMs provide a framework for representing general GP kernels via their series expansion, smolgp also brings scalable performance to many commonly used covariance kernels in astronomy that lack quasiseparability, such as the quasiperiodic kernel. The substantial performance boosts at large $N$ will enable massive multi-instrument cross-comparisons where exposure overlap is ubiquitous, and unlocks the potential for analyses with more complex models and/or higher dimensional datasets.

          Catching 3I/ATLAS Using a Solar Oberth

- **Abstract**
 The third interstellar object to be discovered, 3I/ATLAS, has a unique and continually unfolding story to tell about its nature and origin as it is monitored by telescopes on Earth, orbiting Earth and around the Solar System. Previous research into missions using chemical propulsion have only really addressed the direct case, where the opportunity to launch already expired before 3I/ATLAS's discovery. In contrast, investigations herein exploit 'Optimum Interplanetary Trajectory Software' to simulate an alternative indirect option for chemical propulsion, namely the Solar Oberth Manoeuvre (SOM). For a SOM, a low perihelion burn provides maximum benefit from the Oberth Effect, and accelerates the spacecraft rapidly towards the receding 3I/ATLAS. Though in principle feasible, results indicate this option presents significant challenges. For possible launch years between 2031 and 2037 inclusive, a 2035 launch permits the most efficient transfer to 3I/ATLAS. The reference mission requires a SOM at 3.2 Solar Radii from the Sun's centre, with an intercept after 35-50 years. It is found the SOM can leverage spacecraft masses up to $\sim{500}$ kg. Two or three solid propellant boosters could deliver the required SOM $\Delta$V, and furthermore a refuelled Starship Block 3 in LEO has sufficient performance for such a mission. As inevitable with a SOM, some of the payload mass would be needed for a heat shield to protect against the high solar flux at low perihelion.

- **Abstract**
 Pebble drift is an important mechanism for supplying the materials needed to build planets in the inner region of protoplanetary disks. Thus, constraining pebble drift's timescales and mass flux is essential to understanding planet formation history. Current pebble drift models suggest pebble fluxes can be constrained from the enhancement of gaseous volatile abundances when icy pebbles sublimate after drifting across key snowlines. In this work, we present ALMA observations of spatially resolved $^{13}$C$^{18}$O J=2-1 line emission inside the midplane CO snowline of the HD 163296 and MWC 480 protoplanetary disks. We use radiative transfer and thermochemical models to constrain the spatial distribution of CO gas column density. We find that both disks display centrally peaked CO abundance enhancement of up to ten times of ISM abundance levels. For HD 163296 and MWC 480, the inferred enhancements require 250-350 and 480-660 Earth Masses of pebbles to have drifted across their CO snowlines, respectively. These ranges fall within cumulative pebble mass flux ranges to grow gas giants in the interior to the CO snowline. The centrally peaked CO enhancement is unexpected in current pebble drift models, which predict CO enhancement peaks at the CO snowline or is uniform inside the snowline. We propose two hypotheses to explain the centrally-peaked CO enhancement, including a large CO desorption distance and CO trapped in water ice. By testing both hypotheses with the 1D gas and dust evolution code chemcomp, we find that volatile trapping (about 30\%) best reproduces the centrally peaked CO enhancement observed.

- **Abstract**
 The Lazuli Space Observatory is a 3-meter aperture astronomical facility designed for rapid-response observations and precision astrophysics across visible to near-infrared wavelengths (400-1700 nm bandpass). An off-axis, freeform telescope delivers diffraction-limited image quality (Strehl $>$0.8 at 633 nm) to three instruments across a wide, flat focal plane. The three instruments provide complementary capabilities: a Wide-field Context Camera (WCC) delivers multi-band imaging over a 35' $\times$ 12' footprint with high-cadence photometry; an Integral Field Spectrograph (IFS) provides continuous 400-1700 nm spectroscopy at R $\sim$ 100-500 for stable spectrophotometry; and an ExtraSolar Coronagraph (ESC) enables high-contrast imaging expected to reach raw contrasts of $10^{-8}$ and post-processed contrasts approaching $10^{-9}$. Operating from a 3:1 lunar-resonant orbit, Lazuli will respond to targets of opportunity in under four hours--a programmatic requirement designed to enable routine temporal responsiveness that is unprecedented for a space telescope of this size. Lazuli's technical capabilities are shaped around three broad science areas: (1) time-domain and multi-messenger astronomy, (2) stars and planets, and (3) cosmology. These capabilities enable a potent mix of science spanning gravitational wave counterpart characterization, fast-evolving transients, Type Ia supernova cosmology, high-contrast exoplanet imaging, and spectroscopy of exoplanet atmospheres. While these areas guide the observatory design, Lazuli is conceived as a general-purpose facility capable of supporting a wide range of astrophysical investigations, with open time for the global community. We describe the observatory architecture and capabilities in the preliminary design phase, with science operations anticipated following a rapid development cycle from concept to launch.

          Isotopic Ratios in the Disk of HD 163296

- **Abstract**
 Isotopic abundance ratios in protoplanetary disks are critical for understanding volatile inheritance and chemical evolution in planet-forming environments. We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations of the rare isotopologue 13C18O(2-1) at approximately 0.3 arcsec resolution from the disk around the Herbig Ae star HD 163296, combined with archival observations of C17O(2-1), C18O(1-0), and C17O(1-0), to empirically constrain carbon and oxygen isotopic ratios without detailed disk modeling. Both the C17O/13C18O(2-1) and C18O/C17O(1-0) flux ratios rise sharply across the CO snowline and flatten beyond 1.5 arcsec (r >= 150 au), where the emission becomes optically thin. This transition, reflecting a steep drop in CO column density set by the disk's thermal structure, makes HD 163296 an optimal case for isotopic analysis. Using beam-averaged intensities of the four transitions measured in this optically thin region, we derive isotopic ratios of 12C/13C = 75.3 (+14.7/-11.4) and 18O/17O = 3.28 (+0.31/-0.26), both consistent with local interstellar medium values. The 16O/18O ratio remains weakly constrained due to moderate optical depth in the C18O(1-0) line and degeneracy with CO column density. These results demonstrate that rare CO isotopologues can provide robust, empirical constraints on isotopic ratios in disks when sharp structural transitions allow for the identification of optically thin regions, and establish HD 163296 as a benchmark for extending such studies to other systems with resolved snowline structures.

- **Abstract**
 Stellar photospheric heterogeneities (e.g., starspots, faculae) distort the stellar spectrum in transit and imprint wavelength-dependent biases on the planet-to-star radius ratio (Transit Light Source Effect, TLSE). The Rackham-TLSE (R-TLSE) prescription applies a disc-averaged correction based solely on filling factor and spectral contrast, but transmission spectroscopy also depends on limb darkening, active-region distribution, and transit geometry. We include these in a pixel-resolved framework, ECLIPSE-Xlambda, and run idealised noise-free model-model comparisons to R-TLSE. For LHS 1140 b, K2-18 b, and WASP-69 b, disc-averaged corrections differ from the pixel model by up to about 400 ppm in the optical for active hosts and non-equatorial transits, but stay below about 10 ppm in the near-infrared where limb darkening is weak. We then apply both approaches to the JWST/NIRISS SOSS spectrum of LHS 1140 b. With limb darkening set to zero, ECLIPSE-Xlambda recovers stellar-contamination parameters matching the reference R-TLSE solution, confirming consistency in the disc-averaged limit. With wavelength-dependent limb darkening, reproducing the short-wavelength slope via stellar contamination alone requires hot faculae (delta Tfac about 600 K; ffac about 0.35), equivalent to a circular facular region of radius about 0.6 Rstar (about 60% of the stellar radius) on the disc; such an extended unocculted region is physically unlikely even for an active M dwarf. Purely stellar contamination would therefore require extreme faculae, whereas a genuine atmospheric contribution complementing a more modest facular signal is more plausible. These results delineate the validity regime of R-TLSE and underscore the need for geometry-aware stellar-heterogeneity models including limb darkening in high-precision transmission spectroscopy.

- **Abstract**
 Cosmic dust plays a vital role in stellar and galactic formation and evolution, but its three-dimensional structure in the Milky Way has remained unclear due to insufficient precise reddening and distance measurements. Although early studies typically adopted a single-disk model, we detect two distinct components at Galactocentric distances of 5-14 kpc, enabled by photometric, spectroscopic, and astrometric measurements of over 5 million stars. The thin dust disk's scale height increases radially from 60 to 200 pc, while the thick disk grows from 300 to 800 pc. For the first time, we find the thin and thick dust disk correlates spatially with molecular and atomic hydrogen disk, respectively. The thin, thick, and combined disks have scale lengths of 9.6+1.2-1.1 kpc, 4.2+0.4-0.3 kpc, and 6.6+0.3-0.3 kpc, respectively. The gas-to-dust ratio shows an exponential radial gradient, increasing from around 60 at 5 kpc to around 470 at 14 kpc. These findings provide new insights into dust morphology in the Galaxy and raise fundamental questions that require further investigation.

- **Abstract**
 We present high-resolution near-infrared spectroscopic observations of the newly identified supernova remnant (SNR) candidate G25.8+0.2 obtained with the Immersion Grating Infrared Spectrograph (IGRINS) on the Harlan J. Smith Telescope. The source was originally discovered in the UKIRT Wide-field Infrared Survey for Fe+ (UWIFE; Lee et al. 2014). Our spectra reveal multiple kinematic components in the [Fe II] 1.644 um emission. The high-velocity components exhibit elevated [Fe II]/Br gamma ratios characteristic of shock excitation, while the low-velocity components are dominated by hydrogen and helium recombination lines and are consistent with photoionized gas, indicating an H II-region origin. G25.8+0.2 lies within the G26 complex, a large (~15'x 30', corresponding to ~28 pc x 57 pc at a distance of 6.5 kpc) star-forming region in the inner Galaxy. The shock-excited [Fe II] filaments closely trace the morphology of the bright radio shell that partially encloses centrally filled soft X-ray emission, strongly suggesting recent supernova activity in this region. We discuss the physical nature of G25.8+0.2 and its relationship to the surrounding G26 star-forming complex. In addition, we derive the extinction toward the source using Brackett-line ratios and constrain the spectral types of the dominant ionizing stars from the He I 2.058 um/Br gamma line ratios.

- **Abstract**
 We developed a SpaceWire-based data acquisition (DAQ) system for the FOXSI-4 and FOXSI-5 sounding rocket experiments, which aim to observe solar flares with high sensitivity and dynamic range using direct X-ray focusing optics. The FOXSI-4 mission, launched on April 17, 2024, achieved the first direct focusing observation of a GOES M1.6 class solar flare with imaging spectroscopy capabilities in the soft and hard X-ray energy ranges, using a suite of advanced detectors, including two CMOS sensors, four CdTe double-sided strip detectors (CdTe-DSDs), and a Quad-Timepix3 detector. To accommodate the high photon flux from a solar flare and these diverse detector types, a modular DAQ network architecture was implemented based on SpaceWire and the Remote Memory Access Protocol (RMAP). This modular architecture enabled fast, reliable, and scalable communication among various onboard components, including detectors, readout boards, onboard computers, and telemetry systems. In addition, by standardizing the communication interface and modularizing each detector unit and its associated electronics, the architecture also supported distributed development among collaborating institutions, simplifying integration and reducing overall complexity. To realize this architecture, we developed FPGA-based readout boards (SPMU-001 and SPMU-002) that support SpaceWire communication for high-speed data transfer and flexible instrument control. In addition, a real-time ground support system was developed to handle telemetry and command operations during flight, enabling live monitoring and adaptive configuration of onboard instruments in response to the properties of the observed solar flare. The same architecture is being adopted for the upcoming FOXSI-5 mission, scheduled for launch in 2026.

- **Abstract**
 Procyon A is an F-type main-sequence star in a binary system. It has been the subject of numerous ground-based and space-based observing campaigns, providing precise classical constraints, including a well-determined mass. It was also among the first stars in which individual frequencies were detected, making it a crucial benchmark for F-type stars. Our goal is to investigate the surface effect, namely the discrepancy between observed and model oscillation frequencies due to inadequate modeling of the surface stellar layers, especially important in F-type stars. Using Procyon A as a case study, we aim to understand how different surface correction prescriptions impact the inference of the fundamental properties of this star, and compare the results with those obtained when the surface corrections are neglected. We inferred the fundamental stellar properties employing a grid of models computed with MESA, including gravitational settling, radiative accelerations, and turbulent mixing. We selected the best-fit models using the AIMS code taking into account different methods to fit the individual frequencies. We find that the use of surface corrections can introduce uncertainties up to 7\% in the inferred stellar mass. We identify that the most reliable stellar mass estimates are obtained when using frequency ratios, the Sonoi et al. (2015) surface correction or directly fitting the individual frequencies. Our results indicate that the surface effects in F-type stars differ from those found in the Sun and in solar-like stars, highlighting the need to be careful when considering the surface corrections for these stars.

- **Abstract**
 Accurately measuring stellar ages and internal structures is challenging, but the inclusion of asteroseismic observables can substantially improve precision. However, the curse of dimensionality means this comes at a high computational cost when using standard interpolation methods across grids of stellar models. Furthermore, without a rigorous treatment of random uncertainties in grid-based modelling, it is not possible to address systematic errors in stellar models. We present PITCHFORK -- a multilayer perceptron neural network with a branching architecture capable of rapid emulation of both classical stellar observables and individual asteroseismic oscillation modes of solar-like oscillators. PITCHFORK can predict the classical observables $T_{\text{eff}}$, $L$, and $\left[\mathrm{Fe}/\mathrm{H}\right]$ with precisions of $5.88\,\text{K}$, $0.014\,\text{L}_{\odot}$, and $0.001\,\text{dex}$, respectively, and can predict 35 individual radial mode frequencies with a uniform precision of $0.02$ per cent. PITCHFORK is coupled to a vectorised Bayesian inference pipeline to return well-sampled and fully marginalised posterior distributions. We validate our rigorous treatment of the random uncertainties -- including the asteroseismic surface effect -- in an extensive hare-and-hounds exercise. We also demonstrate our ability to infer the stellar properties of benchmark stars -- namely, the Sun and the binary stars 16 Cygni A and B. This work demonstrates a computationally scalable and statistically robust framework for stellar parameter inference of solar-like oscillators using individual asteroseismic mode frequencies. This provides a foundation for the treatment of systematics in preparation for the imminent abundance of asteroseismic data from future missions.

- **Abstract**
 OBA hypergiants (OBAHGs) are evolved massive stars with notable wind features in their optical spectrum. Positioned at the cool edge of the line-driven wind regime, many are candidate luminous blue variables (LBVs) likely near the Eddington Limit. Although brief, this evolutionary stage deeply impacts their surroundings and subsequent evolution. We study the mechanisms behind OBAHG winds and spectra, covering the temperature range of non-eruptive LBVs. Using the PoWR atmosphere code, we compute models with an Eddington parameter Gamma_e ~ 0.4 and moderate turbulent pressure, typical for cool hypergiants, varying the effective temperature from ~12.5 to ~38.0 kK at solar metallicity. Our models show a complex temperature-dependent mass-loss pattern, with regions of higher/lower rates linked to two wind solutions: "dense" and "airy." Spectra of known OBAHGs and LBVs match models from all solution regions. We find bi-stability jumps -- with sharp mass-loss increases -- at temperatures where Fe IV recombines to Fe III (and Fe III to Fe II). "Drops" in mass-loss also occur when the leading Fe ion changes at wind onset, signaling a switch to airy solutions under insufficient driving opacity. The resulting velocity fields also reflect these different regimes: airy solutions match the empirical terminal velocity vs temperature relation, while dense ones deviate. Turbulent pressure is crucial for wind acceleration at cooler temperatures, especially in airy regimes. We demonstrate that the bi-stability jumps exist in OBAHGs but are part of a broader complex behavior not replicated by current mass-loss recipes. Combining our and other recent results, we suggest that the switch between airy and dense solutions only occurs within a certain proximity to the Eddington Limit. Testing this requires future models with broader parameters and advanced treatments of radiatively-driven turbulence.

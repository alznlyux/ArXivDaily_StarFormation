          CLARA: A Modular Framework for Unsupervised Transit Detection Using TESS Light Curves

 - **Abstract**
 We present CLARA, a modular framework for unsupervised transit detection in TESS light curves, leveraging Unsupervised Random Forests (URFs) trained on synthetic datasets and guided by morphological similarity analysis. This work addresses two core questions: (a) How does the design of synthetic training sets affect the performance and generalization of URFs across independent TESS sectors? (b) Do URF anomaly scores correlate with genuine astrophysical phenomena, enabling effective identification and clustering of transit-like signals? We investigate these questions through a two-part study focused on (1) detection performance optimization, and (2) the physical interpretability of anomalies. In Part I, we introduce three URF model variants tuned via alpha-controlled scoring objectives, and evaluate their generalization across five TESS sectors. This large-scale test involved scoring 384,000 individual light curves (128,000 light curves per alpha variant), revealing stable, interpretable differences between recall-optimized, precision-optimized, and balanced models. In Part II, our optimized clustering (DPMM Cluster 2) yields a 14.04% detection rate (16 confirmed transits among 114 candidates) from the first five TESS SPOC sectors. This reflects a substantial enrichment over baseline rates: 0.4569% for the full TESS-SPOC project candidate set (7658 candidates across 1.68 million light curves), and 0.2650% for the FFI-based SPOC sample (7658 candidates across 2.89 million light curves;). All computations were performed on a personal, CPU-only desktop with an Intel Core i3-8100 processor and 32 GB RAM, using parallelized scoring and classification routines across four physical cores. CLARA processed over 87,000 TESS SPOC light curves (Sectors 1-5) without GPU acceleration in Part-II.

 - **Abstract**
 Investigating chemically peculiar pulsating stars is crucial for understanding the pulsation driving mechanism in detail. To reveal the true peculiarity properties of stars detailed spectroscopic analysis is essential. Therefore, in this study, we focused on Delta Scuti stars previously identified as chemically peculiar but needed comprehensive updated spectroscopic analysis to uncover the chemical abundance structure of them. We selected ten targets which have public high-resolution spectroscopic and photometric data. Performing spectral analyses, we determined the spectral classification, atmospheric parameters, and detailed chemical abundance distributions of the selected stars. The pulsation properties were also analyzed using TESS data and pulsation modes for the highest amplitude pulsation frequencies were derived. We estimated the masses and ages of the targets using the evolutionary tracks and isochrones. As a result of the study, we show that only three targets exhibit chemical peculiarity: AU Scl and FG Eri as metallic A (Am) stars, and HZ Vel as a $\lambda$ Bootis. However, others were found to be chemically normal stars. This study show us the importance of chemical abundance analysis in the classification of chemical peculiar stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Prestellar cores represent early sites of low-mass ($M$ $\leq$ few M$_\odot$) star and planet formation and provide insight into initial chemical conditions of complex organic molecules (COMs). Deuterated COMs trace the degree of molecular inheritance and/or reprocessing, as high deuteration in protostellar systems suggests COMs forming during the prestellar stage when deuteration is enhanced. Within the L1689N molecular cloud, the prestellar core IRAS 16293E sits $90^{"}$ eastward of the chemically-rich IRAS 16293-2422 A and B protostellar system. A unique view of star formation inside a common natal cloud, IRAS 16293A, B, and E all show some of the highest levels of deuteration in the ISM, with a number of D/H ratios $10^{5}$ times higher than Solar. We investigate for the first time the deuteration levels of the simplest COM, methanol (CH$_3$OH), in IRAS 16293E. Using the Arizona Radio Observatory (ARO) 12 m telescope, we target favorable transitions of CH$_2$DOH, CHD$_2$OH, $^{13}$CH$_3$OH, and several higher complexity COMs (including acetaldehyde, CH$_3$CHO, methyl formate, HCOOCH$_3$, and dimethyl ether, CH$_3$OCH$_3$) in the 3 mm band. Follow-up observations with the Yebes 40 m telescope provided additional transitions in the 7 mm (Q-band). We report the first detections of these COMs and deuterated methanol in prestellar core IRAS 16293E and use our observations to calculate excitation temperatures, column densities, and relative abundance ratios. Striking similarities are found between relative molecular ratios and D/H values when comparing IRAS 16293E to the A and B protostars, as well as to a heterogeneous sample of other prestellar cores, protostars, and the comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. Our results support the idea that there is a limited amount of chemical reprocessing of COMs when prestellar cores collapse and heat-up during the protostellar phase.

          Effective Field Theory Constraints on Primordial Black Holes from the High-Redshift Lyman-$α$ Forest

 - **Abstract**
 We present updated constraints on the abundance of primordial black holes (PBHs) dark matter from the high-redshift Lyman-$\alpha$ forest data from MIKE/HIRES experiments. Our analysis leverages an effective field theory (EFT) description of the 1D flux power spectrum, allowing us to analytically predict the Lyman-$\alpha$ fluctuations on quasi-linear scales from first principles. Our EFT-based likelihood enables robust inference across redshifts $z = 4.2-5.4$ and down to scales of 100 kpc, within previously unexplored regions of parameter space for this dataset. We derive new bounds on the PBH fraction with respect to the total dark matter $f_{\text{PBH}}$, excluding populations with $f_{\text{PBH}} \gtrsim 10^{-3}$ for masses $M_{\text{PBH}} \sim 10^{4}-10^{16} M_{\odot}$. This offers the leading constraint for PBHs heavier than $10^{9} M_{\odot}$ and highlights the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest as a uniquely sensitive probe of new physics models that modify the structure formation history of our universe.

 - **Abstract**
 Leveraging the large sample size of low-resolution spectroscopic surveys to constrain white dwarf stellar structure requires an accurate understanding of the shapes of hydrogen absorption lines, which are pressure broadened by the Stark effect. Using data from both the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the Type Ia Supernova Progenitor Survey, we show that substantial biases (5-15 km/s) exist in radial velocity measurements made from observations at low spectral resolution relative to similar measurements from high-resolution spectra. Our results indicate that the physics of line formation in high-density plasmas, especially in the wings of the lines, are not fully accounted for in state-of-the-art white dwarf model atmospheres. We provide corrections to account for these resolution-induced redshifts in a way that is independent of an assumed mass-radius relation, and we demonstrate that statistical measurements of gravitational redshift with these corrections yield improved agreement with theoretical mass-radius relations. Our results provide a set of best practices for white dwarf radial velocity measurements from low-resolution spectroscopy, including those from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument, the 4-meter Multi-Object Spectroscopic Telescope, and the Wide-Field Multiplexed Spectroscopic Facility.

 - **Abstract**
 Modelling perturbations of the Milky Way (MW) halo induced by the infall of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) offers new avenues to constrain the dark matter (DM) distribution in our Galaxy. A key observable is the reflex motion of the MW disc with respect to the halo induced by the LMC's infall, which imprints a velocity dipole on kinematics of halo stars. Here we investigate how the dipole varies with Galactocentric radius, and study the sensitivity of the reflex motion signal to different DM outer-halo profiles. Using a suite of basis function expansion (BFE) simulations with truncated NFW profiles ($\rho \propto r^{-\beta}$ beyond $r=50$ kpc), our $N$-body models show that (i) The reflex motion amplitude varies with Galactocentric radius but is largely insensitive to the outer DM slope, implying that the MW-LMC mass ratio alone does not set the dipole strength. (ii) In contrast, the direction of the disc motion is very sensitive to the density distribution of the outer DM halo. (iii) The contraction of the MW halo induced by the LMC's gravitational pull also depends strongly on the outer DM halo profile. (iv) We find a halo instability whose oscillation frequency increases with $\beta$ producing a potentially observable signature - a sinusoidal pattern of the mean radial velocity of halo stars. Finally, using BFE coefficients we find that steeper truncations produce smaller dipole distortions, while amplifying the quadrupole distortion. These results highlight the limited constraining power of the reflex motion amplitude alone for outer MW profile parameters.

 - **Abstract**
 The nature of Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) progenitor systems and the mechanisms that lead up to their explosions are still widely debated. In rare cases the SN ejecta interact with circumstellar material (CSM) that was ejected from the progenitor system prior to the SN. The unknown distance between the CSM and SN explosion site makes it impossible to predict when the interaction will start. If the time between the SN and start of CSM interaction is of the order of months to years the SN has generally faded and is not actively followed up anymore, making it even more difficult to detect the interaction while it happens. Here we report on a real-time monitoring program which ran between 13-11-2023 and 09-07-2024, monitoring 6914 SNe Ia for signs of late-time rebrightening using the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). Flagged candidates were rapidly followed up with photometry and spectroscopy to confirm the late-time excess and its position. We report the discovery of a $\sim50$ day rebrightening event in SN 2020qxz around 1200 days after the peak of its light curve. SN 2020qxz had signs of early CSM interaction but faded from view over 2 years before its reappearance. Follow-up spectroscopy revealed 4 emission lines that faded shortly after the end of the ZTF detected rebrightening. Our best match for these emission lines are H$\beta$ (blue shifted by $\sim5900$ km s$^{-1}$) and CaII$_{\lambda8542}$, NI$_{\lambda8567}$, and KI$_{\lambda\lambda 8763, 8767}$, all blue shifted by 5100 km s$^{-1}$ (although we note that these identifications are uncertain). This shows that catching and following up on late-time interactions as they occur can give new clues about the nature of the progenitor systems that produce these SNe by putting constraints on the possible type of donor star, and the only way to do this systematically is to use large sky surveys such as ZTF to monitor a large sample of objects.

 - **Abstract**
 Extended X-ray emission observed in the direction of several molecular clouds in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of our Galaxy exhibits spectral and temporal properties consistent with the `X-ray echo' scenario. It postulates that the observed signal is a light-travel-time delayed reflection of a short ($\delta t<$1.5 yr) and bright ($L_{\rm X}>10^{39}~{\rm erg~s^{-1}}$) flare, most probably produced a few hundred years ago by Sgr A*. This scenario also predicts a distinct polarization signature for the reflected X-ray continuum, with the polarization vector being perpendicular to the direction towards the primary source and polarization degree (PD) being determined by the scattering angle. We report the results of two deep observations of the currently brightest (in reflected emission) molecular complex Sgr A taken with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) in 2022 and 2023. We confirm the previous polarization measurement for a large region encompassing Sgr A complex with higher significance, but also reveal an inconsistent polarization pattern for the brightest reflection region in its center. X-ray polarization from this region is almost perpendicular to the expected direction in the case of Sgr A* illumination and shows a smaller PD compared to the large region. This could indicate the simultaneous propagation of several illumination fronts throughout the CMZ, with the origin of one of them not being Sgr A*. The primary source could be associated with the Arches stellar cluster or a currently unknown source located in the closer vicinity of the illuminated cloud, potentially lowering the required luminosity of the primary source. Although significantly deeper observations with IXPE would be required to unequivocally distinguish between the scenarios, a combination of high-resolution imaging and micro-calorimetric spectroscopy offers an additional promising path forward.

          Leading & Trailing Spiral Arms in a Nearly Broken Protoplanetary Disc

 - **Abstract**
 We perform three-dimensional smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations to investigate the formation of spiral arms in misaligned circumbinary discs. In a nearly broken disc the misaligned inner and outer discs interact at two nodes, launching leading spiral arms that do not rotate with the disc. These spirals vanish when the disc is fully broken or aligned. Our results show that the formation of leading spirals is driven by the relative misalignment of the inner and outer disc, and does not depend on the disc physics. With live radiative transfer, the shadows cast by the misaligned inner disc are also able to launch trailing spiral arms that only appear at high misalignments when the discs are disconnected. When the disc is strongly misaligned, leading and trailing spiral arms can both appear and interact with each other. At lower misalignments, the impact of shadows is negligible and leading spiral arms are seen instead. The presence of both leading and trailing spiral arms implies that the rotation of the disc cannot be assumed based on the orientation of the spiral arms alone. Unlike spirals formed by gravitational instability, the spirals in this work can also form in low-mass, gravitationally stable discs.

 - **Abstract**
 Standard Bayesian retrievals for exoplanet atmospheric parameters from transmission spectroscopy, while well understood and widely used, are generally computationally expensive. In the era of the JWST and other upcoming observatories, machine learning approaches have emerged as viable alternatives that are both efficient and robust. In this paper we present a systematic study of several existing machine learning regression techniques and compare their performance for retrieving exoplanet atmospheric parameters from transmission spectra. We benchmark the performance of the different algorithms on the accuracy, precision, and speed. The regression methods tested here include partial least squares (PLS), support vector machines (SVM), k nearest neighbors (KNN), decision trees (DT), random forests (RF), voting (VOTE), stacking (STACK), and extreme gradient boosting (XGB). We also investigate the impact of different preprocessing methods of the training data on the model performance. We quantify the model uncertainties across the entire dynamical range of planetary parameters. The best performing combination of ML model and preprocessing scheme is validated on a the case study of JWST observation of WASP-39b.

 - **Abstract**
 This study presents optical and near-infrared photometric observations, alongside mid-infrared spectroscopic data from the ISO SWS instrument, to examine potential correlations between Aromatic Infrared Band (AIB) features and the optical properties of carbon-rich evolved stars. Identifying such correlations can provide valuable constraints on the evolutionary pathways of low- to intermediate-mass stars beyond the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase. Photometric measurements in the U, B, V, R, I, J, H, K, and L bands were obtained for five well-known carbon-rich objects at various post-AGB or planetary nebula (PN) stages: CRL 2688, PN M 2-43, NGC 7027, BD${+}$30${^\circ}$3639, and AFGL 2132. Our analysis reveals that all five objects exhibit prominent AIB features; however, their spectral profiles show notable variation. These differences are attributed to variations in the chemical composition and physical conditions of the surrounding circumstellar material. In particular, the 3.28$\mu$m polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) feature is detected in all objects except AFGL 2132, indicating a potentially distinct PAH population or environmental condition in its vicinity. Although these sources share broadly similar evolutionary stages, the observed diversity in AIB characteristics underscores the complexity and heterogeneity of their circumstellar environments.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the deep atmospheric composition of Jupiter provides critical constraints on its formation and the chemical evolution of the solar nebula. In this study, we combine one-dimensional thermochemical kinetic-transport modeling with two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations to constrain Jupiter's deep oxygen abundance using carbon monoxide (CO) as a proxy tracer. Leveraging a comprehensive chemical network generated by Reaction Mechanism Generator (RMG), we assess the impact of updated reaction rates, including the often-neglected but thermochemically significant Hidaka reaction (CH3OH + H -> CH3 + H2O). Our 1D-2D coupled approach supports a modest supersolar oxygen enrichment of 1.0-1.5x the solar value. We also present a method for deriving Jupiter's eddy diffusion coefficient Kzz = 3e6 to 5e7 cm2/s) from 2D hydrodynamic simulations using the quasi steady-state approach. This method is applicable to exoplanet atmospheres, where Kzz remains highly uncertain despite its strong influence on atmospheric chemistry. Finally, our results imply a significantly elevated planetary carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratio of ~2.9, highlighting the importance of clarifying the mechanisms behind the preferential accretion of carbon-rich material during Jupiter's formation. By integrating thermochemical and hydrodynamic processes, our study offers a more complete framework for constraining chemical and dynamical processes in (exo)planetary atmospheres.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding demographic properties of planet populations and multiple star systems constrains theories of planet and star formation. Surveys for very low-mass companions to M-A type stars detect brown dwarfs from multiple star formation and planets from circumstellar disks. We fit a composite model describing both very low-mass brown dwarf companions from "multiple-like processes" and gas giants from "planet-like processes" as functions of orbital separation and host star mass. We assemble a database of companion frequency estimates for masses from $< 1$ to $> 75$ Jupiter masses, separations from $< 0.3$ to $> 300$ AU, and host masses from $< 0.3$ to $> 2 M_{\odot}$. Using multinest, we fit these data to various models, performing model selection and deriving probability density functions. We assume companion mass ratio distributions are independent of orbital separation and fit a common log-normal orbital distribution to gas giant populations around M dwarfs, FGK, and A stars. A six-parameter model based on companion mass ratio distributions for planets and brown dwarfs is preferred. The planet CMRD slope is consistent with previous studies ($dN/dq \sim q^{-1.3} \pm 0.03$). Gas giant planets around stars from $< 0.3$ to $> 2.0 M_{\odot}$ follow a log-normal distribution peaking at ln(a) = 1.30 $\pm$ 0.03 (3.8 AU) with dispersion 0.22 $\pm$ 0.04. M dwarf distributions peak at smaller orbital radii than A stars, consistent with iceline considerations. Brown dwarf companion distributions extend stellar binary patterns, with the brown dwarf desert explained by flat-in-q mass functions and limited mass ratios below 0.1.

 Context. Recent JWST observations have shown that brown dwarfs (BD) are chemically rich, offering valuable insights into giant planet formation. Aims. As part of the MIRI mid-INfrared Disk Survey (MINDS) JWST guaranteed time program, we aim to characterize the gas and dust composition of the disk around the brown dwarf [NC98] Cha HA 1, hereafter Cha H$\alpha$ 1, in the mid-infrared. Methods. We obtain data from the MIRI Medium Resolution Spectrometer (MRS) from 4.9 to 28$\mu$m. We use the dust fitting tool DuCK to investigate the dust composition and grain sizes while we identify and fit molecular emission using slab models. Results. Compared with disks around very low mass stars, clear silicate emission features are seen in this BD disk. In addition, JWST reveals a plethora of hydrocarbons, including C$_2$H$_2$, $^{13}$CCH$_2$, CH$_3$, CH$_4$, C$_2$H$_4$, C$_4$H$_2$, C$_3$H$_4$, C$_2$H$_6$, and C$_6$H$_6$ which suggest a disk with a gas C/O > 1. Additionally, we detect CO$_2$, $^{13}$CO$_2$, HCN, H$_2$, and H$_2$O. CO and OH are absent from the spectrum. The dust is dominated by large $\sim$4 $\mu$m size amorphous silicates (MgSiO$_3$). We infer a small dust mass fraction ($>$10$\%$) of 5 $\mu$m size crystalline forsterite. We do not detect polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Conclusions. Cha H$\alpha$ 1 shows the most diverse chemistry seen to date in a BD protoplanetary disk, consisting of a strong dust feature, 12 carbon-bearing molecules plus H$_2$, and water. The diverse molecular environment offers a unique opportunity to test our understanding of BD disks chemistry and how it affects the possible planets forming in them.

 - **Abstract**
 Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are among the most mysterious astronomical transients. Due to their short durations and cosmological distances, their dispersion measure (DM) - redshift ($z$) relation is useful for constraining cosmological parameters and detecting the baryons in the Universe. The increasing number of localized FRBs in recent years has provided more precise constraints on these parameters. In this project, we collect 117 of the latest, localized FRBs, discuss the effect of a more accurate $\sigma_{\rm diff}$ in the probability density function ($p_{\rm diff}$) for ${\rm DM}_{\rm diff}$, and rewrite their likelihood convolution to better constrain the parameters above. We find that the widely used approximation $\sigma_{\rm diff} \sim F/\sqrt{z}$ only works under contrived assumptions. In general, one should use an accurate method to derive this parameter from $p_{\rm diff}$. Our method yields a constraint of $H_0\Omega_b f_{\rm diff} = 2.812_{-0.258}^{+0.250}$ or $H_0 = 66.889_{-5.460}^{+6.754}$ when combining the FRB data with CMB measurements and taking $f_{\rm diff} = 0.84$. This fully analytical correction helps us to better constrain cosmological parameters with the increasing number of localized FRBs available today.

 - **Abstract**
 Anisotropic cosmological models have been gaining attention due to various observational hints of large-scale anisotropies. One of the most surprising evidences for the latter is the discovery of a dipole-like directional variation in cosmological parameters extracted from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data. In this work, we show that the directional variation of the CMB angular acoustic angle calculated with the fully asymmetric Bianchi Type I metric, a simple extension of the standard Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker metric, cannot account for the observed dipole-like anisotropy.

 Context. Simulating stellar dynamics in a molecular cloud environment is numerically challenging due to the strong coupling between young stars and their surrounding gas, and the large range of length and time scales. Aims. This paper is the first of a suite aimed at investigating the complex early stellar dynamics in star-forming regions. We present a new simulation framework which is the key to generating a larger set of simulations, enabling statistical analysis. Methods. Methods originating from the stellar dynamics community, including regularisation and slowdown methods (SDAR), have been added to the hydrodynamical code Phantom to produce simulations of embedded cluster early dynamics. This is completed by a novel prescription of star formation to initialise stars with a low numerical cost, but in a way that is consistent with the gas distribution. Finally, a prescription for H ii region expansion has been added to model the gas removal. Results. We have run testcase simulations following the dynamical evolution of stellar clusters from the cloud collapse to a few Myr. Our new numerical methods fulfil their function by speeding up the calculation. The N-body dynamics with our novel implementation never appear as a bottleneck. Our first simulations show that massive stars largely impact the star formation process and shape the dynamics of the resulting cluster. Depending on the position of these massive stars and the strength of their feedback, they can prematurely dismantle part of the cloud or trigger a second event of cloud collapse, preferentially forming low-mass stars. This stochastic behaviour confirms the need for statistical studies. Conclusions. Our new Phantom N-Body framework enables efficient simulation of the formation and evolution of star clusters. It enables the statistical analysis needed to build models of the dynamical evolution of embedded star clusters.

          Constraints on transition redshift utilizing the latest H(z) measurements and comments on the Hubble tension

 - **Abstract**
 The motivation of this paper is to obtain reliable constraints of transition redshift ($z_{ztr}$) and, in combination with the evolution of the Hubble constant ($H_{0}$) that could alleviate the Hubble tension, discuss the possible origin of the tension. Utilizing the latest H(z) measurements and different methods ($\Lambda$CDM model, Cosmography, and Gaussian process method), we investigated the impact of methodology and dataset on $z_{ztr}$ constraints, and find that the choice of method has a greater impact on $z_{tr}$ than the observations themselves. Through a statistical analysis of the $z_{ztr}$ constraints from 2004 to 2024, we find that total $z_{tr}$ constraints (2004$-$2024) can be well described by a Gaussian function with the mean value 0.65 and the standard deviation 0.16; that is, $\bar{z}_{tr}$(all) = 0.65 $\pm$ 0.16. And we confirmed that both dataset and methodology can indeed significantly affect the final constraints. The screened $z_{tr}$ constraints with free $H_{0}$ gives a new result $\bar{z}_{tr}$(free) = 0.64 $\pm$ 0.16. Coincidentally, the $z_{tr}$ results overlap with the initial moment of $H_{0}$ evolution ($H_{0}$ value starts to deviate from the Planck result). This may suggest that the Hubble tension might be closely related to this particular period in the evolution of the Universe.

          Cosmic string gravitational wave backgrounds at LISA: I. Signal survey, template reconstruction, and model comparison

 - **Abstract**
 We present a catalog of gravitational wave background (GWB) signal templates from cosmic-string networks, based on relevant models proposed in the literature. We classify templates as conventional, based on standard cosmology and Nambu-Goto results (VOS and BOS), and beyond conventional, based on modifications of a) the loop number density (LRS, super, metastable, current-carrying strings), b) the expansion history (non-standard cosmologies, extra degrees of freedom, either thermal or secluded), or c) the loop properties (birth length, power emission). Using the SBI package $\texttt{GWBackFinder}$, we quantify the reconstruction precision of each signal by LISA, scanning over their parameter space, and performing model comparisons. For conventional signals, LISA reconstructs the tension $G\mu$ with an error $\lesssim 10\%$ for $G\mu \gtrsim 5\cdot 10^{-15}$, which decreases down to $2-3\%$ for $G\mu \gtrsim 10^{-12}$. BOS and VOS modelings become distinguishable confidently for $G\mu \gtrsim 5\cdot 10^{-13}$. For beyond-conventional signals, we identify SNR and error-threshold intervals for each parameter, and determine (for few examples) the regions where they can be distinguished from conventional signals. Analogous quality reconstruction studies of cosmic-string GWBs, superimposed over leading astrophysical foregrounds in the LISA window, will be presented in a series of upcoming papers.

          Constraints on DBI dark energy with chameleon mechanism

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we investigate the Dirac Born Infeld chameleon scalar field model in light of the latest cosmological observations, analyzing the model both with the incorporation of the chameleon mechanism and without it. Results from current cosmological observations, such as Pantheon Plus, DES Y5, DESI DR2, and the compressed Planck likelihood, are used to constrain the model. We consider the AdS throat in the form of $f(\phi) = \lambda / \phi^4$ and a potential $V(\phi) = m_0^2 \phi^2 + m_1^2 \phi^4$ .One interesting finding from our analysis is that, without the chameleon mechanism, the mean value of $m_1 \simeq 0$ indicates the self-interaction of the DBI field could potentially be negligible. Constraints on the potential parameters do not appear when considering the chameleon mechanism, but the warp parameter and chameleon coupling parameter are forced to satisfy $\eta \geq 0$ and $\beta \leq 0$. Different choices of $\beta$ render the same background cosmological parameters. The equation of state $w_{\rm DE}$ resides more in the quintessence region in the past. There is no phantom crossing in this model under our assumption of the warp throat and potential. By computing the $\Delta \text{AIC}$ relative to the $\Lambda$CDM model, we study statistical model comparison. The model as a candidate of dynamical dark energy is observationally viable at the cosmological background level.

          Development of PANOSETI Telescopes for Ultra-High-Energy Gamma-Ray Astronomy

 - **Abstract**
 Ultra-High-Energy (UHE, E $>100$ TeV) gamma rays are one of the few channels to search for and study Galactic PeVatrons. Among the most promising PeVatron candidates are the many UHE gamma-ray sources that have recently been identified on the Galactic Plane. Ground-based particle detectors see these sources as extended rather than point-like, and current generation Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs) struggle to study them with effective areas and background rejection that are suboptimal at UHE. A cost-efficient way of constructing an array of IACTs explicitly designed for UHE sensitivity is to sparsely separate many small telescopes. We have simulated, prototyped, and twice deployed a pathfinder array that is instrumented with telescopes designed by the Panoramic Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (PANOSETI) team. These 0.5-meter Fresnel lens telescopes are purpose-built for imaging optical transients on nanosecond timescales and are equipped with a $10^\circ\times10^\circ$ silicon photomultiplier camera. Three PANOSETI telescopes were deployed twice in the same temporary configuration at Lick Observatory in March and October 2024. Here we give a brief description of the instrument and present a comparison of simulations with the data collected, including an analysis of the Crab Nebula. We also report on the ongoing deployment of PANOSETI telescopes for the Dark100 array that is planned to operate for five years at Palomar Observatory.

 - **Abstract**
 The Large inclination Distant Objects LiDO survey has discovered the first securely classified object in the 10:1 mean motion resonance of Neptune. This object, 2020 VN40, is short-term stable in the 10:1 resonance, but not stable on Gyr timescales. 2020 VN40 is likely part of the scattering sticking population, and temporarily resides in the 10:1 resonance at ~139.5 au. This discovery confirms that this distant resonance is populated, as a single detection is likely to be indicative of a large population that is difficult to detect due to observational biases. This object has an inclination of 33.4 degrees, and n-body integrations of orbital clones of 2020 VN40 have revealed some unexpected evolutions. While clones of 2020 VN40 show resonant libration around the expected resonance centers of approximately 90, 180, and 270 degrees, for a restricted range of inclination and eccentricity values some clones librate around a resonant argument of 0 degrees. As this occurs for the slightly lower-eccentricity portions of the evolution, this behavior can also be quite stable. Our initial exploration suggests that this libration around a center of 0 degrees is a generic effect for highly inclined objects in n:1 resonances because the nature of their resonant interaction with Neptune becomes a strong function of their argument of pericenter, omega. At large inclination, the resonant islands shift as omega precesses, switching the center of symmetric libration to 0 degrees for omega=90 degrees and omega=270 degrees. 2020 VN40 provides interesting insight into the evolution of the large-inclination resonators, which become more common at increasing semi-major axis.

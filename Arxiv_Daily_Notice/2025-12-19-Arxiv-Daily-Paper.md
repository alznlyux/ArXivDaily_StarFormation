- **Abstract**
 The formation and evolution of the Milky Way's disc, bar, and bulge remain fundamentally limited by the lack of a contiguous, Galaxy-wide, high-precision chemo-dynamical map. Key open questions - including the survival or destruction of the primitive discs, the origin of the bulge's multi-component structure, the role of mergers and secular processes, and the coupling between stellar chemistry, dynamics, and the Galactic potential - cannot be fully resolved with current or planned facilities. Existing spectroscopic surveys provide either high resolution for small samples or wide coverage at insufficient resolution and depth, and none can obtain homogeneous abundances, precise 3D kinematics, and reliable ages for the millions of stars required, particularly in the obscured midplane, the far side of the bar, or the outer, low-density disc. A new wide-field, massively multiplexed, large-aperture spectroscopic facility, capable of both high- and low-resolution spectroscopy over tens of thousands of square degrees, is therefore essential. Such a facility would deliver the statistical power, sensitivity, and completeness needed to reconstruct the Galaxy's assembly history, constrain its gravitational potential, and establish the Milky Way as the definitive benchmark for galaxy evolution.

- **Abstract**
 The earliest stages of star formation are highlighted by complex interactions between accretion, outflow, and radiative processes, which shape the chemical and physical environment of the emerging protostar. James Webb Space Telescope observations of the low-mass, low-luminosity Class 0 protostar IRAS 16253-2429 reveal a central compact source. This object exhibits a rich mid-infrared emission spectrum of OH pure rotational lines and $\rm CO_2$ ro-vibrational lines. Unusually for a young stellar object, it has no mid-infrared line emission from $\rm H_2O$ to match the other molecules. We demonstrate that the emitting OH molecules arise from UV photodissociation of $\rm H_2O$ in its second absorption band at $\lambda = 114-145$ nm, and that the OH emission is a fluorescent cascade starting with highest-excitation rotational states. This situation offers the opportunity of using the infrared OH spectrum to measure the UV flux from the central protostar. Thereby we determine the disk-star accretion rate to be $3 \times 10^{-10} \ M_\sun \ {\rm year^{-1}}$, and demonstrate that the system luminosity arises mostly from the protostar's photosphere rather than from accretion luminosity. The result is in accord with the measured outflow rate of IRAS 16253-2429 and lies within the outflow/accretion-flow rate trend often inferred for protostars; and with episodic accretion as the dominant mechanism by which this protostar has grown.

- **Abstract**
 Quasar photometric redshifts are essential for studying cosmology and large-scale structures. However, their complex spectral energy distributions cause significant redshift-color degeneracy, limiting the accuracy of traditional methods. To overcome this, we introduce LSTM-MDNz, a novel end-to-end deep learning model combining long short-term memory networks (LSTM) with mixture density networks (MDN). The model directly uses multi-band photometric fluxes and associated errors as wavelength-ordered sequential inputs, eliminating the need for manual feature engineering while enabling simultaneous point estimation and probability distribution function (PDF) prediction of quasar redshifts. We integrate data from four major sky surveys-SDSS, DESI-LS, WISE, and GALEX-to assemble a sample of over 550,000 spectroscopically confirmed quasars ($0 \leq z_{\mathrm{spec}} \leq 5$) across 14 ultraviolet to infrared bands for model training and testing. Experimental results show that using all 14 bands yields optimal performance, with a normalized median absolute deviation ($\sigma_{\mathrm{NMAD}}$) of 0.037 and an outlier rate ($f_{\mathrm{out}}$) of 3.5\% on the test set. These values represent reductions of 29\% and 56\%, respectively, compared to the commonly adopted SDSS+WISE band set. Probability integral transform ($\mathrm{PIT}$) and continuous ranked probability score ($\mathrm{CRPS}$) analyses confirm that the predicted PDFs align closely with the true redshift distribution. Band-ablation experiments further highlight the essential role of ultraviolet and infrared data in alleviating color degeneracy and reducing systematic bias. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of multi-band fusion in improving quasar photo-z accuracy and offers a ready-to-use estimation framework for future surveys like LSST, CSST, and Euclid.

- **Abstract**
 Steady-state solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations are known to admit solutions that are singular at the sonic point. Consequently, inviscid solar wind models require special treatment of the solution near the sonic points, and this has proven to be a significant impediment to efficient modeling of the solar wind. In this paper we revisit the governing hydrodynamic equations for the expanding solar wind, with the inclusion of the classical (Newtonian) viscous stress , and we show how this inclusion eliminates the singularities that emerge from the inviscid equations. This result has been previously reported and used to generate solar wind profiles from initial conditions in the asymptotic limit; however, those studies did not include realistic treatments of the inner corona, and generally rejected the prospect of extrapolating solutions outward from the Sun into the heliosphere. Here, we expand this method to include external heating and optically thin radiative losses and show that solutions can be computed from initial conditions near the solar surface, thereby capturing the entire range of scales from below the transition region to the outer heliosphere in a single solution. Our approach is to cast the steady-state Navier-Stokes equations as a system of five coupled, ordinary differential equations (ODEs), which we solve using conventional methods, without any special treatment of the governing equations in the vicinity of the sonic point. The representative solutions that we present here demonstrate the utility and efficiency of this extrapolation method, which is considerably more realistic than commonly used analytical or empirical models. This method provides a direct approach to generating accurate solar wind profiles subject to observationally motivated initial conditions near the solar surface, at a fraction of the computational cost of comparable relaxation-based models.

- **Abstract**
 Open clusters serve as laboratories to study and evaluate stellar evolution and Galactic chemical evolution models. Chemical peculiarities, such as lithium-rich giants, are rarely observed in these stellar systems. This work focuses on eight red giants (#005, #028, #034, #053, #087, #121, #126, and #190) previously reported as members of the Galactic cluster IC 2714. We conducted a detailed investigation using high-resolution spectroscopy, supplemented with data from the Gaia DR3 catalog. Besides deriving the cluster's fundamental parameters, we provide the most thorough chemical characterization of IC 2714 to date, reporting the abundance of 23 species, including light elements (Li, C, N, O), odd-Z elements (Na, Al), $\alpha$-elements (Si, Ca, Ti, Mg), iron-peak elements (Sc, Cr, Ni), $\textit{s}$-process-dominated elements (Y, Zr, Ba, La, Ce, Nd) and $\textit{r}$-process elements (Sm, Eu). We also present the carbon isotopic ratios $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C for the first time for seven stars. One particular star (#087) exhibits a high lithium abundance ($\log \varepsilon$(Li)$_{\rm NLTE}$ = $+$1.54 dex) and a slightly higher projected rotational velocity ($v \sin i$ = 6.7 km s$^{-1}$). Our results suggest that the analyzed stars are in the core-helium-burning phase of evolution, where the most lithium-rich giants are found. Combining astrometric probabilities and chemical abundances, we conclude that two giants (#028 and #034) might not be cluster members.

          Axisymmetric Modeling of DSHARP Dusty Disks: Asymmetric Structures and Inner-Disk Dispersal

- **Abstract**
 High-resolution observations of Class II protoplanetary disks frequently reveal annular structures that may indicate the presence of embedded planets. In this study, we model brightness profiles and geometries for 16 dusty disks in the DSHARP observations to identify asymmetric substructures, including possible planet-induced signatures. We find no compelling evidence for circumplanetary emission in these systems. We identify a possible one-armed spiral in Elias 27; while previous studies report an $m=2$ spiral, the morphology of the newly identified spiral agrees with a spiral for a possible protoplanet. Although non-detection of circumplanetary emission is consistent with low expected luminosities, the absence of additional dust spirals except for Elias 27 may constrain properties of potential embedded planets given their theoretical detectability. The analyses further suggest that spiral amplitudes and phases correlated with gap and ring locations in WaOph 6 and IM Lup, appearing as deflections of spirals in images. Five disks exhibit strong residual asymmetries attributable to the vertical extent of their dust layers. We find that the brightness temperature of inner disks ($1$-$5$ au) declines with stellar age on a $\sim 3$ Myr timescale, while the total flux shows no clear decreasing trend. This trend is consistent with the presence of pressure bumps that retain large dust grains at outer radii, while allowing the inner disks to disperse. The universality of disk dispersal timescale at millimeter wavelengths, observed in both the extended DSHARP disks and the compact disks from previous demographic surveys, may constrain timing of planet formation, including habitable planets.

          Bayesian Smooth-Fit Extrapolation of the $^{12}\mathrm{C}+{}^{12}\mathrm{C}$ Astrophysical $S$ Factor

- **Abstract**
 A Bayesian analysis of the astrophysical $S$ factor for the $^{12}\mathrm{C}+^{12}\mathrm{C}$ fusion reaction is presented, based on available experimental information at carbon--carbon relative energies $E \gtrsim 2~\mathrm{MeV}$, including direct measurements, indirect Coulomb-renormalized Trojan Horse Method (THM) results, and recent inverse-kinematics data. The Bayesian inference is performed on the quantity $\log_{10}S^{*}(E)$ rather than on $S^{*}(E)$ itself, which naturally accommodates the wide dynamic range of the data and leads to approximately Gaussian uncertainties. The logarithm of the astrophysical factor is parametrized by a quadratic polynomial in energy, and the posterior distribution of the fit coefficients is determined using a weighted Bayesian regression. From this posterior, a global median $S^{*}(E)$ curve is constructed, and the associated covariance matrix is used to define a low/medium/high (LO/MED/HI) band corresponding to a $68\%$ credible interval. Particular emphasis is placed on the extrapolation below $E_{\mathrm{cm}}=2~\mathrm{MeV}$, where the fusion reaction rate is most relevant for stellar carbon burning. At $E_{\mathrm{cm}}=1.5~\mathrm{MeV}$, the posterior distribution yields $S_{\mathrm{global}}^{*}(1.5~\mathrm{MeV})= \left(2.13^{+0.01}_{-0.01}\right)\times10^{16}\,\mathrm{keV\,b}, $ corresponding to a $68\%$ credible interval. The extracted result is consistent with recent inverse-kinematics measurements and with Coulomb-corrected Trojan Horse Method constraints, providing a tightly constrained estimate of the $^{12}\mathrm{C}+^{12}\mathrm{C}$ fusion $S$ factor in the energy region relevant for stellar carbon burning.

          Weakened Inspirals I: High Mass Ratio Common Envelope Interactions in RGB Stars

- **Abstract**
 The common envelope (CE) interaction between an expanding giant star and a compact companion typically leads to a rapid orbital decay, ending in either a merger or the formation of a close binary. However, the existence of post-red giant and post-asymptotic giant branch binaries with separations of 100 to 800 Rsun challenges this standard picture, as these systems appear to have experienced strong interactions without undergoing a classic CE inspiral. In this work, we investigate the effect of high mass ratio, q = M2/M1, on the CE inspiral using three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations performed with the smoothed particle hydrodynamics code PHANTOM. The primary is a 0.88 Msun, 90 Rsun red giant branch star, while the companion masses span q = 0.68 to 1.5. Higher mass ratios lead to wider post-CE separations, with a maximum of approximately 40 Rsun. The pre-CE mass transfer phase is longer for larger companion masses, and for q greater than or equal to 1 the inspiral becomes significantly more stable, broadly consistent with analytical expectations. This phase is not fully converged with respect to numerical resolution, and higher resolution simulations are expected to further increase its duration and stability. Although higher q systems show enhanced mass loss through the L2 and L3 Lagrange points, we find that circumbinary discs are more likely to form from fallback of bound envelope material. Fallback times are short, of order a few hundred years, and fallback radii lie well outside the binary, between 0.5 and 5 au, where discs are expected to spread efficiently through viscous torques. While high mass ratio systems produce wider post-interaction separations, these remain smaller than those observed. In contrast, fallback-formed discs have properties consistent with observed circumbinary discs.

- **Abstract**
 Thousands of X-ray sources have been detected in the Galactic center (GC), most believed to be cataclysmic variables (CVs). As a potential probe of the old stellar population, in particular CVs, the existence and detectability of novae in the GC remain elusive, due to the prohibitive extinction toward the GC and their relatively low occurrence rate. Nova remnants evolving in the characteristic hot ($T\sim{10^{6}~\rm K}$) and dense ($n_e\sim{10~\rm cm^{-3}}$) interstellar medium in the GC may shed light on recent novae and provide useful insight on the GC ecosystem. In this work, we perform hydrodynamical simulations of putative nova remnants in the GC environment and calculate their time-dependent multiwavelength emission to estimate the detectability. Among 79 models sampling the nova parameter space (primarily ejecta mass and velocity), 6, 44, and 51 modelled nova remnants are detectable at their X-ray, radio, and Paschen-$\alpha$ maximum, respectively, for existing {\it Chandra}, VLA, and HST observations of the GC. The predicted peak luminosities are $\sim10^{32}~\rm erg~s^{-1}$, $\sim10^{31}~\rm erg~s^{-1}$, and $\sim10^{36}~\rm erg~s^{-1}$ in these three bands and the detectable window ranges from weeks to notably hundred years. By specifying a CV population of the nuclear star cluster, we estimate the probability of detecting at least one remnant to be 20\%, 8\%, and 18\% in X-rays, radio, and Pa$\alpha$. The nova remnant would be best resolved in the X-ray band. Our study highlights the potential for detecting nova remnants through further observations, leveraging JWST and the potentially forthcoming AXIS and SKA.

          High mass accretion rates onto evolved stripped-envelope massive stars by jet-induced mass removal

- **Abstract**
 Simulating one-dimensional stellar evolution models with MESA, we show that removing the outer inflated envelope of a mass-accreting evolved stripped-envelope star, like a Wolf-Rayet (WR) star, substantially moderates the stellar expansion during accretion at high-mass accretion rates. We study the accretion onto a star via an accretion disk, which launches jets that remove the high-entropy outer layers of the inflated envelope. This is the `jetted mass removal accretion scenario.' By manually removing the entire hydrogen-rich envelope from a red supergiant, we build a hydrogen-deficient WR stellar model with a mass of 6.03Mo and a radius of 0.67Ro. We then accrete mass onto it at a high rate. We mimic the real process of simultaneous mass addition near the equatorial plane and jet-induced mass removal from the outer envelope by dividing the accretion period into hundreds of pulses: in the first half of each pulse, we add mass, and in the second, we remove a fraction of this mass. The removal of tens of percent from the added mass decreases the stellar expansion by a factor of about 2-5. Our results show that WR stars can maintain a deep potential well and not expand much while accreting mass at high rates. This allows the formation of an accretion disk and the liberation of large amounts of gravitational energy. Our results strengthen models of intermediate-luminosity optical transients, such as luminous red novae, in which a non-degenerate star accretes at high rates and launches jets that power the transient event.

- **Abstract**
 Based on the finding of unusual chemical abundance ratios of N-emitters, which resemble those of globular cluster (GC) stars, their compactness, high ISM densities and other properties, it has been suggested that N-emitters could indicate the formation sites of globulars. A recent statistical study of the N-emitter population has quantified the frequency $f_N$ of these rare objects and their redshift evolution (Morel et al. 2025). Using these results we here test if N-emitters trace the formation of GCs and use the observed cosmic star-formation rate density evolution to predict the cosmological evolution of the GC population with time, their age distribution, and the total present-day stellar mass density formed in globulars. The predicted age distribution of GCs strongly resembles the typical asymmetric observed distributions in the Galaxy and ellipiticals, with a peak at $\sim 11.5-12$ Gyr and a longer tail extending to younger ages. We derive a total stellar mass density formed in N-emitters down to redshift zero of $(2-7) \times 10^5$ M$_{\odot}$ Mpc$^{-3}$, which matches within a factor $\sim 2$ the observed fraction of stellar mass found in the GC population at $z=0$. These results provide additional indirect arguments supporting the hypothesis that N-emitters could represent sign-posts of a short phase of GC formation.

- **Abstract**
 Mauve is a low-cost small satellite developed and operated by Blue Skies Space Ltd. The payload features a 13 cm telescope connected with a fibre that feeds into a UV-Vis spectrometer. The detector covers the 200-700 nm range in a single shot, obtaining low resolution spectra at R~20-65. Mauve has launched on 28th November 2025, reaching a 510 km Low-Earth Sun-synchronous orbit. The satellite will enable UV and visible observations of a variety of stellar objects in our Galaxy, filling the gaps in the ultraviolet space-based data. The researchers that have already joined the mission have defined the science themes, observational strategy and targets that Mauve will observe in the first year of operations. To date, 10 science themes have been developed by the Mauve science collaboration for year 1, with observational strategies that include both long duration monitoring and short cadence snapshots. Here, we describe these themes and the science that Mauve will undertake in its first year of operations.

 The Serpens OB2 association (l ~ 18.5 deg, b ~ 1.9 deg, d = 1950 +/- 30 pc) is a large star-forming complex ~65 pc above the Galactic midplane, with a clumpy, elongated structure extending ~50 pc parallel to the plane. We analyse a sample of probable association members, including OB stars and low-to-intermediate-mass young stellar objects (YSOs) from the SPICY catalogue. While both populations are found throughout the association, the OB stars lie preferentially on the side nearest the Galactic plane, while the YSOs are generally younger and more strongly clustered around molecular-cloud clumps detected in 13CO MWISP data. Using Gaia DR3 proper motions to probe the association's internal kinematics, we find aligned stellar velocities on length scales <2 pc, two-point velocity statistics that show increasing velocity differences and predominantly divergent motions at larger separations, and distinct velocities for star clusters within the association. Finally, the association exhibits gradual, but statistically significant global expansion perpendicular to the Galactic plane, with a spatial gradient of 0.10 +/- 0.02 km/s/pc. The expansion of the H II region Sh 2-54, powered by the association's OB stars, may be accelerating the star-forming cloud away from the plane given the system's geometry, plausibly inducing the vertical stellar velocity gradient. The clumpy stellar distribution, correlated velocities on small scales, and increasingly divergent motions on larger scales are consistent with an initial velocity field inherited from a turbulent molecular cloud modified by stellar feedback. Ser OB2 demonstrates that the multi-scale expansion of an OB association can begin even while star formation is still ongoing throughout the complex.

- **Abstract**
 The Wide-field Infrared Transient Explorer (WINTER) is a new near-infrared time-domain survey instrument installed on a dedicated 1-meter robotic telescope at Palomar Observatory. The project takes advantage of the recent technology advances in time-domain astronomy, robotic telescopes, large-format sensors, and rapid data reduction and alert software for timely follow up of events. Since June of 2023, WINTER robotically surveys the sky each night to a median depth of J_AB = 18.5 mag, balancing a variety of science programs including searching for kilonovae from gravitational-wave alerts, blind surveys to study galactic and extragalactic transients and variables, and building up reference images of the near-infrared sky. The project also serves as a technology demonstration for new large-format Indium Gallium Arsenide (InGaAs) sensors for near-infrared photometry without cryogenic cooling. WINTER's custom camera combines six InGaAs sensors with a novel tiled fly's-eye optical design to cover a >1 degree-squared field of view with 1 arcsecond pixels in the Y-, J-, and shortened-H-band filters (0.9 - 1.7 micron). This paper presents the design, performance, and early on-sky science of the WINTER observatory.

- **Abstract**
 An excess emission has been observed by Spitzer in the [3, 5] micron range of the SNR 1987A spectrum. It is generally argued that this excess could be due to the presence of warm amorphous carbon dust in the equatorial ring (ER) around the supernova, but the proposed models all have problems. This prompted us to present an alternative view on the interpretation of the Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) of SNR 1987A from the near-IR wavelengths to the radio frequencies (from 3 micron up to 1.4 GHz), between 6000 and 8000 days after outburst. We argue that the origin of that excess could be attributed instead to a free-free emission. We show that under very specific conditions (the free-free is self-absorbed at a cut-off frequency imposed by the mass of the emitting region), it could be produced by collisional heating of the gas. We then discuss the time evolution of the various components of the SED. We establish a linear relationship between the growth of the warm carbon dust mass and that of the silicates dust during the analyzed period. Finally, we build the Spitzer light curves and we show that our models reproduce the observations pretty well, although our study clearly favors the free-free case. In conclusion, we argue that the free-free model provides a formally very good description of the data, however the model does require some very specific parameter choices, and results in an unusually low temperature for the ionized gas.

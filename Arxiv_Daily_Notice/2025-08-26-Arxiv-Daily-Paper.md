#### Title:
          Estimating the Local Hubble Parameter from the Thermal Evolution of Earth and Mars

 - **Abstract**
 The problem of local (e.g., interplanetary) Hubble expansion is studied for a long time but remains a controversial subject till now; and of particular interest is a plausible value of the local Hubble parameter at the scale of the Solar system. Here, we tried to estimate the corresponding quantity by the analysis of surface temperatures on the Earth and Mars, which are formed by a competition between a variable luminosity of the Sun and increasing radii of the planetary orbits. Our work employs paleochemical and paleobiological data on the temperature of the ancient Earth, on the one hand, and geological data on the existence of an ocean of liquid water on the ancient Mars, on the other hand. As follows from our analysis, the martian data impose only a weak constraint on the admissible values of the Hubble parameter because of the unknown salinity - and, therefore, the freezing point - of the martian water. On the other hand, the terrestrial data turn out to be much more valuable, especially, for the Precambrian period, when temperature variation was sufficiently smooth and monotonic. For example, in the framework of standard LambdaCDM model with 70% of dark energy, contemporary value of the local Hubble parameter was found to be 70-90 km/s/Mpc under assumption that the Earth's surface temperature in the end of Precambrian equaled 45 C. This is in reasonable agreement both with the intergalactic data and with an independent estimate of the local Hubble parameter from tidal evolution of the Earth-Moon system.

 - **Abstract**
 Grouping stars by chemical similarity has the potential to reveal the Milky Way's evolutionary history. The APOGEE stellar spectroscopic survey has the resolution and sensitivity for this task. However, APOGEE lacks access to strong lines of neutron-capture elements ($Z > 28$) which have nucleosynthetic origins that are distinct from those of the lighter elements. We assess whether APOGEE abundances are sufficient for selecting chemically similar disk stars by identifying 25 pairs of chemical ``doppelgangers'' in APOGEE DR17 and following them up with the Tull spectrograph, an optical, $R \sim 60{,}000$ echelle on the McDonald Observatory 2.7-m telescope. Line-by-line differential analyses of pairs' optical spectra reveals neutron-capture (Y, Zr, Ba, La, Ce, Nd, and Eu) elemental abundance differences of $\Delta$[X/Fe] $\rm \sim 0.020 \pm 0.015$ to $0.380 \pm 0.15$ dex (4--140%), and up to 0.05 dex (12%) on average, a factor of 1--2 times higher than intra-cluster pairs. This is despite the pairs sharing nearly identical APOGEE-reported abundances and [C/N] ratios, a tracer of giant-star age. This work illustrates that even when APOGEE abundances derived from SNR $> 300$ spectra are available, optically-measured neutron-capture element abundances contain critical information about composition similarity. These results hold implications for the chemical dimensionality of the disk, mixing within the interstellar medium, and chemical tagging with the neutron-capture elements.

          Linear map-making with LuSEE-Night

 - **Abstract**
 LuSEE-Night is a pathfinder radio telescope on the lunar far side employing four 3-m monopole antennas arranged as two horizontal cross pseudo-dipoles on a rotational stage and sensitive to the radio sky in the 1-50 MHz frequency band. LuSEE-Night measures the corresponding 16 correlation products as a function of frequency. While each antenna combination measures radiation coming from a large area of the sky, their aggregate information as a function of phase in the lunar cycle and rotational stage position can be deconvolved into a low-resolution map of the sky. We study this deconvolution using linear map-making based on the Wiener filter algorithm. We illustrate how systematic effects can be effectively marginalised over as contributions to the noise covariance and demonstrate this technique on beam knowledge uncertainty and gain fluctuations. With reasonable assumptions about instrument performance, we show that LuSEE-Night should be able to map the sub-50 MHz sky at a ~5-degree resolution.

          Characterising the short-orbital period X-ray transient Swift J1910.2-0546

 - **Abstract**
 SwiftJ1910.2-0546 is a Galactic X-ray transient discovered during a bright outburst in 2012. We use time-series optical photometry and spectroscopy to estimate the orbital period, characterise the donor star, determine the interstellar extinction, distance, and system geometry, and constrain the component masses. Multi-site r-band and clear-filter light curves and WHT/ACAM spectra from the 2012 outburst are combined with time-series spectroscopy from GTC/OSIRIS and VLT/FORS2 in quiescence. Period searches are conducted using generalised Lomb-Scargle, phase-dispersion minimisation, and analysis-of-variance algorithms. Diffuse interstellar bands constrain E(B-V), while empirical correlations involving H$\alpha$ yield estimates of K2, q, and i. We detect a double-humped modulation with a period of $0.0941\pm0.0007$d ($2.26\pm0.02$h) during the outburst. Its morphology is consistent with an early superhump, suggesting that the true orbital period may be slightly shorter than 4.52h. The H$\alpha$ radial velocity curves do not yield a definitive orbital period. In quiescence, TiO bands indicate an M3-M3.5 donor contributing 70% of the red continuum. Diffuse interstellar bands give E(B-V)=$0.60\pm0.05$ and N_H=$(3.9\pm1.3)$x10$^{21}$cm$^{-2}$, placing the system at a distance of 2.8-4.0 kpc. The H$\alpha$ line width in quiescence (FWHM_0 =$990\pm45$km/s), via a FWHM-K_2 calibration, provides an estimate of K_2, while its double peaked profile gives q and i. Adopting the resulting K_2=$230\pm17$km/s and q=$0.032\pm0.010$, and two orbital period scenarios (2.25 and 4.50h), Monte Carlo sampling returns a compact object mass M_1=8-11M_sun and an inclination i=13-18 deg for plausible donor masses (M_2=0.25-0.35M_sun). We favour an orbital period of 4.5h. Further phase-resolved spectroscopy and photometry during quiescence are needed to better determine its fundamental parameters.

          Soot Planets instead of Water Worlds

 - **Abstract**
 Some low-density exoplanets are thought to be water-rich worlds that formed beyond the snow line of their protoplanetary disc, possibly accreting coequal portions of rock and water. However, the compositions of bodies within the Solar System and the stability of volatile-rich solids in accretionary disks suggest that a planet rich in water should also acquire as much as 40% refractory organic carbon ("soot"). This would reduce the water mass fraction well below 50%, making the composition of these planets similar to those of Solar System comets. Here we show that soot-rich planets, with or without water, can account for the low average densities of exoplanets that were previously attributed to a binary combination of rock and water. Formed in locations beyond the soot and/or snow lines in disks, these planets are likely common in our galaxy and already observed by JWST. The surfaces and interiors of soot-rich planets will be influenced by the chemical and physical properties of carbonaceous phases, and the atmospheres of such planets may contain plentiful methane and other hydrocarbons, with implications for photochemical haze generation and habitability.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the discovery of the planetary system orbiting the bright (V = 7.2), nearby (35 pc), Sun-like star HD 60779, which has a mass of 1.050 +/- 0.044 solar masses and a radius of 1.129 +/- 0.013 solar radii. We report two TESS transits and a subsequent CHEOPS transit of HD 60779 b, a sub-Neptune with a radius of 3.250 (+0.100 / -0.098) Earth radii on a 29.986175 (+0.000030 / -0.000033) day orbit. Additionally, 286 HARPS-N radial velocity measurements reveal the mass of planet b (14.7 +1.1 / -1.0 Earth masses) and the presence of an outer planet, HD 60779 c, with an orbital period of 104.25 (+0.30 / -0.29) days and a minimum mass (m sin i) of 27.7 +/- 1.6 Earth masses. Both planets' orbits are consistent with being circular, suggesting that they have a dynamically quiet history. The data are not sufficient to determine whether planet c transits. HD 60779's uniquely high systemic radial velocity (129.75 +/- 0.12 km/s) allows its Lyman-alpha emission to avoid absorption by the interstellar medium, making it a prime candidate for probing atmospheric escape from HD 60779 b. HD 60779 is also the third-brightest host of a sub-Neptune with orbital period greater than 25 days and with both mass and radius measured, distinguishing it in terms of accessibility to spectroscopic characterization.

 - **Abstract**
 With the discovery of the third confirmed interstellar object (ISO), 3I/ATLAS, we have entered a new phase in the exploration of these long-predicted objects. Though confirmed discovery of ISOs is quite recent, their utility as targets in the search for technosignatures (historically known as the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence -- SETI) has been discussed for many decades. With the upcoming NSF-DOE Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), the discovery and tracking of such objects is expected to become routine, and thus so must our examination of these objects for possible technosignatures. Here we review the literature surrounding ISOs as targets for technosignatures, which provides a well-developed motivation for such exploration. We outline four broad classes of technosignatures that are well suited for ISO follow-up, including the type of data needed and the best timing for study. Given the limitations in the current understanding of ISOs, we show that care must be taken in identifying technosignatures based primarily on comparison to objects in the Solar System. We therefore provide a roadmap for careful and consistent study of the population of ISOs in the hope of identifying technosignatures.

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-ray bursts represent some of the most energetic and complex phenomena in the universe, characterized by highly variable light curves that often contain observational gaps. Reconstructing these light curves is essential for gaining deeper insight into the physical processes driving such events. This study proposes a machine learning-based framework for the reconstruction of gamma-ray burst light curves, focusing specifically on the plateau phase observed in X-ray data. The analysis compares the performance of three sequential modeling approaches: a bidirectional recurrent neural network, a gated recurrent architecture, and a convolutional model designed for temporal data. The findings of this study indicate that the Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit model showed the best predictive accuracy among the evaluated models across all GRB types, as measured by Mean Absolute Error, Root Mean Square Error, and Coefficient of Determination. Notably, Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit exhibited enhanced capability in modeling both gradual plateau phases and abrupt transient features, including flares and breaks, particularly in complex light-curve scenarios.

          Modeling Multiphase Galactic Outflows: A Multifluid Moving Mesh Approach

 - **Abstract**
 Outflows are a key part of the galactic gas cycle and crucial in shaping the star formation activity in their host galaxy. Yet, in simulations of galaxy evolution, modeling these outflows in their multi-phase nature and over the relevant timescales is an unsolved problem. We present a subgrid model for simulating multiphase galactic outflows in efficient, comparatively low-resolution simulations, designed for application in future cosmological simulations. The cold phase (T = 10000 K) is treated as pressureless, and its interaction with the hot phase is captured through source terms representing drag and mixing. These terms are obtained using analytic drag and mixing terms for single clouds and convolving them with a cloud mass distribution consistent with high-resolution simulations. Applied to a setup resembling the starburst galaxy M82, the model reproduces the velocity, density, and mass outflow rates of high-resolution simulations that resolve individual cold clouds. Cold outflows emerge naturally from interactions between the hot wind and cold interstellar clouds, with drag and mixing both contributing to the acceleration. Varying the mixing strength strongly affects outflow properties: stronger mixing enhances mass transfer from hot to cold gas, reduces the hot phase velocity, and accelerates the cold phase, while also influencing the origin and composition of the cold outflow. Weak mixing produces cold gas mostly from preexisting interstellar clouds, whereas stronger mixing leads to substantial cold gas formation from the hot phase. This framework enables efficient simulations of multiphase galactic outflows while retaining key multi-component features of the outflow dynamics.

 - **Abstract**
 The $\Lambda$CDM model faces significant challenges, including an incomplete understanding of the dark sector and persistent tensions in the Hubble constant and the clustering amplitude. To address these issues, we propose a general disformal coupling between dark energy (DE) and dark matter from a field-theoretic action which can generate a rich variety of interactions including conformal and pure-momentum coupling scenarios. Our analysis reveals that a pure disformal coupling naturally produces a unique interacting Early Dark Sector, wherein the interactions with dark matter suppress the Hubble friction on the DE scalar field leading to a kinetic-driven cosmological constant-like behavior at early times followed by its dilution as $a^{-6}$ and eventually leading to a potential-driven epoch characteristic of late-time dark energy. In contrast to existing Early Dark Energy (EDE) models that rely on finely-tuned potentials, the EDE-like behavior, in our framework, is purely a consequence of the disformal coupling paired with the dilution of dark matter, offering a more fundamental and less ad hoc solution to cosmological tensions. This framework also predicts a suppression of power in the CMB temperature spectrum on large angular scales, offering a potential physical explanation for the observed low-$\ell$ anomaly. By deriving these effects from a fundamental action, our work provides a unified, testable alternative to $\Lambda$CDM that can be constrained by next-generation cosmological surveys and gravitational wave observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Dark matter halos are fundamental cosmological structures whose properties-such as concentration, ellipticity, and mass centroid-encode information about their formation and evolution. Concentration traces collapse time and internal structure, while ellipticity and centroid offsets reflect halo shape and dynamical state. Accurate characterization of these properties improves mass estimates and tests dark matter models. Gravitational lensing, which directly probes projected mass distributions, provides a powerful means to constrain halo structure. We present a 2D weak-lensing analysis of 299 RedMaPPer clusters using shear measurements from the HSC-SSP first-year data release. By fitting elliptical NFW models with mass priors from the RedMaPPer cluster richness-mass relation, considering the priors helps us break the mass-concentration degeneracy and tighten constraints on other parameters. The derived concentration-mass relation exhibits a slightly steeper slope than traditional weak-lensing power-law or upturn models, and agrees more closely with the results from strong lensing selected halos. More massive and lower-redshift clusters tend to have lower concentrations and appear more spherical. The halo ellipticity distribution is characterized by e=1-b/a=0.530+/-0.168, with a mean of <e>=0.505+/-0.007. We also detect a bimodal distribution in the offsets between optical centers and mass centroids: some halos are well-aligned with their brightest cluster galaxy (BCG), while others show significant displacements. These results highlight the power of 2D weak-lensing modeling in probing halo morphology and in providing key inputs for understanding and modeling systematic effects in stacked lensing analyses.

          JWST/NIRSpec Observations of Salacia-Actaea and Máni: Exploring Population-level Trends among Water-ice-rich Kuiper Belt Objects

 - **Abstract**
 We present observations of the mid-sized Kuiper belt objects (KBOs) Salacia-Actaea and Máni, obtained with the Near-Infrared Spectrograph on JWST. The satellite Actaea was fully blended with Salacia at the spatial resolution of the integral field unit, and we extracted the combined spectrum. The 0.7-5.1 ${\mathrm \mu}$m reflectance spectra of Salacia-Actaea and Máni display prominent water-ice absorption bands at 1.5, 2, 3, and 4-5 ${\mathrm \mu}$m. The $\nu_3$ fundamental vibrational band of carbon dioxide ice at 4.25 ${\mathrm \mu}$m is present in both spectra. From a quantitative band-depth analysis of the entire current JWST spectroscopic sample of water-ice-rich KBOs, we find strong evidence for a positive covariance between relative water-ice abundance and size, which may indicate the emergent impacts of internal differentiation and cryovolcanic production of surface water ice on mid-sized KBOs. A detailed look at the distribution of 2- and 3-${\mathrm \mu}$m band depths suggests additional sources of variability, such as different water-ice grain sizes. In addition, we report an apparent transition in the carbon dioxide band depth at diameters of roughly 300-500 km, with larger objects showing systematically weaker absorptions, although selection effects within the sample do not allow us to confidently distinguish between a size-dependent phenomenon and a correlation with dynamical class. The band shape of the carbon dioxide feature also varies with size: while small KBOs have narrow bands centered at ~4.27 ${\mathrm \mu}$m, the largest objects have broader, blue-shifted features that may include contributions from carbon dioxide in an irradiated, mixed, and/or layered state.

          On the Spatial Distribution of Luminous Blue Variables, B[e] Supergiants, and Wolf-Rayet stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud

 - **Abstract**
 We examine the spatial distributions of LBV's, B[e] supergiants, and W-R stars in the LMC, to clarify their relative ages, evolutionary states, and relationships. This survey employs a reference catalog that was not available for previous work, comprising more than 3900 of the LMC's most luminous stars. Our analysis shows that LBV's, B[e] supergiants, and WR's have spatial distributions like normal stars with the same spectral types and luminosities. Most LBV's are not isolated, nor do they require binary or multiple status to explain their spatial relationship to other populations. There are two likely exceptions: one lower-luminosity LBV and one LBV candidate are relatively isolated and may have velocities that require additional acceleration. The B[e] supergiants are spatially and kinematically more dispersed than LBV's, suggesting that they belong to an older population. The most luminous early-type WN's are most closely associated with the evolved late O-type supergiants. The high luminosity late WN's, however, are highly concentrated in the 30 Dor region which biases the analysis. The less luminous WN's and WC's are associated with a mix of evolved late B, A-type, and yellow supergiants which may be in a post-red-supergiant phase. Spatial distributions of the less luminous WN, WC, and WN3/O3 stars reinforce proposed evolutionary links among those subtypes. Our analysis also demonstrates the importance of using a comprehensive census, with reference populations clearly defined by spectral type and luminosity, and how small number statistics, especially combined with spatial clustering, can invalidate some commonly-cited statistical tests.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the discovery of a companion to the Y-dwarf, CWISEP J193518.59-154620.3, the second Y-Y dwarf binary detected to date. Y-dwarfs are the coldest known free-floating objects ($<$ 500 K) and on average represent the lowest mass objects directly formed through turbulent fragmentation of a molecular cloud. Studying their multiplicity allows us to place strong constraints on the ability to form multiple systems of planetary masses and approaching the opacity limit of fragmentation. Due to their physical properties, Y-dwarfs also serve as analogs to gas giant planets. CWISEP J193518.59-154620.3 has been shown to have a unique methane emission feature in its near infrared spectrum at 3.326 $\mu$m, potentially indicative of auroral processes without a clear origin. CWISEP J193518.59-154620.3 was observed with JWST's MIRI in the F1000W, F1280W, and F1800W filters. We applied a point-spread function (PSF) fitting algorithm using empirically derived PSF models and resolve a companion in the F1000W and F1280W filters separated by 172 milli-arcseconds, 2.48 au assuming the distance of 14.43 pc. Using the ATMO2020 evolutionary models, we estimate a mass of 12-39 $M_{\rm Jup}$ for the primary and 7-24 $M_{\rm Jup}$ for the companion assuming an age of 1-10 Gyr for a mass ratio of 0.55-0.62, resulting in an estimated period of 16-28 years. It is unknown which component of this binary exhibits the methane emission feature. We also resolve known companions WISE J014656.66+423410.0B and WISE J171104.60+350036.8B using MIRI data and present their F1000W and F1280W photometry.

          Gravitational Instability and Fragmentation in Collapsar Disks Supports the Formation of Sub-Solar Neutron Stars

 - **Abstract**
 We perform three-dimensional shearing-box hydrodynamical simulations to explore the outcome of gravitational instability in the outer regions of neutrino-cooled disks such as those formed from the collapse of rotating massive stars ("collapsars''). We employ a physical equation of state, optically-thin neutrino cooling, and assume an electron fraction set by the balance of electron/positron pair-capture reactions. Disks in a marginally stable initial state (Toomre parameter Q~ 1) undergo runaway cooling and fragmentation when the dimensionless cooling timescale obeys tau_cool = t_cool*Omega < 10, where Omega is the orbital frequency; these conditions correspond to accretion rates > Msun/s on the upper end of those achieved by collapsar progenitor stars. Fragmentation leads to the formation of neutron-rich clumps (electron fraction Ye ~ 0.1) spanning a range of masses ~0.01-1 Msun around the local Jeans value. Most clumps exceed the local Chandrasekhar mass M_Ch ~ Ye^2 and hence will continue to collapse to nuclear densities, forming neutron stars (NS) with sub-solar masses otherwise challenging to create through ordinary stellar core-collapse. Even cool disks dominated by alpha-particles (Ye ~ 0.5) can fragment and collapse into neutron-rich clumps capable of forming sub-solar NSs. Although our simulations cannot follow this process directly, if the disk-formed NSs subsequently pair into binaries, the gravitational wave chirps from their rapid mergers are potentially detectable by ground based observatories. The temporal coincidence of such a hierarchical NS merger chain with the collapsar gamma-ray burst and supernova would offer a uniquely spectacular multi-messenger "symphony''.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a foundational, scalable algorithm architecture for processing data from aperture synthesis radio telescopes. The analysis leading to the architecture is rooted in the theory of aperture synthesis, signal processing and numerical optimization keeping it scalable for variations in computing load, algorithmic complexity, and accommodate the continuing evolution of algorithms. It also adheres to scientific software design principles and use of modern performance engineering techniques providing a stable foundation for long-term scalability, performance, and development cost. We first show that algorithms for both calibration and imaging algorithms share a common mathematical foundation and can be expressed as numerical optimization problems. We then decompose the resulting mathematical framework into fundamental conceptual architectural components, and assemble calibration and imaging algorithms from these foundational components. For a physical architectural view, we used a library of algorithms implemented in the LibRA software for the various architectural components, and used the Kokkos framework in the compute-intensive components for performance portable implementation. This was deployed on hardware ranging from desktop-class computers to multiple super-computer class high-performance computing (HPC) and high-throughput computing (HTC) platforms with a variety of CPU and GPU architectures, and job schedulers (HTCondor and Slurm). As a test, we imaged archival data from the NSF's Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) telescope in the A-array configuration for the Hubble Ultra Deep Field. Using over 100 GPUs we achieve a processing rate of ~2 Terabyte per hour to make one of the deepest images in the 2 -- 4 GHz band with an RMS noise of ~1 microJy/beam.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic inflation is one of the most important paradigms in modern cosmology. In its simplest form, inflation is driven by a single inflaton field. However, multi-field inflation has become increasingly attractive because it can solve many theoretical and observational challenges. In this paper, we propose a particular model involving two axion-like fields with simply monodromy-dominated potentials. We demonstrate that this model is consistent with current cosmological observations.

 - **Abstract**
 DESI observations of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs), combined with cosmic microwave background (CMB) and type-Ia supernova (SN Ia) data, suggest that the dark energy equation of state $w_{\rm DE}$ crosses the phantom divide from $w_{\rm DE} < -1$ to $w_{\rm DE} > -1$ at low redshifts. In shift-symmetric Horndeski and generalized Proca theories with luminal gravitational-wave speed and no direct couplings to dark matter, we show that such a phantom-divide crossing is generically difficult without introducing theoretical pathologies. In Horndeski theories, however, breaking the shift symmetry allows this transition. We present an explicit model with broken shift symmetry, in which the scalar field has a potential in addition to a Galileon self-interaction and a higher-order derivative term. This model realizes the desired phantom-divide crossing at low redshifts while avoiding ghosts and Laplacian instabilities.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent measurements from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), combined with Planck and DESI data, suggest a scalar spectral index $n_s$ higher than the Planck 2018 baseline, thereby placing conventional attractor-type inflationary models such as Starobinsky $R^2$ and Higgs inflation under increasing tension at the $\gtrsim 2\sigma$ level. In this work, we examine quantum-corrected $\phi^4$ inflation with a non-minimal coupling to gravity. Introducing an anomalous scaling parameter $\gamma$ to capture quantum corrections to the effective potential, we derive analytic expressions for the inflationary observables $n_s$ and $r$. Confronting these predictions with ACT, Planck, and BAO+lensing constraints, we demonstrate that modest values of $\gamma$ can raise $n_s$ into the ACT-preferred range while maintaining a strongly suppressed tensor-to-scalar ratio. For instance, with $N=60$ and $\gamma\simeq 0.006$, the model predicts $n_s\simeq 0.974$ and $r\simeq 0.007$, in excellent agreement with current bounds. We further investigate preheating dynamics, focusing on particle production via parametric resonance in quantum-corrected $\phi^4$ inflation with a non-minimal coupling to gravity. In this scenario, the inflaton $\phi$ couples to an additional scalar $\chi$ through an interaction $g^{2}\phi^{2}\chi^{2}$. In Minkowski spacetime, the resonance dynamics reduce to the Mathieu equation, and we find that broad resonance can be readily achieved, leading to efficient particle production.

 - **Abstract**
 Information field theory (IFT) is the application of probabilistic reasoning to fields. Physical fields are mathematical functions over continuous spaces that exhibit certain properties of regularity, such as limited variance and finite gradients. Inferring a field from an observational dataset should exploit these regularities. However, the finite number of constraints that the data provides is insufficient to determine the infinite number of degrees of freedom of a field. IFT enables us to derive optimal field inference algorithms that explicitly exploit domain knowledge. These algorithms can be implemented via Numerical Information Field Theory (NIFTy). In NIFTy, neural operator forward models can be written and inverted probabilistically. NIFTy thereby infers fields and their remaining uncertainties. This is achieved using novel variational inference schemes that scale quasi-linearly, even for ultra-high dimensional problems. This paper introduces the basic concepts of IFT and NIFTy, highlights a few of their astrophysical applications, and discusses their artificial intelligence (AI) perspective. Finally, UBIK (the Universal Bayesian Imaging Kit), an emerging customisation of NIFTy for a suite of astrophysical telescopes, is presented as a central tool to the topic of the UniversAI conference.

 - **Abstract**
 The black hole low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) candidate IGR J17091-3624 experienced a hard-state-only outburst in 2025. In this paper, we show that IXPE detected a series of intermittent X-ray dips, spanning a total interval of ~1 day. Subsequent observations with NICER, EP, NuSTAR, and Swift reveal that these dips recur with a period of 2.83$\pm$0.07 days and are accompanied by an increase in spectral hardness. This is the first time such quasi-periodic dipping behavior has been observed in this target since discovery. Our spectral analysis shows that the dips can be explained by obscuration from an ionized absorber characterized by an ionization parameter of $log{\xi}$ ~1-3 erg cm s$^{-1}$ and an equivalent hydrogen column density of $N^{\rm zxipcf}_{\rm H}$~(1-30)$\times10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$. The periodic reappearance of the absorber is likely caused by obscuring material located in the outer accretion disk, modulated by the binary orbital period. If confirmed, this period would suggest that the donor star in IGR J17091-3624 has deviated from the standard main-sequence evolutionary path and is likely a (partially) stripped giant. In the optical band, no significant periodicity or correlation with the X-ray dips was detected, whereas the radio counterpart exhibited a flat to steep spectrum, in contrast to the inverted spectrum typically observed during the hard state of LMXBs.

 Time series data and their time-frequency representation from gravitational-wave interferometers present multiple opportunities for the use of artificial intelligence methods associated with signal and image processing. Closely connected with this is the real-time aspect associated with gravitational-wave interferometers and the astrophysical observations they perform; the discovery potential of these instruments can be significantly enhanced when data processing can be achieved in O(1s) timescales. In this work, we introduce a novel signal and noise identification tool based on the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection framework. For its application into gravitational waves, we will refer to it as GW-YOLO. This tool can provide scene identification capabilities and essential information regarding whether an observed transient is any combination of noise and signal. Additionally, it supplies detailed time-frequency coordinates of the detected objects in the form of pixel masks, an essential property that can be used to understand and characterize astrophysical sources, as well as instrumental noise. The simultaneous identification of noise and signal, combined with precise pixel-level localization, represents a significant advancement in gravitational-wave data analysis. Our approach yields a 50\% detection efficiency for binary black hole signals at a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 15 when such signals overlap with transient noise artifacts. When noise artifacts overlap with binary neutron star signals, our algorithm attains 50\% detection efficiency at an SNR of 30. This presents the first quantitative assessment of the ability to detect astrophysical events overlapping with realistic, instrument noise present in gravitational-wave interferometers.

 This study examines the rotational characteristics of asteroids through statistical modeling of the diameter-period relationship. A statistical evaluation of the diameter-period relationship was conducted using a dataset of 34,326 asteroids. Clustering identified three main groups, including a dense cluster below the spin barrier, a population of small, fast-rotating asteroids, and a more diffuse group. Geometric and density-based analyses showed that the densest region consists of objects with diameters from 3 to 10 km and rotation periods between 3 and 9 hours, some of which extend beyond the spin barrier. Polynomial modeling demonstrated that a third-degree fit provides the most stable representation of the overall trend without overfitting. Additionally, an empirical lower boundary was identified and proposed, below which no asteroid was found in either the main sample or the selected targets.

 - **Abstract**
 We present near-infrared (NIR) and optical observations and analysis of the Type Ibn/Icn supernova (SN) 2023xgo, spanning the period from two days to 100 days past explosion. A comparison of the NIR light curves and color evolution with those of other Type Ibn SNe reveals prominent NIR excess persisting from 15 to 100 days. The spectral energy distribution (SED) is well explained by a combination of a hot blackbody component and a carbon dust model. The dust temperature remained relatively constant at $T=1600\pm100$ K up to $t=60$ d. The estimated dust mass is $\sim1.2 \times10^{-4}~M_{\odot}$. Based on the SN emission of $10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$ at peak luminosity, the evaporation radius is estimated to be $1.2\times10^{16}$ cm, consistent with the expectation from light travel time. The dust shell is located outside the shocked cool dense shell (CDS) at the position of $7.6\times10^{14}$ cm. It suggests that the observed NIR excess originates from pre-existing circumstellar (CS) dust. Considering a typical dust-to-gas mass ratio, the CS gas mass is estimated to be $\simeq10^{-2}~M_{\odot}$, implying a high mass-loss rate of $\sim0.1~M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ from either a low-mass helium star progenitor with a binary interaction, or may be a massive Wolf-Rayet star that experienced a significant eruption.

 - **Abstract**
 The stochastic-$\delta \mathcal{N}$ formalism is widely used to study inflation models in which the quantum diffusion of inflatons dominates the background dynamics, leading to interesting phenomena such as the production of primordial black holes. Among numerical approaches to calculate the curvature perturbation spectrum $\mathcal{P}_\zeta(k)$ in this formalism, the Monte Carlo simulation-based approach has been proposed as a promising choice, especially in multifield cases. In this approach, we generate many paths of inflatons from the initial points to the end of inflation, obtain statistics of $\delta N$ from the paths, and then estimate $\mathcal{P}_\zeta(k)$. However, this method involves a nested Monte Carlo simulation, which requires generating many branch paths from each trunk path at the point corresponding to the scale $k$ of interest, resulting in a high computational cost. In this paper, we propose a new Monte Carlo-based approach that utilizes least squares fitting, introducing two novel features for reducing computational cost. First, we devise a simple estimator of a key statistic $\langle \delta\mathcal{N}_{\mathbf{X}}^2\rangle$, the variance of $\delta \mathcal{N}$ conditioned on the branching point, to avoid nesting path generation. Second, via least squares fitting of a parametric function to the sampled values of the estimator, we obtain not just an estimate of $\mathcal{P}_\zeta(k)$ for a single value of $k$ but an approximating function of $\mathcal{P}_\zeta(k)$ over a range of $k$ of interest. We also conduct numerical demonstrations for concrete inflation models, which show the usefulness of our method.

 - **Abstract**
 The very high-energy (VHE; $>$100 GeV) radiation carries the signatures of the matter-energy interaction in some of the most extreme astrophysical environments. Considering broad emission line blazars, i.e., flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs), the dense photon fields surrounding the relativistic jet can prohibit the particle population from accelerating to very high energies and producing VHE radiation. They can also possibly make the environment opaque for the VHE $\gamma$ rays due to $\gamma\gamma$ pair production, thus explaining the paucity of VHE-detected FSRQs and non-detection of TeV radiation ($>$1 TeV) from them. Here we report, for the first time, a $>$7$\sigma$ detection of an FSRQ, S5 1027+74 ($z=0.123$), in the VHE band, including the first ever detection of TeV emission from an object of this class, using the Fermi Large Area Telescope observations. Its $\gamma$-ray spectrum covering the 100 MeV to 2 TeV band revealed a prominent spectral break with a flat, rising shape above $\sim$10 GeV, a feature never detected from other VHE-detected FSRQs. The radio-to-$\gamma$-ray spectral energy distribution of S5 1027+74 provides strong evidence of a third bump peaking at multi-TeV energies. These enigmatic findings imply that FSRQ jets can accelerate particles to extremely high energies and provide tantalizing clues about the complex radiative environment of relativistic jets.

 We report on the timing and spectral properties of PSR J1838-0655 using joint observations from the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) and the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR). By disentangling the pulsar's emission from its surrounding wind nebula across joint Chandra, NuSTAR, and NICER observations, we find the pulsar's broad-band X-ray spectrum (1.3--79\,keV) is best-described by a broken power-law model. The model features photon indices of $\Gamma_1 = 1.19 \pm 0.07$ and $\Gamma_2 = 1.47 \pm 0.02$ below and above a break energy of $E_{\rm b} = 7.7 \pm 0.8$\,keV. The resulting unabsorbed 2--10\,keV flux from the pulsar is $(9.5^{+0.4}_{-0.3}) \times 10^{-12}~\mathrm{erg\,cm^{-2}\,s^{-1}}$. Furthermore, timing analysis of NICER data spanning MJD 58250 to 60630 reveals a very large glitch occurring around MJD 59300, characterized by a frequency jump of $\Delta \nu = 29.367(7) \times 10^{-6}$ Hz, which can be well explained by the vortex creep model. Phase-resolved spectral analysis indicates a clear anti-correlation between the photon index and the pulse intensity, suggesting spectral hardening at the pulse peak.

 - **Abstract**
 Hot accretion disks around massive protostars provide a unique opportunity to study ice-free silicate grains that cannot be investigated in protoplanetary disks. We conduct a self-consistent investigation into grain-size evolution and its impact on (sub)millimeter-wave emission from massive protostellar disks. Our radiative transfer modeling accounts for dust self-scattering and includes vertical temperature gradients in the disk structure. The results show that once silicate grains grow to sizes exceeding the observing wavelength, enhanced scattering dims the disk emission by 20\%--30\% relative to the blackbody emission expected at the disk surface temperature. By comparing our model with Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array 1.14 mm observations of the disk around the massive protostar GGD27-MM1, we constrain the threshold velocity for collisional fragmentation of silicate grains to approximately 15 m s-1. This fragmentation velocity is lower than the typical maximum collisional velocities in protoplanetary disks around low-mass stars, suggesting that collisional coagulation alone is insufficient for silicate dust to form rocky planetesimals in such environments. Furthermore, our analysis identifies two potential scenarios to better reproduce the bright inner-disk emission of GGD27-MM1. One possibility is that the grain growth is limited to 160 mum by another growth barrier (e.g., collisional bouncing), reducing scattering dimming. Alternatively, the stellar luminosity may be as much as five times higher than current estimates, compensating for the reduced brightness. Future multiwavelength observations, particularly at shorter submillimeter wavelengths, will be crucial to distinguish between these scenarios and further constrain silicate grain coagulation processes in massive protostellar disks.

 We determined the metal/silicate partition coefficients of hydrogen and carbon, DH and DC, simultaneously under typical conditions of Earth's core formation. Experiments demonstrate that both DH and DC diminish in the presence of carbon and hydrogen, respectively, indicating their strong interactions in liquid metal. With these partitioning data, we investigated the core and bulk Earth abundances of hydrogen and carbon based on core formation scenarios that are compatible with the bulk silicate Earth composition and the mass fraction and density deficit of the core. The results of the single-stage core formation modelling are markedly different from those using DH and DC individually determined in earlier experiments, indicating that the Earth building blocks do not match enstatite chondrites in water abundance and require contributions by carbonaceous chondrites. The multi-stage core formation models combined with an Earth accretion scenario accounting for isotopic composition show 0.18-0.49 wt% H and 0.19-1.37 wt% C in the core, leading to 0.53-1.40 wt% H2O (present as H in the core) and 0.07-0.44 wt% C in the bulk Earth. Our modelling also demonstrates that up to 53% and 72% of Earth's water (hydrogen) and carbon, respectively, could have been derived from non-carbonaceous chondritic materials.

          Equilibrium Simplified Chemistries for H2O and CO in three-phase astrochemical models

 - **Abstract**
 Astrochemical models can be greatly simplified, with obvious computational advantages, if the reaction networks for key species can be reduced to a bare minimum. In addition, if chemical equilibrium holds, then simple analytical solutions can be formulated. These have particular advantages in the application to complex models evolving over multi-point spatial grids. In this study, the equilibrium solutions to highly simplified chemical networks for CO and H2O have been re-assessed with particular attention to the formulation of the ice desorption rates in the context of 'three-phase' gas-grain astrochemical models. The analytical solutions have also been updated to account for the chemically inert reservoir of molecules below the surface ice layers, and to include the effects of reactive desorption. We find that a very close match is obtained to the results from detailed three-phase models of the time-dependent astrochemistry, and the abundances are typically accurate to within a factor of two over the entire range of densities and extinction that are applicable to dense clouds and young star-forming regions. In addition, these solutions give accurate results over most of the range of conditions even for systems undergoing rapid dynamical evolution. Although there are some caveats of applicability, we therefore recommend that these solutions be used in models of cold molecular environments where the rapid calculation of the abundances of CO, H2O and atomic coolants is helpful.

 - **Abstract**
 Sun-as-a-star analyses serve as a bridge for comparative studies on solar and stellar activities. To investigate the typical Sun-as-a-star Ha temporal spectral characteristics in solar eruption source regions, we analyzed five different types of solar eruptions, using spectroscopic data from the Chinese Ha Solar Explorer (CHASE). Because the spatially-integral Ha spectrum of source region is mainly contributed by emission from heated plasma in flare ribbons and absorption from cold plasma in evolving filaments, we separately analyze the sub-regions of the source region dominated by different dynamical processes. It is revealed that filament eruptions show emission near Ha line center, accompanied by blueshifted/redshifted absorption, while flare ribbons show Ha line center emission with red asymmetry and line broadening. Moreover, a special spectral signature likely associated with coronal mass ejections (CMEs) is identified: prominent blueshifted absorption without a clear deceleration phase, along with redshifted absorption, which can be used as a probe when searching stellar CMEs. Furthermore, in the X9.0 flare (SOL2024-10-03T12:18) accompanied by a violent CME, the expected blueshifted signal is not visible in the spatially-integral Ha spectra. This suggests that filament-lifting signals associated with CMEs in the source region can be obscured by the simultaneous dominant flare-ribbon emission within the integration region, which may explain the relatively small number of confirmed stellar CMEs observed in Ha. We also find that comparison between the Ha and UV spectral observations can effectively reveal the velocity evolution of erupting filaments and potential existence of associated CMEs.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Stars with masses ranging from 3 to 11 M_\odot exhibit multiple evolutionary paths. Less massive stars in this range conclude their evolution as carbon-oxygen (CO) white dwarfs. However, those that achieve carbon ignition before the pressure by degenerate electron halts the core contraction may either form massive CONe/ONe white dwarfs, or undergo an electron-capture supernova, or photo-disintegrate neon and proceed with further thermonuclear burning, ultimately leading to the formation of a gravitationally unstable iron core. Aims. An evaluation of the impact of the energy loss caused by the production of axion-like-particles (ALPs) on evolution and final destiny of these stars is the main objective of this paper. Methods. We compute various sets of stellar models, all with solar initial composition, varying the strengths of the ALP coupling with photons and electrons. Results. As a consequence of an ALP thermal production, the critical masses for off-center C and Ne ignitions are both shifted upward. When the current bounds for the ALP coupling strengths are assumed, the maximum mass for CO WD progenitors is about 1.1 M_\odot heavier than that obtained without the ALP energy loss, while the minimum mass for a core collapse supernova (CCSN) progenitor is 0.7 M_\odot higher. Conclusions. Current constraints from observed Type II-P supernova light curves and pre-explosive luminosity do not exclude an ALP production within the current bounds. However, the maximum age of CCSN progenitors, as deduced from the star formation rate of the parent stellar population, would require a smaller minimum mass. This discrepancy can be explained by assuming a moderate extra mixing (as due to core overshooting or rotational induced mixing) above the fully convective core that develops during the main sequence.

          Dissociation and destruction of PAHs and PAH clusters induced by absorption of X-rays in protoplanetary discs around T Tauri stars

 - **Abstract**
 Only 8% of the protoplanetary discs orbiting a T Tauri star show emission features of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). As PAHs are strong absorbers of UV radiation, they contribute to the heating of the discs photosphere, shielding of UV radiation that drives photo-chemistry in the disc, and their abundance is a key parameter to determine the strength of photo-evaporative disc winds. We want to understand the photochemical evolution of PAHs in protoplanetary discs around T Tauri stars and thus explain the absence of PAH features. We want to determine whether PAHs are destroyed because of the X-ray emission from their host stars or whether PAHs can withstand these conditions. We developed a model for the absorption of X-rays by PAHs. X-rays with more energy than the K edge of carbon will double ionise PAHs and will vibrationally excite them by ~ 15-35 eV. With a Monte Carlo model, we modelled the dissociation of H, H2, and C2H2 from PAH monomers. Furthermore, we modelled the dissociation of PAH clusters and the desorption of PAH clusters from dust grains caused by X-ray excitation. We find that small PAH clusters will quickly desorb and dissociate into individual molecules. PAH molecules experience rapid loss of H and acetylene C2H2 by the high excitation and will lose C2H2 on average after three X-ray excitations. However, large PAH clusters can stay intact and frozen out on dust grains. Based on our results, we expect a gas-phase PAH abundance that is lower than 0.01 times the ISM abundance and will rapidly decrease over time due to the dissociation of small clusters that are subsequently destroyed. To maintain a higher abundance, replenishment processes must exist such as vertical mixing. Large PAH clusters remain in the disc, frozen out on dust grains, but barely emit PAH features because of their strong thermal coupling to dust grains.

 (abridged)We explore a phenomenological model that quantifies the deviation of the Hubble expansion rate from the standard scenario. The specific form of this model is expressed as $H^{2}(z) = H^{2}_{\rm \Lambda CDM}(\Omega_m, z)[1+\delta(z)]$. We consider three forms of $\delta(z)$: model I, $\delta(z)=\delta_c$; model II, $\delta(z)=\delta_{c}z/(1+z)$, and model III, $\delta(z)=\delta_{c}{\rm ln}(1+z)$. Here, $\delta_c$ represents a constant value. To constrain the models, we utilize a comprehensive set of observational data, including DESI BAO, CMB, CC, SNIa data, and the $H_0$ measured by the SH0ES. Our results show that for most combined datasets, $\delta_c$ tends to take on negative values for models I and II, while consistently taking positive values in model III. Our analysis further discloses that for model I, in which the deviation parameter is redshift-independent, there is a notable 2$\sigma$ deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM model when considering the combined datasets of DESI BAO+CMB+CC+SH0ES. However, this deviation decreases to less than $2\sigma$ once SNIa datasets are included. In contrast, model II remains consistent with the standard $\Lambda$CDM model across all datasets examined. Model III exhibits a significant deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM model, exceeding $2\sigma$ and reaching $3\sigma$ for the full combined datastes. The Akaike Information Criterion indicates that models I and II are consistent with the $\Lambda$CDM model, whereas model III is preferred over the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, with the $\Lambda$CDM model being substantially disfavored for the combined datasets DESI BAO+CMB+CC+SH0ES+DESY5. These results suggest that the Hubble expansion rate likely deviates from the standard $\Lambda$CDM prediction-a conclusion that aligns with various studies on dark energy, wherein dynamic dark energy is often favored over a cosmological constant.

 - **Abstract**
 The standard $\Lambda$CDM model, despite its success, is challenged by persistent observational tensions in the Hubble constant ($H_0$) and the matter clustering amplitude ($S_8$), motivating the exploration of alternative cosmological scenarios. We investigate a dark energy model with a phenomenological interaction in the dark sector, constructed to be exactly degenerate at the background level with the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parameterization. This setup allows us to test whether models with identical expansion histories but distinct physical mechanisms can be distinguished by cosmological data. We perform a Bayesian analysis using a combination of recent datasets: DESI DR2 BAO measurements, DESY5 supernovae, and CMB data from Planck and ACT. We find that both the interacting model and the CPL model provide significantly better fits to the data than $\Lambda$CDM. Although indistinguishable in background observables, the interacting model predicts a distinct matter-sector evolution driven by a late-time sign change in the dark sector interaction at $z \approx 0.8$, corresponding to the $w=-1$ crossing in the CPL description. In this sense, the interacting picture may be considered more physical, since it avoids the problematic crossing by construction. The resulting decay of dark energy into dark matter lowers $S_8$, potentially alleviating the weak-lensing $S_8$ tension. At the same time, it predicts a sharp suppression of the growth rate $f\sigma_8(z)$ at $z \lesssim 0.8$, which is in tension with current measurements of structure formation. This indicates that the model may not simultaneously reconcile the expansion history and the observed growth of cosmic structure, highlighting the need for a more comprehensive analysis to fully assess its viability.

          Radiative signatures of electron-ion shocks in BL Lac type objects

 - **Abstract**
 Shocks are promising sites of particle acceleration in extragalactic jets. In electron-ion shocks, electrons can be heated up to large Lorentz factors, making them an attractive scenario to explain the high minimum electron Lorentz factors regularly needed to describe the emission of BL Lac objects. Still, the thermal electron component is commonly neglected when modelling the observations, although it holds key informations on the shock properties. We model the broadband emission of the HSP blazar Mrk421 employing particle distributions that include a thermal relativistic Maxwellian component at low energies followed by a nonthermal power-law, as motivated by PIC simulations. The observations in the optical/UV and MeV-GeV bands efficiently restrict the nonthermal emission from the Maxwellian electrons, which we use to derive constraints on the basic properties, such as the fraction $\epsilon_e$ of the total shock energy stored in the nonthermal electrons. The best-fit model yields a nonthermal electron power-law with an index of ~2.4, close to predictions from shock acceleration. Successful fits are obtained when the ratio between the Lorentz factor at which the nonthermal distribution begins ($\gamma_{\rm nth}$) and the dimensionless electron temperature ($\theta$) satisfies $\gamma_{\rm nth}/\theta \lesssim 8$. Since $\gamma_{\rm nth}/\theta$ controls $\epsilon_e$, the latter limit implies that at least $\epsilon_e \approx 10\%$ of the shock energy is transferred to the nonthermal electrons. These results are almost insensitive to the shock velocity $\gamma_{\rm sh}$, but radio observations indicate $\gamma_{\rm sh} \gtrsim 5$ since for lower shock velocities the radio fluxes are overproduced by the Maxwellian electrons. If shocks drive the particle energisation, our findings indicate that they operate in the mildly to fully relativistic regime with efficient electron acceleration.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The Kepler Legacy sample is, to this day, the sample of solar-like oscillators with the most exquisite asteroseismic data. In this work, we carry out a detailed modelling of a subsample of these stars for which the surface lithium abundance has also been observed by the GALAH survey and a photometric surface rotation as been measured. Aims. We aim at studying the impact of additional mixing processes on the asteroseismic modelling of Kepler Legacy G and F-type stars. We also investigate whether a single process can be invoked to reproduce the lithium depletion and asteroseismic constraints at the same time. Methods. We use detailed asteroseismic modelling techniques combining global and local minimization techniques. We start by using standard models and then aim at improving this solution by the addition of extra-mixing at the border of convective regions using either convective penetration or turbulence in radiative layers. Results. We find that lower mass models (~ 1M_Sun ) have no problem in reproducing the observed lithium depletion using only turbu- lence in the radiative zone, similarly to solar models. F-type stars, having a shallower convective envelope, are unaffected by additional turbulence at the BCZ, but require significant convective penetration values to actually reproduce the observed lithium depletion. The extent of this penetration is however incompatible with the frequency separation ratios. Conclusions. We conclude that the impact of extra-mixing is moderate for solar-type stars of the Kepler Legacy sample and well within the requirements of the PLATO mission. For more massive stars (~ 1.5M_Sun ), we conclude that the behaviour of the frequency separation ratios must be further investigated, as even models with large convective penetration at the base of their convective envelope are unable to reproduce them.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the design and initial testing of a low-frequency radio telescope prototype developed for the CANTAR (Colombian Antarctic Telescope for 21-cm Absorption during Reionization) experiment. Operating from 100 to 200 MHz, the system integrates a blade dipole antenna inspired by the EDGES high-band design with a software-defined radio (SDR) receiver. We report simulations of antenna impedance and beam chromaticity, along with SDR performance tests (Limenet Mini, Ettus E310, USRP2920). A dual-stage low-noise amplifier reduces system temperature, enabling foreground-sensitive observations. Radiometric estimates suggest sub-mK sensitivity is achievable with 1000 h of integration. This prototype forms part of Colombia's emerging infrastructure for 21-cm cosmology, with deployments planned in low-RFI sites in the Colombian Andes and Antarctica.

 - **Abstract**
 A key challenge in modeling (exo)planetary atmospheres lies in generating extensive opacity datasets that cover the wide variety of possible atmospheric composition, pressure, and temperature conditions. This critical step requires specific knowledge and can be considerably time-consuming. To circumvent this issue, most available codes approximate the total opacity by summing the contributions of individual molecular species during the radiative transfer calculation. This approach neglects inter-species interactions, which can be an issue for precisely estimating the climate of planets. To produce accurate opacity data, such as correlated-k tables, chi factor corrections of the far-wings of the line profile are required. We propose an update of the chi factors of CO$_2$ absorption lines that are relevant for terrestrial planets (pure CO$_2$, CO$_2$-N$_2$ and CO$_2$-H$_2$O). These new factors are already implemented in an original user-friendly open-source tool designed to calculate high resolution spectra, named SpeCT. The latter enables to produce correlated-k tables for mixtures made of H$_2$O, CO$_2$ and N$_2$, accounting for inter-species broadening. In order to facilitate future updates of these chi factors, we also provide a review of all the relevant laboratory measurements available in the literature for the considered mixtures. Finally, we provide in this work 8 different correlated-k tables and continua for pure CO$_2$, CO$_2$-N$_2$, CO$_2$-H$_2$O and CO$_2$-H$_2$O-N$_2$ mixtures based on the MT_CKD formalism (for H$_2$O), and calculated using SpeCT. These opacity data can be used to study various planets and atmospheric conditions, such as Earth's paleo-climates, Mars, Venus, Magma ocean exoplanets, telluric exoplanets.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive study of the optical and dynamical properties of a rotating black hole immersed in a Dehnen-type $(1,4,0)$ galactic dark matter halo, modeled by a double power-law density profile commonly used to describe realistic galactic cores. By extending our previous Schwarzschild-Dehnen solution using a modified Newman-Janis algorithm, we construct a Kerr-like axisymmetric spacetime that smoothly incorporates both black hole rotation and the influence of the surrounding dark matter halo. We systematically investigate the effects of the halo parameters-the central density and halo radius-on horizon structure, the shape and extent of the ergoregion, and the null geodesics associated with black hole shadows. Our results show that the presence of a dense or extended halo expands the event horizon and ergoregion, and significantly alters the size and distortion of the black hole shadow. Furthermore, by applying the WKB approximation to scalar field perturbations, we compute the quasinormal mode (QNM) spectra and demonstrate that the frequencies and damping times of ringdown signals are highly sensitive to the halo profile. These results open promising avenues for probing the dark matter environment of astrophysical black holes through black hole imaging and gravitational wave observations.

 - **Abstract**
 The classic model of the Local Group (LG) is that of two dominant constituents, the Milky Way and M31, first separating and then detaching from the Hubble flow, leading to a nearly radial approaching orbit. This simple model has been confronted by new measurements of the 3D M31 kinematics, by cosmological simulations, and by theoretical understanding of the impact of massive substructures such as the Large Magellanic Cloud. This article explores the consequences of new observations and theory on the determination of the mass and dynamics of the LG. The M31 tangential velocity measurement and contribution from the cosmological constant both increase the implied timing mass of the LG to be $\sim 5 \times 10^{12}$ M$_\odot$. Timing mass estimates for the LG tend to be larger than the sum of the Milky Way and M31 halo masses, and larger than independent LG mass estimators. Precision future kinematics have the potential to explore the origin of this difference, shed light on dark matter in the LG, the origin of its angular momentum, and possibly even local values of cosmological parameters.

 - **Abstract**
 We detail the population properties of merging compact objects using 158 mergers from the cumulative Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog 4.0, which includes three types of binary mergers: binary neutron star, neutron star--black hole binary, and binary black hole mergers. We resolve multiple over- and under-densities in the black hole mass distribution: features persist at primary masses of $10\,M_\odot$ and $35\,M_\odot$ with a possible third feature at $\sim 20\,M_\odot$. These are departures from an otherwise power-law-like continuum that steepens above $35\,M_\odot$. Binary black holes with primary masses near $10\,M_\odot$ are more likely to have less massive secondaries, with a mass ratio distribution peaking at $q = 0.74^{+0.13}_{-0.13}$, potentially a signature of stable mass transfer during binary evolution. Black hole spins are inferred to be non-extremal, with 90\% of black holes having $\chi < 0.57$, and preferentially aligned with binary orbits, implying many merging binaries form in isolation. However, we find a significant fraction, 0.24--0.42, of binaries have negative effective inspiral spins, suggesting many could be formed dynamically in gas-free environments. We find evidence for correlation between effective inspiral spin and mass ratio, though it is unclear if this is driven by variation in the mode of the distribution or the width. (Abridged)

 - **Abstract**
 We use Magellan/MIKE echelle spectroscopy to conduct an in-depth chemodynamical analysis of the most luminous star-forming region within the metal-poor starburst dwarf galaxy CGCG 007-025. Leveraging the exceptional high resolution (R$\sim$50,000) and broad wavelength coverage, we apply Bayesian inference to simultaneously model the fluxes of 30 emission lines spanning the wavelength range 3400-9200Å. Employing a two-region ionisation model, we characterise various gas properties including electron temperature, electron density, and chemical abundances across different elements. Our direct-method inferred metallicity yields $\rm 12+\log(O/H)=7.77\pm0.03$, placing the galaxy in the metal-poor regime. Furthermore, Metal-to-Oxygen ratios such as log(S/O), log(Ne/O) or log(Ar/O) are in full agreement with the values derived for the Milky Way, consistent with expectations from stellar evolutionary models. The brightest emission lines are kinematically complex, with modelling requiring up to four distinct components. The exceptional resolution and signal-to-noise ratio of the data unveil asymmetric and wide ($\sigma_{HeII} \approx$ 35km/s) HeII$\lambda$4686 emission. The flux ratio of this nebular line, together with the absence of other high ionisation species such as [NeV]$\lambda$3426, indicates the presence of fast radiative shocks. This dataset underscores the capability of echelle spectroscopy in delivering comprehensive chemodynamical analyses of starbursts in the Local Volume.

 We present the confirmation of HD 190360 d, a warm ($P=88.690^{+0.051}_{-0.049}~\mathrm{d}$), low-mass ($m\sin i=10.23^{+0.81}_{-0.80}~\mathrm{M_\oplus}$) planet orbiting the nearby ($d=16.0$ pc), Sun-like (G7) star HD 190360. We detect HD 190360 d at high statistical significance even though its radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude is only $K=1.48\pm0.11~\mathrm{m~s^{-1}}$. Such low-amplitude signals are often challenging to confirm due to potential confusion with low-amplitude stellar signals. The HD 190360 system previously had two known planets: the $1.7~\mathrm{M_J}$ (true mass) HD 190360 b on a $7.9$ yr orbit and the $21~\mathrm{M_\oplus}$ (minimum mass) HD 190360 c on a $17.1$ d orbit. Here, we present an in-depth analysis of the HD 190360 planetary system that comprises more than 30 years of RV measurements and absolute astrometry from the Hipparcos and Gaia spacecrafts. Our analysis uses more than 1400 RVs, including nearly 100 from NEID. The proper motion anomaly as measured by these two astrometric missions solves for the dynamical mass of HD 190360 b and contributes to our understanding of the overall system architecture, while the long baseline of RVs enables the robust characterization of HD 190360 c and confirms the discovery of HD 190360 d.

 3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object to visit our Solar System, and only the second to display a clear coma. Infrared spectroscopy with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) provides the opportunity to measure its coma composition and determine the primary activity drivers. We report the first results from our JWST NIRSpec campaign for 3I/ATLAS, at an inbound heliocentric distance of $r_H=3.32$ au. The spectral images (spanning 0.6-5.3 $\mu$m) reveal a CO2 dominated coma, with enhanced outgassing in the sunward direction, and the presence of H2O, CO, OCS, water ice and dust. The coma CO2/H2O mixing ratio of $8.0\pm1.0$ is among the highest ever observed in a comet, and is 6.1-sigma above the trend as a function of heliocentric distance for long-period and Jupiter-family comets (excluding the outlier C/2016 R2). Our observations are compatible with an intrinsically CO2-rich nucleus, which may indicate that 3I/ATLAS contains ices exposed to higher levels of radiation than Solar System comets, or that it formed close to the CO2 ice line in its parent protoplanetary disk. A low coma H2O gas abundance may also be implied, for example, due to inhibited heat penetration into the nucleus, which could suppress the H2O sublimation rate relative to CO2 and CO.

          Far-Infrared Emission from a Late Supernova Remnant in an Inhomogeneous Medium

 - **Abstract**
 The interstellar dust grains are swept up during the expansion of the supernova (SN) remnant, they penetrate behind the shock front, where they are heated and destroyed in the hot gas. This leads to a change in emissivity of such grains. In this work, we consider the evolution of the infrared (IR) luminosity of the SN remnant expanding into an inhomogeneous interstellar medium with lognormal distribution of the density fluctuations. The IR luminosity of the swept-up interstellar dust rapidly increases during the first several thousand years after the SN explosion, and reaches the maximum value. Afterwards, it decreases due to the destruction of the dust grains in hot gas and their declining emissivity in the cooling down gas of the shell. We show how the IR luminosity of dust in the SN remnant depends on the dispersion of the gas density in front of the SN shock front. We find that for the significant period of time (40 - 50 kyr) the maximum of the dust IR luminosity peaks at the range centered at 70$\mu$m. Therefore, this band can be considered as the most optimal range for studying the late SN remnants. We illustrate that during evolution, the dust temperature changes from 70 to 20 K, and only slightly depends on the inhomogeneity of the medium. In the radiative phase, the strong emission lines of metal ions emerge above the dust continuum. Their luminosity rapidly increases and exceeds the dust continuum luminosity by $\sim 10-10^3$ times. The point in time when the high luminosity in the lines is reached strongly depends on the inhomogeneity of the medium. We discuss possibilities for detection of the IR emission both in dust continuum and in lines. We expect that their ratios will allow to estimate the inhomogeneity of the medium, where the remnant is expanding.

          Free-floating Planets Produced by Planet-Planet Scatterings: Ejection Velocity and Survival Rate of Their Moons

 - **Abstract**
 The discovery of numerous free-floating planets (FFPs) has intensified interest in their origins and dynamical histories. A leading formation mechanism is planet-planet scatterings in unstable multi-planetary systems, which can naturally lead to planetary ejections. If these planets originally host moons, it remains an open question whether such satellites can remain gravitationally bound to FFPs after ejection. In this work, we investigate both the ejection velocity of FFPs produced by planet-planet scatterings and the survival rate of their potential moons; we estimate the latter by determining the statistics of the minimum planet-planet distance prior to planet ejection, and comparing it to the initial orbital radius of the moon relative to its host planet. Using the circular restricted three-body framework, we derive an analytical boundary for the ejection velocity based on Jacobi energy conservation, which agrees with the results of integrations. We also identify a minimum planetary mass required for successful ejection. For two-planet systems with finite planetary masses, we use simulations and analytical arguments to determine how the ejection velocity scales with the planetary mass and initial semi-major axis. Extending our analysis to three-planet systems yields similar results, reinforcing the robustness of our conclusions. These findings offer insights into the property of FFPs and inform future efforts to search for exomoons around them.

 - **Abstract**
 The dipole in the angular distribution of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) is typically attributed to the Doppler effect and our motion relative to the CMB rest frame. It is expected that observations of large-scale structures would also exhibit a related kinematic dipole, helping to confirm the kinematic origin of the CMB dipole. However, numerous studies of the large-scale structure dipole have shown significant discrepancies with predictions based on the CMB. In this work, we investigate how considering the clustering dipole affects the cosmic large-scale structure distribution dipole using the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) Very Large Array (VLA) Sky Survey (NVSS) and examine the nonlinear regime to calculate the correlation between the clustering dipole and the kinematic dipole. We also determine whether these outcomes help reconcile previous measurements of the NVSS dipole with predictions based on the CMB. Additionally, we explore a model in which the distribution of matter on large scales might be intrinsically anisotropic. Using the remnant discrepancy between the observed and predicted dipole, we derive an upper limit for the amplitude of intrinsic anisotropy and calculate the clustering for this model. Furthermore, we investigate these results within the framework of modified gravity theories, specifically the $f(R)$ gravity model. By examining this model, it is possible to gain a better understanding of how the cosmic dark energy component affects the dipole. Finally, by comparing these two models, we can see that the $f(R)$ model predicts a higher clustering dipole compared to the standard cosmological model, which explains the discrepancy between the kinetic and clustering dipoles and leads to a higher dipole amplitude.

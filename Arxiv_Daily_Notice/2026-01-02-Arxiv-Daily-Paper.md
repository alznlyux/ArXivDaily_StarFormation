- **Abstract**
 Although many globular clusters (GCs) have been identified in the Galaxy, their population is estimated to be incomplete, especially in regions with strong crowding and interstellar extinction such as the Galactic bulge and this http URL Lyrae stars, as bright standard candles and tracers of old stellar populations, are powerful tools for finding GCs in these regions, and large catalogs of such stars have recently become available. We aim to construct a sample of RR Lyrae stars with six-dimensional information (three-dimensional positions, proper motions, and metallicities) in the Galactic plane and bulge, and to exploit it using a hierarchical clustering algorithm to search for Galactic substructures. We build a sample of fundamental-mode RR Lyrae (RRab) stars with positions, distances, proper motions, and photometric metallicity estimates from Gaia and VVV data. Using a clustering algorithm calibrated to optimize GC recovery, we identify groups of RRab stars with similar locations in the six-dimensional parameter space. The most promising groups are selected by comparison with the properties of known GCs. We recover many RRab groups associated with known Galactic GCs and derive the first RR Lyrae-based distances for BH 140 and NGC 5986. We also detect small groups of two to three RRab stars at distances up to ~25 kpc that are not associated with any known GC, but display GC-like distributions in all six parameters. Several of these groups, mostly pairs, lie toward the Galactic bulge but show distinct proper motions or distances, suggesting they may not belong to the bulge population. Overall, our approach identifies dozens of GC-like RRab groups in the Galactic plane and bulge, which are excellent targets for follow-up observations. Future radial velocity measurements can test whether the RRab members of these groups are truly co-moving.

- **Abstract**
 Extinction curves contain key information on interstellar dust composition and size distribution, with the 2175 Å bump being the most prominent feature. We analyze 20 sightlines toward M31 using HST/STIS UV spectroscopy combined with multi-band photometry to characterize this feature. The extinction curves show substantial diversity, from MW-like shapes to flatter profiles with $R_V$ reaching up to $\sim5.8$. The strength of the 2175 Å feature varies widely, including two sightlines where the bump is essentially absent. The bump central wavelength spans a broader range than previously reported, while its width remains consistent with earlier studies. A moderate positive correlation is found between bump strength ($c_3$) and width ($\gamma$). We derive an average UV extinction curve toward M31 with $R_V \approx 3.53$. These results provide new constraints on dust properties and their spatial variations in this galaxy.

- **Abstract**
 Wide-field rapid sky surveys serve as critical observational methods for time-domain astronomical research. The Antarctic region, with several months of continuous dark nights annually, is an ideal site for time-domain astronomical observations. The Antarctic TianMu Staring Observation Project aims to deploy a fleet of small telescopes, adopting an array observation model to conduct time-domain optical observations in Antarctica, featuring wide-sky coverage, high-cadence sampling, long-period staring, and simultaneous multi-band measurements. Considering the severe challenges optical telescopes face in Antarctica, including extremely low temperatures, unattended operation, and limited power supply and network transmission, we have designed and developed the Antarctic TianMu prototype telescope based on drift-scan charge-coupled device technology. In October 2022, our prototype (with an aperture of 18 cm), named AT-Proto was transported to Zhongshan Station in Antarctica aboard China's 39th Antarctic Research Expedition. It has since operated stably and reliably in the frigid environment for over two years, demonstrating the significant advantages of this technology in polar astronomical observations. The experimental observation results of AT-Proto provide a solid foundation for the subsequent construction of a time-domain astronomy observation array in Antarctica.

- **Abstract**
 The Antarctic TianMu Staring Observation Program is a time-domain optical sky survey project carried out in Antarctica, capable of large sky coverage, high-cadence sampling, and long-period staring. It utilizes the exceptional observing conditions in Antarctica to conduct high-cadence time-domain sky surveys. At present, we have successfully developed an 18-cm aperture Antarctic TianMu prototype, which has been deployed at Zhongshan Station in Antarctica for two consecutive years of trouble-free observations, during which more than 300,000 original images were obtained. This paper systematically outlines the commissioning data of the prototype telescope in 2023, the primary data processing pipeline, and the preliminary data products. The core pipeline encompasses four key stages: Data preprocessing, instrumental effect correction, astrometric solution, and full-field stellar photometry. Here, we release the 2023 data products, which specifically include reduced image data and a photometric catalog, for which, preliminary analyses demonstrate robust performance. Using Gaia Data Release 3 as a reference catalog, the astrometric precision, quantified by the root mean square of positional errors, is determined to be better than approximately 2 arcseconds, validating the observational capabilities of the system. For a 30-second exposure, the detection limit in the G-band is achieved at 15.00~mag, with a detection threshold of 1.5~$\sigma$. The photometric errors are below 0.1~mag for the majority of stars brighter than 14.00~mag. Furthermore, it improves significantly, reaching better than 0.01~mag for most stars brighter than 11.00~mag and 12.00~mag when employing the adaptive aperture photometry and point spread function photometry methods, respectively.

- **Abstract**
 Aims: We investigate the utility of Rubin's Data Preview 1 for estimating stellar number density profile in the Milky Way halo. Methods: Stellar broad-band near-UV to near-IR $ugrizy$ photometry released in Rubin's Data Preview 1 is used to estimate distance and metallicity for blue main sequence stars brighter than $r=24$ in three $\sim$1.1. sq.~deg. fields at southern Galactic latitudes. Results: Compared to TRILEGAL simulations of the Galaxy's stellar content by (Dal Tio, 2022), we find a significant deficit of blue main sequence turn-off stars with $22 < r < 24$. We interpret this discrepancy as a signature of a much steeper halo number density profile at galactocentric distances $10-50$ kpc than the cannonical $\sim1/r^3$ profile assumed in TRILEGAL simulations. Conclusions: This interpretation is consistent with earlier suggestions based on observations of more luminous, but much less numerous, evolved stellar populations, and a few pencil beam surveys of blue main sequence stars in the northern sky. These results bode well for the future Galactic halo exploration with Rubin's Legacy Survey of Space and Time.

          Tidally Trapped Two-pole Pulsations Discovered in a Close Binary with a Massive $β$ Cephei Star

- **Abstract**
 Tidally tilted pulsators (TTPs), whose pulsation axis aligns with the binary's semi-major axis, represent a newly established class of oscillators in binary systems. While all previously known TTPs are either $\delta$ Scuti or subdwarf B-type stars, their existence has remained unidentified in more massive $\beta$ Cephei variables. Here, we report the discovery of tidally trapped pulsations in the massive ellipsoidal variable HD~329379, based on photometry from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). Our analysis reveals a $\beta$ Cephei pulsator in a 2.25-day orbit whose pulsation mode amplitude is strongly modulated with the orbital frequency. Based on our analysis, we concluded that this modulation can be explained by pulsations with significantly larger amplitude near the star's two tidal poles (apsides). We interpret this as a tidally distorted quadrupole pulsation chariacteristiced by trapped two-pole pulsations, with a pulsation axis aligned with the tidal axis. This represents the first identification of such a pulsation mode in a $\beta$ Cephei star, which differs from single-sided pulsations observed in previous works, marking a rare and important discovery. Our work extends the family of TTPs beyond $\delta$ Scuti and subdwarf B-type stars to include more massive $\beta$ Cephei variables. In particular, the two-pole pulsator HD~329379 stands out as the prototype of a new class of TTPs in massive stars. These results not only provide a new insight to probe the interior structure and evolutionary state for massive stars but also offer a unique opportunity to study the interaction between pulsations and strong tidal distortions.

          Improved lanthanide constraints for the kilonova AT 2017gfo

- **Abstract**
 Spectroscopic observations of the kilonova AT 2017gfo provide a unique opportunity to identify signatures from individual heavy elements freshly synthesised via the {\it r}-process, the nucleosynthetic channel responsible for producing $\sim$half of all trans-iron-group elements. Limitations in the available atomic data have historically hampered comprehensive line identification studies; however, renewed interest has led to the generation of improved (more complete and accurately calibrated) line lists for {\it r}-process species. Here we demonstrate the utility of such data, by exploiting newly generated line lists for the lanthanides to model the photospheric-phase 3.4d X-shooter spectrum of AT 2017gfo with the radiative transfer tool \textsc{tardis}. We find the data can only be reproduced by invoking a substantially diminished lanthanide mass fraction ($X_{\textsc{ln}}$) than that proposed by previous studies. Specifically, our model necessitates $X_{\textsc{ln}} \approx 2.5 \times 10^{-3}$, a value $20 \times$ lower than previously claimed. This substantial reduction in $X_{\textsc{ln}}$ is driven by our inclusion of much more complete lanthanide line information that enables better estimation of their total contribution to the observations. We encourage future modelling works to exploit all atomic data advances, and also encourage continued efforts to generate the necessary data for the remaining {\it r}-process species of interest.

          From Nbody1 to Nbody7: the Growth of Sverres Industry

- **Abstract**
 From NBODY1 to NBODY6 : The Growth of an Industry is the title of a 1999 invited review by Sverre Aarseth, for Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific (PASP). I took this as an inspiration for the title of this paper; it describes how Sverres NBODY Industry has further grown since 90s of the previous century, and how it is further flourishing and hopefully developing, in his spirit, even after the sad news of his passing away reached us. My contact and friendship with Sverre started a few decades ago being sent to Cambridge to learn NBODY5, counting input parameters, and learning about the fact that even a sophisticated code (which had already at that time quite a history) requires permanent maintenance and bug fixes. Managed by Sverre, who relentlessly ran his code and responded to the widely spread crowd of customer colleagues. There has been a phase of massive and fast development and improvements due to vectorization, parallelization, GRAPE and GPU acceleration, and Sverre has been always on top of it if not ahead, but also fully adopting ideas of collaborators, once they tested well. NBODY6++GPU and NBODY7 entered the scene, and also recent new competitors, such as PETAR or BIFROST . We all have learnt a lot from Sverre, and strive to continue in his open-minded spirit, for open source and exchange. A striking evidence for the further growth of the industry is the number of papers here (and two of them follow in this session, but also in other sessions) using and further developing the aforementioned codes, as well as the occurrence of new and competing codes, which keep the field alive.

- **Abstract**
 Based on the spatial distribution of objects in the solar neighbourhood with a radius of 20 parsecs, and after correcting for the incompleteness of observational data, an expression was obtained for estimating the probability of finding an object at a given distance from the Sun. According to these estimates, with a probability of about 0.5, there exists a brown dwarf in the immediate solar vicinity (< 1.2 pc). The possible multiplicity of this hypothetical object is discussed, as well as the reasons why it has not yet been detected.

          A millimeter methanol maser ring tracing the deceleration of the heat wave powered by the massive protostellar accretion outburst in G358.93-0.03 MM1

- **Abstract**
 We present multi-epoch, multi-band ALMA imaging of the new Class II millimeter methanol masers excited during the accretion outburst of the massive protostar G358.93-0.03 MM1. The highest angular resolution image (24 mas $\approx$ 160 au) reveals a nearly complete, circular ring of strong maser spots in the 217.2992 GHz ($v_t$=1) maser line that closely circumscribes the dust continuum emission from MM1. Weaker maser emission lies inside the eastern and southern halves of the maser ring, generally coincident with the centimeter masers excited during the outburst, but avoiding the densest parts of the hot core gas traced by high excitation lines of CH$_3$CN. Using a variety of fitting techniques on the image cubes of the two strongest maser lines, each observed over 3-4 epochs, we find the diameter of the ring increased by $\gtrsim$60% (from $\approx$1100 to $\approx$1800 au in the 217 GHz line) over 200 days, consistent with an average radial propagation rate of $\approx$0.01c, while the maser intensity declined exponentially. Fitting the angular extent of the millimeter masers versus time yields a power law of index 0.39$\pm$0.06, which also reproduces the observed extent of the 6.7 GHz masers in the first VLBI epoch of R. A. Burns et al. (2020). This exponent is consistent with the prediction of radius vs. time in the Taylor-von Neumann-Sedov self-similar solution for an intense spherical explosion from a point source ($R \propto t^{2/5}$). These results demonstrate the explosive nature of accretion outbursts in massive protostars and their ability to generate subluminal heat waves traceable by centimeter and millimeter masers for several months as the energy traverses the surrounding molecular material.

- **Abstract**
 To enhance the efficiency, scalability, and cross-survey applicability of stellar parameter inference in large spectroscopic datasets, we present a modular, parallelized Python framework with automated error estimation, built on the LAMOST Atmospheric Parameter Pipeline (LASP) originally implemented in IDL. Rather than a direct code translation, this framework refactors LASP with two complementary modules: LASP-CurveFit, a new implementation of the LASP fitting procedure that runs on a CPU, preserving legacy logic while improving data I/O and multithreaded execution efficiency; and LASP-Adam-GPU, a GPU-accelerated method that introduces grouped optimization by constructing a joint residual function over multiple observed and model spectra, enabling high-throughput parameter inference across tens of millions of spectra. Applied to 10 million LAMOST spectra, the framework reduces runtime from 84 to 48 hr on the same CPU platform and to 7 hr on an NVIDIA A100 GPU, while producing results consistent with those from the original pipeline. The inferred errors agree well with the parameter variations from repeat observations of the same target (excluding radial velocities), while the official empirical errors used in LASP are more conservative. When applied to DESI DR1, our effective temperatures and surface gravities agree better with APOGEE than those from the DESI pipeline, particularly for cool giants, while the latter performs slightly better in radial velocity and metallicity. These results suggest that the framework delivers reliable accuracy, efficiency, and transferability, offering a practical approach to parameter inference in large spectroscopic surveys. The code and DESI-based catalog are available via \dataset[DOI: https://doi.org/10.12149/101679]{this https URL} and \dataset[DOI: https://doi.org/10.12149/101675]{this https URL}, respectively.

          Distributions of wide binary stars in theory and in Gaia data: III. Orbital momenta, masses, and manifestations of MOND

- **Abstract**
 Using the censored catalog of 103,169 resolved Gaia DR3 binary stars with accurate astrometric data for each component, a new observable, object-specific parameter is computed for each pair: the projected orbital momentum. This parameter is the product of four functions of physical characteristics: total mass, semimajor axis, eccentricity, and inclination angle. Using the previously estimated marginal probability densities of eccentricity and semimajor axis, and assuming an isotropic orientation of binary systems, the sample distribution of mass was adjusted using a concordance metric of the observed and synthetic distributions of orbital momenta and an ad hoc functional model. The best-fitting mass density model is found to faithfully reproduce the observed dependence of orbital momenta on apparent separation, although the absolute luminosity distributions indicate a tendency of the widest systems to more frequently include solar-type primaries. The anticipated manifestation of MOND is computed in the investigated parameter space \{separation, momentum\}. This effect is absent in the given data. The median total mass of the widest Gaia binaries is found to be somewhat higher than that of the tighter pairs, which is interpreted as a dynamical age effect.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we propose an approach combining diffusion models and inverse problems for the reconstruction of circumstellar disk images. Our method builds upon the Rhapsodie framework for polarimetric imaging, substituting its classical prior with a diffusion model trained on synthetic data. Our formulation explicitly incorporates stellar leakage while efficiently handling missing data and high level noise inherent to high-contrast polarimetric imaging. Experiments show significant improvement over conventional methods within our framework of assumptions, opening new perspectives for studying circumstellar environments.

          Simulation of Time-dependent Karhunen-Loeve Phase Screens: an Ergodic Approach

 - **Abstract**
 Time-dependent phase screens in ground-based astronomy are typically simulated in the so-called frozen-screen approximation by establishing a static phase screen on a large pupil and dragging an aperture equivalent to the size of the actual input pupil across this oversized phase screen. The speed of this motion sweeping through the large phase screen is equivalent to a wind speed that changes the phase screen as a function of time. The ergodic ansatz replaces this concept by constructing the structure function in a three-dimensional volume -- a sphere for reasons of computational efficiency -- , sampling phase screens by two-dimensional planar cuts through that volume, and dragging them along the surface normal at some speed which generates a video of a phase screen. This manuscript addresses the linear algebra of populating the three-dimensional volume with phase screens of the von-Karman model of atmospheric turbulence.

          Probabilistic Inference of Cosmological Density Parameters from Synthetic Hubble Expansion Data of Varying SNR Using Diverse Artificial Neural Network Architectures

 - **Abstract**
 This paper builds upon ParamANN's novel approach (S. Pal & R. Saha 2024) of using ANNs to infer cosmological density parameters by determining optimal architecture for varying synthetic Hubble data SNRs in estimating the density parameters $\Omega_{m, 0}$ and $\Omega_{\Lambda, 0}$ across redshift values $z \in [0, 1]$. To generate the synthetic data, this study randomly sampled initial free parameter values at $z=0$ from theoretically motivated priors and evolved them backwards using the first Friedmann Equation to generate clean $H(z)$ curves. Then, this paper adds realistic noise of high, normal, and low SNR by sampling relative uncertainties from a Gaussian KDE on 47 real data observations compiled by A. Bouali et al. (2023). In the end, this study found that a RNN that uses BiLSTM is the most effective for high and normal SNR data across four quantitative metrics. On the other hand, a combination of convolution and recurrent layers that uses GRU performed the best for low SNR data across the same four metrics. A comparison between the results of this paper's ANN predictions and those of ParamANN shows that all architectures tested in this paper regardless of training SNR are statistically consistent within 1 standard deviation of ParamANN. However, most ANN results are not statistically consistent within 3 standard deviations of Planck Collaboration et al. (2020), showing a significant difference between ANN and the more traditional MCMC methods used by Planck collaboration.

          Revealing evolution of Dark Energy density from observations

 - **Abstract**
 We present a model--independent reconstruction of the normalized dark energy density function, $X(z) \equiv \rho_{\mathrm{de}}(z)/\rho_{\mathrm{de}}(0)$, derived directly from the DES-SN5YR Type~Ia supernova sample. The analysis employs an inversion formalism that relates the derivative of the distance modulus, $\mu^{\prime}(z)$, to the expansion history, allowing the data to determine the shape of $X(z)$ without assuming a specific equation--of--state or dark energy density parameterization. A statistically optimized binning of the supernova sample (using 17 intervals following the Freedman--Diaconis criterion and 34 following Scott's rule) ensures a stable estimation of $\mu^{\prime}(z)$ and a controlled propagation of uncertainties throughout the inversion process. The resulting $X(z)$ remains statistically consistent with a constant value within one standard deviation across the entire redshift range, showing no significant evidence for an evolving dark energy component at present. In a direct comparison among $\Lambda$CDM, CPL, and the quadratic $X^2(z)$ parameterization -- where CPL and $X^2(z)$ each introduce two additional free parameters relative to $\Lambda$CDM -- the CPL model attains the best statistical agreement with the data, albeit only marginally and strictly within this restricted model set. These outcomes indicate that current observations are compatible with an almost constant dark energy density ($w \simeq -1$), while the inversion framework remains sensitive to subtle departures that forthcoming high--precision surveys could resolve.

 - **Abstract**
 Investigating the multi-scale fragmentation of dense clumps into compact cores is essential for understanding the processes that govern the initial distribution of mass in stellar clusters and how high-mass stars ($>8~M_{\odot}$) form. We present a catalog of the hierarchical continuum structure from 904 clumps observed in the ALMAGAL program, a high resolution ($0.15-0.8$\arcsec) 1.38 mm Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) large program targeting dense clumps capable of high-mass star formation throughout the Galactic disk. We use \verb|astrodendro|, a dendrogram-based algorithm, on a uniform linear resolution (2000 au) version of the data to extract 5160 continuum structures with effective radii spanning $800-42000$ au and estimated masses between $~0.05-670~M_{\odot}$. With our large sample, we statistically examine the difference in clump properties for regions with varying levels of hierarchical complexity. We find that clumps exhibiting the richest hierarchical morphology have distributions with higher dust temperatures, surface densities, luminosity-to-mass (\textit{L/M}) ratios, and most massive core (MMC) masses, indicating that these regions tend to be at later evolutionary stages. We find a positive correlation between the mass of cores from the ALMAGAL core catalog and the surface density of their surrounding structures identified in this work. However, this correlation is weaker for cores in more evolved clumps, where lower mass cores can be found at higher local surface densities. This could indicate that some cores accrete mass less efficiently from the intra-clump reservoir than others, despite the total available mass increasing over time, a scenario that is congruent with a clump-fed core accretion model.

 - **Abstract**
 Analyzing large-scale scientific datasets presents substantial challenges due to their sheer volume, structural complexity, and the need for specialized domain knowledge. Automation tools, such as PandasAI, typically require full data ingestion and lack context of the full data structure, making them impractical as intelligent data analysis assistants for datasets at the terabyte scale. To overcome these limitations, we propose InferA, a multi-agent system that leverages large language models to enable scalable and efficient scientific data analysis. At the core of the architecture is a supervisor agent that orchestrates a team of specialized agents responsible for distinct phases of the data retrieval and analysis. The system engages interactively with users to elicit their analytical intent and confirm query objectives, ensuring alignment between user goals and system actions. To demonstrate the framework's usability, we evaluate the system using ensemble runs from the HACC cosmology simulation which comprises several terabytes.

          Strategy for identifying Vera C. Rubin Observatory kilonova candidates for targeted gravitational-wave searches

 - **Abstract**
 Since the observation of the binary neutron star merger GW170817 and the associated kilonova AT2017gfo, the next joint gravitational-wave/optical kilonova has been highly anticipated. Overlapping observations between the Vera C. Rubin Observatory and the international gravitational-wave detector network are expected soon. Wide-field survey facilities, such as Rubin, can serve dual roles in gravitational-wave astronomy: conducting dedicated optical counterpart searches following gravitational-wave triggers and, through surveys such as the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), providing opportunities for fortuitous kilonova discoveries during routine operations. We use simulations to develop a strategy for identifying kilonova candidates observed by Rubin and processed by the Fink broker. These candidates can be used as astrophysical triggers for a targeted gravitational-wave search. We simulate kilonovae light-curves for the first year of Rubin with the latest observing strategy for the Wide-Fast-Deep and the Deep Drilling Fields. Assuming a kilonova rate of 250 Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$, we find that Rubin brokers should observe $\sim 4$ kilonovae per year with at least one alert above a signal-to-noise ratio of 5 within the gravitational-wave detector horizon ($\sim 350$ Mpc). Most of these will be faint, and detected 1-2 days following the neutron star merger. Photometric and spectroscopic follow-up will be limited to large telescopes. Using archival data from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and our proposed selection criteria, we estimate a minimum contamination of at least 30 events per month from other transients and variables, even under our strictest selection criteria. A deep gravitational-wave search targeting Rubin kilonova candidates may lead to the next multi-messenger discovery.

 - **Abstract**
 ComPair, the prototype of the All-sky Medium Energy Gamma-ray Observatory (AMEGO) mission concept, is a combined Compton imager and pair production telescope. It consists of four subsystems: a double-sided silicon strip detector (DSSD) Tracker, a virtual Frisch-grid cadmium zinc telluride (CZT) Low Energy Calorimeter, a cesium iodide (CsI) High Energy Calorimeter, and a plastic scintillator Anti-Coincidence Detector (ACD) to reject the charged particle background. These subsystems work together to reconstruct events, by tracking the locations and energies of gamma-ray scatters and pair production events. To quantify ComPair's scientific capabilities prior to a balloon launch in 2023, calibrations were performed to benchmark the instrument's performance in terms of angular resolution, energy resolution, and effective area. In this paper we provide an overview of the ComPair instrument and detail the calibration campaign. Finally, we compare our results to the expected performance based on simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 Although a multitude of studies have focused on targeted observations of Galactic X-ray transients, blind surveys and population studies have been limited. We have used the ROSAT, eROSITA and Gaia source catalogs to find Galactic X-ray transients having timescales $<$30 years. We report the properties of 738 transients found in our search, majority of which are active stars or interacting binaries. We have also found $\sim$40 compact object systems among which are at least 8 newly-identified white-dwarf systems, 3 known X-ray binaries, and one known pulsar. We use eROSITA (soft X-ray) spectra of the Galactic transients to show that two distinct types of flaring systems are prevalent: one having peak around 1 keV, well fit by thermal models, and another having peak below 0.2 keV and requiring a power-law component. Our study also reveals that single star or interacting binary systems (X-ray transients) involving giant stars exhibit significantly higher X-ray luminosities than systems involving only main-sequence stars or young stellar objects. Finally, we discuss the properties of the transients in the context of their putative emission mechanisms, the fraction of transients with respect to the total population, and the rates of Galactic transients expected in blind searches of the X-ray sky.

 - **Abstract**
 Dark matter fermions interacting via attractive fifth forces mediated by a light mediator can form dark matter halos in the very early universe. We show that bound systems composed of these halos are capable of generating gravitational wave (GW) signals detectable today, even when the individual halos are very light. The Yukawa force dominates the dynamics of these halo binaries, rather than gravity. As a result, large GW signals can be produced at initially extremely high frequencies, which are then redshifted to frequency bands accessible to current or future GW observatories. In addition, the resulting GW signals carry distinctive features that enable future observations to distinguish them from conventional ones. Notably, even if only a tiny fraction of dark matter experiences strong fifth-force interactions, such effects provide a new avenue to discover self-interacting dark matter through GW observations.

 Open clusters have long been used to determine ages of stars, as well as calibrate stellar evolution models and other methods of age-dating stellar groups, e.g., gyrochronology, asteroseismology, and chemical clocks. In this work, we have obtained new high-resolution (R $\ge$ 50,000), high-S/N, optical data for 3+ stellar members in open clusters, using Keck/HIRES, with membership derived from the Open Cluster Chemical Abundances and Mapping (OCCAM) survey. From these new Keck/HIRES data, we have derived neutron capture abundances for stars in seven distant outer Galaxy open cluster

 - **Abstract**
 Kernel phase interferometry (KPI) is a post-processing technique that treats a conventional telescope as an interferometer by accurately modeling a telescope pupil as an array of virtual subapertures. KPI provides angular resolution within the diffraction limit by eliminating instrumental phase errors to first order. It has been successfully demonstrated to boost angular resolution on both space- and ground-based observatories, and is especially useful for enhancing space telescopes, as their diameters are smaller than the largest ground-based facilities. Here we present the first demonstration of KPI on JWST/MIRI data at 7.7 microns, 10 microns, and 15 microns. We generate contrast curves for 16 white dwarfs from the MIRI Exoplanets Orbiting White dwarfs (MEOW) Survey, finding significantly deeper contrast at small angular separations compared to traditional imaging with JWST/MIRI, down to within $\lambda$/D. Additionally, we use our KPI setup to successfully recover four known companions orbiting white dwarfs and brown dwarfs. This analysis shows that at these wavelengths KPI can uniquely access the orbital parameter space where inward-migrating post-main-sequence giant exoplanets are now thought to exist. We discuss the prospects for applying KPI to a larger sample of white dwarfs observed with JWST, increasing the volume of directly imaged close-in post-main-sequence exoplanets.

          Gravitational-Wave Signatures of Highly Eccentric Stellar-Mass Binary Black Holes in Galactic Nuclei

 - **Abstract**
 A significant fraction of compact-object mergers in galactic nuclei are expected to be eccentric in the Laser-Interferometer-Space-Antenna (LISA) frequency sensitivity range, $10^{-4} - 10^{-1}\ \rm Hz$. Several compact binaries detected by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration may retain hints of residual eccentricity at $10$~Hz, suggesting dynamical or triple origins for a significant fraction of the gravitational-wave-observable population. In triple systems, von-Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai oscillations perturb both the eccentricity and the argument of pericentre, $\omega$, of the inner black hole binary. The latter could be fully \textit{circulating}, where $\omega$ cycles through $2\pi$, or may \textit{librate}, with $\omega$ ranges about a fixed value with small or large variation. We use \texttt{TSUNAMI}, a regularised N-body code with up to 3.5 post-Newtonian (PN) term corrections, to identify four different families of orbits: (i) circulating, (ii) small and (iii) large amplitude librating, and (iv) merging orbits. We develop and demonstrate a new method to construct gravitational waveforms using the quadrupole formula utilising the instantaneous {\it total} acceleration of each binary component in \texttt{TSUNAMI}. We show that the four orbital families have distinct waveform phenomenologies, enabling them to be distinguished if observed in LISA. The orbits are also distinguishable from an isolated binary or from a binary perturbed by a different tertiary orbit, even if the secular timescale is the same. Future burst timing models will be able to distinguish the different orbital configurations. For efficient binary formation, about $\sim 50$ binaries can have librating orbits in the Galactic Centre.

 We run a three-dimensional Galactic chemical evolution (GCE) model to follow the propagation of Mn-53 from supernovae of type Ia (SNIa), Fe-60 from core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), Hf-182 from intermediate mass stars (IMSs), and Pu-244 from neutron star mergers (NSMs) in the Galaxy. We compare the GCE of these short-lived radioactive isotopes (SLRs) to recent detections on the deep-sea floor. We find that although these SLRs originate from different sites, they often arrive conjointly on Earth.

 A significant fraction of gravitational-wave mergers are expected to be eccentric in the Laser-Interferometer-Space-Antenna (LISA) frequency band, $10^{-4} - 10^{-1}$ Hz. Several LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA events show potential hints of residual eccentricity at 10 Hz, pointing to dynamical or triple origins for part of the population, where von-Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai oscillations can perturb both the eccentricity and the inclination of the binary. Moreover, the argument of pericentre, $\omega$ could be fully circulating, or librating, with a limited range for $\omega$. We use TSUNAMI, a regularised N-body code with 3.5PN corrections to identify four different orbital families: (i) circulating, (ii) small-amplitude and (iii) large-amplitude librating, and (iv) merging. We develop a new method to construct gravitational-wave waveforms using the quadrupole formula from the instantaneous acceleration in TSUNAMI. The four orbital families have distinct waveform phenomenologies, enabling them to be distinguished if observed in LISA. In particular, the properties of the tertiary companion can be inferred and serve as an independent mass measurement and distinguish field triple dynamics from galactic dynamics.

 - **Abstract**
 Since the launch of JWST, the sample size of reionization-era Lyman-alpha-emitters (LAEs) has been steadily growing; yet inferences about the neutral hydrogen fraction in the intergalactic medium exhibit increasing variance at redshift z ~ 7, possibly indicating significant field-to-field fluctuations in the progression of cosmic reionization. In this paper, we present new JWST/NIRSpec and Keck/LRIS spectra of nine LAEs in the redshift z ~ 7 protocluster, LAGER-z7OD1. Measurements of Lyman-alpha-transmission and Lyman-alpha velocity offset along multiple sightlines map the Lyman-alpha damping wing optical depth across the galaxy overdensity. In the standard context of inside-out ionization, we estimate radii of ionized bubbles (R(min) = 0.07 - 0.69 Mpc) based on the distance from each LAE to the first neutral patch along the sightline. The resulting 3D topology reveals three distinct sub-clusters where the ionized bubbles are approaching overlap. Five of the nine LAEs plausibly ionized their bubbles, a few bursts of star formation and a modest escape fraction are sufficient. We demonstrate, however, that the actual ionized volumes are likely larger, at least R(ism) = 0.42 - 1.29 Mpc, based on an empirical model for interstellar attenuation of Lyman-alpha. Modeling galactic attenuation of Lyman-alpha significantly increases the inferred intergalactic transmission (thus enlarging the ionized pathlength). The errorbars on the reddening correction allow fully overlapping bubbles, and our results are consistent with accelerated reionization in the protocluster.

          The dependence of black hole formation in open clusters on the cluster formation process

 - **Abstract**
 We performed N-body simulations of both individual cluster evolution and subcluster coalescence, demonstrating that cluster evolution and its outcomes strongly depend on the cluster formation process through comparisons of different gas expulsion modes and formation channels. The evolution of star clusters is significantly shaped by the gas expulsion mode, with faster expulsion producing greater mass loss. A broader degeneracy exists among initial cluster mass, gas expulsion timescale, and formation channel (monolithic vs. coalescence), which manifests in both evolutionary pathways and black hole production. In individual cluster simulations, slower gas expulsion enables progressively lower-mass clusters to retain central black holes within the tidal radius. As the gas expulsion mode transitions from fast to moderate to slow, the fraction of high-velocity stars decreases. Variations in gas expulsion mode and formation channel ultimately influence the stellar velocity distribution (within the tidal radius), and thus the expansion speed, which governs both cluster mass loss and black hole retention. Slowly expanding clusters are more likely to retain black holes and multiple systems, making them prime candidates for black hole searches with {\it Gaia}. Our results highlight the crucial influence of early gas expulsion and cluster formation mechanisms on the dynamical evolution of star clusters and black hole production. These factors should be carefully incorporated into the initial conditions of N-body simulations, which necessarily rely on input from the star formation community.

 - **Abstract**
 For accreting black holes (BHs), the lamp-post scenario is a simple and popular model: a hot and point-like corona is located above the black hole, irradiating the accretion disk with hard X-ray radiation, which is believed to be generated by inverse Compton scattering in the corona. Although the lamp-post model successfully explains the disk reflection component, it fails to address the origin of seed photons and the geometry of the hot corona, because this model simplistically treats the corona as a point-like source generating a cutoff powerlaw spectrum. In this paper, we make simulations on a possible physical realization of the lamp-post scenario: the shape of the scattering zone is set to be a cylinder, corresponding to the jet base near a BH. The source of seed photons in this system is assumed to be the multicolor blackbody radiation of the accretion disk. In our simulations, the Compton scattering process is simulated with a custom Monte Carlo program based on the Geant4 package and the disk reflection process is simulated with the xilconv model in XSPEC. Our simulation results have confirmed that the relativistic motion of the jet can weaken or even completely suppress the reflection of the accretion disk, and simultaneously, the Comptonization of disk photons in the jet can still make a major contribution to the observed X-ray spectrum in high energy range. We discuss the implications of our simulation results, in light of the recent observations of a very weak reflection component in the presence of a strong hard X-ray radiation from the outburst of Swift J1727.8-1613.

 - **Abstract**
 In the present paper, which is a development of an earlier study by the author \cite{Sosnitskii08}, we consider the stability of triangular libration points in the spatial circular restricted three-body problem and improve the result of author's work \cite{Sosnitskii08}. Unlike \cite{Sosnitskii08}, where the instability of libration points was established on the base of reduced approximate equations, we succeeded in this paper to use a new approach that made it possible to prove the instability of triangular libration points on the base of a closed complete system of equations. The relationship between the Lyapunov stability and Birkhoff stability (formal stability) is also discussed

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we propose a non-standard dark matter (NSDM) model in which the equation of state (EoS) of dark matter (DM) is parameterized as $w_{\rm dm} = w_2 a^2$, and this DM model is motivated by the idea that DM must become cold dark matter (CDM) in the neighborhood of the scale factor $a = 0$, which implies that both the EoS of DM, $w_{\rm dm}$, and its derivative with respect to the scale factor, ${\rm d}w_{\rm dm}/{\rm d}a$, vanish at $a = 0$. By incorporating the latest cosmological datasets -- including the Planck2018 Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) distance priors, the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation measurements from the Data Release 2 of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), together with three independent Type Ia Supernova datasets, namely the Dark Energy Survey Year 5 (DESY5) compilation, the Union3 compilation, and the PantheonPlus sample -- we constrain the $\Lambda w_2$DM, $ww_2$DM, and $w_0w_aw_2$DM models, which are constructed by replacing CDM with NSDM in the $\Lambda $CDM, $w$CDM, and $w_0w_a$CDM models, respectively. We find that there is a preference for a negative DM EoS at more than the $3\sigma$ confidence level for the data combinations CMB+DESI+Union3 and CMB+DESI+DESY5. Moreover, for all data combinations, replacing CDM with NSDM in the $w$CDM and $w_0w_a$CDM models significantly reduces the probability of violating the null energy condition. Furthermore, both $ww_2$DM and $w_0w_aw_2$DM are favored over $\Lambda $CDM with a significance comparable to that of the $w_0w_a$CDM model.

 - **Abstract**
 The stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB), arising from the incoherent superposition of numerous compact binary coalescences, serves as a powerful probe of both astrophysical populations and fundamental physics. In this work, we investigate the influence of gravitational lensing on the SGWB, focusing on primordial black holes (PBHs) as potential lenses. Assuming PBHs as dark matter candidates with a broad cosmic distribution, we show that their lensing optical depth can be significantly enhanced, producing pronounced effects with relative deviations at the 10^-1 level. By systematically varying the PBH mass (M_PBH) and abundance (f_PBH), we demonstrate that the mass predominantly determines the frequency-dependent diffraction features of the spectrum, while the abundance primarily amplifies the overall lensing-induced deviation. Although the SGWB from binary black holes has not yet been observed, our analytical results provide theoretical insight into the possible imprint of lensing on its spectrum and suggest that future detections could offer a novel avenue to constrain dark matter scenarios.

 - **Abstract**
 Pluto and Charon are a dwarf binary system with a high mass ratio $\mu$, preventing Trojan companions. This instability creates ideal intersections for low-energy pathways that spacecraft can traverse and serves as an important test case for stability at Lagrange points for high $\mu$ binaries. This study models the Pluto-Charon system in the planar Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem (CR3BP) and compares the tadpole and horseshoe orbits of a massless particle with known low-$\mu$ orbits. Moreover, it compares the trajectories for instances where the L1 neck is opened and closed, and exhibits the corresponding zero-velocity curves; RK4 integration was used to update the position and velocity of the particle. The simulations consistently showed chaotic and unpredictable trajectories, where small changes in initial parameters could completely alter the results; trajectories displayed the influence of higher values of $\mu$ on the stability of binary systems. These findings confirm that Pluto-Charon cannot host long-lived Trojan companions and instead behaves as a system of chaotic transport. Future work could extend the study to include the spatial or elliptic three-body problem, further refining the understanding of instability in high-$\mu$ binaries.

 The detection of interstellar radionuclides in geological archives provides insights into nucleosynthesis in stars and stellar explosions as well as interstellar medium dynamics in the Local Bubble and the Local Interstellar Cloud. In this work, current projects to detect interstellar radionuclides with accelerator mass spectrometry will be reviewed. These projects aim to address unsolved questions regarding the timing and the origin of the influxes and to establish new radionuclides for future searches. For the first time, experimental evidence for an inhomogeneous deposition of interstellar 60Fe onEarthwill be presented and another potential source for 60Fe on Earth and the Moon, primary galactic cosmic rays, will be introduced.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new method for aperture masking interferometric (AMI) imaging at near-IR wavelengths using radio astronomical techniques. The method starts with derivation of interferometric visibilities from a Fourier transform of the interferograms. An iterative joint optimization process is then employed, using self-calibration of the interferometric element-based complex voltage gains (i.e. electric fields), and CLEAN deconvolution to obtain the source structure. We demonstrate the efficacy of the method using the NIRISS aperture masking interferometer on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) at 4.8~$\mu$m and 3.8~$\mu$m. Due to a number of effects (the large pixel size, charge migration, near-field optics), the method also requires an initial visibility-based amplitude normalization using observations of a well know point-source calibration star. We employ early science observations of the dusty binary Wolf-Rayet star WR137. Images with a dynamic range (peak/rms) of $\sim 240$ on the target, and $\sim 1000$ on the calibrator, are synthesized from a short integration. The self-calibration process determines the photon path-lengths through the optical system to each aperture using data on the target source itself, thereby representing an essentially 'real-time', precise wavefront error sensor. Four independent measures of the JWST mirror segment pistons (two wavelengths for two sources), agree to within 10~nm to 15~nm, comparable to the expected errors based on an analysis of closure phases on the calibrator star. Including a baseline-based phase correction improves the dynamic range of the final images by about 23\%.

 - **Abstract**
 Current optimization of ground-based Cherenkov telescopes arrays, also called Imaging Air Cherenkov Telescope (IACT) arrays, relies on brute-force human-driven approaches based on large simulations requiring both high amount of storage and long computation time. To explore the full phase space of telescope positioning of a given array even more simulations would be required. To optimize any array layout, we explore the possibility of developing a differential program with surrogate models of IACT arrays based on high-level instrument response functions (IRFs). The simulation time of a single telescope to a cosmic-ray event can be significantly reduced with its instrument response function or with generative models. However, it is not straight forward to model the array of telescopes from a set of single telescope surrogate models as the array is a stereoscopic imaging system. The complexity increases as well if the telescopes in the array are of different types. Additionally, the optimum of the array layout depends on the scientific use case. Current array layout optimization are obtained by minimizing the sensitivity of the array, a metric that depends on several high-level parameters such as the trigger efficiency, the energy and angular resolution, as well as the background rejection capability. The variety of telescopes types in IACT arrays, such as in the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), not only extends the sensitive energy range but also allows for cross-calibration of the instruments. Therefore, the optimal array layout is not only which minimizes sensitivity but also which reduces the systematic uncertainties. We focus on the optimization of a telescope array based on the SST-1M IACTs in Hanle, Ladakh India aiming at building a generic optimization pipeline for future ground-based cosmic-ray observatories

 - **Abstract**
 This study explores the impact of observational and modelling systematic effects on cluster number counts and cluster clustering and provides model prescriptions for their joint analysis, in the context of the \Euclid survey. Using 1000 \Euclid-like cluster catalogues, we investigate the effect of systematic uncertainties on cluster summary statistics and their auto- and cross-covariance, and perform a likelihood analysis to evaluate their impact on cosmological constraints, with a focus on the matter density parameter $\Omega_{\rm m}$ and on the power spectrum amplitude $\sigma_8$. Combining cluster clustering with number counts significantly improves cosmological constraints, with the figure of merit increasing by over 300\% compared to number counts alone. We confirm that the two probes are uncorrelated, and the cosmological constraints derived from their combination are almost insensitive to the cosmology dependence of the covariance. We find that photometric redshift uncertainties broaden cosmological posteriors by 20--30\%, while secondary effects like redshift-space distortions (RSDs) have a smaller impact on the posteriors -- 5\% for clustering alone, 10\% when combining probes -- but can significantly bias the constraints if neglected. We show that clustering data below $60\,h^{-1}\,$Mpc provides additional constraining power, while scales larger than acoustic oscillation scale add almost no information on $\Omega_{\rm m}$ and $\sigma_8$ parameters. RSDs and photo-$z$ uncertainties also influence the number count covariance, with a significant impact, of about 15--20\%, on the parameter constraints.

          Investigating the Formation of Planets Interior to in situ Hot Jupiters

 - **Abstract**
 The population of hot Jupiters with adjacent planetary companions is small but growing, and inner companions appear to be a nearly ubiquitous outcome within this subset of the exoplanet census. While most hot Jupiters are believed to form via tidal migration, the presence of adjacent companions is not easily explained by this formation mechanism, requiring consideration of additional formation mechanisms such as disk migration and in situ formation. In this work, we explore the possibility of in situ formation for both hot Jupiters and their interior companions. Using numerical simulations performed with the N-body integrator REBOUND, we investigate the growth of interior companions under various assumptions about disk conditions and hot Jupiter final orbital positions. Our results show that if a sufficiently high density of planetary embryos is transported to short orbital radii, it is feasible for both hot Jupiters and their interior companions to form in situ, providing a viable explanation for a subset of observed planetary architectures.

 - **Abstract**
 Following its launch on January 9, 2024, the Einstein Probe (EP) telescope has detected hundreds of fast X-ray transients (FXTs), yet their physical origins remain elusive. Understanding their luminosity function and formation rate is crucial for elucidating their nature. Based on the latest catalog of EP-detected FXTs, we present, a model-independent, non-parametric approach to derive the luminosity function and formation rate of FXTs. Our analysis reveals significant cosmological luminosity evolution, characterized by a scaling relationship of $(1+z)^{3.58}$. After accounting for this evolution, we establish that the local luminosity function is best represented by a broken power law, with a break luminosity of $(4.17 \pm 0.34) \times 10^{46}$ erg/s. The formation rate exhibits a gentle decline with redshift, following the relation $(1+z)^{-0.21}$, yielding a local rate of approximately $28.0_{-16.4}^{+27.3}$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$. This rate is comparable to that of low-luminosity long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs). Our findings indicate a potential correlation between FXTs and LGRBs, supporting the majority of FXTs may be linked to collapsar progenitors.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a detailed analysis of the Type-I (thermonuclear) X-ray bursts and eclipses observed from the neutron star low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) EXO 0748--676 with AstroSat during the second known outburst of the source following a 16-year-long quiescence period. We detect three thermonuclear X-ray bursts, with two displaying simultaneous coverage in the soft X-rays. Simultaneous UV observations show evidence of reprocessed burst emissions in the far-ultraviolet band. The time-resolved spectral analysis reveals the photospheric radius expansion (PRE) nature for two bursts. We estimate the distance to the source to be $7.42\pm0.53$ kpc using the peak flux of PRE. Notably, one of the bursts exhibited a secondary peak, $\sim30$ s after the primary, particularly dominating in the softer X-rays, which reveals a correlation with the evolution of burst hotspot radius with no temperature dependence. The burst properties and corresponding flux values suggest that mixed H/He burning may have fueled the bursts. We also detect evidence of a soft excess during one burst, likely arising from the interaction of the burst photons with the surroundings. We uncover evidence for a hard X-ray deficit during the peak of all bursts and a hard lag of $\sim4$ s, which can be attributed to the Compton cooling of the corona by the burst photons. We also probe the temporal evolution and the energy dependence of the eclipses, which offer insights into the binary environment. Our study helps gain deeper insight into the physics of burst ignition, flame propagation, the burst-accretion interaction, and the evolution of LMXBs.

 - **Abstract**
 The structural evolution of rotating protoneutron stars encodes essential information about their observable signatures, while microscopic properties provide complementary knowledge to advance observational investigations. Using a relativistic mean-field model with density-dependent couplings that account for temperature and particle composition, we investigate rotation, neutrino-emission-driven changes in angular momentum, particle distributions, temperature profiles, and sound speed to probe the internal dynamics of protoneutron star matter. Additionally, we track the evolution of macroscopic quantities such as energy distribution and gravitational mass and establish direct links between microphysics and global evolution. Extending the framework of Phys. Rev. D 112, 023007 (2025), which focuses on the global properties of rotating protoneutron star evolution, our results reveal that protoneutron star deformation and thermal evolution are governed by angular momentum, mass, and composition. Exotic matter (hyperons and $\Delta$-resonances) and rapid rotation enhance deformation leading to a reduction in core temperature, whereas slowly rotating stars like PSR J0740$+$6620 remain nearly spherical. Our predicted equatorial radii for PSR J0740$+$6620, $13.0\ \mathrm{km} < R_e < 13.5\ \mathrm{km}$, are consistent with NICER measurements. These findings constrain the EoS, requiring a self-consistent treatment of rotation, mass-dependent compression, and composition-driven modeling to accurately model protoneutron star evolution in the context of multi-messenger astrophysics.

 Recently, in the VSX database, G. Murawski reported the discovery of an oscillation with a period of about 40 min in the probable cataclysmic variable 1RXS J014549.6+514314. To confirm the existence of this oscillation and precisely measure its period, I conducted extensive photometric observations of the object over 25 nights between 2022 and 2024. The total duration of these observations was 139 hr. The observations revealed the oscillation on each observation night. This oscillation was coherent throughout all the observations covering 18 months. Due to the large coverage of observations, I was able to determine the oscillation period with high precision. It was found to be 41.485867+\-0.000026 min. The semi-amplitude of the oscillation was large, averaging 0.154(2) mag. The pulse profile of the oscillation did not change during the observations and followed a perfect sinusoidal pattern. With the high precision of the period, I created an ephemeris for the oscillation with a validity time of 30 years. This ephemeris can be used in future studies of changes in the oscillation period. Although short-period X-ray oscillations have not yet been detected in 1RXS J014549.6+514314, the high coherence of its 41-minute oscillation suggests that this object is most likely to be an intermediate polar.

 - **Abstract**
 The sustained gamma ray emission (SGRE) from the Sun is one of the fascinating high energy phenomena closely related to the acceleration of protons to energies >300 MeV. Here we report on the solar cycle variation of SGRE events based on observations from Fermi's Large Area Telescope (LAT). This report covers solar cycles (SCs) 24 and 25 during which Fermi has been operating. Since SGRE events are closely related to solar energetic particle (SEP) events and interplanetary type II radio bursts caused by fast and wide coronal mass ejections (CMEs), we consider these phenomena as well. Many studies have shown that SC 25 is similar or slightly stronger than SC 24. The number of SEP events, GLE events, IP type II bursts, and fast and wide CMEs confirm this conclusion. However, the number of SGRE events observed by Fermi LAT has diminished significantly in SC 25 relative to SC 24. One of the issues has been the reduced coverage of the Sun since 2018 due to a mechanical problem with a solar array of the Fermi mission. By identifying the Fermi LAT gaps and the number of energetic events (fast and wide CMEs, interplanetary type II bursts) we conclude that about three times more SGRE events must have occurred than the 15 events observed by Fermi.

 Radial velocity searches may lead to detection of exoplanets at large orbital separations only if long-enough time-series of data are available. Therefore publication of precise measurements collected in the past is very valuable even if not successfully completed with a definitive detection. Here we present 309 precise ($\sigma$RV$\approx$5-7 m s$^{-1}$) multi-epoch radial velocities for 28 stars observed with the Hobby-Eberly Telescope and its High Resolution Spectrograph between 2004 and 2013. Based on the observations gathered we present a low mass companion ($m_{p}\sin{i}$ = 10.6 $M_{J}$ in 1887.76 $\pm$ 0.01 d, 4.65 au orbit with $e$ = 0.59 $\pm$ 0.01) to a K giant BD+37 3172 ($M$=3.75$\pm$ 0.86 M$_{\odot}$), and a planetary mass companion (m$_{p}\sin{i}$=0.55 M$_{J}$ in 123.05$\pm$0.04 day, 0.55 au orbit with e=0.73$\pm$0.03) to a K giant BD+42 2315 ($M$=1.38$\pm$ 0.30 M$_{\odot}$). We also present two preliminary detections of new spectroscopic binaries: BD+56 2957 (K5) and HD 236555 (G5).

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first XRISM/Resolve observation of the persistently accreting neutron star (NS) low-mass X-ray binary Serpens X-1. The source was observed on October 17th, 2024, for approximately 350 ks of elapsed time, resulting in 171 ks of exposure. The source exhibited 22% variability with respect to the average count rate of 73.1 count/s during the observation, but remained in a spectrally soft state throughout. The time averaged spectrum was analyzed in conjunction with spectra extracted from periods of different count rate to check for variations in spectral components. The unprecedented energy resolution of 4.5 eV at 6 keV of XRISM/Resolve provides a detailed look at the shape and structure of the Fe emission line within the data, which shows a dual-peaked structure with an extended red-wing, and steep decline in the blue-wing of the line profile. Fits with the reflection model relxillNS are able to describe the structure in the Fe line region, and confirms previous results that the disk is close to the NS ($R_{\rm in}$ = $1.02_{-0.01}^{+0.21}\ R_{\rm ISCO}$). These models also measure a low systemic inclination ($i=5^{\circ}\pm1^{\circ}$), confirming prior X-ray and optical studies. Alternative models were explored to describe the structure of the Fe line profile, however, relativistic reflection provides the simplest and statistically best explanation of the data.

          Dynamics and Observational Signatures of Core-Collapse Supernovae with Central Engines: Hydrodynamics Simulations with Monte Carlo Post-Processing

 - **Abstract**
 A long-lived central engine embedded in expanding supernova ejecta can alter the dynamics and observational signatures of the event, producing an unusually luminous, energetic, and/or rapidly-evolving transient. We use two-dimensional hydrodynamics simulations to study the effect of a central energy source, varying the amount, rate, and isotropy of the energy deposition. We post-process the results with a time-dependent Monte Carlo radiation transport code to extract observational signatures. The engine excavates a bubble at the centre of the ejecta, which becomes Rayleigh-Taylor unstable. Sufficiently powerful engines are able to break through the edge of the bubble and accelerate, shred, and compositionally mix the entire ejecta. The breakout of the engine-driven wind occurs at distinct rupture points, and the outflowing high-velocity gas may eventually give rise to radio emission. The dynamical impact of the engine leads to faster rising optical light curves, with photon escape facilitated by the faster expansion of the ejecta and the opening of low-density channels. For models with strong engines, the spectra are initially hot and featureless, but later evolve to resemble those of broad-line Ic supernovae. Under certain conditions, line emission from ionized, low-velocity material near the centre of the ejecta may be able to escape and produce narrow emission similar to that seen in interacting supernovae. We discuss how variability in the engine energy reservoir and injection rate could give rise to a heterogeneous set of events spanning multiple observational classes, including the fast blue optical transients, broad-line Ic supernovae, and superluminous supernovae.

 - **Abstract**
 Photometric classification of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) is critical for cosmological studies but remains difficult due to class imbalance and observational noise. While deep learning models have been explored, they are often resource-intensive and lack interpretability. We present a computationally efficient and interpretable classification framework that maintains high performance on imbalanced datasets. We emphasize the use of PR-AUC and F1-score as more informative metrics than ROC-AUC in severely imbalanced settings. Using an XGBoost ensemble optimized via Bayesian hyperparameter tuning, we classified light curves from the Supernova Photometric Classification Challenge (SPCC), comprising 21,318 events with a 3.19 imbalance ratio (non-Ia to Ia). Our model achieved a PR-AUC of $0.993^{+0.03}_{-0.02}$, an F1-score of $0.923 \pm 0.008$, and a ROC-AUC of $0.976 \pm 0.004$, matching or exceeding deep learning performance on precision-recall trade-offs while using fewer resources. Despite slightly lower overall accuracy, our method balances false positives and false negatives, improving the efficiency of spectroscopic follow-up. We show that optimized ensemble models offer a reproducible and lightweight alternative to complex architectures, particularly for large-scale surveys such as the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) where transparency and efficiency are essential.

 - **Abstract**
 Double-bump showers are a rare class of extensive air showers (EAS) predicted by Monte Carlo simulations. They occur when a high-energy secondary particle, the leading particle, travels significantly farther than the rest, creating a distinct double-peaked longitudinal profile. So far, no experiment has been able to directly detect these showers. The unique radio footprint of double-bump showers, characterized by multiple Cherenkov rings, provides a way to reconstruct longitudinal profiles from radio observations. With its dense antenna array and broad frequency range, the Square Kilometer Array Observatory (SKAO) will be the first experiment capable of detecting these features, offering a new opportunity to probe hadronic interactions and constrain particle cross sections at high energies. In our analysis, we simulate the EAS using CORSIKA with the CoREAS plugin for radio. We developed a new method based on the Akaike information criterion to identify double bump showers in simulations by analyzing their longitudinal profiles. Then we investigate the prevalence of these double bump showers across different cosmic ray primary particles and various hadronic interaction models. We create a skeleton of the EAS which consists of all the particles with at least $1\%$ of the primary energy, allowing us to confirm the leading particle hypothesis and track shower development following these particles. This will enable us to relate the attributes of the leading particle to measurable parameters. Depending on the exact shower properties, the radio footprint of a double bump shower can create a complex interference pattern, consisting of multiple rings. From this information, the longitudinal profiles can be extracted. SKA due to its dense antenna array and frequency range will be the first experiment able to observe these double bump showers in detail.

          Density reconstruction from biased tracers: Testing the equivalence principle through consistency relations

 - **Abstract**
 Consistency relations of large-scale structure offer a unique and powerful test of the weak equivalence principle (EP) on cosmological scales. If the EP is violated, different tracers will undergo different accelerations in response to a uniform gravitational field, and this loss of universality manifests as a dipole with a characteristic $1/K$ scale dependence in the squeezed limit of the bispectrum. In this work we show that such a violation can be identified with a particular anti-symmetric {modulation} in the local cross-power spectrum of distinct tracers. Based on this observation, we propose to test the EP using quadratic estimators as a more practical alternative to the conventional approach of directly estimating the bispectrum. We apply our quadratic estimator to a DESI-like survey and forecast constraints on the overall amplitude of EP violation. Including mildly nonlinear scales in our reconstruction ($k_\mathrm{max}\simeq0.15\, h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$), we find that our estimator is competitive with the more exhaustive direct bispectrum approach. This means surveys like DESI can already benefit from the quadratic estimator approach.

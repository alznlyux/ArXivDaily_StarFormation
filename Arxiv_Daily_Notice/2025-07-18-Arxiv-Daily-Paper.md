 - **Abstract**
 ColdPress is a Python module that compresses photometric redshift probability distribution functions (PDFs) by encoding quantiles of their cumulative distribution. For a fixed packet size (the default is 80 bytes per PDF), ColdPress attains a reconstruction accuracy comparable to the sparse-basis representation method implemented in the pdf_storage module of Carrasco-Kind & Brunner (2014), yet reduces the computational cost by a factor of ~7000. I describe the implementation and quantify its compression speed and reconstruction accuracy in comparison to pdf_storage for real-life PDFs from two different photometric redshift codes. ColdPress is free software, available at this https URL.

 - **Abstract**
 Using direct $N$-body simulations, we investigate the initial conditions and evolution of a star-forming region resembling the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) with the advanced \textsc{NBODY6} code. By varying the initial conditions, we aim to identify a model that closely aligns with observed parameters such as the half-mass radius, core radius, and total mass. Additionally, we examine the cluster's evolution over 800 Myr to determine whether it could reproduce the present-day properties of the Pleiades and Hyades along its evolutionary path. Under the influence of a Milky Way-like tidal field, the ONC experiences significant mass loss, primarily due to rapid gas expulsion, retaining approximately 47\% of its initial 4200 stars by about 100 Myr and only 9\% by about 700 Myr. These evolutionary stages closely match the properties of the Pleiades and Hyades, suggesting that an ONC-like cluster may have been their precursor. Additional models with varying degrees of primordial mass segregation indicate that the ONC likely had an initial half-mass radius of 0.2-0.3 pc, a total mass of 1200 - 2000 M$_\odot$, and a high degree of mass segregation. Models with an initial stellar count of about $N_{\text{in}} \approx 4 \times 10^3 - 5 \times 10^3$, rich in binaries and exhibiting mass segregation, show excellent agreement with observed cluster properties.

 - **Abstract**
 The discovery of the massive black hole (BH) system Gaia BH3 in pre-release Gaia DR4 data suggests that wide BH binaries with luminous companions may be significantly overrepresented at low metallicities. Motivated by this finding, we have initiated a spectroscopic survey of low-metallicity stars exhibiting elevated RUWE values in Gaia DR3, using the FEROS and APF spectrographs. We identify promising BH binary candidates as objects with instantaneously measured radial velocities (RVs) that are very different from their mean RVs reported in Gaia DR3. Thus far, we have observed over 500 targets, including a nearly complete sample of stars with $\text{[Fe/H]} < -1.5$, RUWE $> 2$, and $G < 15$. Our search has yielded one promising target exhibiting slow acceleration and an RV more than 98 km s$^{-1}$ different from its DR3 mean RV, as well as dozens of other candidates with smaller RV discrepancies. We quantify the sensitivity of our search using simulations, demonstrating that it recovers at least half of the BH companions within our selection criteria. We make all the spectra and RVs from our survey publicly available and encourage further follow-up.

          Systematics from NICER Pulse Profiles Drive Uncertainty in Multi-Messenger Inference of the Neutron Star Equation of State

 - **Abstract**
 We present new constraints on the neutron star equation of state (EOS) and mass distribution using a unified Bayesian inference framework that incorporates latest NICER measurements, including PSR J0614$-$3329, alongside gravitational wave data, radio pulsar masses, and nuclear theory. By systematically comparing four inference scenarios--varying in the inclusion of PSR J0614$-$3329 and in the pulse profile model used for PSR J0030+0451--we quantify the impact of observational and modeling choices on dense matter inference. We find that pulse profile systematics dominate EOS uncertainties: the choice of hot spot geometry for PSR J0030+0451 leads to significant shifts in the inferred stiffness of the EOS and maximum neutron star mass. In contrast, PSR J0614$-$3329 mildly softens the EOS at low densities, reducing the radius at \(1.4\,M_\odot\) by \(\sim 100\)~m. A Bayesian model comparison yields a Bayes factor of $\log_{10} \mathrm{BF} \approx 1.58$ in favor of the ST+PDT model over PDT-U, providing strong evidence that multi-messenger EOS inference can statistically discriminate between competing NICER pulse profile models. These results highlight the critical role of NICER systematics in dense matter inference and the power of joint analyses in breaking modeling degeneracies.

 - **Abstract**
 Multiband astronomical time series exhibit heterogeneous variability patterns, sampling cadences, and signal characteristics across bands. Standard transformers apply shared parameters to all bands, potentially limiting their ability to model this rich structure. In this work, we introduce Astro-MoE, a foundational transformer architecture that enables dynamic processing via a Mixture of Experts module. We validate our model on both simulated (ELAsTiCC-1) and real-world datasets (Pan-STARRS1).

 - **Abstract**
 Temperate sub-Neptunes are compelling targets for detecting liquid-water oceans beyond the Solar System. If water-rich and lacking massive hydrogen-helium envelopes, these planets could sustain liquid layers beneath their atmospheres despite sizes larger than Earth. Previous observations of the temperate sub-Neptune K2-18 b revealed an H2-dominated atmosphere rich in CH4, with moderate evidence for CO2 and tentative signs of dimethyl sulfide (DMS). Here we present four new JWST/NIRSpec transit observations of K2-18 b. The resulting high-precision transmission spectrum robustly detects both CH4 and CO2, precisely measuring their abundances and firmly establishing the planet's water-rich nature: either a thick envelope with >10% H2O by volume or a thin atmosphere above a liquid-water ocean. The spectrum reveals no detectable H2O, NH3, or CO. The absence of atmospheric water vapor suggests an efficient cold trap, while the nondetections of NH3 and CO support the scenario of a small H2-rich atmosphere overlying a liquid reservoir. However, alternative models that include these gases can also reproduce the spectrum within uncertainties, highlighting the need for deeper observations. The spectrum only contains marginal signals of DMS, methyl mercaptan (CH3SH), and nitrous oxide (N2O), with none exceeding 3 sigma in model preference and all falling below ~2 sigma without imposing a strong super-Rayleigh haze. Meanwhile, our self-consistent photochemical models show that DMS and CH3SH may form abiotically in massive H2-rich atmospheres of high metallicity, making it important to consider additional indicators for their potential use as biosignatures. K2-18 b, a cool, water-rich world, stands out as one of the most promising temperate sub-Neptunes for exploring the emergence of liquid-water environments in non-Earth-like planets, motivating further characterization of its atmosphere and interior.

 - **Abstract**
 Supermassive black hole formation remains an unsolved problem. Quasi-stars have been suggested as a viable heavy-seeding mechanism. In this work, we implement methods for modeling quasi-stars previously used with the Cambridge STARS code into the 1D stellar evolution code MESA. The computational capabilities of MESA allow for more detailed simulations of quasi-star evolution due to its modularity and the ease of implementing of new physical processes and controls. Our implementation, the MESA Quasi-star Evolutionary Simulation Toolkit (MESA-QUEST), is available in a publicly accessible repository.

          An All-sky Survey of White Dwarf Merger Remnants: Far-UV is the Key

 - **Abstract**
 The majority of merging white dwarfs leave behind a white dwarf remnant. Hot/warm DQ white dwarfs with carbon-rich atmospheres have high masses and unusual kinematics. All evidence points to a merger origin. Here, we demonstrate that far-UV + optical photometry provides an efficient way to identify these merger remnants. We take advantage of this photometric selection to identify 167 candidates in the GALEX All-Sky Imaging Survey footprint, and provide follow-up spectroscopy. Out of the 140 with spectral classifications, we identify 75 warm DQ white dwarfs with $T_{\rm eff}>10,000$ K, nearly tripling the number of such objects known. Our sample includes 13 DAQ white dwarfs with spectra dominated by hydrogen and (weaker) carbon lines. Ten of these are new discoveries, including the hottest DAQ known to date with $T_{\rm eff}\approx23,000$ K and $M=1.31~M_{\odot}$. We provide a model atmosphere analysis of all warm DQ white dwarfs found, and present their temperature and mass distributions. The sample mean and standard deviation are $T_{\rm eff} = 14,560 \pm 1970$ K and $M=1.11 \pm 0.09~M_{\odot}$. Warm DQs are roughly twice as massive as the classical DQs found at cooler temperatures. All warm DQs are found on or near the crystallization sequence. Even though their estimated cooling ages are of order 1 Gyr, their kinematics indicate an origin in the thick disk or halo. Hence, they are likely stuck on the crystallization sequence for $\sim$10 Gyr due to significant cooling delays from distillation of neutron-rich impurities. Future all-sky far-UV surveys like UVEX have the potential to significantly expand this sample.

          A multi-frequency global view of Callisto's thermal properties from ALMA

 - **Abstract**
 We present thermal observations of Callisto's leading and trailing hemispheres obtained using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) at 0.87 mm (343 GHz), 1.3 mm (233 GHz), and 3 mm (97 GHz). The angular resolution achieved for these observations ranged from 0.09-0.24 arcseconds, corresponding to ~420-1100 km at Callisto. Global surface properties were derived from the observations using a thermophysical model (de Kleer et al. 2021) constrained by spacecraft data. We find that Callisto's millimeter emissivities are high, with representative values of 0.85-0.97, compared to 0.75-0.85 for Europa and Ganymede at these wavelengths. It is clear that models parameterized by a single thermal inertia are not sufficient to model Callisto's thermal emission, and clearly deviate from the temperature distributions in the data in systematic ways. Rather, more complex models that adopt either two thermal inertia components or that treat electrical skin depth as a free parameter fit the data more accurately than single thermal inertia models. Residuals from the global best-fit models reveal thermal anomalies; in particular, brightness temperatures that are locally 3-5 K colder than surrounding terrain are associated with impact craters. We identify the Valhalla impact basin and a suite of large craters, including Lofn, as key cold anomalies (~3-5 K) and geologic features of interest in these data. These data provide context for Callisto JWST results (Cartwright et al. 2024) as well as the other ALMA Galilean moon observations (de Kleer et al. 2021, Trumbo et al. 2017, 2018, Thelen et al. 2024), and may be useful ground-based context for upcoming Galilean satellite missions (JUICE, Europa Clipper).

          Bar-driven Streaming Motions Mimic a Massive Bulge in the Inner Milky Way

 - **Abstract**
 The circular speed curve of the Milky Way provides a key constraint on its mass distribution, reflecting the axisymmetric component of the gravitational potential. This is especially critical in the inner Galaxy ($R \lesssim 4$ kpc), where non-axisymmetric structures such as the stellar bar and nuclear stellar disk strongly influence dynamics. However, significant discrepancies remain between circular speed curves inferred from stellar dynamical modeling and those derived from the terminal-velocity method applied to gas kinematics. To investigate this, we perform three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations including cooling, heating, star formation, and feedback, under a realistic gravitational potential derived from stellar dynamical models calibrated to observational data. This potential includes the Galactic bar, stellar disks, dark matter halo, nuclear stellar disk, and nuclear star cluster. We generate synthetic longitude-velocity ($l$-$v$) diagrams and apply the terminal-velocity method to derive circular speeds. The simulated gas reproduces the observed terminal-velocity envelope, including a steep inner rise. We find this feature arises from bar-driven non-circular motions, which cause the terminal-velocity method to overestimate circular speeds by up to a factor of 2 at $R \sim 0.4$ kpc, and enclosed mass by up to a factor of 4. These results suggest that inner gas-based rotation curves can significantly overestimate central mass concentrations. The steep inner rise in gas-derived circular speeds does not require a massive classical bulge but can be explained by bar-induced streaming motions. Rather than proposing a new mechanism, our study provides a clear, Milky Way-specific demonstration of this effect, emphasizing the importance of dynamical modeling that explicitly includes non-circular motions for accurate mass inference in the inner Milky Way.

          Physical properties of newly active asteroid 2010 LH15

 - **Abstract**
 Main-belt asteroid 2010 LH$_{15}$ has been classified as an active asteroid, based on the recent discovery of dust activity from the archival images observed in 2010 and 2019. In this study, we perform measurements and dynamical modeling of the dust tail of the active asteroid 2010 LH$_{15}$ using ZTF archival data from July 26 to August 31, 2019, with the derived physical properties from these relatively independent methods being compatible. The photometric results show that the radius of the nucleus is $1.11\pm0.02$ km with assumed geometric albedo of $p_r = 0.05$, and the color index of the nucleus is relatively close to that of the ejecta around the nucleus, with a value of $H_g - H_r = 0.44\pm0.07$. The effective scattering cross-section increases at an average rate of $0.28\pm0.02$ km$^2$ day$^{-1}$ throughout the observation period, indicating that the activity of LH$_{15}$ is likely driven by mechanisms capable of causing a sustained process like sublimation. Further dust dynamics modeling indicates that the dust activity initiates as early as about 26 June 2019, with the ejected dust particles having a radius ranging from 0.03 mm to 3 mm. The dependence of the terminal velocity on dust size is consistent with a sublimation-driven mechanism. If the orbit of LH$_{15}$ is stable, its sublimation origin will extend the inner boundary of the water-ice-bearing region in the main asteroid belt inward by approximately 0.1 AU.

          Great comet C/2023 A3 (Tsuchinshan-ATLAS): dust loss before perihelion

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, the dust loss of comet C/2023 A3 (Tsuchinshan-ATLAS) is investigated through the analysis of archival images. By measuring the surface brightness profile of the coma, we determined that the comet maintained nearly in a steady state during the observations. Analysis of the dust distribution perpendicular to the orbital plane reveals that the ejection velocity is $v_{\perp}\sim(65\pm5)\,\beta^{1/2}$ m s$^{-1}$, where $\beta$ is inversely proportional to the size of the dust grains. From the dust scattering cross-section measurement, we estimated the upper limit of the nucleus radius to be $\sim\!5.9\pm0.2$ km, assuming a geometric albedo of 0.04. Based on the extrapolation of the scattering cross-section over time, the onset time of significant dust activity is estimated to be 25 July 2022, corresponding to a heliocentric distance of 9.1 au, with the activity mechanism at this distance likely being the phase transition from amorphous to crystalline ice. Our simulation reveals that the minimum dust size is \SI{20}{\micro\meter} and the size distribution index is $s = 3.4$ in tail. The dust loss rate is determined to be $(1.7 \pm 0.8) \times 10^2$ kg s$^{-1}$, based on the derived average size of the particles and the rate of change of the scattering cross-section over time. Through a simplistic model, we evaluate that the nucleus of the comet remains stable against tidal effects, sublimation, and rotational instability, and disfavour the fate of disintegration. The result is consistent with observations that the nucleus has survived.

 - **Abstract**
 As the data volume of astronomical imaging surveys rapidly increases, traditional methods for image anomaly detection, such as visual inspection by human experts, are becoming impractical. We introduce a machine-learning-based approach to detect poor-quality exposures in large imaging surveys, with a focus on the DECam Legacy Survey (DECaLS) in regions of low extinction (i.e., $E(B-V)<0.04$). Our semi-supervised pipeline integrates a vision transformer (ViT), trained via self-supervised learning (SSL), with a k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) classifier. We train and validate our pipeline using a small set of labeled exposures observed by surveys with the Dark Energy Camera (DECam). A clustering-space analysis of where our pipeline places images labeled in ``good'' and ``bad'' categories suggests that our approach can efficiently and accurately determine the quality of exposures. Applied to new imaging being reduced for DECaLS Data Release 11, our pipeline identifies 780 problematic exposures, which we subsequently verify through visual inspection. Being highly efficient and adaptable, our method offers a scalable solution for quality control in other large imaging surveys.

          Finding strangelets in cosmic rays from HESS J1731-347, a possible strange quark star using the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory

 - **Abstract**
 The hypothesis that supernova remnants are key sources of Galactic cosmic rays gains support from evidence that HESS J1731-347 one of the few Galactic objects capable of accelerating hadronic cosmic rays to TeV energies may harbor an exotic strange quark star rather than a conventional neutron star. This conclusion stems from its unusually low mass and compact radius, which challenge standard neutron star models. If confirmed, such a quark star could generate cosmic rays through the transition from the two-flavor color-superconducting (2SC) phase to the color-flavor-locked (CFL) phase, potentially releasing strangelets, hypothetical strange quark matter particles. Detecting these strangelets in cosmic rays would provide groundbreaking evidence for quark matter. The future Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA), with its unmatched sensitivity and spectral resolution in the very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray regime, is uniquely positioned to search for their annihilation or decay signatures. We analyze theoretical predictions for these gamma-ray signals and evaluate CTA's potential to detect or constrain them. Additionally, we present an in-depth assessment of CTA observations of HESS J1731-347, focusing on spectral features that could confirm strangelet production. A positive detection would not only validate the existence of strange quark stars but also establish a direct link between quark matter and cosmic-ray acceleration, reshaping our understanding of compact objects and high-energy astrophysics.

          How does the chemical composition of solids influence the formation of planetesimals?

 - **Abstract**
 The formation of planetesimals is a necessary step in the formation of planets. While several mechanisms have been proposed, a local dust-to-gas ratio above unity is a strong requirement to trigger the collapse of pebble clouds into planetesimals. A prime location for this is the water-ice line, where large water-rich pebbles evaporate and release their smaller silicate cores. This enhances the local dust-to-gas ratio due to the different inward drift speeds of large and small pebbles. Previous work suggested that planetesimal formation becomes difficult at overall dust-to-gas ratios below 0.6\%, consistent with the occurrence of close-in super Earths. However, the influence of disc composition on planetesimal formation remains unclear. Observations of stellar abundances show both a decrease and a wide spread in C/O ratios for low-metallicity stars. Using the C/O ratio as a proxy to determine water ice abundance in discs, we use the 1D disc evolution code chemcomp to simulate protoplanetary discs with varying C/O and dust-to-gas ratios over 3 Myr. Planetesimal formation is modeled using conditions based on dust-gas dynamics and pebble fragmentation. Our results confirm that planetesimal formation strongly depends on disc metallicity, with lower metallicity discs forming significantly fewer planetesimals. A lower carbon fraction generally promotes planetesimal formation by increasing water ice, while higher carbon fractions suppress it. The opposite is seen for oxygen: higher oxygen content leads to more efficient planetesimal formation at the same dust-to-gas ratio. We thus predict that planets around low-metallicity stars should be more common when their C/O ratio is low and oxygen is enhanced, a trend that can be tested observationally. Our simulations thus open a pathway to understand if the composition of the planet forming material influences the growth of planets.

 - **Abstract**
 Black hole X-ray binaries (candidates) currently identified in our galaxy are mainly transient sources, with the majority discovered through the detection of their X-ray outbursts. Among these, only four were found during faint outbursts exhibiting peak X-ray luminosities $L_{\rm X}\lesssim10^{36}~{\rm erg~s^{-1}}$, likely due to the previous lack of sensitive, wide-field monitoring instruments in the X-ray band. In this Letter, we present the discovery of an intriguing X-ray transient, EP J182730.0-095633, via the Einstein Probe (EP) and subsequent multi-wavelength follow-up studies. This transient, located on the Galactic plane, experienced a faint and brief X-ray outburst lasting about 20 days. Its X-ray spectrum is non-thermal and consistent with a power-law model with a nearly constant photon index of $\Gamma \sim2$ throughout the outburst. A long-lasting millihertz quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) signal was detected in its X-ray light curve, centered around a frequency of $\sim0.04$ Hz. A transient near-infrared source was identified as its counterpart, although no optical emission was detectable, likely due to significant extinction. A radio counterpart was also observed, displaying an inverted radio spectrum with $\alpha\sim0.45$. The X-ray spectral and temporal characteristics, along with the multi-wavelength properties, indicate that the source is a faint low-mass X-ray binary, with the compact object likely being a black hole. This work demonstrates the potential of the EP in discovering new X-ray binaries by capturing faint-level X-ray outbursts.

          Spectral analysis of HD 49798, a bright, hydrogen-deficient sdO-type donor star in an accreting X-ray binary

 - **Abstract**
 Context: HD 49798 is a bright ($m_{\rm V} = 8.287$), hot (effective temperature $T_{\rm eff} = 45000$ K) subdwarf star of the spectral type O (sdO). It is the only confirmed sdO-type mass-donor star of an X-ray binary that has a high-mass (1.28 $M_\odot$) white-dwarf or neutron-star primary with a spin period of only 13.2 s. Aims: Since a high-quality spectrum of HD 49798, obtained with the Tübingen Ultraviolet Echelle Spectrometer (TUES), that has never been analyzed before is available in the database of the Orbiting and Retrievable Far and Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (ORFEUS), we performed a spectral analysis based on observations from the far ultraviolet (FUV) to the optical wavelength range. Methods: We used advanced non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) model atmospheres of the Tuebingen Model-Atmosphere Package (TMAP) to determine the effective temperature, the surface gravity ($\log g$), and the abundances of those elements that exhibit lines in the available observed spectra. Results: We determined $T_{\rm eff} = 45000 \pm 1000$ K, log (g / cm/s$^2$) = $4.46 \pm 0.10$, and re-analyzed the previously determined photospheric abundances of H, He, N, O, Mg, Al, Si, Fe, and Ni. For the first time, we measured the abundances of C, Ne, P, S, Cr, and Mn. Conclusons: Our panchromatic spectral analysis of HD 49798 -- from the FUV to the optical -- allowed to reduce the error limits of the photospheric parameters and to precisely measure the metal abundances. HD 49798 is a stripped, intermediate-mass (zero-age main sequence mass of about 7.15 $M_\odot$) He star with a mass of 1.14(+0.30/-0.24) $M_\odot$. At its surface it exhibits abundances that are the result of CNO-cycle and 3 alpha burning nucleosynthesis as well as enhanced Cr, Mn, Fe, and Ni abundances.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Theories of the formation and evolution of small bodies in planetary systems predict that they may escape into interstellar space at any time. After having characterized just two such interlopers -1I/2017 U1 (Oumuamua) and 2I/Borisov more questions were raised than answered. Assessing the recently discovered interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS will only broaden our understanding of this complex topic. Aims. Here, we investigate the spectral, cometary, and rotational properties of 3I/ATLAS as well as its dynamical context. Methods. We identified the spectral type of 3I/ATLAS from the visible reflectance spectrum and used photometric observations to derive its level of activity and rotational properties. Observational data were obtained with the OSIRIS camera spectrograph at the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias and the Two-meter Twin Telescope. We used N-body simulations and statistical analyses of Gaia DR3 data to investigate the origin of 3I/ATLAS and its Galactic background. Results. Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has a visible spectrum consistent with that of a D-type asteroid, and has a spectral slope of 14.6%/1000 A in the 5000-9000 A range, which is similar to the one of Oumuamua but redder than that of 2I/Borisov and most solar system comets. It has a conspicuous coma and its rotation period is 16.79 h. The heliocentric components of its Galactic velocity were (U, V, W) = (-51.25, -19.466, 18.94) km/s with a radiant in Sagittarius. The analysis of a sample of kinematic analogs of 3I/ATLAS extracted from Gaia DR3 suggests that its parent system is part of the Galactic thin disk and includes a solar-like star with slightly sub-solar metallicity.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Understanding how the shape of cloud particle size distributions affects the atmospheric properties of sub-stellar atmospheres is a key area to explore, particularly in the JWST era of broad wavelength coverage, where observations are sensitive to particle size distributions. It is therefore important to elucidate how underlying cloud microphysical processes influence the size distribution, in order to better understand how clouds affect observed atmospheric properties. Aims. In this follow-up paper, we aim to extend our sub-stellar atmosphere microphysical cloud formation framework from Paper I to include effects of assuming a polydisperse gamma particle size distribution, requiring a three-moment solution set of equations. Methods. We develop a three-moment framework for sub-stellar mineral cloud particle microphysical nucleation, condensation, evaporation and collisional growth assuming a gamma distribution. As in Paper I, we demonstrate the effects of polydispersity using a simple one-dimensional Y-dwarf KCl cloud formation scenario, and compare the results with the monodisperse case. Results. Our three-moment scheme provides a generalised framework applicable to any size distribution with a defined moment generation expression. In our test case, we show that the gamma distribution evolves with altitude, initially broad at the cloud base and narrowing at lower pressures. We find that differences between the gamma and monodisperse cloud structures can be significant, depending on the surface gravity of the atmosphere. Conclusions. We present a self-consistent framework for including the effects of polydispersity for sub-stellar microphysical cloud studies using the moment method.

 - **Abstract**
 The sky images captured nightly by the camera on the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's telescope will be processed across facilities on three continents. Data acquisition will occur at the observatory's location on Cerro Pachón in the Andes mountains of Chile. A first copy of the raw image data set is stored at the summit and immediately transmitted via dedicated network links to the archive center within the US Data Facility at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory in California, USA and from there to two European facilities for processing and archiving purposes. Data products resulting from periodic processing campaigns of the entire set of images collected since the beginning of the survey are made available to the scientific community in the form of data releases. In this paper we present an overall view of how we leverage the tools selected for managing the movement of data among the Rubin processing and serving facilities, including Rucio and FTS. We also present the tools we developed to integrate Rucio's data model and Rubin's Data Butler, the software abstraction layer that mediates all access to storage by pipeline tasks that implement science algorithms.

 - **Abstract**
 Bouncing cosmology offers a singularity-free alternative to inflation, but its minimal realization-comprising only four cosmic phases-predicts a simple power-law stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) with a narrow observational window. We introduce the next-to-minimal bouncing cosmology (NMBC), which adds an extra early contraction phase that imprints a broken power-law feature in the SGWB spectrum, enhancing detectability. Using our matrix-representation method grounded in an inequality algebra, we derive a closed-form expression for the NMBC SGWB spectrum. From this analytical result, we show that all NMBC models satisfying the current \(\Delta N_{\rm eff}\) bound \(\Omega_{\rm GW}h^2(f)<1.7\times10^{-6}\) automatically avoid the trans-Planckian problem, \(\rho_{s\downarrow}^{1/4}<0.79\,m_{\rm pl}\). These findings establish the NMBC as a self-consistent, self-contained framework capable of generating a potentially detectable SGWB in both astrophysical and laboratory searches, and demonstrate the broad utility of our matrix-representation method for future SGWB analyses in multi-phase cosmologies.

 - **Abstract**
 Turbulence plays a critical role in regulating star formation in molecular clouds and is also observed in simulations of primordial halos that host Population III (Pop III) stars. The relative velocity between baryons and dark matter at the time of recombination is thought to be a source of turbulence in the early universe. In this paper, we study how this stream velocity affects the turbulence inside primordial halos using high-resolution cosmological simulations across the redshift range of $z = 30$ to $z = 20$. We find that at a fixed redshift, the stream velocity enhances turbulence in low-mass halos ($M \lesssim 10^6 \ \mathrm{M_\odot}$) and suppresses it for high-mass halos ($M \gtrsim 10^6 \ \mathrm{M_\odot}$). The enhancement in low-mass halos likely arises from residual kinetic energy introduced by the stream velocity, while the suppression in high-mass halos likely arises from a reduction in inflowing accretion-driven turbulence. This mass-dependent modulation of turbulence suggests that the initial conditions inside primordial halos are altered in the presence of the stream velocity, potentially influencing their fragmentation and the resulting star formation.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Young Massive Star Clusters, long considered as potentially important sources of galactic cosmic rays, have recently emerged as gamma-ray emitters up to very high energies. Aims. In order to quantify the contribution of this source class to the pool of Galactic CRs, we need to estimate the typical acceleration efficiency of these systems. Methods. We search for emission in the GeV band, as most of the energy is emitted in this band. We perform an analysis of Fermi-LAT data collected towards the M16 region, a star-forming region also known as the Eagle Nebula, which hosts the Young Massive Star Cluster NGC 6611. We model the acceleration at the stellar wind termination shock and the propagation through the wind-blown bubble to derive the energetics of the process and interpret the GeV observations. Results. We find significant GeV emission in correspondence of a molecular cloud associated to the Young Massive Star Cluster NGC 6611. We interpret this as hadronic emission associated to particle accelerated at the cluster wind termination shock and propagated through the low-density wind-excavated bubble to the cloud. Our modeling allows us to put firm constraints on the acceleration efficiency in NGC 6611, assessing it between $\sim$ 1 % and $\sim$ 4 %.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of a highly polarized millimeter (mm) continuum source in the central region of NGC 4945, identified through ALMA Band 3 observations. This starburst Seyfert 2 galaxy contains numerous compact mm sources, yet only one - located approximately 3.4" (~60 pc) from the galactic center and unresolved with ~0.1" resolution - exhibits an unusually high polarization degree of 50% $\pm$ 14%, likely originating from non-thermal synchrotron radiation. The source is faint, yet clearly detected in two separate epochs of observation taken 14 days apart, with flux of 0.104 $\pm$ 0.018 and 0.125 $\pm$ 0.016 mJy, as well as in earlier ALMA observations, showing no variability at any timescale. The spectral index remains stable within large uncertainties, -1.8 $\pm$ 2.5 and -1.3 $\pm$ 2.5. The source, which we further refer to as Punctum due to its compactness, revealed no clear counterparts in existing X-ray or radio observations. Assuming association with the central region of NGC 4945, we estimate upper limits for its luminosity of ~1 $\times$ 10$^{37}$ erg s$^{-1}$ in the 3-6 keV X-ray band (from archival Chandra data) and ~5 $\times$ 10$^{35}$ erg s$^{-1}$ at 23 GHz (from archival ATCA data). A comparison of the radio, mm (including polarization), and X-ray properties with known astrophysical sources emitting synchrotron radiation, such as accreting neutron stars, supernova remnants, and non-thermal galactic filaments, revealed no clear match in any of these scenarios. The exact nature of this highly polarized source remains undetermined.

 - **Abstract**
 The precise insertion of CubeSats into designated orbits is a complex task, primarily due to the limited propulsion capabilities and constrained fuel reserves onboard, which severely restrict the scope for large orbital corrections. This limitation necessitates the development of more efficient maneuvering techniques to ensure mission success. In this paper, we propose a maneuvering sequence that exploits the natural J2 perturbation caused by the Earth's oblateness. By utilizing the secular effects of this perturbation, it is possible to passively influence key orbital parameters such as the argument of perigee and the right ascension of the ascending node, thereby reducing the need for extensive propulsion-based corrections. The approach is designed to optimize the CubeSat's orbital insertion and minimize the total fuel required for trajectory adjustments, making it particularly suitable for fuel-constrained missions. The proposed methodology is validated through comprehensive numerical simulations that examine different initial orbital conditions and perturbation environments. Case studies are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the J2-augmented strategy in achieving accurate orbital insertion, showing a major reduction in fuel consumption compared to traditional methods. The results underscore the potential of this approach to extend the operational life and capabilities of CubeSats, offering a viable solution for future low-Earth orbit missions.

 We present a spectral atlas of solar spectroheliograms covering the wavelength range from 3641 to 6600 Å, with continuous coverage between 3711 and 5300 Å, and sparser coverage beyond this range. The spectral resolution varies between R $\sim$ 20 000 and 40 000, with a spectral step size between 60 and 90 mÅ, while the spatial resolution averages around 2.5 arcseconds. These observations were acquired over three months during the 2025 solar maximum, using amateur spectroheliographs (Sol'Ex and ML Astro SHG 700). The atlas is accessible via an interactive online platform with navigation tools and direct access to individual spectroheliograms.

 - **Abstract**
 We aim to identify the cluster members, estimate cluster properties, study the dynamical state of the clusters as a function of mass, trace the existence of dynamical effects in massive stars, and check for spatial patterns of members in young clusters. We studied 14 young open clusters located within 1 kpc using the data from Gaia DR3 with the membership estimated using the GMM method. The cluster parameters such as age, distance, metallicity, and extinction were estimated by fitting PARSEC isochrones to the CMDs. These clusters are found to have ages between 6-90 Myr, located between 334-910 pc, covering a mass range, of 0.13 to 13.77 solar mass. In five of these clusters, stars from F to M spectral type show increasing velocity dispersion, a signature for dynamical relaxation. We detect high proper motion for B and A-type stars, possible walkaway stars in the other five clusters, Alessi Teutsch 5, ASCC 16, ASCC 21, IC 2395, and NGC 6405. We demonstrate the existence of mass-dependent velocity dispersion in young clusters suggestive of dynamical relaxation. The typical range of transverse velocity dispersion is found to be 0.40 - 0.70 km/s for young clusters.

 - **Abstract**
 No less than 15% of large (diameter greater than 140 km) asteroids have satellites. The commonly accepted mechanism for their formation is post-impact reaccumulation. However, the detailed physical and dynamical properties of these systems are not well understood, and many of them have not been studied in detail. We aim to study the population of large binary asteroid systems. To do so, we compare the gravitational fields predicted from the shape of the primary body with the non-Keplerian gravitational components identified in orbital models of the satellites of each system. We also aim to contextualize these systems in the greater population of large binary systems, providing clues to asteroid satellite formation. We reduce all historical high-angular-resolution adaptive-optics (AO) images from ground-based telescopes to conduct astrometric and photometric measurements of each system's components. We then determine orbital solutions for each system using the genoid algorithm. We model the shapes of the system primaries using lightcurve-inversion techniques scaled with stellar occultations and AO images, and we develop internal structure models using SHTOOLS. Finally, we compare the distribution of the physical and orbital properties of the known binary asteroid systems. We find that differences between studies binary systems reflect an overall dichotomy within the population of large binary systems, with a strong correlation between primary elongation and satellite eccentricity observed in one group. We determine that there may be two distinct formation pathways influencing the end-state dichotomy in these binary systems, and that (762) Pulcova and (283) Emma belong to the two separate groups.

 Small bodies are the remnant building blocks from the time when the planets formed and migrated to their current positions. Their volatile composition and relative abundances serve as time capsules for the formation conditions in the protosolar nebula. By constraining the volatile composition of Centaurs, we can fill in important gaps in understanding the history of our solar system. We review here the state of knowledge for volatiles in small bodies, processes that influence volatile composition and activity in small bodies, and future capabilities that can be leveraged to advance our understanding of volatiles in Centaurs.

          Gravitational Waves from First-Order Phase Transitions Assisted by Temperature-Enhanced Scatterings

 - **Abstract**
 Scatterings whose cross sections increase as the cosmic temperature decreases, known as temperature-enhanced scatterings, can have a significant impact on the thermal effective potential of scalar fields responsible for driving cosmological first-order phase transitions. In this work, we systematically investigate how the inclusion of temperature-dependent corrections to the effective potential affects key phase transition parameters, including the nucleation temperature, latent heat release, and inverse duration parameter. These modifications influence both the strength and duration of the phase transition, which in turn determine the properties of the resulting stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background. Employing semi-analytic computational methods, we evaluate the GW spectra generated under these conditions and compare our predictions with the projected sensitivities of forthcoming detectors such as LISA, DECIGO, and BBO. Our analysis demonstrates that temperature-enhanced scatterings can substantially strengthen the phase transition and produce GW signals that lie within the reach of future observational facilities. This study highlights the importance of temperature-dependent microphysical processes in shaping early Universe cosmological signatures.

V838 Mon underwent a series of eruptions and extreme brightenings in 2002, which are thought to have occured as a result of a stellar merger.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent statistical analyses of wide binaries have revealed a boost in gravitational acceleration with respect to the prediction by Newtonian gravity at low internal accelerations $\lesssim 10^{-9}$ m\,s$^{-2}$. This phenomenon is important because it does not permit the dark matter interpretation, unlike galaxy rotation curves. We extend previous analyses by increasing the maximum sky-projected separation from 30 to 50 kilo astronomical units (kau). We show that the so-called ``perspective effects'' are not negligible at this extended separation and, thus, incorporate it in our analysis. With wide binaries selected with very stringent criteria, we find that the gravitational acceleration boost factor, $\gamma_g \equiv g_{\rm obs}/g_{\mathrm N}$, is $1.61^{+0.37}_{-0.29}$ (from $\delta_{\rm obs-newt}\equiv (\log_{10}\gamma_g)/\sqrt{2}=0.147\pm0.062$) at Newtonian accelerations $g_{\mathrm N} = 10^{-11.0}$ m\,s$^{-2}$, corresponding to separations of tens of kau for solar-mass binaries. At Newtonian accelerations $g_{\mathrm N} = 10^{-10.3}$ m\,s$^{-2}$, we find $\gamma_g=1.26^{+0.12}_{-0.10}$ ($\delta_{\rm obs-newt}=0.072\pm0.027$). For all binaries with $g_{\rm N}\lesssim10^{-10}$ m\,$s^{-2}$ from our sample, we find $\gamma_g=1.32^{+0.12}_{-0.11}$ ($\delta_{\rm obs-newt}=0.085\pm0.027$). These results are consistent with the generic prediction of MOND-type modified gravity, although the current data are not sufficient to pin down the low-acceleration limiting behavior. Finally, we emphasize that the observed deviation from Newtonian gravity cannot be explained by the perspective effects or any separation-dependent eccentricity variation which we take into account.

 - **Abstract**
 The candidate supernova remnant (SNR) G118.4+37.0 (Calvera's SNR), discovered as a faint radio ring at high Galactic latitude and coincident with extended Fermi/LAT gamma-ray emission, is likely associated to the X-ray pulsar 1RXS J141256.0+792204 (Calvera). Previous XMM-Newton data hinted at soft diffuse X-ray emission inside the ring but lacked sufficient exposure for detailed characterisation. We obtained new XMM-Newton observations, and produced count-rate images, equivalent width and median photon energy maps to identify optimal regions for spectral analysis. We complemented these observations with a reanalysis of Fermi/LAT gamma-ray data and new Telescopio Nazionale Galileo observations aimed to search for Halpha emission. The X-ray diffuse emission is well described by a model of shock-heated plasma with temperature kT \sim 0.15 keV, mildly under-solar N and o abundances and densities ne=0.1-0.7 cm-3. According to our estimates, Calvera's SNR is 10-20 kya old and lies at a distance of 4-5 kpc. A distinti "Clump" region shows hared emission equally well described by a thermal (kT\sim 1.7 keV) or a non thermal model (Gamma \sim 2.7). The brightest X-ray area is close to the gamma-ray peak and to an isolated Alpha filament. G118.4+37.0 is a middle-aged remnant which expands in a tenuous medium and encountered a denser phase, likely the relic of the wind activity of the massive progenitor star. The estimated SNR distance is consistent within the uncertainties with that estimated for Calvera, confirming that this peculiar pulsar was born in the explosion of a massive star high above the Galactic disk. Our measured ambient density, together with the patchy morphology of the gamma-ray emission and the detection of Halpha filaments indicates that a hadronic origin is compatible with the gamma-ray flux, though a mixed leptonic-hadronic cannot be excluded

 - **Abstract**
 We study the mesonic nonlinear (NL) interaction equation of state (EoS) employing the relativistic mean-field model and investigate the effect of $\sigma$-cut potential (NL-$\sigma$ cut) and dark matter (NL DM) on the non-radial and radial oscillation modes of neutron stars. For NL-$\sigma$ cut, we include the $\sigma$-cut potential $U_{cut} (\sigma)$ to study its effect. For the dark matter, we use the neutron decay anomaly model. For each model, we investigate two extreme EoSs, stiff and soft, that cover the entire allowed parameter range from the given model, consistent with the current astrophysical constraints. The EoS and the stellar properties, such as mass and radius, are calculated, and the effect of $\sigma$-cut and DM is discussed. Both non-radial and radial oscillation modes are computed in the general relativistic framework. We study the non-radial $f$ and $p_1$ mode frequency, damping time, and some qusi-universal relations connecting the frequencies of the $f$-mode to the average density and compactness. The analysis showed that the $f$ and $p_1$ mode frequencies at both 1.4~$M_{\odot}$ and the maximum mass configuration are higher in the NL DM model compared to the NL and NL-$\sigma$ models. The consistent alignment between our prior parameterizations and current calculations strongly supports the existence of quasi-universal relations that hold true irrespective of the particular matter components involved. For the radial oscillations, we compute 10 lowest-order modes ($f$, $p$), study the radial perturbations as well as the large frequency separation with NL-$\sigma$ cut and NL DM EoS, showing that the microphysics involved in the NS EoS is imprinted on the frequency separation between different nodes.

E71 is located at the edge of a filamentary structure, as traced in Herschel images (250-500 $\mu$m), Herschel column density map, and molecular maps in the velocity range [-20,-14] km/s. It hosts a stellar cluster (radius~1.26 pc, distance~1.81+/-0.15 kpc) associated with radio continuum emission, including a centrally positioned B1.5-type massive star (hereafter 'm2'), along with an enhanced population of evolved low-mass stars and young stellar objects. MIR images and molecular line maps reveal a PDR surrounding 'm2', exhibiting an arc-like structure along the edges of E71. Regularly spaced molecular and dust condensations are identified along this structure. The position-velocity map of 12CO emission suggests an expansion of molecular gas concentrated at the periphery of E71. Near-infrared spectroscopic observations with TANSPEC confirm the presence of the accretion process in a massive young stellar object (MYSO) located near the edge of the bubble. High-resolution uGMRT radio continuum maps uncover substructures in the ionized emission, both toward the MYSO and the center of E71. These findings support that 'm2' has shaped an arc-like morphology through its feedback processes. The pressure exerted by 'm2' and the velocity structure of the 12/13CO(1-0) emission suggest that the stellar feedback has likely driven out molecular material, leading to the formation of the expanding E71 bubble. Our overall investigation infers that the "collect and collapse" process might be a possible mechanism that can describe the ongoing star formation activities around the E71 bubble.

 - **Abstract**
 After nearly a decade in quiescence, the accreting millisecond pulsar IGR J17511$-$3057 displayed a new outburst on 2025 February 11, its third since discovery, following previous activity in 2009 and 2015. We report on an XMM-Newton Target of Opportunity observation performed on 2025 March 4, more than twenty days after the outburst onset. From the X-ray spectrum - well described by an absorbed Comptonization model - we estimated an unabsorbed 0.5$-$10 keV luminosity of $L_X \sim 7 \times 10^{33} \, \mathrm{erg \, s^{-1}}$ (assuming a source distance equal to the upper limit of $6.9$ kpc). To place this in context, we analyzed an archival Chandra observation performed in 2019, which yielded a quiescent luminosity of $L_\mathrm{X,q} \sim 2 \times 10^{32} \, \mathrm{erg \, s^{-1}}$ in the same energy band. Although this comparison indicates that the source was still well above its quiescent level during the XMM-Newton observation, the estimated low luminosity during the late stage of the 2025 outburst would typically place the source in the propeller regime. Nevertheless, we unexpectedly detected coherent X-ray pulsations with an amplitude peaking at $\sim$42% in the 0.3$-$3 keV band. We also observed a spectral softening compared to the early stages of the outburst. Finally, we report a 3$\sigma$ upper limit of 60 $\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$ on the source flux density at 5.5 GHz from ATCA observations acquired on 2025 April 12, following a decline of the accretion activity, as indicated by our analysis of NICER data from 2025 March 15, which revealed no significant X-ray pulsations at a luminosity level of $L_X \sim 1 \times 10^{34} \, \mathrm{erg \, s^{-1}}$. We discuss our findings in the context of other accreting millisecond pulsars and draw comparisons with transitional systems in the sub-luminous disk state.

 - **Abstract**
 We report on the results of a comprehensive analysis of X-ray observations carried out with \textit{Chandra}, \textit{XMM-Newton} and \textit{NuSTAR} of the pulsar wind nebula (PWN) associated with PSR B1853+01, located inside the W44 supernova remnant (SNR). Previous X-ray observations unveiled the presence of a fast-moving pulsar, PSR B1853+01, located at the southern edge of the W44 thermal X-ray emission region, as well as an elongated tail structure trailing the pulsar. Our analysis reveals, in addition, the presence of an ``outflow'' feature ahead of the pulsar extending for about 1 \arcmin ($\sim$ 1.0 pc at the distance of 3.2 kpc). At larger scales, the entire PWN seems to be surrounded by a faint, diffuse X-ray emission structure. The southern part of this structure displays the same unusual morphology as the ``outflow'' feature ahead of the pulsar, and extends along $\sim 6$ \arcmin ($\sim$ 5 pc) in the direction of the pulsar proper motion. In this report, a spatially-resolved spectral analysis for the different extended regions around PSR B1853+01 is carried out. For an updated value of the column density of $0.65_{+0.46}^{-0.42} \times 10^{22} ~\textrm{cm}^{-2}$, a power-law fit to the ``outflow'' region yields a spectral index $\Gamma \approx 1.24_{+0.23}^{-0.24}$, which is significantly harder than that of the pulsar ($\Gamma \approx 1.87_{+0.48}^{-0.43}$) and the pulsar tail ($\Gamma \approx 2.01_{+0.39}^{-0.38}$). We argue that both the ``outflow'' structure and the surrounding halo-like X-ray emission might be produced by high-energy particles escaping the PWN around PSR B1853+01, a scenario recently suggested also for other Bow-shock PWNe with jet-like structures and/or TeV halos.

 - **Abstract**
 Shadow observations provide a powerful tool to separate foreground components of the soft diffuse X-ray background (SDXB) from the background components. Such observations have now established that the ``local'' foreground is made of the solar wind charge exchange and the local bubble, and the background emission is from the extended circumgalactic medium (CGM) of the Milky Way and from the unresolved extragalactic sources. New data and careful analyses of the SDXB led to two new discoveries in recent years: (1) excess emission near 0.5 keV that is identified as the NVII emission line, and (2) excess emission near 0.8-1.0 keV that is identified with an additional, super-virial temperature hot thermal component of the CGM. The goal of this paper is to use Suzaku shadow observations along six sightlines to determine whether either of these components is from the ``local'' sources. We eliminate the ambiguity regarding the origin of NVII emission, ruling out the local origin. We confirm that the Milky Way CGM contains nitrogen-rich plasma, with a super-solar average (N/O) of 2.6+-0.5, and suggest that nitrogen-enhanced plasma is widespread throughout the CGM. We find super-solar Ne abundance in two sighlines, also from the CGM. Similarly, we rule out the local origin of the hot thermal component and confirm that it is present beyond the shadowing clouds. Furthermore, we provide a revised model of the soft diffuse X-ray background, which is crucial for extragalactic astronomy.

          $\texttt{raccoon}$: A Python package for removing wiggle artifacts in the JWST NIRSpec integral field spectroscopy

 - **Abstract**
 $\texttt{raccoon}$ is a Python package for removing resampling noise - commonly referred to as "wiggles'' - from spaxel-level spectra in datacubes obtained from the JWST Near Infrared Spectrograph's (NIRSpec) integral field spectroscopy (IFS) mode. These wiggles arise as artifacts during resampling of the 2D raw data into 3D datacubes, due to the point spread function (PSF) being undersampled. The standard JWST data reduction pipeline does not correct for this noise. The wiggle artifacts can significantly degrade the scientific usability of the data, particularly at the spaxel level, undermining the exquisite spatial resolution of NIRSpec. $\texttt{raccoon}$ provides an empirical correction by modeling and removing these artifacts, thereby restoring the fidelity of the extracted spectra. $\texttt{raccoon}$ forward-models the wiggles as a chirp function impacting one or more template spectra that are directly fit to the original data across the entire wavelength range. The best-fit wiggle model is then used to clean the data while propagating the associated uncertainties.

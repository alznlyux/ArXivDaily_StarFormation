 - **Abstract**
 We present an expanded template library for the supernova identification (SNID) software, along with updated source files that make it easy to merge our templates - and other major SNID libraries - into the base code. This expansion, dubbed 'Super-SNID', increases the number of spectra for under-represented supernova classes (e.g., SNe Ia-02cx, Ibn) and adds new classes (e.g., SLSNe, TDEs, LFBOTs). Super-SNID includes 841 spectral templates for 161 objects, primarily from the Public ESO Spectroscopic Survey of Transient Objects (PESSTO) Data Releases 1-4. The library is available on GitHub with simple installation instructions.

          Probing the origins. II. Unravelling lithium depletion and stellar motion: Intrinsic stellar properties drive depletion, not kinematics

 - **Abstract**
 In Paper I, we classified a stellar sample from the thin disc with a broad range in metallicity as being churned outward or inward, or blurred/undisturbed. In this paper (Paper II), we delve deeper by analysing our entire metallicity-stratified sample along with their dynamic properties, focusing on the connection between radial migration and Li depletion. We analyse the chemo-dynamics of a set of 1188 thin disc dwarf stars observed by the \textit{Gaia}-ESO survey, previously classified into six metallicity-stratified groups via Hierarchical Clustering (HC). We examine several features, such as effective temperatures, masses, and dynamic properties. We also implement a parametric survival analysis using penalised splines (logistic distribution) to quantify how stellar properties and motion (or migration) direction jointly influence Li depletion patterns. We find that stars in our sample that appear to have churned outward are predominantly Li-depleted, regardless of their metallicities. These stars are also the oldest, coldest, and least massive compared to those in the same HC group that have either churned inward or kept their orbital radii. Our survival analysis confirms temperature as the primary driver of Li depletion, followed by metallicity and age, while migration direction shows negligible influence. The increasing proportion of outward-churned stars with higher metallicity (and older ages) indicates their dominant influence on the overall trend observed in the [Fe/H]-A(Li) space for stellar groups with [Fe/H]>0. The survival model reinforces that the observed Li depletion stems primarily from intrinsic stellar properties (cool temperatures, higher metallicity, old ages) rather than migration history. This suggests the metallicity-dependent depletion pattern emerges through stellar evolution rather than Galactic dynamical processes.

          A Morphological Model to Separate Resolved--unresolved Sources in the DESI Legacy Surveys: Application in the LS4 Alert Stream

 - **Abstract**
 Separating resolved and unresolved sources in large imaging surveys is a fundamental step to enable downstream science, such as searching for extragalactic transients in wide-field time-domain surveys. Here we present our method to effectively separate point sources from the resolved, extended sources in the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Legacy Surveys (LS). We develop a supervised machine-learning model based on the Gradient Boosting algorithm \texttt{XGBoost}. The features input to the model are purely morphological and are derived from the tabulated LS data products. We train the model using $\sim$$2\times10^5$ LS sources in the COSMOS field with HST morphological labels and evaluate the model performance on LS sources with spectroscopic classification from the DESI Data Release 1 ($\sim$$2\times10^7$ objects) and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 17 ($\sim$$3\times10^6$ objects), as well as on $\sim$$2\times10^8$ Gaia stars. A significant fraction of LS sources are not observed in every LS filter, and we therefore build a ``Hybrid'' model as a linear combination of two \texttt{XGBoost} models, each containing features combining aperture flux measurements from the ``blue'' ($gr$) and ``red'' ($iz$) filters. The Hybrid model shows a reasonable balance between sensitivity and robustness, and achieves higher accuracy and flexibility compared to the LS morphological typing. With the Hybrid model, we provide classification scores for $\sim$$3\times10^9$ LS sources, making this the largest ever machine-learning catalog separating resolved and unresolved sources. The catalog has been incorporated into the real-time pipeline of the La Silla Schmidt Southern Survey (LS4), enabling the identification of extragalactic transients within the LS4 alert stream.

          Asteroseismology of WD J004917.14-252556.81, the Most Massive Pulsating White Dwarf

 - **Abstract**
 We present extensive follow-up time-series photometry of WD J0049$-$2525, the most massive pulsating white dwarf currently known with $T_{\rm eff} = 13\, 020\,{\rm K}$ and $\log{\it g} = 9.34$ cm s$^{-2}$. The discovery observations detected only two significant pulsation modes. Here, we report the detection of 13 significant pulsation modes ranging from 170 to 258 s based on 11 nights of observations with the New Technology Telescope, Gemini, and Apache Point Observatory telescopes. We use these 13 modes to perform asteroseismology and find that the best-fitting models (under the assumption of an ONe core composition) have $M_{\star} \approx 1.29~M_\odot$, surface hydrogen layer mass of $\log(M_{\rm H}/M_{\star}) \lesssim -7.5$, and a crystallized core fraction of $>99\%$. An analysis of the period spacing also strongly suggests a very high mass. The asteroseismic distance derived is in good agreement with the distance provided by Gaia. We also find tentative evidence of a rotation period of 0.3 or 0.67 d. This analysis provides the first look at the interior of a $\sim 1.3~M_{\odot}$ white dwarf.

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are generally categorized into long and short bursts based on their duration ($T_{90}$). Recently, it has been proposed that GRBs can also be classified into type I (merger) and type II (collapsar) bursts based on the different origin. From a sample of \textit{Swift} long GRBs~(LGRBs) with a redshift completeness of 60\% and $P \geq 2.6 \, \text{ph} \, \text{cm}^{-2} \, \text{s}^{-1}$, collected through the end of 2023, we identify a pure sample of 146 Type II GRBs. With this sample, we construct the luminosity function (LF) using both the Broken Power Law (BPL) and Triple Power Law (TPL) models. Our results indicate that, similar to LGRBs, a strong redshift evolution in either luminosity or density is necessary to accurately account for the observations, regardless of the specific form of the LF assumed. The LF of LGRBs remains a topic of debate, with some studies suggesting it follows a BPL form, while others advocate for a TPL form. In our study, we find that the LF of Type II GRBs tends to favor a BPL model.

          Far-ultraviolet flares and variability of the young M dwarf AU Mic: a non-detection of planet c in transit at Lyman-alpha

 - **Abstract**
 Atmospheric escape's potential to shape the exoplanet population motivates detailed observations of systems actively undergoing escape. AU Mic is a young and active M dwarf hosting two close-in transiting sub- to Neptune-sized planets. Atmospheric escape was previously detected on the inner planet b, with radially-blown neutral hydrogen producing ~30% blue-shifted absorption in Lyman-alpha. We obtained one HST/STIS transit of the outer planet c, to search for the planet's escaping atmosphere in transmission at Lyman-alpha and compare with AU Mic b. We detected 6 short-duration flares in Si IV and C IV, of which only one corresponded to a Lyman-alpha flare. We identified longer-duration stellar variability at the tens of percent level for lines less sensitive to stellar activity, including O I, C II and Lyman-alpha, which inhibits detection of an exosphere. We do not report absorption associated with an exosphere containing neutral hydrogen or any metals detectable in the far-ultraviolet, and discuss the implications of the non-detection. This work highlights the importance of 1) careful consideration of stellar variability in atmospheric escape observations, and 2) the dual-influence of photoionization and stellar wind when interpreting and modeling atmospheric escape.

          Wind shear and the role of eddy vapor transport in driving water convection on Jupiter

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations of convection in the jovian atmosphere have demonstrated that convection is strongly concentrated at specific locations on planet. For instance, observations of lightning show that the cyclonic features (e.g,. belts and folded filamentary regions - FFRs) show increased convective activity compared to anti-cyclonic regions. Meanwhile, the distribution of ammonia and water vapor show a large enrichment near the equator, which is also suggestive of strong upwelling and convective activity. Marrying these different observations is challenging due to a lack of data concerning the characteristics of the deep jovian atmosphere, and a resulting inability to observe the true deep source of the various convective phenomena. To understand the nature of these convective events and \paperedit{the role of the } structure of the deep atmosphere \paperedit{in driving convective events}, we run simulations of cloud formation and convection using the Explicit Planetary hybrid-Isentropic Coordinate General Circulation Model (EPIC GCM). We vary the dynamics of the atmosphere by parameterizing the deep wind shear and studying the resulting effect on the strength, frequency and distribution of convective storms. We find that convection in our model is strongly tied to the local dynamics and the deep wind shear. We further decompose the generation of convective available potential energy (CAPE) into three components (thermal, mechanical, and moist/chemical), and find that the chemical mechanism is the strongest component, working to advect water vapor from moisture-rich regions to moisture-poor regions and to drive convection along a ``moisture front.''

          Oort Cloud Formation and Evolution in Star Clusters

 - **Abstract**
 It is unknown if an Oort cloud reaches its maximum mass within its star's birth cluster or millions of years later. Complicating the Oort cloud evolution process is the fact that comets can be stripped from orbit due to perturbations from passing stars. We explore how a star's cluster escape time (t$_{ \rm esc}$) and the time its Oort cloud reaches maximum mass (t$_{ \rm max}$) affect the Oort cloud's ability to survive via $N$-body simulations. In a 14 M$_\odot$/pc$^3$ cluster, we identify 50 stars of 1 M$_\odot$ with a range of t$_{ \rm esc}$ to host Oort clouds, each with 1000 comets at t$_{ \rm max}$. For each host, we consider Oort clouds that reach maximum mass 0, 50, and 250 Myr after the cluster's formation. Each Oort cloud's evolution is simulated in the cluster from t$_{ \rm max}$ to t$_{ \rm esc}$. Only a fraction of comets tend to remain in orbit, with this amount depending on t$_{ \rm max}$ and t$_{ \rm esc}$. We observe that 12%, 22%, and 32% of Oort clouds with a t$_{ \rm max}$ of 0, 50 and 250 Myr retain >50% of their comets at t$_{ \rm esc}$, respectively. We find that the fraction of comets stripped has the relationship, $\rm f=m\log_{10}(\frac{t_{ \rm esc}-t_{ \rm max}}{Myr})$ where m = 0.32$\pm$0.04, indicating that the longer the Oort cloud remains in the cluster, the more comets are stripped, with this fraction increasing logarithmically at approximately the same rate for each t$_{ \rm max}$.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a cosmological model-independent determination of the Hubble constant, $H_0$, by combining time-delay measurements from seven TDCOSMO systems, Einstein radius measurements, and Type Ia Supernovae data sourced from the Pantheon+ sample. For each lens of time-delay system, we calculate the angular diameter distance $D_{A_l}$ using the product $D^{\textrm{Obs}}(z_l) \cdot D_{A,\Delta t}^{\textrm{Obs}}(z_l, z_s)$, where $D^{\textrm{Obs}}(z_l)$ is reconstructed via Gaussian Processes from 99 Einstein radius measurements, and $D_{A,\Delta t}^{\textrm{Obs}}(z_l,z_s)$ is the time-delay angular distance. We also reconstruct the unanchored luminosity distance $H_0 D_L(z_l)$ from supernova data. By using the cosmic distance duality relation validity, we anchor $D_{A_l}$ and $H_0 D_L(z_l)$ to infer $H_0 = 70.55 \pm 7.44$ km/s/Mpc (68\% CL). Our result, though not resolving the Hubble tension, offers a cosmological model-independent consistency check and highlights the potential of using strong lensing and supernovae data via the cosmic distance duality relation to constrain $H_0$.

          Changing methodologies in solar physics

 - **Abstract**
 This study attempts to establish a basis for understanding how methods used in research in solar physics have evolved since World War II (WWII). The goal is to begin to explore if and how the changing research environment affects the training of young scientists, and the future of solar physics research at our institutions. A strategy based upon a sample of 650 PhD theses is used to seek possible trends over 8 decades, with the aim of uncovering any correlations between methods used and measures of success. Necessarily subjective, results depend on how methods are defined, and how success is measured. Although a brief justification of the choices made is attempted, trying mainly to avoid pitfalls such as counting citations, it is clear that further assessment is required. The statistical analysis is based upon necessarily subjective categorization and the inference of likelihoods of two different distributions being drawn from the same underlying distribution. The statistics seem to reflect historical events, such as the Kennedy Moonshot program and the associated SKYLAB mission, with changes delayed by a few years. The data suggest that impactful advances are becoming more rare. Yet the methods used have changed little barring those related to obvious technological advances (e.g. the advent of spacecraft, adaptive optics). A follow-up study to explore the 100,000+ publications in solar physics through machine learning seems warranted.

          Model-Independent Dark Energy Measurements from DESI DR2 and Planck 2015 Data

 - **Abstract**
 Using DESI DR2 baryon acoustic oscillation distance measurements and Planck cosmic microwave background distance priors, we have measured the dark energy density $\rho_X(z)$ and dark energy equation of state $w_X(z)$ as free functions of redshift (smoothly interpolated from values at $z=0, 1/3, 2/3, 1, 4/3, 2.33$), and find both to be consistent with a cosmological constant, with only deviations of 1.2$\sigma$ for $\rho_X(z)$ and 1.9$\sigma$ for $w_X(z)$ at $z=2/3$. We confirm our earlier finding in Wang & Freese (2006) that $w_X(z)$ is significantly less constrained by data than $\rho_X(z)$. Our results differ noticeably from those of the DESI Collaboration, in which they used the same DESI DR2 data combined with Planck data and found a 3.1$\sigma$ deviation from a cosmological constant, a finding which is the consequence of their assuming the parametrization $w_X(z)=w_0+w_a(1-a)$. Our results indicate that assuming a linear $w_X(z)$ could be misleading and precludes discovering how dark energy actually varies with time at higher redshifts. In our quest to discover the physical nature of dark energy, the most urgent goal at present is to determine definitively whether dark energy density varies with time. We have demonstrated that it is of critical importance to measure dark energy density as a free function of redshift from data. Future galaxy redshift surveys by Euclid and Roman at higher redshifts will significantly advance our understanding of dark energy.

          Fast inflowing ionized absorber tracing the gas dynamics at sub-parsec scale around Mrk 3

 - **Abstract**
 Accretion onto supermassive black hole (SMBH) releases energy via radiation, jets or winds, providing feedback effects on the circumnuclear gas environment. However, the dynamics of accreting gas on sub-parsec scales near the SMBH remains poorly understood. With high-resolution X-ray spectra of Mrk 3, we detect a fast inflowing ionized absorber characterized by redshifted Fe XXV and Fe XXVI absorption lines. Photoionization modeling reveals the inflowing absorber is located at $\lesssim0.04-0.74\rm~pc$ and is decelerating from $6.1\pm0.5\times10^3\rm~km~s^{-1}$ to $3.4\pm0.3\times10^3\rm~km~s^{-1}$ over 11 years. Only $\sim0.6$\%--$3$\% of the inflowing material is estimated to reach the event horizon. This direct evidence of sub-parsec scale fueling inflow bridges the gap between the torus and the outer accretion disk. Furthermore, a $0.86$-keV gas component with sub-solar metallicity ($Z\sim0.22$), outflowing at a velocity of $\sim330\rm~km~s^{-1}$, is detected in the soft X-ray band. It may corresponds to the [O III] biconical outflow in the narrow-line region. A putative ultra-fast disk wind outside our line-of-sight, or clouds within the broad-line region, are promising candidates for decelerating the inflowing absorber.

          High-time-resolution properties of 35 fast radio bursts detected by the Commensal Real-time ASKAP Fast Transients Survey

 - **Abstract**
 We present microsecond-resolution, coherently-dedispersed, polarimetric measurements of 35 fast radio bursts (FRBs) detected during the Commensal Real-time ASKAP Fast Transients (CRAFT) incoherent sum (ICS) survey with the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP). We find a wide diversity of time-frequency morphology and polarisation properties broadly consistent with those of currently known non-repeating FRBs. The high S/N and fine time-resolution of our data however reveals a wealth of new information. Key results include (i) the distribution of scattering timescales, ${\tau}_{obs}$, is limited purely by instrumental effects, with no downturn at high ${\tau}_{obs}$ as expected from a log-normal distribution; (ii) for the 29 FRBs with known redshift, ${\tau}_{obs}$ is uncorrelated with dispersion measure (DM) fluctuations about the Macquart relation, in contrast to expectations from pulsar scattering-DM relations; (iii) all FRBs probably have multiple components, and at least a large fraction have variable PA, the identification of which is limited by scattering; (iv) at least half of all FRBs exhibit PA microstructure at 200 ${\mu}s$-200 ns timescales, with behaviour most closely resembling a sub-category of Crab main pulses; (v) that there is a break in the FRB circular polarisation distribution at Stokes V $\gtrsim$ 20%, which is suggestive of a discrete sub-population.

          Are single-field models of inflation and PBH production ruled out by ACT observations?

 - **Abstract**
 The data release from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) imposes stronger constraints on primordial black hole (PBH) formation in single-field inflation models than the Planck data. In particular, the updated Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) measurements favor a higher scalar spectral index $n_s$, a positive running $\alpha_s$, and a smaller slow-roll parameter $\eta$. Even in the absence of PBH production, the updated constraints together place many single-field models under tension with the CMB data. To explore this tension, we study PBH formation in an $\alpha$-attractor E-model. We investigate an impact of bending of the inflaton potential plateau toward reconciling the model with the new bounds for CMB observables. We find that attempts to increase $n_s$ by upward bending lead to negative values of $\alpha_s$ that are disfavored by the new bounds. A possible model-building approach to resolve the tension is proposed.

 - **Abstract**
 We demonstrate that dark matter interactions can profoundly influence stellar nucleosynthesis in the early universe by altering thermodynamic gradients and modifying nuclear reaction rates within primordial stars. Incorporating a dark matter-modified Fermi-Dirac distribution and accounting for localized energy injection from annihilation heating, our model predicts enhanced production of carbon and nitrogen alongside reduced oxygen synthesis. These compositional shifts significantly reshape stellar structure and produce synthetic spectra that closely reproduce the observed characteristics of carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars. Our findings reveal a direct and previously overlooked role of dark matter in driving the chemical evolution of the early cosmos, offering a plausible link between fundamental particle physics and observable astrophysical signatures.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the image maps, data reduction, analysis and the first source counts from the Herschel SPIRE Dark Field. The SPIRE Dark Field is an area of sky near the North Ecliptic Pole observed many times during the calibration phase of the Herschel mission in order to characterise the stability of the SPIRE instrument and is subsequently one of the deepest imaged fields of the Universe at far-infrared-submillimetre wavelengths. The SPIRE dark field is concurrent with the Spitzer IRAC Dark Field used for a similar purpose. The final Dark Field map is comprised of 141 individual SPIRE observations in Small Map and Large Map modes defined by a deep inner region approximately 12' in diameter and a slightly shallower surrounding area of diameter ~30'. The depth of both regions reach well below the confusion limit of the SPIRE instrument at 250 microns, 350 microns and 500 microns. Two independent processes are used to extract sources, a standard map based method using the SUSSEXtractor algorithm and a list driven photometry approach using the XID algorithm with the Spitzer MIPS 24 microns catalogue as an input prior. The resulting source counts detect the turnover in the galaxy population with both methods shown to be consistent with previous results from other Herschel surveys, with the XID process reaching approximately twice as deep compared to traditional map based algorithms. Finally, we compare our results with two contemporary galaxy evolution models, again showing a good general agreement with the modelled counts.

          Primordial black holes through preheating instabilities in $α$-attractor models

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we explore the production of primordial black holes (PBHs) within the context of $\alpha$-attractor inflationary models, focusing on the preheating phase following inflation. During this phase, self-resonance instabilities arise due to deviations of the inflationary potential from a quadratic form. PBH formation is analyzed using three criteria: (1) the perturbation must lie within the instability band, (2) its characteristic length must exceed the Jeans length, and (3) it must have sufficient time to collapse based on the estimations of massive scalar field spherical collapse in Einstein-de Sitter universe. Based on these criteria, we calculate the PBH mass fraction using the Press-Schechter (PS) and Khlopov-Polnarev (KP) formalisms. Our results show that the PS formalism tends to overestimate PBH abundance during preheating, as it neglects nonspherical effects. In contrast, the KP formalism yields more realistic predictions by incorporating such effects. We provide a detailed comparison with observational constraints from evaporating PBHs. Notably, the PS formalism is excluded by these constraints, which are based on Hawking radiation, while the KP formalism remains viable. These findings underscore the importance of accounting for nonspherical effects and accurate collapse dynamics in studies of PBH formation during preheating.

          Gravitational waves from strong first order phase transitions

 - **Abstract**
 We study gravitational wave production at strong first order phase transitions, with large-scale, long-running simulations of a system with a scalar order parameter and a relativistic fluid. One transition proceeds by detonations with asymptotic wall speed $v_\text{w}=0.92$ and transition strength $\alpha_n=0.67$, and the other by deflagrations, with a nominal asymptotic wall speed $v_\text{w}=0.44$ and transition strength $\alpha_n=0.5$. We investigate in detail the power spectra of velocity and shear stress and - for the first time in a phase transition simulation - their time decorrelation, which is essential for the understanding of gravitational wave production. In the detonation, the decorrelation speed is larger than the sound speed over a wide range of wavenumbers in the inertial range, supporting a visual impression of a flow dominated by supersonic shocks. Vortical modes do not contribute greatly to the produced gravitational wave power spectra even in the deflagration, where they dominate over a range of wavenumbers. In both cases, we observe dissipation of kinetic energy by acoustic turbulence, and in the case of the detonation an accompanying growth in the integral scale of the flow. The gravitational wave power approaches a constant with a power law in time, from which can be derived a gravitational wave production efficiency. For both cases this is approximately $\tilde{\Omega}^\infty_\text{gw} \simeq 0.017$, even though they have quite different kinetic energy densities. The corresponding fractional density in gravitational radiation today, normalised by the square of the mean bubble spacing in Hubble units, for flows which decay in much less than a Hubble time, is $\Omega_{\text{gw},0}/(H_\text{n} R_*)^2=(4.8\pm1.1)\times 10^{-8}$ for the detonation, and $\Omega_{\text{gw},0}/(H_\text{n} R_*)^2=(1.3\pm0.2)\times 10^{-8}$ for the deflagration.

 - **Abstract**
 The Barcelona Raman LIDAR (BRL) will provide continuous monitoring of the aerosol extinction profile along the line of sight of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO). It will be located at its Northern site (CTAO-N) on the Observatorio del Roque de Los Muchachos. This article presents the performance of the pathfinder Barcelona Raman LIDAR (pBRL), a prototype instrument for the final BRL. Power budget simulations were carried out for the pBRL operating. under various conditions, including clear nights, moon conditions, and dust intrusions. The LIDAR PreProcessing (LPP) software suite is presented, which includes several new statistical methods for background subtraction, signal gluing, ground layer and cloud detection and inversion, based on two elastic and one Raman lines. Preliminary test campaigns were conducted, first close to Barcelona and later at CTAO-N, albeit during moonlit nights only. The pBRL, under these non-optimal conditions, achieves maximum ranges up to about 35 km, range resolution of about 50 m for strongly absorbing dust layers, and 500 m for optically thin clouds with the Raman channel only, leading to similar resolutions for the LIDAR ratios and Angstrom exponents. Given the reasonable agreement between the extinction coefficients obtained from the Raman and elastic lines independently, an accuracy of aerosol optical depth retrieval in the order of 0.05 can be assumed with the current setup. The results show that the pBRL can provide valuable scientific results on aerosol characteristics and structure, although not all performance requirements could be validated under the conditions found at the two test sites. Several moderate hardware improvements are planned for its final upgraded version [truncated].

 - **Abstract**
 Astrometry, the precise measurement of stellar positions and velocities, offers a promising approach to probing the low-frequency stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB). Notably, astrometric vector sky maps are sensitive to parity-violating SGWB signals, which cannot be distinguished using pulsar timing array observations in an isotropic SGWB. We present the first astrometric constraints on parity-violating SGWB using quasar catalogs from Gaia DR3 and VLBA data. By analyzing the $EB$ correlation in the two-point correlation function of the proper motions of the quasars, we find 2$\sigma$ constraints on the parity-violating SGWB amplitude $h_{70}^2\Omega_{V} = -0.020 \pm 0.025$ from Gaia DR3 and $h_{70}^2\Omega_{V} = -0.004 \pm 0.010$ from VLBA. These constraints are valid in the frequency range $4.2 \times 10^{-18}\,{\rm Hz} < f < 1.1 \times 10^{-8}\,{\rm Hz}$. Although not currently a tight constraint on theoretical models, this first attempt lays the groundwork for future investigations using more precise astrometric data.

          Grand Theft Moons. Formation of habitable moons around giant planets

 Of the few thousand discovered exoplanets, a significant number orbit in the habitable zone of their star. Many of them are gas giants lacking a rocky surface and solid water reservoirs necessary for life as we know it. The search for habitable environments may extend to the moons of these giant planets. No confirmed exomoon discoveries have been made as of today, but promising candidates are known. Theories suggest that moon formation is a natural process in planetary systems. We aim to study moon formation around giant planets in a phase similar to the final assembly of planet formation. We search for conditions for forming the largest moons with the highest possibility in circumplanetary disks, and investigate whether the resulting moons can be habitable. We determined the fraction of the circumplanetary disk's mass converted into moons using numerical N-body simulations where moon embryos grow via embryo-satellitesimal collisions, investigated in disks around giant planets consisting of 100 fully interacting embryos and 1000 satellitesimals. In fiducial simulations, a 10 Jupiter-mass planet orbited a solar analog star at distances of 1-5 au. To determine the habitability of the synthetic moons, we calculated the stellar irradiation and tidal heating flux on these moons based on their orbital and physical parameters. The individual moon mass is found to be higher when the host planet orbits at a smaller stellar distance. However, moons leave the circumplanetary disk due to the stellar thief effect, which is stronger closer to the star. We find that 32% of synthetic moons can be habitable in the circumstellar habitable zone. Due to the intense tidal heating, the incidence rate of moon habitability is similar at 2 au, and decreasing to 1% at larger distances (<5 au). We conclude that the circumstellar habitable zone can be extended to moons around giant planets.

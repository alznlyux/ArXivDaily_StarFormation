 - **Abstract**
 Enceladus is among the most intriguing bodies in the solar system due to its astrobiological potential. Determining the extent and duration of sustainable habitability requires characterizing the interior properties, and in particular, the extent and distribution of the tidal heating. The intensity of any inferred geophysical activity in the core has direct implications for understanding the hydrothermal activity and the budget of biologically useful species. We build a statistical framework using an MCMC approach to constrain the interior based on currently available observations of libration, shape, heat budget, and mass. We use this framework to examine the extent that geodetic measurements can constrain the interior structure, with an emphasis on determining the partitioning of tidal dissipation between the shell and the core. We quantify plausible ranges of gravitational and displacement tidal Love numbers consistent with existing observations. We demonstrate that measuring the amplitude and phase of $k_2$ alone can only constrain the total tidally dissipated energy, without a sensitivity to the distribution of heat. However, measuring the amplitude and phase of $h_2$ or $l_2$ facilitates determination of the shell rheology. We provide the precisions required for measuring $k_2$, $h_2$, and/or $l_2$ that enable distinguishing between the two main scenarios of tidal heating, i.e., in the shell versus the core. We also investigate the effect of the structural heterogeneities of the shell on the tidal response. Lastly, we evaluate the efficacy of a suite of future geodetic measurements to constrain key interior properties essential to instantaneous and sustained habitability at Enceladus.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the detection of a spin-down glitch with a fractional frequency change of $\Delta\nu/\nu=-3.46(6)\times10^{-9}$ in the rotation-powered pulsar PSR J1835$-$1106 at MJD 55813, based on timing observations collected with the Nanshan 26-m and Parkes 64-m radio telescopes from January 2000 to July 2022. A comparison of the average pulse profiles within $\pm300$ d of the event reveals no significant morphological changes. We also estimate the angular velocity lag between the normal and superfluid components at the time of the glitch, demonstrating that one of the spin-down glitch models proposed by Kantor & Gusakov (2014) is not applicable to PSR J1835$-$1106.

 - **Abstract**
 The evolution of interstellar ices can be studied with thermal tracers such as the vibrational modes of CO$_2$ ice that show great diversity depending on their local chemical and thermal environment. In this work we present JWST observations of the 15.2 $\mu$m bending mode, the 4.39 $\mu$m stretching mode and the 2.70 $\mu$m combination mode of $^{12}$CO$_2$ and $^{13}$CO$_2$ ice in the high-mass protostar IRAS 20126 and the low-mass protostar Per-emb 35. The 15.2 $\mu$m bending mode of both protostars shows the characteristic double peak profile that is associated with pure CO$_2$ ice and a sharp short-wavelength peak is observed at 4.38 $\mu$m in the $^{13}$CO$_2$ bands of the two sources. Furthermore, a narrow short-wavelength feature is detected at 2.69 $\mu$m in the $^{12}$CO$_2$ combination mode of Per-emb 35. We perform a consistent profile decomposition on all three vibrational modes and show that the profiles of all three bands can be reproduced with the same linear combination of CO$_2$ ice in mixtures with mostly CH$_3$OH and H$_2$O ices when the ices undergo segregation due to heating. The findings show that upon heating, CO$_2$ ice is likely segregating from mostly the water-rich ice layer and the CO$_2$-CH$_3$OH component becomes dominant in all three vibrational modes. Additionally, we find that the contribution of the different CO$_2$ components to the total absorption band is similar for both $^{12}$CO$_2$ and $^{13}$CO$_2$. This indicates that fractionation processes must not play a significant role during the different formation epochs, H$_2$O-dominated and CO-dominated. We quantify the $^{12}$CO$_2$ and $^{13}$CO$_2$ ice column densities and derive $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C$_{ice}$ = 90 $\pm$ 9 in IRAS 20126. Finally, we report the detection of the $^{13}$CO$_2$ bending mode of pure CO$_2$ ice at 15.64 $\mu$m in both IRAS 20126 and Per-emb 35.

          Accretion of self-interacting dark matter onto supermassive black holes

 - **Abstract**
 Dark matter (DM) spikes around supermassive black holes (SMBHs) may lead to interesting physical effects such as enhanced DM annihilation signals or dynamical friction within binary systems, shortening the merger time and possibly addressing the `final parsec problem'. They can also be promising places to study the collisionality of DM because their velocity dispersion is higher than in DM halos allowing us to probe a different velocity regime. We aim to understand the evolution of isolated DM spikes for self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) and compute the BH accretion rate as a function of the self-interaction cross-section per unit DM mass ($\sigma/m_\chi$). We have performed the first $N$-body simulations of SIDM spikes around supermassive black holes (SMBH) and studied the evolution of the spike with an isolated BH starting from profiles similar to the ones that have been shown to be stable in analytical calculations. We find that the analytical profiles for SIDM spikes remain stable over the time-scales of hundreds of years that we have covered with our simulations. In the long-mean-free-path (LMFP) regime, the accretion rate onto the BHs grows linearly with the cross-section and flattens when we move towards the short-mean-free-path (SMFP) regime. In both regimes, our simulations match analytic expectations, which are based on the heat conduction description of SIDM. A simple model for the accretion rate allows us to calibrate the heat conduction in the gravothermal fluid prescription of SIDM. Using this prescription, we determine the maximum allowed accretion rate which occurs when $r_{\rm isco} \rho(r_{\rm isco}) \sigma/m_\chi \sim 1$, where $r_{\rm isco}$ the radius of the innermost stable orbit. Our calibrated DM accretion rates could be used for statistical analysis of SMBH growth and incorporated into subgrid models to study BH growth in cosmological simulations.

          Binary stars take what they get: Evidence for Efficient Mass Transfer from Stripped Stars with Rapidly Rotating Companions

 - **Abstract**
 Binary stars and their interactions shape the formation of compact binaries, supernovae, and gravitational wave sources. The efficiency of mass transfer - the fraction of mass retained by the accretor during binary interaction - is a critical parameter that significantly impacts the final fate of these systems. However, this parameter is observationally poorly constrained due to a scarcity of well-characterized post-mass-transfer binaries. Be+sdOB binaries, consisting of a rapidly rotating Be star and a stripped hot subdwarf companion, are particularly valuable for studying mass transfer since they represent clear examples of past binary interaction. Recently, a significantly expanded observational sample of 16 Be+sdOB binaries with well-constrained masses was obtained through combined spectroscopic and interferometric observations. In this work, we compile and analyze this sample to provide robust constraints on the mass transfer efficiency in binaries that underwent stable mass transfer during the donor's hydrogen-shell burning phase. Our analysis reveals that mass transfer was predominantly conservative: half of the systems require mass transfer efficiencies above 50%. This challenges commonly adopted assumptions of highly non-conservative mass transfer in binary evolution modeling. Our findings are inconsistent with models that account for spin-up and limit accretion due to a centrifugal barrier. We also find tension with a commonly used mass transfer model in rapid population synthesis that limits accretion based on the thermal timescale of the accretor. These results have strong implications for almost all products of binary evolution including the variety of supernovae, white dwarfs, blue stragglers, runaway stars, X-ray binaries, and gravitational-wave sources.

          Population demographics of white dwarf binaries with intermediate separations: Gaia constraints on post-AGB mass transfer

 - **Abstract**
 Astrometry from the Gaia mission has revealed a large population of white dwarf (WD) + main sequence (MS) binaries with periods of $100 - 1000\,$d. Such systems have separations intermediate to predictions from standard binary evolution scenarios, challenging models of binary interaction and mass transfer. Because the selection function of Gaia astrometric catalogs is complex, the underlying population demographics of WD+MS binaries remain imperfectly understood. We present a forward-model of the au-scale WD+MS binary population probed by Gaia that begins with a realistic binary population and incorporates a full model of Gaia mock observations and astrometric model fitting, as well as cuts employed in producing the Gaia astrometric catalog and selecting WD+MS binary candidates. Our model allows us to constrain the intrinsic population demographics of intermediate-separation WD+MS binaries. The inferred period distribution is close to flat, with ${\rm d}N/{\rm d}P_{\rm orb}\propto P_{\rm orb}^{-0.25}$, while the WD mass distribution is sharply peaked at $0.6\,M_{\odot}$. We model the formation of au-scale WD+MS binaries as the result of interaction when the WD progenitor is an AGB star. Explaining the mass distributions of both components requires two key assumptions: (1) the mass growth of the WD is terminated when its AGB progenitor overflows its Roche lobe, and (2) post-AGB binaries binaries remain wide only if the accretor-to-donor mass ratio exceeds a critical threshold, $q_{\rm crit} \approx 0.4$. Systems with more unequal mass ratios likely shrink to shorter periods and become classical post-common envelope binaries or merge. The model implies that $\sim 1\%$ of solar-type stars have WD companions with periods of $100 - 1000\,$d, consistent with complementary constraints from self-lensing binaries.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the structural and dynamical properties of Open Clusters (OCs) classified as single, in pairs, or in groups. By analysing their mass, size, age, fractality, and mass segregation, we aim to identify systematic differences among these categories and evaluate the role of the Galactic environment in their evolution. Our sample comprises 420 single OCs, 415 in pairs, and 317 in groups. To characterise their structure, we apply the Q-parameter, which distinguishes fractal from radial distributions. We also compute the local density ratio to quantify mass segregation and explore its dependence on environment. Grouped OCs tend to be the youngest, followed by those in pairs, while single OCs generally exhibit older ages. Although sizes are comparable, OCs in pairs and groups tend to be less concentrated. Structurally, grouped OCs show the highest fractality, which decreases with age as clusters evolve towards more radial configurations. Mass segregation is detected in ~80% of OCs, with a slightly higher incidence in single clusters. Some older single OCs show inverse segregation, with massive stars at larger radii. Spatially, single OCs are more dispersed, whereas paired and grouped ones are concentrated in spiral arms and star-forming regions. OC evolution appears to be shaped by both internal dynamics and environmental influences. Single OCs tend to exhibit signs of more advanced dynamical evolution, whereas those in pairs and groups may retain features reflecting their formation environment. Substructures and high fractality in younger clusters suggest that early interactions play a key role in their long-term development. More massive OCs evolve towards radial configurations, while less massive ones may retain fractal properties for longer. These findings highlight the interplay between intrinsic properties and external conditions in shaping OC evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 The pairwise Kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) measures both the pairwise motion between massive groups and the amount of gas within them, providing a tracer for the cosmic growth. To interpret the cosmological information in kSZ, it is crucial to understand the optical cluster selection bias on the kSZ observables. Line-of-sight structures that contribute to both the optical observable (e.g. richness) and the kSZ signal can induce a correlation between these two quantities at fixed cluster mass. The selection bias arising from this correlation is a key systematic effect for cosmological analyses and has the potential to resolve the tension between the cosmological constraints from the DES-Y1 cluster counts, lensing, and Planck. In order to test for a kSZ equivalent of such a bias, we adopt an alternative mock richness based on galaxy counts within cylindrical volumes along the line-of-sight. We apply the cylindrical count method to hydrodynamical simulations across a wide range of galaxy selection criteria, assigning richness consistent with DES-Y1 to the mock clusters. We find no significant bias on pairwise kSZ, pairwise velocities, or optical depth, when comparing optically selected clusters to mass-selected halos, within our uncertainty limits of approximately 16, 10, and 8 per cent, respectively.

 - **Abstract**
 Measuring the distribution of spin tilts-the angles between the spin vectors and the binary orbital angular momentum-in stellar-mass binary black holes detected by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA would provide valuable insight into their astrophysical origins. Analyses of the 69 binary black holes detected through LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA's third observing run yielded model-dependent conclusions, particularly regarding whether the spin tilt distribution exhibits a peak near alignment, as expected for binaries formed in galactic fields. In this work, we simulate populations of up to 1500 binary black hole systems with parameters consistent with the default GWTC-3 analysis, while introducing a correlation that favors small spin tilts for binaries with mass ratios near unity. We find that: (a) spurious peaks away from perfect alignment are possible even with catalogs of up to 300 sources; (b) establishing a definitive peak at alignment remains difficult even with 1500 detections; (c) integrated measurements -- such as the fraction of events with tilt angles smaller than $10^\circ$ or greater than $90^\circ$ -- are more robust and should be preferred, achieving relative 90\% credible uncertainties of $\sim20\%-80\%$ with 1500 sources; and (d) even with the largest simulated catalogs, evidence for a mass ratio-tilt correlation remains inconclusive. Our results suggest that identifying the formation channels of merging black holes using spin tilts will remain challenging, but that model-independent measurements may yield more informative insights over model parameters themselves.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive study of formaldehyde (H2CO) absorption and radio recombination line (H110a) emission in 215 molecular clouds from the Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey (BGPS), observed using the Nanshan 25-m radio telescope. H2CO was detected in 88 sources (40.93 percent) with 59 being new detections, while H110a emission was found in only 11 sources (5.12 percent), all coincident with H2CO absorption. There exists a correlation of H2CO fluxes with millimeter fluxes below a 3 Jy threshold and an increased dispersion above it, suggesting the sub-CMB cooling of H2CO. Cross-matching with kinematic distance catalogs revealed H2CO spanning galactocentric distances from 0.216 to 10.769 kpc, with column densities ranging from 7.82 x 10^11 to 6.69 x 10^14 cm-2. A significant inverse correlation was observed between H2CO detection fraction and galactocentric distance, suggesting enhanced star forming activity closer to the Galactic Center. These findings challenge traditional Galactic Habitable Zone (GHZ) models by demonstrating the presence of biogenic precursors in the inner Galaxy, shielded within dense molecular clouds. Our results underscore the importance of incorporating chemical tracers like H2CO, alongside physical constraints, to refine the boundaries of the GHZ and advance the research of prebiotic chemistry in the Milky Way.

 - **Abstract**
 Linear polarimetry of unresolved stars is a powerful method for discerning or constraining the geometry of a source and its environment, since spherical sources produce no net polarization. However, a general challenge to interpreting intrinsic stellar polarization is the contribution to the signal by interstellar polarization (ISP). Here, we review methodologies for distinguishing the stellar signal from the interstellar contribution in the context of massive stars. We first characterize ISP with distance using a recent compilation of starlight polarization catalogs. Several scenarios involving Thomson scattering, rapidly rotating stars, optically thick winds, and interacting binaries are considered specifically to contrast the wavelength-dependent effects of ISP in the ultraviolet versus optical bands. ISP is recognizable in the stellar polarization from Thomson scattering in the polarization position angle rotations. For hot stars with near-critical rotation rates, the ISP declines whereas the stellar continuum polarization sharply increases. In the case of quite dense winds, strong ultraviolet lines trace the ISP, which is not always the case in the optical. In the binary case, temporal and chromatic effects illustrate how the ISP displaces variable polarization with wavelength. This study clarifies the impacts of ISP in relation to new ultraviolet spectropolarimetry efforts such as Polstar and Pollux.

 - **Abstract**
 LiteBIRD is a JAXA-led international project aimed at measuring the cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization with high sensitivity to detect polarization $B$ modes. This detection would provide evidence of inflation. LiteBIRD will observe the full sky for three years at the L2 Lagrange point of the Earth-Sun system across 34-448 GHz, and is expected to launch in the Japanese fiscal year of 2032. The Low-Frequency Telescope (LFT) will observe in the 34-161 GHz range implementing a modified crossed Dragone (MCD) reflective optical design optimized for high optical performance across a wide $18^{\circ} \times 9^{\circ}$ field-of-view (FOV). In this paper, we report the LFT optical design details including its optimization and optical performance assessed using optical simulations. The MCD design consists of a paraboloidal primary and a hyperboloidal secondary reflector with polynomial correction terms up to 7th order, achieving Strehl ratios $\ge 0.97$ at 161 GHz across the FOV. The Mueller QU (UQ) cross-polarization response is $\le -26.9$ dB at 34 GHz. The simulated beam sizes are $< 78^{\prime}$ at 34 GHz. The simulated sidelobe response for the direct and diffuse triple reflection sidelobes are estimated to be $< -57$ dB, and for the focused triple reflection sidelobe $< -37$ dB at 34 GHz. The LFT optical design satisfies all the optical requirements and specifications for the project, and is compatible with the LiteBIRD science goals.

 - **Abstract**
 Petabytes of archival high time resolution observations have been captured with the Murchison Widefield Array. The search for Fast Radio Bursts within these using established software has been limited by its inability to scale on supercomputing infrastructure, necessary to meet the associated computational and memory requirements. Hence, past searches used a coarse integration time, in the scale of seconds, or analysed an insufficient number of hours of observations. This paper introduces BLINK, a novel radio interferometry imaging software for low-frequency FRB searches to be run on modern supercomputers. It is implemented as a suite of software libraries executing all computations on GPU, supporting both AMD and NVIDIA hardware vendors. These libraries are designed to interface with each other and to define the BLINK imaging pipeline as a single executable program. Expensive I/O operations between imaging stages are not necessary because the stages now share the same memory space and data representation. BLINK is the first imaging pipeline implementation able to fully run on GPUs as a single process, further supporting AMD hardware and enabling Australian researchers to take advantage of Pawsey's Setonix supercomputer. In the millisecond-scale time resolution imaging test case illustrated in this paper, representative of what is required for FRB searches, the BLINK imaging pipeline achieves a 3687x speedup compared to a traditional MWA imaging pipeline employing WSClean.

 - **Abstract**
 The Cold Dark Matter (CDM) model successfully explains large-scale structure formation, but challenges remain at smaller scales, leading to interest in Warm Dark Matter (WDM) as an alternative. The abundance of Milky Way subhalos depends on the mass of WDM particles, allowing constraints to be obtained by comparing observations and theoretical models. However, high-resolution simulations of heavier WDM particle masses are computationally demanding, making semi-analytical approaches valuable. In this study, we evaluate the ability of the Semi-Analytical Sub-Halo Inference Modeling for WDM (SASHIMI-W) to reproduce subhalo mass functions for heavier WDM particle masses. We perform high-resolution cosmological N-body simulations for CDM and WDM with particle masses of 1 keV, 3 keV, and 10 keV, and compare the ratio of the subhalo mass function between WDM and CDM cases. Our results show that SASHIMI-W successfully reproduces the simulation results over redshifts z = 0 to z = 2. Furthermore, both simulations and the semi-analytical model show a slight redshift dependence in the subhalo suppression ratio. However, a direct comparison of the differential subhalo mass functions shows discrepancies in the mid- and low-mass regions, suggesting that the tidal stripping effects implemented in SASHIMI-W may be too strong for WDM subhalos, or that the removal of spurious subhalos in the simulations is insufficient. These results validate the use of SASHIMI-W in constraining WDM properties, and highlight the need for refinements in both tidal effect modeling and spurious subhalo filtering to improve subhalo abundance predictions.

 - **Abstract**
 Millimetre-compact dust disks are thought to have efficient radial drift of icy dust pebbles, which has been hypothesised to produce an enhanced cold ($T<$400 K) H$_2$O reservoir in their inner disks. Mid-infrared spectral surveys, now with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), pave the way to explore this hypothesis. In this work, we test this theory for 8 compact disks ($R_\mathrm{dust}<$60 au) with JWST-MIRI/MRS observations. We analyse the different reservoirs that can be probed with the pure rotational lines ($>$10 $\mathrm{\mu}$m) through parametric column density profiles, multiple component slab models, and line flux ratios. We find that not all compact disks show strong enhancements of the cold H$_2$O reservoir, instead we propose three different classes of inner disk H$_2$O distributions. Four of our disks appear to have similar H$_2$O distributions as many of the large and structured disks (Type N or ``Normal'' disks), as is indicated by the slab model fitting and the line flux ratios. These disks have a small cold reservoir, suggesting the inward drift of dust, but it is not as efficient as hypothesised before. Only two disks do show a strong enhancement of the cold H$_2$O emission (Type E or cold H$_2$O enhanced disks), agreeing with the original hypothesis. The two remaining disks are found to be very H$_2$O-poor (Type P or H$_2$O-poor disks), yet show emission from either the hot or immediate reservoirs (depending on the fit) in addition to emission from the cold one. We find that different parametrisations are able to provide a good description of the observed H$_2$O spectra, with the multiple component analysis yielding similar results. Finally, we also report the detection of other molecules in these disks, including a tentative detection of CH$_4$ in CY Tau.

 - **Abstract**
 Chandrasekhars $H(\mu)$-function has long been a cornerstone of radiative transfer theory in semi-infinite, isotropically scattering atmospheres subjected to external illumination. However, this classical formulation does not account for thermal emission arising from internal heat sources, which is critical in a variety of astrophysical contexts such as hot Jupiters, brown dwarfs, and irradiated exoplanets, where the re-radiation of absorbed stellar energy significantly alters the emergent intensity. To address this limitation, we extend the diffuse reflection framework to incorporate both isotropic scattering and intrinsic thermal emission, leading to a generalized function known as the $M(\mu)$-function. Building on the formalism of Chandrashekhar (1960) combined with the recent work by Sengupta(2021), we derive the governing integral equations for the $M$-function and express it in terms of three key physical parameters: the radiation direction cosine $\mu$, the thermal emission coefficient $U(T) = B(T)/F$, and the single scattering albedo $\tilde{\omega}_0$. We implement a numerically stable iterative scheme, using Gaussian quadrature method to compute high-precision values of $M(\mu, U, \tilde{\omega}_0)$ across a broad parameter space. In the zero-emission limit, our results recover the classical $H$-function, thus validating the this http URL provide comprehensive values of $M$-function for $\mu \in [0, 1]$, $U < 0.7$, and $\tilde{\omega}_0 < 1$, enabling direct application to modeling diffusely reflected intensities from thermally emitting this http URL a case study, we apply this formalism to exoplanet K2-137b and identify the wavelength range (0.85 -2.5 $\mu$m) where the model is most applicable, highlighting its relevance to the observation range of the telescopes JWST, HST, ARIEL.

 In this manuscript, considering evolution of fallback accreting debris in a central Tidal Disruption Event (TDE), the outer boundary increased with time of the disk-like broad emission line regions (BLRs) lying into central accretion disk will lead expected broad emission lines changed from double-peaked to single-peaked. Considering common elliptical orbitals for the accreting fallback TDEs debris, based on simulated results through the preferred standard elliptical accretion disk model, a probability about 3.95\% can be estimated for cases with double-peaked profile changed to single-peaked profile in multi-epoch broad emission lines, indicating such unique profile variability could be indicator for BLRs related to TDE debris. Meanwhile, among the reported optical TDE candidates with apparent broad lines, such profile changes in broad H$\alpha$ can be found in the AT 2018hyz. After accepted the outer boundaries of the disk-like BLRs increased with time, the observed multi-epoch broad H$\alpha$ can be described in AT 2018hyz. Moreover, the elliptical accretion disk model determined time dependent ratios of the outer boundaries of the disk-like BLRs are well consistent with the TDE model expected ratios of the outer boundaries of the fallback TDE debris. Furthermore, the evolution properties of disk-like BLRs can be applied to estimate the locations of the disk-like BLRs of which outer boundary could be about one sixth of the outer boundary of the fallback TDE debris in AT 2018hyz. Such unique profile changes from double-peaked to single-peaked could be applied as further clues to support a central TDE.

 - **Abstract**
 Flares are short-lived but energetic manifestations of stellar activity. Studying them is crucial, as they emit intense high-energy radiation that can impact the circumstellar environment, especially the atmospheres of orbiting planets. This is particularly relevant for M dwarfs, which frequently flare and often host planets within their habitable zones. Flare-driven photoevaporation and photochemical processes may significantly affect planetary evolution. In this work, we analyzed the flaring properties of a volume-limited, unbiased sample of nearby M dwarfs using data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). We selected stars within 10 pc from Gaia DR3 and used an iterative Gaussian process to remove long-term stellar variability from the light curves, isolating impulsive flare events. For each flare, we measured amplitude, duration, and total emitted energy. Our sample includes 173 stars and 17,229 detected flares, ranging from 0 to 76 flares per TESS sector. We focused on three representative stars to highlight the diversity in flare activity. Detected flares had energies above 10^29 erg and durations from 2 to 8000 seconds. We modeled cumulative energy distributions with one- and two-slope power-law fits, finding average slopes of -0.79 +/- 0.64 and -1.23 +/- 1.32, respectively. We introduced the Flare Energy Index (GF.01) to describe flare frequency, identifying two populations: fainter stars tend to produce fewer high-energy flares, while brighter stars exhibit more frequent low-energy flares. Finally, we investigated two highly active stars, G 227-22 and G 258-33, observed across many sectors, to study long-term flare behavior and energy trends.

 - **Abstract**
 Most stars end their main-sequence (MS) lives by evolving through the red-giant and asymptotic-giant branches before ending as a quiescent, stable white dwarf. Therefore, it is imperative to model the post-MS as it relates to long-term stability of environments potentially suitable for life. Recent work has shown that gas giants can exist in the habitable zone (HZ) during the red giant phase and around a white dwarf remnant. Icy moons represent large reservoirs of water and will evolve through sublimation and melting when exposed to higher instellation, where the relatively lower surface gravity could lead to the rapid loss of all surface water. We model the surface evolution of Europa when initially exposed to habitable zone instellation in the red giant branch. Modeling the diurnal and yearly flux variations on a 2D map we show that, due to Jupiter's increased albedo, the sub-Jovian hemisphere of Europa largely sublimates while only the anti-Jovian equatorial band sublimates. With the increasing instellation of the red giant branch, both hemispheres sublimate substantially. We then model the evolution of a tenuous water-vapor atmosphere and show it is stable against atmospheric loss for at least 0.2 Gyr in the red giant branch habitable zone. We then present three ways to observe a sublimating Europan-like exomoon and potential spectra. Extending the results of this work to different planets and moons could open up a new pathway by which life could persist beyond the death of a star.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar streams are essential tracers of the gravitational potential of the Milky Way, with key implications to the problem of dark matter (DM) model distributions, either within or beyond phenomenological $\Lambda$CDM halos. For the first time in the literature, a DM halo model based on first physical principles such as quantum statistical mechanics and thermodynamics is used to try to reproduce the 6D observations of the Sagittarius (Sgr) stream. We model both DM haloes, the one of Sgr dwarf and the one of its host with a spherical self-gravitating system of neutral fermions which accounts for the effects of particles escape and fermion degeneracy, the latter causing a high-density core at the center of the halo. Full baryonic components for each galaxy are also considered. We use a spray algorithm with $\sim 10^{5}$ particles to generate the Sgr tidal debris, which evolves in the gravitational potential of the host-progenitor system, to compare with the full phase-space data of the stream. We repeat this kind of simulations for different parameter setups of the fermionic model including the particle mass, with special attention to test different DM halo morphologies allowed by the physics. We find that across the different families of fermionic halo models, they can only reproduce the trailing arm of the Sgr stream. Within the observationally allowed span of enclosed masses where the stream moves, neither the power-law like, nor the polytropic behaviour of the fermionic halo models can answer for the observed trend of the leading tail. A conclusion which is shared by former analysis using other type of spherically symmetric haloes. We conclude that further model sophistications such as abandoning spherical symmetry and including the Large Magellanic Cloud perturber are needed for a proper modelisation of the overall Milky Way potential within this kind of first principle halo models.

 - **Abstract**
 In a systematic search for eclipsing white dwarfs using Zwicky transient facility (ZTF) data, we found seven eclipsing double white dwarfs with orbital periods ranging from 45 minutes to 3 hours. We collected high-speed light curves, archival multi-wavelength data, and optical spectra for all systems and determined the binary parameters for each of them. We show that six of the systems are low-mass, double helium-core white dwarf binaries, with the last one a carbon-oxygen -- helium core white dwarf binary. These binaries slowly spiral inwards due to gravitational wave energy losses and are expected to merge within 36Myr--1.2Gyr, and we predict that the shortest orbital period binary will show a measurable eclipse arrival time delay within a decade. The two longest systems show a delay in the arrival time of the secondary eclipse, which we attribute to a small eccentricity of $\approx 2\times10^{-3}$. This is the first time that a non-zero eccentricity is measured in a compact double white dwarf binary. We suggest that these systems emerged from the common envelope with this small eccentricity, and because of the relatively long orbital period, gravitational wave emission has not yet circularised the binaries. Finally, we predict that relativistic apsidal precession will result in a change in the delay of the secondary eclipse that is measurable within a decade.

          Probing Scalar-Photon Coupling in the Early Universe: Implications for CMB Temperature and Anisotropies

 - **Abstract**
 The Hubble tension, as a persistent discrepancy between early-time and late-time measurements of the Hubble constant, motivates explorations of new physics in the early Universe. In a recent early dark energy (EDE) model, we introduced a scalar field interacting with the radiation sector at early-time before recombination. We showed that such a scalar-photon coupling can lead to an accelerated expansion phase in which the energy density of scalar component dilutes faster than radiation does, a crucial feature for a successful EDE model. In the present work, we extend our analysis to investigate how this scalar-photon coupling affects the CMB temperature-redshift law and CMB anisotropies. We demonstrate that the temperature-redshift law deviates from the standard relation $T(z)\propto (1+z)$ due to the scalar-photon coupling. This deviation is controlled by a model parameter $\epsilon$, which quantifies the rate of energy transfer between the scalar field and radiation. We also argue that a positive value of $\epsilon$ shifts the acoustic peaks to larger scales, which potentially alleviates the Hubble tension. These findings suggest that scalar-photon coupling is a testable mechanism for reconciling different cosmological observations.

 - **Abstract**
 We conducted a spectroscopic study of 39 blue straggler stars in the globular cluster NGC 3201. The spectra of these stars were collected from the literature. We determined the radial velocity, atmospheric parameters (Teff, log g), and the abundance of Mg, as well as the metallicity ([Fe/H]) of the blue straggler population. The mean radial velocity and [Fe/H] are determined to be 498.0 $\pm$ 5.3 km/s and -1.42 $\pm$ 0.27, respectively, for the blue straggler stars. The derived [Fe/H] is consistent, within uncertainties, with the cluster's [Fe/H] of -1.59 dex. The mean [Mg/Fe] for the blue straggler stars is estimated to be 0.36 $\pm$ 0.73. Importantly, this study first estimates [Mg/Fe] for the blue straggler stars in the cluster NGC 3201.

 - **Abstract**
 The Fermi Gamma ray Space Telescope, launched in 2008, has over 16 years of operations providing gamma ray (8 keV to 300 Gev) spectra science observations of cosmic phenomena. It continues to provide invaluable research for the astrophysics community which include the study of pulsars, cosmic rays, gamma ray bursts, and coordination with gravity wave observations for neutron star mergers. The Fermi Earth orbit at a 500 x 512 km altitude is subject to collision warnings due to new constellations deployed near Fermi: currently over 7,000 satellites and growing. This paper presents analysis concerning changing Fermi's orbit and associated operational flight dynamics considerations. The cadence of burns and expected fuel use for a proposed orbit raise scenario is examined, ensuring that Fermi should have sufficient fuel for end of life operations. In addition, a Monte Carlo design is presented to capture single maneuver model uncertainty.

          Current constraints on the minimally extended varying speed of light model through the cosmic distance duality relation

 - **Abstract**
 One of the most crucial tests of the standard cosmological model consists on testing possible variations on fundamental physical constants. In frameworks such as the minimally extended varying speed of light model (meVSL), the relationship between the luminosity distance ($D_{\text{L}}$) and the angular diameter distance ($D_{\text{A}}$), namely the cosmic distance duality relation (CDDR), is expected to deviate from $\eta(z) \equiv D_{\text{L}}(z)/D_{\text{A}}(z) = (1+z)^{2}$, making it a powerful probe of a potential variation of such a fundamental constant. Hence, we test the viability of the meVSL model through the CDDR by comparing $D_{\text{A}}$ measurements, provided by the transverse (2D) and anisotropic (3D) baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) observations from different surveys, like SDSS, DES and DESI, in combination with $D_{\text{L}}$ measurements from Pantheon+ type Ia Supernova (SNe) compilation. The Gaussian Process reconstruction is employed on the SN data to match $D_{\text{A}}$ with $D_{\text{L}}$ at the same redshift. We find no deviation of the standard CDDR relation within 1-2$\sigma$ confidence level when considering SNe with 2D and 3D BAO samples combined together, as well as when considering SNe with 3D BAO only. However, when SNe and 2D BAO only are considered, the standard CDDR is only recovered at $\sim 4\sigma$ confidence level. However, such a result might be due to some recently discussed tensions between SN and BAO datasets, especially at low redshifts, in addition to possible inconsistencies between the BAO datasets individually. Therefore, our results show no significant evidence in favour of the meVSL model, once these potential systematics are taken into account.

 - **Abstract**
 We show that the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) lensing trispectrum is sensitive to parity violation in Large-Scale Structure (LSS). We obtain a compact expression for the reduced lensing trispectrum that is general for any input matter trispectrum. We then present as an example a simple parity-violating toy model for the latter, and explicitly compute the parity-odd lensing trispectrum, including an estimate of the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). This work serves as a proof of principle, demonstrating how future studies of more physically motivated models can be conducted. It also provides an intuitive physical explanation of why CMB lensing is sensitive to parity. Our work is the first to point out that secondary CMB anisotropies can be used to probe parity in LSS, and will be important in enabling upcoming experiments such as Simons Observatory and CMB-S4 to contribute maximal power on parity violation.

          Discovery of a dwarf planet candidate in an extremely wide orbit: 2017 OF201

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of a dwarf planet candidate, 2017 OF201, currently located at a distance of 90.5 au. Its orbit is extremely wide and extends to the inner Oort cloud, with a semi-major axis of 838 au and a perihelion of 44.9 au precisely determined from 19 observations over seven years. Assuming a typical albedo of 0.15, we estimate a diameter about 700 km, making it the second-largest known object in this dynamical population and a likely dwarf planet. Its high eccentricity suggests that it is part of a broader, unseen population of similar objects totaling about 1 % of Earth's mass. Notably, the orbit of 2017 OF201 lies well outside the clustering of longitude of perihelion observed in extreme trans-Neptunian objects, which has been proposed as dynamical evidence for a distant, undetected planet.

 - **Abstract**
 Machine Learning (ML) serves as a general-purpose, highly adaptable, and versatile framework for investigating complex systems across domains. However, the resulting computational resource demands, in terms of the number of parameters and the volume of data required to train ML models, can be high, often prohibitive. This is the case in astrophysics, where multimedia space data streams usually have to be analyzed. In this context, quantum computing emerges as a compelling and promising alternative, offering the potential to address these challenges in a feasible way. Specifically, a four-step quantum machine learning (QML) workflow is proposed encompassing data encoding, quantum circuit design, model training and evaluation. Then, focusing on the data encoding step, different techniques and models are investigated within a case study centered on the Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRB) signal detection in the astrophysics domain. The results thus obtained demonstrate the effectiveness of QML in astrophysics, highlighting the critical role of data encoding, which significantly affects the QML model performance.

          The phase spiral's origin and evolution: indications from its varying properties across the Milky Way disk

 - **Abstract**
 The phase spiral is a perturbation to the vertical phase-space distribution of stars in the Milky Way disk. We study the phase spiral's properties and how they vary with spatial position, in order to constrain its origin and evolution, as well as properties of the disk itself. We produce high resolution maps using two complementary data processing schemes: (a) we bin the Gaia proper motion sample in a disk parallel spatial grid, reaching distances up to 4 kpc; (b) we bin the spatially nearby line-of-sight velocity sample in terms of disk parallel orbital parameters. We find complex structure, most significantly with respect to Galactocentric radius and guiding radius, but also in Galactic azimuth and epicyclic action and phase. We find that spiral winding and rotation phase vary smoothly across the disk, with close-to-flat radial profiles. This uniform structure, in particular for the rotation phase, indicates that the phase spiral was sourced by one or many global perturbations. Curiously, this also implies that the winding time has a strong slope with respect to Galactocentric radius, with low values for the inner disk.

          First Temperature Profile of a Stellar Flare using Differential Chromatic Refraction

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first derivation of a stellar flare temperature profile from single-band photometry. Stellar flare DWF030225.574-545707.45129 was detected in 2015 by the Dark Energy Camera as part of the Deeper, Wider, Faster Programme. The brightness ($\Delta m_g = -6.12$) of this flare, combined with the high air mass ($1.45 \lesssim X \lesssim 1.75$) and blue filter (DES $g$, 398-548 nm) in which it was observed, provided ideal conditions to measure the zenith-ward apparent motion of the source due to differential chromatic refraction (DCR) and, from that, infer the effective temperature of the event. We model the flare's spectral energy distribution as a blackbody to produce the constraints on flare temperature and geometric properties derived from single-band photometry. We additionally demonstrate how simplistic assumptions on the flaring spectrum, as well as on the evolution of flare geometry, can result in solutions that overestimate effective temperature. Exploiting DCR enables studying chromatic phenomena with ground-based astrophysical surveys and stellar flares on M-dwarfs are a particularly enticing target for such studies due to their ubiquity across the sky, and the heightened color contrast between their red quiescent photospheres and the blue flare emission. Our novel method will enable similar temperature constraints for large sample of objects in upcoming photometric surveys like the Vera C. Rubin Legacy Survey of Space and Time.

 - **Abstract**
 Dipper stars are extrinsically variable stars with deep dimming events due to extended, often dusty, structures produced by a wide range of mechanisms such as collisions, protoplanetary evolution or stellar winds. ASAS-SN has discovered 12 dipper-like objects as part of its normal operations. Here we systematically search the $\sim 5.1$ million ASAS-SN targets with $13<g<14$~mag for dippers with $\Delta g\ge0.3$~mag to identify 4 new candidates. We also discover 15 long-period eclipsing binary candidates. We characterized the 19 new and 12 previously discovered objects using the ASAS-SN light curves and archival multi-wavelength data. We divide them into three categories: long-period eclipsing binaries with a single eclipse (13 total), long-period eclipsing binaries with multiple eclipses (7 total) and dipper stars with dust or disk occultations (11 total).

          Luminous Late-time Radio Emission from Supernovae Interacting with Circumbinary Material

 - **Abstract**
 Numerous core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) exhibit signatures of interaction with circumstellar material (CSM). Bright radio emission years after the SN is one such indication of dense CSM at large distances from the star, which may be generated via binary interactions. In this work, we use forward modeling to study the radio emission produced by interaction between the SN ejecta and CSM formed by non-conservative stable mass transfer from stripped-envelope stars in short-period binaries. The donors are among the likely progenitors of hydrogen-poor CCSNe that significantly expand $10^3$-$10^4$ years before core-collapse. We identify that non-conservative stable mass transfer from lower-mass stripped stars can create a detached shell-like CSM, whereas for our higher-mass stars the CSM is wind-like. In our models, mass transfer rates of $\sim 10^{-4} M_\odot$ $\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ lead to dense CSM extending to $\sim 10^{18}$ $\mathrm{cm}$. The predicted radio emission is luminous at late times, reaching $L_{\nu}\sim10^{26}$-$10^{29}$ $\mathrm{erg}$ $\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ $\mathrm{Hz}^{-1}$ at years to decades after core-collapse, which is as bright as late-time radio emission observed for a sample of hydrogen-poor SNe. However, the light curves of events with early-time data show more complex behavior in the weeks to months after core-collapse. We qualitatively demonstrate that similar early-time emission can manifest for CSM that is accelerated to speeds of $\sim10^3$ $\mathrm{km}$ $\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ upon ejection, as well as for different viewing angles in case of an asymmetric CSM distribution.

          Bound dark energy: Particle origin of dark energy with DESI BAO and DES supernova data

 - **Abstract**
 The recent findings from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) indicate a preference for dynamical dark energy at a significance level above $2.5 \sigma$, with baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) combined with cosmic microwave background (CMB) data and Type Ia supernovae (SNe) data, favoring a time dependent equation of state $w(z)$ rather than the cosmological constant ($w = -1$). We introduce the Bound Dark Energy (BDE) model, in which dark energy arises from the lightest meson field $\phi$ in a dark SU(3) gauge group, developing dynamically through non perturbative interactions. Governed by an inverse power law potential $V(\phi) = \Lambda_c^{4+2/3}\phi^{-2/3}$, BDE features no dark energy free parameters: one less than $\Lambda$CDM ($\Lambda$) and three less than the $ w_{0}w_{a} $CDM ($ w_{0}, w_{a},\Lambda $) models. By integrating DESI BAO measurements, CMB data and Dark Energy Survey SN Ia distance data collected during the fifth year, BDE demonstrates a reduction of $42$ and $37$ percent in the reduced $\chi^{2}_{BAO}$ as well as lower AIC and BIC values compared to the $w_{0}w_{a}$CDM and $\Lambda$CDM models, respectively, while maintaining a comparable fit for both type Ia supernovae and the cosmic microwave background data. Although the ($w_{0},w_{a}$) contour in BDE is 10,000 times smaller than that found in the $w_{0}w_{a}$CDM model, the BDE model suggests a dynamical dark energy scenario with precise values of $w_{0}=$-0.9301 $\pm$ 0.0004 and $w_{a}=$ -0.8085 $\pm$ 0.0053 while providing a consistency on the six Planck and derived parameters at the 1$\sigma$ level between BDE, $\Lambda$CDM and $w_{0}w_{a}$CDM models. The critical parameters condensation energy scale $\Lambda_{c} = 43.806 \pm 0.190$ eV and epoch $a_{c} = (2.497 \pm 0.011) \times 10^{-6}$ are consistent with predictions from high energy physics.

 - **Abstract**
 Librating around the Lagrange L5, the Jupiter's Trojan (2207) Antenor has been observed in recent years and its rotational light curve suggests it to be a very likely binary asteroid candidate. From stellar occultations, we report results from three events from Europe and North America to estimate the 2D apparent size and shape of Jupiter's Trojan (2207) Antenor. For the best-fitted ellipse in the sky-plane, we determined that Antenor has a 2D apparent equatorial radius of 54.30 +/- 0.99 km at the moment of the occultations, with an apparent oblateness of 0.144 +/- 0.051. We highlight the positive detection from 2021 June 12, which shows an intriguing feature that can be interpreted as a very large topographical feature (of about 11 km) of the body or that can provide further evidence that this object is, in fact, a close or contact binary. We also determine astrometric positions, with uncertainties of a few milliarcseconds (mas) for our preferred solutions.

          Revealing Flare Energetics and Dynamics with SDO EVE Solar Extreme Ultraviolet Spectral Irradiance Observations

 - **Abstract**
 NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) Extreme-ultraviolet Variability Experiment (EVE) has been making solar full-disk extreme ultraviolet (EUV) spectral measurements since 2010 over the spectral range of 6nm to 106nm with 0.1nm spectral resolution and with 10-60sec cadence. A primary motivation for EVE's solar EUV irradiance observations is to provide the important energy input for various studies of Earth's upper atmosphere. For example, the solar EUV creates the ionosphere, heats the thermosphere, and drives photochemistry in Earth's upper atmosphere. In addition, EVE's observations have been a treasure trove for solar EUV flare spectra. While EVE measures the full-disk spectra, the flare spectrum is easily determined as the EVE spectrum minus the pre-flare spectrum, as long as only one flare event is happening at a time. These EVE flare observations provide EUV variability that have been used to study flare phases (including the discovery of the EUV Late Phase flare class), flare energetics (plasma temperature variations), corona heating (plasma abundance changes that support nano-flare heating mechanism), flare dynamics (downwelling and upwelling plasma flows during flares from Doppler shifts), and coronal mass ejections (CME) energetics (CME mass and velocity derived from coronal dimming in some EUV lines). We also introduce a new EVE data product called the EVE Level 4 Lines data product, which provides line profile-fit results for intensity, wavelength shift, and line width for 70 emission features. These emission features are from the chromosphere, transition region, and corona, and so Doppler measurements of those lines can reveal important plasma dynamical behavior during a flare's impulsive phase and gradual phase. With over 10,000 flares detected in the EVE observations, there is still much to study and to learn about solar flare physics using EVE solar EUV spectra.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an overview of the MINERVA survey, a 259.8 hour (prime) and 127 hour (parallel) Cycle 4 treasury program on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). MINERVA is obtaining 8 filter NIRCam medium band imaging (F140M, F162M, F182M, F210M, F250M, F300M, F360M, F460M) and 2 filter MIRI imaging (F1280W, F1500W) in four of the five CANDELS Extragalactic fields: UDS, COSMOS, AEGIS and GOODS-N. These fields were previously observed in Cycle 1 with 7 - 9 NIRCam filters by the PRIMER, CEERS and JADES programs. MINERVA reaches a 5$\sigma$ depth of 28.1 mag in F300M and covers $\sim$ 542 arcmin$^2$, increasing the area of existing JWST medium-band coverage in at least 8 bands by $\sim$ 7$\times$. The MIRI imaging reaches a 5$\sigma$ depth of 23.9 mag in F1280W and covers $\sim$ 275 arcmin$^2$ in at least 2 MIRI filters. When combined with existing imaging, these data will provide a photometric catalog with 20-26 JWST filters (depending on field) and 26-35 filters total, including HST. This paper presents a detailed breakdown of the filter coverage, exposure times, and field layout relative to previous observations, as well as an overview of the primary science goals of the project. These include uncovering the physics of enigmatic sources hiding in current broadband catalogs, improving systematics on stellar mass functions and number densities by factors of $\gtrsim$ 3, and resolved mapping of stellar mass and star formation at 1 $< z <$ 6. When complete, MINERVA will become an integral part of the treasury deep field imaging datasets, significantly improving population studies with well-understood completeness, robust photometric redshifts, stellar masses, and sizes, and facilitating spectroscopic follow up for decades to come.

          Eccentric von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai effects under mildly hierarchical triple systems: Influence of Brown corrections upon orbit flipping

 - **Abstract**
 Mildly hierarchical three-body systems are widespread in the Universe, exemplified by planets in stellar binaries and stars in black-hole binaries. In such systems, Brown Hamiltonian corrections play a crucial role in governing the long-term dynamical evolution. In this work, we extend Brown corrections to include octupole-order coupling terms, thereby formulating a more accurate dynamical model for predicting long-term dynamical behaviors. The utilization of the gauge freedom in canonical transformation shows that the quadrupole-octupole coupling term vanishes and the octupole-octupole coupling term is axisymmetric. Under triple systems with different levels of hierarchies, we systematically investigate the impact of Brown corrections on orbital flipping induced by the eccentric von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai (ZLK) mechanism. Our analysis reveals that, as the hierarchy of triple systems becomes lower, the asymmetry in the flipping regions becomes more significant. The asymmetric structures are examined in detail using Poincare sections and perturbative techniques, showing that Brown corrections are the key factor responsible for breaking the symmetry of flipping regions. Finally, we extend the classical pendulum approximation to our refined model and demonstrate that its analytical predictions agree remarkably well with those derived from perturbative methods, particularly in the high-eccentricity regime.

          The First Day of a Type Ia Supernova from a Double-Degenerate Binary

 - **Abstract**
 Supernovae in binary star systems involve a hydrodynamical interaction between the ejecta and a binary companion. This collision results in shock heating and a modified density structure for the ejecta, both of which affect the light curve. As highlighted by Kasen, these considerations are particularly relevant for type Ia supernovae, as the companion is expected to be Roche-lobe filling at the time of the explosion. We simulate here the interaction between type Ia supernova ejecta and a white dwarf donor using Athena++, finding the formation of a low-density wake extending to higher velocities than the unperturbed ejecta. Radiation hydrodynamics is then used to generate synthetic light curves for the first day after the explosion for a range of viewing angles. We find that the hot, high-velocity, shocked ejecta yields $L>10^{40}$ ergs/s over half the sky in the first few hours. The photosphere within the shock-heated ejecta cools and recedes in velocity space, partially obscuring it from view, as heating from radioactive nickel becomes increasingly important in driving the supernova's luminosity. By one day after the explosion, the luminosity measured by observers looking directly into the wake is dimmer than that of a normal type Ia supernova by 15 percent due to the modified density structure.

 - **Abstract**
 We report on our finding of an excess of $54^{+16}_{-15}$ neutrinos at the location of the pulsar wind nebula (PWN) G63.7+1.1. By analyzing the IceCube track-like neutrino data for a group of 14 PWNe, which are selected as the targets because of their reportedly association with molecular clouds, G63.7+1.1 is found to be the only one detected with neutrino emission and the post-trail significance for the detection is 3.2$\sigma$. Previously, this PWN was estimated to have an age of $\gtrsim$8\,kyr, contain a candidate pulsar detected in X-rays, and have a distance of $\sim$6\,kpc. More importantly and related to the PWN's possible neutrino emission, surrounding molecular materials are seen to interact with the PWN. On the basis of these properties, we examine the proton-proton interactions as the process for the neutrino production. The PWN (or the pulsar) can collectively provide sufficient energy to power the required high-energy (HE) protons. This possibly first neutrino-emitting case in our Galaxy, with problems or other possibilities to be solved or examined, may reveal to us that PWNe are the significant Galactic HE neutrino sources.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the nebular phase spectroscopic and photometric observations of the nearby hydrogen-rich core-collapse supernova (CC-SN) 2023ixf, obtained through our JWST programs. These observations, combined with ground-based optical and near-infrared spectra, cover +252.67 - 719.96 d, creating a comprehensive, panchromatic time-series dataset spanning 0.32 - 30$\mu$m. In this second paper of the series, we focus on identifying key spectral emission features and tracking their evolution through the nebular phase. The JWST data reveal hydrogen emission from the Balmer to Humphreys series, as well as prominent forbidden lines from Ne, Ar, Fe, Co, and Ni. NIRSpec observations display strong emission from the first overtone and fundamental bands of carbon monoxide, which weaken with time as the ejecta cools and dust emission dominates. The spectral energy distribution shows a clear infrared excess emerging by +252.67 d peaking around 10.0$\mu$m, with a secondary bump at 18.0$\mu$m developing by +719.96 d. We suggest that this evolution could arises from multiple warm dust components. In upcoming papers in this series, we will present detailed modeling of the molecular and dust properties. Overall, this dataset significantly advances our understanding of the mid-infrared properties of CC-SNe, providing an unprecedented view of their late-time line, molecule, and dust emission.

 - **Abstract**
 The LAMOST-Kepler/K2 Medium-Resolution Spectroscopic Survey (LK-MRS) conducted time-domain medium-resolution spectroscopic observations of 20 LAMOST plates in the Kepler and K2 fields from 2018 to 2023, a phase designated as LK-MRS-I. A catalog of stellar parameters for a total of 36,588 stars, derived from the spectra collected during these five years, including the effective temperature, the surface gravity, the metallicity, the {\alpha}-element abundance, the radial velocity, and v sin i of the target stars, is released, together with the weighted averages and uncertainties. At S/N = 10, the measurement uncertainties are 120 K, 0.18 dex, 0.13 dex, 0.08 dex, 1.9 km/s, and 4.0 km/s for the above parameters, respectively. Comparisons with the parameters provided by the APOGEE and GALAH surveys validate the effective temperature and surface gravity measurements, showing minor discrepancies in metallicity and {\alpha}-element abundance values. We identified some peculiar star candidates, including 764 metal-poor stars, 174 very metal-poor stars, and 30 high-velocity stars. Moreover, we found 2,333 stars whose radial velocity seems to be variable. Using Kepler/K2 or TESS photometric data, we confirmed 371 periodic variable stars among the radial velocity variable candidates and classified their variability types. LK-MRS-I provides spectroscopic data being useful for studies of the Kepler and K2 fields. The LK-MRS project will continue collecting time-domain medium-resolution spectra for target stars during the third phase of LAMOST surveys, providing data to support further scientific research.

 - **Abstract**
 Delensing--the process of mitigating the lensing-induced B-mode contamination in cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations--will be a pivotal challenge for next-generation CMB experiments seeking to detect primordial gravitational waves (PGWs) through B-mode polarization. This process requires an accurate lensing tracer, which can be obtained either through internal reconstruction from high-resolution CMB observations or from external large-scale structure (LSS) surveys. Ground-based large-aperture telescopes (LATs) are crucial for internal reconstruction, yet existing and planned facilities are confined to the southern hemisphere, limiting effective delensing to that region. In this work, we assess the impact of introducing a northern hemisphere LAT, assumed to be situated near AliCPT (hence termed Ali-like LAT, or LATN), on delensing performance and PGW detection, using simulations. Our baseline setup includes a space-based small-aperture mission (LiteBIRD-like, SAT) and a southern LAT (SO-like, LATS). External LSS tracers, which have been shown to play an important role in delensing before the availability of ultra-sensitive polarization data, are also considered. We find that southern-hemisphere internal delensing reduces the uncertainty in r by approximately 21% compared to the no-delensing case. Adding LATN enables full-sky internal delensing, achieving a further ~19% reduction--comparable to that from including LSS tracers (~17%). Once LATN is included, the marginal benefit of LSS tracers drops to ~10%. These results highlight the significant role of LATN in advancing delensing capabilities and improving PGW constraints.

 We determine the surface lithium abundance of the eclipsing binary components in V 505 Per (HIP 10961), A(Li)=2.65+/-0.07 and 2.35+/-0.1, which supports the rather unexpected conclusion that their surface Li abundances differ. We find effective temperatures 6600 K + 6550 K (~150 K higher than previously reported), which place the stars at the hot limit of the Lithium Dip, thus aleviating the previously suggested discrepancy with cluster stars of similar ages and temperatures. These temperatures are also more consistent with the system's Gaia spectral energy distribution. Our iron abundances, [Fe/H]=-0.15+\-0.07 and -0.25+\-0.1, agree with predictions of the higher temperatures deduced from our spectra and from evolutionary tracks. The surface rotation rate implied by our line profiles, 12.5+\-1 km/s, is smaller than the synchronous rotation rate, a curious result given the circular orbit and the age of the system.

 - **Abstract**
 We have conducted VLBA 1.4 GHz (L-band) continuum observations towards twelve sources with HI 21-cm absorption detections at redshift $0.4<z<0.7$ in the pilot surveys of FLASH, an ongoing survey with the ASKAP radio telescope. 11 of the 12 targets are resolved in the VLBA observations. Using the parsec scale radio images, we have classified the source morphology and identified the radio core. Six of the twelve targets have core-jet morphology, four have two-sided jet morphology, one has a complex morphology, and one is unresolved. We describe a methodology to test whether the emission from the core or the total emission detected in the VLBA image has sufficient flux density to cause the entire HI 21-cm absorption, and we estimate limits on the gas covering factor and velocity-integrated optical depth (VOD). We find that for seven of the twelve sources, the core has sufficient flux density to cause all the HI 21-cm absorption detected in the ASKAP spectrum. For three other targets, with projected sizes in the range $\rm 305-409 \ pc$, a large fraction of the entire emission in the VLBA map could be occulted by the gas. For 0903+010 (NVSS J090331+010846), we estimate that at least $\approx 73\%$ of the peak absorption detected in the ASKAP spectrum could arise against the emission detected in the VLBA image. For the target 0023+010 (NVSS J002331+010114), we estimate an upper limit on the VOD of $\rm 169 \ km \ s^{-1}$, the highest in our sample. For 0903+010 (NVSS J090331+010846) we estimate a lower limit of $\rm 104 \ km \ s^{-1}$ on the VOD. We find that the distribution of HI 21-cm VODs at $0.4<z<1.0$ could increase by up to a factor of three after correction for the covering factors using our VLBA measurements.

 - **Abstract**
 State-of-the-art molecular databases and realistic global atmospheric models allow to predict accurate atmospheric transmittance spectra. The TAPAS online service provides atmospheric transmittance spectra of the most important species as well as Rayleigh extinction, adapted to any observing location, date, and direction. We describe recent updates, improvements, and additional tools. TAPAS is interpolating in location in the atmospheric profiles of temperature, pressure, H2O, O2 and O3 extracted from the ECMWF and produced by Arletty, a Data Terra/AERIS/ESPRI product, supplemented by auxiliary climatological models for additional species. The transmittance spectra are computed with the LBLRTM code. The resolution is chosen to ensure that the shapes of all absorption lines are reproduced for each species. Major improvements are: - the extension of the wavelength range in the near-UV down to 300 nm; in the near-IR up to 3500 nm; - the use of HITRAN2020; - the addition of NO2, to complement H2O, O2, O3, N2O, CO2 and CH4; - an increased accessibility; -the possibility to force the total H2O column to match the one measured at the observatory. We show O3 absorption in the near-UV and near-IR and NO2 absorption in the visible. We illustrate the quality of TAPAS by means of comparisons between models and ESO/VLT/CRIRES recorded spectra of a hot star with spectral resolution 130,000, in two intervals with strong H2O, NO2, CO2 and CH4 absorption. We describe the measurement of an instrumental Line Spread Function (LSF) based on TAPAS O2 lines and a method using the Singular Value Decomposition technique that can be made entirely automated. TAPAS can be used to improve the wavelength and to measure the LSF in regions where telluric features are present. The extended wavelength range will be particularly useful for future or recent spectrographs in the near-UV and in the near-infrared.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an analysis of flare ribbon fine structure observed during a GOES C2-class flare using high spatial and spectral resolution multi-line spectropolarimetric observations from the ViSP instrument at the DKIST. The ViSP recorded full Stokes spectra in three lines: Fe I 630.2 nm line pair, Na I D1, and Ca II 854.2 nm. To infer the stratification of temperature and line-of-sight (LOS) velocity across the ribbon, we performed non-LTE multi-line inversions of ViSP spectra. In the red wing of the Ca II 854.2 nm line, we identified multiple compact, roundish, and quasi-equally spaced bright structures, referred to as ribbon blobs, embedded within the flare ribbon. The sizes of these blobs range from 320 to 455 km, and they are spaced roughly ~1100 km apart. These features exhibit complex spectral profiles with pronounced asymmetries and double peaks near the line core of the Ca II 854.2 nm line. The blob regions were found to be significantly hotter (by ~1 kK) at log {\tau} = -4 compared to surrounding ribbon areas (~7 kK). The LOS velocity maps revealed both upflows and downflows at log {\tau} = -4$ and log {\tau} = -3, respectively. We discuss the plausible origins of these fine structures in the chromosphere, which may be related to electron beam heating, plasma draining, or tearing-mode instabilities in the reconnecting current sheet.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a catalog of 652 young stellar objects (YSOs) in the Carina star-forming region. The catalog was constructed by combining near-infrared Ks-band variability from the VISTA Variables in the Via Lactea eXtended survey and medium-resolution H-band spectroscopy from APOGEE-2, Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV (SDSS-IV). Variability analysis of 6.35 million sources identified 606 variable stars. The classification of the spectral lines by semisupervised K-means clustering of 704 stars, refined through comparison with known catalogs in literature and visual inspection of the spectra, was performed. Combined with Ks variability, the final catalog contains three groups: Emission-line YSOs, Absorption-line YSOs, and Literature/Variable-identified YSOs. Cross validation with the Gaia DR3 proper motion and distance estimates supports Carina membership for 415 sources. The statistical characterization of YSO variability demonstrated that most Carina members (78%) exhibit variability patterns. Of these, 134 stars show emissions in their spectra, which is consistent with some accretion processes. Analysis of fundamental stellar parameters from StarHorse and Gaia DR3 reveals typical distributions of YSOs, dominated by low-mass 1-4 Msun, solar-metallicity stars with temperatures between 4000 and 6000K. Only a small fraction (4%) of the sources are more massive than 4 Msun, suggesting limited ongoing massive star formation in Carina. This well-characterized catalog also offers a robust training dataset for machine learning applications aimed at predicting YSO behavior.

 Symbiotic stars are among the most crucial binary systems for studying binary star interactions and Type Ia supernova progenitors. Based on the unique observational characteristics of symbiotic stars, strong H I, He I emission lines, giant spectral features, and the presence of [O III], He II, O VI, and other emission lines with ionization potentials exceeding 35 eV, and the Gaia information, we search for new symbiotic stars using the low-resolution spectroscopic survey data from LAMOST. Thirty-six binary systems have been selected as symbiotic stars or candidates, in which the five known symbiotic stars are included. Among them five systems (ZTF J005917.52+315605.4, ATO J094137.5+075304, LAMOST J200310.90+360822.6, LAMOST J072528.18+342530.4, and V* V758 Cyg) have been found as new symbiotic stars. Notably, LAMOST J072528.18+342530.4 and V* V758 Cyg were also confirmed as new symbiotic stars in a recent study. For the remaining 26 candidates, classification is based solely on the presence of [O III] emission lines (with ionization potentials > 35 eV) and the absence of He II high-excitation emission lines. Further observations are needed to confirm their nature as symbiotic stars.

 - **Abstract**
 We compare halo mass estimates from three galaxy group catalogs (redMaPPer, Yang21, and Zou21) with those derived from gravitational lensing measurements. Each catalog employs distinct methodologies, including mass-richness relations, abundance matching, and luminosity-based calibration. A linear correlation is observed between catalog-estimated and lensing-derived masses. The redMaPPer catalog shows the best agreement, especially for lower-redshift groups, with minor deviations in higher-redshift bins. Yang21 is the only catalog containing low mass groups, which gives a reasonably good mass estimation, except for the lowest mass bin. Cross-matched groups between redMaPPer and Yang21 reveal the former catalog provides more accurate mass estimation, while the Yang21 makes under-estimation of halo mass for those sharing the central galaxy with redMaPPer and over-estimation of halo mass for those with different center determination with redMaPPer and for the unique Yang21 groups. These findings emphasize the importance of redshift-dependent calibration and refined group definitions for accurate mass estimation.

 - **Abstract**
 T Coronae Borealis (T CrB) is a symbiotic recurrent nova with eruptions in 1866 and 1946. Mounting evidence suggests an imminent outburst, offering a rare opportunity to observe a nearby nova in detail. We constrain the circumbinary medium (CBM) by modeling inter-eruption radio observations and simulate the hydrodynamic evolution of the upcoming outburst to predict its X-ray signatures, focusing on the roles of the red giant companion, accretion disk, and equatorial density enhancement (EDE). We model thermal radio emission from a CBM composed of a spherical wind and a torus-like EDE to estimate its density. We then perform 3D hydrodynamic simulations of the nova outburst, varying explosion energy, ejecta mass, and CBM configuration. From these, we synthesize X-ray light curves and spectra as they would appear to XMM-Newton and XRISM. The CBM in T CrB is significantly less dense than in other symbiotic novae, with a mass-loss rate of $\dot{M} \approx 4 \times 10^{-9}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ for a 10 km s$^{-1}$ wind. Despite the low-density EDE, the blast is collimated along the poles by the accretion disk and EDE, producing a bipolar shock. The red giant partially shields the ejecta, forming a bow shock and hot wake. X-ray evolution proceeds through three phases: an early phase (first few hours) dominated by shocked disk material; an intermediate phase ($\sim 1$ week-1 month) driven by reverse-shocked ejecta; and a late phase dominated by shocked EDE. Soft X-rays trace shocked ejecta, hard X-rays arise from shocked ambient gas, and synthetic spectra show asymmetric, blueshifted lines due to absorption by expanding ejecta. The X-ray evolution resembles that of RS Oph and V745 Sco, with a peak luminosity of $L_\mathrm{X} \approx 10^{36}$ erg s$^{-1}$, but features a more prolonged soft X-ray phase, reflecting the lower CBM density and distinct ejecta-environment interaction.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results from the simulations of the atmospheres of hot-Jupiters HD189733b, HD209458b and WASP-39b, assuming the presence of three different types of haze. Using a 3D General Circulation Model, the Unified Model, we capture the advection, settling and radiative impact of Titan-like, water-world-like and soot-like haze, with a particle radius of 1.5 nm. We show that the radiative impact of haze leads to drastic changes in the thermal structure and circulation in the atmosphere. We then show that in all our simulations, 1) the superrotating jet largely determines the day-to-night haze distribution, 2) eddies drive the latitudinal haze distribution, and 3) the divergent and eddy component of the wind control the finer structure of the haze distribution. We further show that the stronger the absorption strength of the haze, the stronger the superrotating jet, lesser the difference of the day-to-night haze distribution, and larger the transit depth in the synthetic transmission spectrum. We also demonstrate that the presence of such small hazes could result in a stronger haze opacity over the morning terminator in all three planets. This could lead to an observable terminator asymmetry in WASP-39b, with the morning terminator presenting a larger transit depth than the evening terminator. This work suggests that, although it might not be a typical detection feature for hot-Jupiters, an observed increase in transit depth over the morning terminator across the UV and optical wavelength regime could serve as a strong indicator of the presence of haze.

 In September 1777 Ruđer Bošković observed and measured the sun-spot positions to determine the solar rotation elements. In 1785, among other methods, he described a trigonometric spherical solution for the determination of the position of the axis and rate of the solar rotation using three sunspot positions, but without equations. For the first time, we derive the equations that are applicable to modern computers for calculating the solar rotation elements, as they were described by Bošković. We recalculated Bošković's original example using his measurements of sunspot positions from 1777 and the equations developed here, confirming his results from 1785. Bošković's methodology of arithmetic means determines $i$, $\Omega$, and sidereal period $T'$ separately, while the planar trigonometric solution determines $i$ and $\Omega$ together. His spherical trigonometric solution calculates $i$, $\Omega$, and the sidereal period $T'$ in a single procedure. Keywords: Ruđer Bošković, Sunspots, Solar rotation, Spherical trigonometry

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations have identified a significant 4.9$\sigma$ tension between the cosmic dipole inferred from galaxy number counts and that derived from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), suggesting a potential deviation from the cosmological principle. This work investigates whether superhorizon isocurvature perturbations in cold dark matter (CDM) can account for this discrepancy. We demonstrate that, unlike adiabatic modes which cancel at leading order, superhorizon isocurvature modes can generate an intrinsic CMB dipole without significantly affecting galaxy number counts, thereby explaining the observed mismatch. We explore both single-mode and continuous-spectrum cases, focusing on two concrete models: a nearly scale-invariant power-law spectrum with a UV cutoff and axion-induced isocurvature perturbations. For the axion scenario, we show that if the radial mode evolves during inflation, the resulting perturbations can match the required amplitude while evading current CMB constraints. Our analysis constrains the self-coupling of associated potential for the axion to the range $10^{-9} < \lambda < 4 \times 10^{-9}$. These findings offer a viable solution to the dipole tension and may serve as indirect evidence for axion dark matter.

 - **Abstract**
 Direct imaging of cosmic-ray-induced particle showers during daylight is a long-standing challenge in astroparticle physics. A promising avenue for capturing images of these showers is through the radio emissions generated by their electrically charged particles. Their corresponding current vectors evolve over time as the particle shower propagates through the Earth's atmosphere leading to a characteristic time-dependent electric field in an antenna array. In this work, we harness modern Bayesian inference techniques within the Python toolkit for numerical information field theory NIFTy, coupled with the high-performance numerical computing capabilities of the Python library JAX. This innovative combination enables us to reconstruct the particle shower and its temporal development from data collected by a ground-based antenna array. Our approach opens an initial pathway for detailed imaging of cosmic-ray showers, potentially advancing our understanding of high-energy astrophysical processes.

 - **Abstract**
 A significant fraction of white dwarfs (WDs) host dust/debris disks formed from the tidal disruption of asteroids and planetsimals. Several studies indicate that the disks can attain significant vertical heights through collisional cascade. In this work I model the effects of geometrically thick disks on two primary observables: photometric transits by the disk when viewed at high inclinations and infrared dust emission. Specifically, I consider disks with a Gaussian vertical profile with scale heights comparable to or larger than the WD radius. I primarily focus on inclinations $\gtrsim$$87$ degrees ('edge-off'), which can produce significant transits with moderate disk thickness. Both the transit depth and color become strong functions of inclination, and I explore their dependence on the disk parameters. I show that such a setup can produce the recently discovered reddening in the transit of WD J1013$-$0427. Moving to infrared emission, I show that the contribution from the heated inner rim can be substantial even at high inclinations. It can potentially explain the infrared excess observed in two transiting debris systems, WD 1145$+$017 and WD 1232$+$563, consistently with the transits. The other two important radiation components are the optically thin dust emission from the disk's outer layers and the optically thick emission from the backwarmed disk interior. Extending my analysis to G29-38 shows that the former can adequately produce the silicate emission feature. The inner dense layers, on the other hand, allows the disk to contain a large dust mass. Overall, I show that thick disk effects can be significant and should be taken into account. I motivate detailed studies to quantify the effects accurately.

 - **Abstract**
 This study continues our in-depth investigation of total-eclipse W Ursae Majoris-type contact binaries by analyzing eight new systems, complementing our previous work. Multiband $BVR_cI_c$ photometric data were acquired through ground-based observations at an observatory in Mexico, from which new times of minima were determined. Our analysis of orbital period variations using the O-C method revealed that one system shows no long-term variation, four systems exhibit a secular decrease in their orbital periods, and two systems exhibit a secular increase, suggesting mass transfer between the components. Notably, one system displays a cyclic variation with an amplitude of 0.00865 days and a period of 10.49 years, which we attribute to the light travel time effect induced by a tertiary companion, possibly a brown dwarf. We modeled the light curves using the PHOEBE Python code. Six of the target systems required the inclusion of a cold starspot on one of the system's stars due to the asymmetry observed in the maxima of their light curves. Absolute parameters were estimated using the Gaia DR3 parallax method. Using the components' effective temperatures and masses, we classified five of the systems as W-subtype and three as A-subtype. The stellar evolution was illustrated through the mass-radius and mass-luminosity diagrams. Furthermore, we investigated the dynamical stability of two systems with extremely low mass ratios.

 - **Abstract**
 High-mass young stellar objects exhibit episodic accretion bursts similar to their low-mass counterparts. Understanding these outbursts is crucial for elucidating massive star formation and disk evolution around high-mass protostars. We investigate thermal instability's role in triggering accretion outbursts using a two-dimensional hydrodynamical model that fully resolves the vertical structure of the inner disk. This approach provides a more realistic depiction of axially symmetric disk dynamics and assesses observable burst signatures. We simulate the inner 10 astronomical units of a circumstellar disk around a high-mass protostar, incorporating viscous heating and radiative transport in radial and vertical directions. Unlike previous one-dimensional studies, our two-dimensional model resolves time-dependent vertical disk structure, capturing complex radial-vertical dynamics. Our simulations show thermal instability causes significant structural changes. Steep temperature gradients and vigorous convection develop at outburst onset, with gas flows differing between midplane and upper layers. Energy release produces 15-30 year outbursts with peak accretion rates of $2-3\times10^{-4}~\rm M_{\odot}~\rm{yr}^{-1}$. While observable, these bursts are insufficiently bright with rise times differing from rapid observed events. Our models lack the "reflares" seen in one-dimensional calculations. Resolving full vertical disk structure is essential for accurate thermal instability modeling. While thermal instability significantly influences episodic accretion, it appears insufficient alone to explain observed HMYSO outburst diversity. Additional mechanisms are required for comprehensive understanding.

          Mixing due to internal gravity waves can explain the CNO surface abundances of B-type detached eclipsing binaries and single stars

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of double-lined spectroscopic eclipsing binaries are ideal to study stellar evolution. They have tight model-independent constraints on their masses and radii. With the addition of spectroscopically determined effective temperatures and surface abundances, they can be used to calibrate and improve models. Here we determine whether the observed trends of surface nitrogen abundance in single and binary stars can be explained by wave-induced mixing occurring in the stellar envelope. We use MESA to run the simulations. We compare the outcome of the models to observations of the surface nitrogen abundance for samples of detached eclipsing binary systems and of single B-type stars. From this we determine the amount of wave-induced mixing required to bring the model predictions in agreement with the observations. We find nitrogen to be enriched at the surface of theoretical models with wave-induced mixing provided that we use levels above log(Denv)=5-6 at the convective core boundary. A prominent observation is that the B-type components of detached eclipsing binaries do not show any nitrogen surface enhancement, which can be explained by their relatively fast rotation enforced by the tidal forces in the systems. The slowly rotating or evolved stars among the sample of single B stars do reveal a nitrogen enhancement. Our findings on the difference between single B stars and B-type components of detached binary systems can potentially be explained by internal wave-induced mixing profiles based on recent 2-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of rotating B stars. Such wave-induced mixing decreases with increasing rotation and may act in combination with additional rotational mixing. Our findings motivate future asteroseismic studies in samples of single B stars and pulsating eclipsing binaries with B-type components as optimal laboratories to further test our interpretations.

 - **Abstract**
 We model the formation of a bar plus box/peanut bulge (BP bulge) component in a Milky Way-like disc galaxy using simulations of isolated multi-component systems that evolve from equilibrium initial conditions. The simulations are designed to test the hypothesis that the bar forms early on and thickens to create the bulge. To this end, our initial conditions include a stellar disc with a Sérsic surface density profile and do not include any classical bulge component. We also include a gas disc, which is important in regulating the growth of the bar. Our best-fit model has an initial stellar disc with a Sérsic index of $n = 1.75$ and a gas disc with mass equal to 7% of the mass of the stellar disc. The model reproduces the bar size, pattern speed, and box/peanut shape of the Milky Way's bulge+bar.

 - **Abstract**
 This work investigates the impact of mirror dark matter (DM) on the global properties of rotating neutron stars (NSs) across evolutionary stages, from hot, lepton-rich proto-neutron stars (PNSs) to cold, catalyzed NSs along the Kelvin--Helmholtz timescale. The baryonic matter (BM) is modeled using a relativistic mean-field (RMF) approach with density-dependent couplings, while the dark sector mirrors the visible sector with analogous thermodynamic conditions. Using a two-fluid formalism with purely gravitational DM-BM interaction, we find that rotation enlarges the star, whereas DM admixture increases compactness and enhances gravitational stability. However, increased compactness due to DM lowers the threshold for rotational instabilities, making DM-admixed stars more susceptible. Rotation decreases temperature profiles by redistributing thermal energy over a larger volume and reducing central density, while DM raises temperatures by deepening the gravitational potential and increasing thermal energy. Stars become more prone to collapse and rotational instabilities as frequency ($\nu$) rises and the polar-to-equatorial radius ratio ($r_p/r_e$) decreases, especially near the Keplerian limit ($\nu_K$). DM-admixed stars also show higher surface gravitational redshifts due to their compactness. Our results qualitatively agree with universal relations primarily derived for rotating cold stars. These findings highlight competing effects of rotation and DM on NS thermal evolution, structure, and observables, potentially offering indirect probes of DM within NSs.

 - **Abstract**
 The parameter space for mass loss in Type Ia supernova progenitors is large, with different progenitor scenarios favoring different mass loss regimes. Here we focus on the impact that uniform and isotropic outflows have on the circumstellar environment of Type Ia supernova progenitors. We vary mass loss rate, wind velocity, and outflow duration, and evolve supernova remnant (SNR) models in this grid of circumstellar structures in order to compare the bulk properties of these models (ages, radii, and \feka\ centroids and luminosities) to observations. We find that roughly 50\% of young Type Ia SNRs in the Milky Way and the Large Magellanic Cloud had progenitors that did not substantially modify their surroundings on $\sim$pc scales. This group includes SN Ia with a range of luminosities, and at least some likely products of double detonation explosions in sub-Chandrasekhar white dwarfs. The other half of our sample can be divided in two distinct classes. A small subset of SNRs ($\sim$15\%) have large radii and low \feka\ centroids and are likely expanding into large cavities excavated by fast ($\sim$1000 km/s), sustained progenitor outflows. The majority of the SNRs that are expanding into a modified medium ($\sim35\%$) show evidence for dense material, likely associated with slow ($\sim$10 km/s) progenitor outflows, possibly a byproduct of accretion processes in near-Chandrasekhar white dwarfs spawned by younger stellar populations.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a Bayesian method for estimating spectral quantities in multivariate Gaussian time series. The approach, based on periodograms and Wishart statistics, yields closed-form expressions at any given frequency for the marginal posterior distributions of the individual power spectral densities, the pairwise coherence, and the multiple coherence, as well as for the joint posterior distribution of the full cross-spectral density matrix. In the context of noise projection - where one series is modeled as a linear combination of filtered versions of the others, plus a background component - the method also provides closed-form posteriors for both the susceptibilities, i.e., the filter transfer functions, and the power spectral density of the background. Originally developed for the analysis of the data from the European Space Agency's LISA Pathfinder mission, the method is particularly well-suited to very-low-frequency data, where long observation times preclude averaging over large sets of periodograms, which would otherwise allow these to be treated as approximately normally distributed.

 - **Abstract**
 Low Earth Orbit (LEO) optical satellite communication systems face performance challenges due to atmospheric effects such as scintillation, turbulence, wavefront distortion, beam spread, and jitter. This paper presents a comprehensive mathematical model to characterize these effects and their impact on signal propagation. We develop a methodology for dynamically calculating link budgets at any location and time by integrating these models into a probabilistic framework. The approach accounts for spatial and temporal variations in atmospheric conditions, enabling accurate estimation of link loss probabilities. Simulations validate the model's accuracy and applicability to real-world LEO satellite systems. This work offers a robust tool for optimizing link performance and enhancing the reliability of satellite networks, providing valuable insights for system designers and operators.

 - **Abstract**
 Accurate surface rotation measurements are crucial to estimate stellar ages and improve our understanding of stellar rotational evolution. Comparisons of datasets obtained from different space missions on common targets represent in this sense a way to explore the respective biases and reliability of the considered instruments, as well as a possibility to perform a more in-depth investigation of the properties of the observed stars. In this perspective, we aim at using observations for the K2 mission to provide an external validation to Gaia rotation measurements, and confront observables available from Gaia, K2, and Kepler. We therefore crossmatch the Gaia rotation catalogue and the K2 mission Ecliptic Plane Input Catalogue (EPIC) in order to find Gaia stars with both measured rotation and periods and available K2 light curves. Using our crossmatch, we analyse 1063 light curves from the K2 mission in order to characterise stellar rotational modulations and compare the recovered periods with Gaia reference values. The K2/Gaia cross-validated sample is used as a random-forest classifier training set to identify a subsample of Gaia stars with similar properties. We validate the Gaia rotation measurements for a large fraction of the sample and we discuss the possible origin of the discrepancies between some K2 and Gaia measurements. We note that the K2 sample does not include members of the low-activity ultra-fast-rotating (UFR) population that was highlighted by Gaia observations, a feature that we explain considering the instrumental capabilities of K2. Placing our sample in perspective with the full Gaia rotation catalogues and Kepler observations, we show that the population for which both Gaia and K2 are able to measure rotation is composed of young late-type stars, a significant fraction of which is not yet converged on the slow-rotator gyrochronological sequence.

 - **Abstract**
 Cold gas clouds embedded in a hot, turbulent medium are expected to be short-lived due to disruptive hydrodynamic instabilities. However, radiative cooling might allow such clouds to survive and grow. We present 3D \texttt{Athena++} simulations of clouds with a density contrast of $\chi = 1000$, exploring turbulent Mach numbers $\mathcal{M}\in (0.25, 0.75)$ and cloud radii chosen to span cooling-to-crushing ratios $\alpha \in [0.001, 10]$. We find a shift in the survival boundary, with cloud survival occurring only when the cooling-to-cloud-crushing ratio ($t_{\text{cool,mix}} / t_{\text{cc}}$) $\lesssim 0.01$, which is lower than the expected boundary of $\sim 1$. This result shows that it is more difficult for higher over-density cold clouds to survive in a turbulent, hot medium, and suggests another `survival criterion'.

          Observability of radio reflections from exoplanet ionospheres with next generation radio telescopes

 - **Abstract**
 Much has been learned about exoplanets and their atmospheres in the last three decades with the help of highly sensitive optical telescopes. Limited observations using X-ray telescopes have revealed the presence of ionospheres with very high density plasma around the hot Jupiter HD189733b. Owing to high density, the cutoff frequency of this plasma would lie in the range of few GHz. As the planet goes around the star, we suggest it might be possible to capture the stellar radio emission reflected from the ionosphere of the planet. We find that the reflected spectrum has a slope which is representative of the plasma density profile of the ionosphere and has a cutoff frequency. After investigating the reflection and free-free absorption process in the ionosphere, we find that this reflected signal, though feeble, can be captured by very sensitive radio telescopes operating in the low frequency range. We estimate the reflected signal from the ionosphere of a hot Jupiter and find that the flux ratio of the planet to the star are about $\sim 0.01\%$. In the view of development of facilities like Square Kilometer Array, it might be possible to capture the reflected radio signal from the ionosphere and constrain the thermal state of the ionosphere.

          Debiasing inference in large-scale structure with non-flat volume measures

 - **Abstract**
 Increasingly large parameter spaces, used to more accurately model precision observables in physics, can paradoxically lead to large deviations in the inferred parameters of interest -- a bias known as volume projection effects -- when marginalising over many nuisance parameters. For posterior distributions that admit a Laplace expansion, we show that this artefact of Bayesian inference can be mitigated by defining expectation values with respect to a non-flat volume measure, such that the posterior mean becomes unbiased on average. We begin by finding a measure that ensures the mean is an unbiased estimator of the mode. Although the mode itself, as we rediscover, is biased under sample averaging, this choice yields the least biased estimator due to a cancellation we clarify. We further explain why bias in marginal posteriors can appear relatively large, yet remains correctable, when the number of nuisances is large. To demonstrate our approach, we present mock analyses in large-scale structure (LSS) wherein cosmological parameters are subject to large projection effects (at the 1-2$\sigma$ level) under a flat measure, that are however recovered at high fidelity ($<0.1\sigma$) when estimated using non-flat counterparts. Our cosmological analyses are enabled by $\texttt{PyBird-JAX}$, a fast, differentiable pipeline for LSS developed in our companion paper [1].

 - **Abstract**
 Chemical abundance measurements from stars in the Milky Way to the intragalactic medium in the Perseus Cluster have challenged the spherical explosion models. Models in the literature cannot closely match the observed element ratios, where Si, S are overproduced and Ar, Ca are underproduced. In this article, we explore the impact of the model parameters during the evolution of massive stars on the final explosive nucleosynthesis. We investigate the effects of a parametrized model of the convective process, including the mixing length parameter and the semi-convection parameter, on the production of Si-group elements. We search for the value pair that can reduce the discrepancy in the models. We conclude that a mixing length parameter of 2.2 and semi-convection parameter of 0.03 are required to fit these criteria. Using this updated value pair, we compute a sequence of massive star models from $M_{\rm ZAMS} = $ 15 -- 40 $M_{\odot}$. The high resolution data from future observations such as XRISM will provide further details on less constrained processes in stellar evolution and supernova explosion. Future comparison with supernova models of various progenitor metallicity will further shed light on the supernova population and their relative rates on cosmological scales.

          Primordial Black Hole Triggered Type Ia Supernovae I: Impact on Explosion Dynamics and Light Curves

 - **Abstract**
 Primordial black holes (PBHs) in the asteroid-mass window are compelling dark matter candidates, made plausible by the existence of black holes and by the variety of mechanisms of their production in the early universe. If a PBH falls into a white dwarf (WD), the strong tidal forces can generate enough heat to trigger a thermonuclear runaway explosion, depending on the WD mass and the PBH orbital parameters. In this work, we investigate the WD explosion triggered by the passage of PBH. We perform 2D simulations of the WD undergoing thermonuclear explosion in this scenario, with the predicted ignition site as the parameter assuming the deflagration-detonation transition model. We study the explosion dynamics and predict the associated light curves and nucleosynthesis. We find that the model sequence predicts the light curves which align with the Phillip's relation ($B_{\max}$ vs. $\Delta M_{15}$). Our models hint at a unifying approach in triggering Type Ia supernovae without involving two distinctive evolutionary tracks.

 - **Abstract**
 In cold molecular clouds, UV photolysis of icy grain mantles generates radicals that lead to new molecule formation. When radical diffusion is limited by low temperatures, oxygen atom addition and insertion reactions, enabled by photolysis of common ice components such as H$_2$O, CO$_2$, CO, and O$_3$, offer an alternative route to chemical complexity through the production of metastable, highly reactive O($^{1}D$) atoms. We examine the reactivity of these oxygen atoms generated by UV photolysis of O$_3$ with methyl cyanide (CH$_3$CN). These studies are conducted in an ultrahigh vacuum chamber at cryogenic and low-pressure conditions equipped with in situ infrared spectroscopy to monitor destruction and product formation in real time. We conclude that oxygen atoms rapidly insert into CH$_3$CN to produce primarily methyl isocyanate (CH$_3$NCO) in matrix free ices. Over the range from 10 K to 40 K, we observe no temperature dependence to either CH$_3$CN destruction or CH$_3$NCO production. When placing CH$_3$CN:O$_3$ in H$_2$O and CO$_2$ ice matrices, we find that CH$_3$NCO formation remains robust, but that the yield likely decreases due to competing reaction pathways. In the case of the H$_2$O ice we also observe a shift in product branching ratios towards alternative pathways such as the formation of hydroxyacetonitrile (HOCH$_2$CN). Overall, our results demonstrate that oxygen atom reactivity provides an important channel for generating chemical complexity from nitriles on cold grains where radical mobility is limited.

          Galactic Super-Accreting X-ray Binaries as Super-PeVatron Accelerators

 - **Abstract**
 The extension of the cosmic-ray (CR) spectrum well beyond 1~PeV necessitates the existence of a population of accelerators in the Milky Way, which we refer to as Super PeVatrons. Identifying the nature of these sources remains a challenge to the paradigm of galactic CRs. Galactic super-accreting X-ray binaries, where the compact object accretes at a rate near or above the Eddington limit, can meet the energy requirement to supply the high-energy population of galactic CRs. We demonstrate that the trans-relativistic jets and/or winds of these powerful objects with kinetic energy luminosity exceeding $10^{39} \, \rm erg/s$, can accelerate protons to energies above several PeV. Detection of such super-accreting X-ray binaries through their ultra-high-energy $\gamma$-ray ``halos" and large-scale nebulae is also discussed.

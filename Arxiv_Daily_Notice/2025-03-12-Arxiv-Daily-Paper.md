 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of two new Galactic accreting compact objects consistent with the respective positions of the unassociated Fermi-LAT gamma-ray sources 4FGL J0639.1--8009 and 4FGL J1824.2+1231. A combination of new and archival X-ray data from Chandra, XMM-Newton, Swift/XRT, and eROSITA reveals a variable X-ray source in each gamma-ray error ellipse. Both candidate counterparts show power-law spectra with photon indices $\Gamma \sim 1.7-1.9$. Optical follow-up photometry and spectroscopy show rapid high-amplitude variability unrelated to orbital motion and persistent accretion disk spectra for both objects. We demonstrate that the properties of these X-ray/optical sources are at odds with the known phenomenology of accreting white dwarfs, but are consistent with the observed properties of the sub-luminous disk state of transitional millisecond pulsars. This brings the census of confirmed or candidate transitional millisecond pulsars in the Galactic field to nine. We show this potentially represents $\lesssim 10\%$ of the total population of transitional millisecond pulsars within 8 kpc.

 - **Abstract**
 More than a decade ago, the IceCube Neutrino Observatory discovered a diffuse flux of 10 TeV - 10 PeV neutrinos from our Universe. This flux of unknown origin most likely emanates from an extragalactic population of neutrino sources, which are individually too faint to appear as bright emitters. We review constraints on extragalactic neutrino source populations based on the non-detection of the brightest neutrino source. Extending previous work, we discuss limitations of source populations based on general neutrino luminosity functions. Our method provides more conservative but also statistically more robust predictions for the expected number of observable sources. We also show that the combined search of the brightest neutrino sources via weighted stacking searches or the analysis of non-Poissonian fluctuations in event-count histograms can improve the discovery potential by a factor of 2-3 relative to the brightest source.

 - **Abstract**
 Ultra-hot Jupiters (UHJs) orbit close to their host stars and experience extreme conditions, making them important laboratories to explore atmospheric composition and dynamics. Transmission spectroscopy is a useful tool to reveal chemical species and their vertical and longitudinal distribution in the atmosphere. We use transmission spectra from the PEPSI spectrograph on the Large Binocular Telescope to search for species and measure their time-resolved wind velocities in the atmosphere of TOI-1518 b. We detect Fe I at 7.8$\sigma$ and Fe II at 8.9$\sigma$, and tentatively detect Cr I at 4.4$\sigma$ and Ni I at 4.0$\sigma$. The time-resolved wind velocities of Fe I show a velocity pattern that is consistent with the velocity pattern of Fe II. TOI-1518 b joins a small sample of UHJs for which time-resolved wind velocities have been measured.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper investigates the potential of intensity interferometry, based on the Hanbury Brown-Twiss effect, for measuring supernova sizes and distances. Through optimized telescope positioning, observing strategy, and advancements in single-photon detection technology, this method can provide precise angular size measurements of Type Ia supernovae as bright as 12~mag, corresponding to a local volume out to $z\sim0.004$, with an anticipated rate of $\sim 1$ events per year. The combination of angular size data with known physical dimensions enables accurate distance determination. Multiple telescope pairs at different relative positions allow tomographic mapping of the ejecta structure while reducing distance uncertainties. As Type Ia supernovae serve as standardizable candles for measuring the Universe's expansion history, combining intensity interferometry distances with the supernova Hubble diagram facilitates measurements of the Hubble constant $H_0$.

 - **Abstract**
 Strong gravitational lenses enable direct inference of halo abundance and internal structure, which in turn enable constraints on the nature of dark matter and the primordial matter power spectrum. However, the density profiles of dark subhalos around the main deflector of a strong lens system also depend on tidal evolution inside the host, complicating the interpretation of strong-lensing inferences. We present a model for subhalo tidal evolution that accurately predicts the bound mass function and the density profiles of tidally-stripped subhalos that appear near the Einstein radius of a typical deflector for a variety of dark matter models. This model matches predictions from the semi-analytic model (SAM) {\tt{galacticus}}, but enables the simulation of subhalo populations in seconds, rather than hours. We use this model to examine the expected number of subhalos near the Einstein radius of a typical lens, and examine their lensing signals. We show that in cold dark matter the amplitude of the bound mass function is suppressed by a factor of $20$ relative to the infall mass function, and $87 \%$ of subhalos appearing in projection near the Einstein radius of a typical strong lensing deflector have lost more than $80\%$ of their mass since infall. Tidal stripping becomes increasingly severe in dark matter models with suppressed small-scale power, such as warm dark matter. This model will be used to forward model subhalo populations in forthcoming analyses of strong lens systems.

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we utilize photometric and kinematic data from \textit{Gaia} DR3 and the {\sc ASteCA} package to analyze the sparsely studied open clusters, King 2 and King 5. For King 2, we identify 340 probable members with membership probabilities exceeding 50\%. Its mean proper motion components are determined as $(\mu_\alpha\cos\delta,~\mu_\delta) = (-1.407 \pm 0.008, -0.863 \pm 0.012)$ mas yr$^{-1}$, and its limiting radius is derived as $6.94_{-1.06}^{+0.22}$ arcminutes based on radial density profiles. The cluster has an estimated age of $4.80 \pm 0.30$ Gyr, a distance of $6586 \pm 164$ pc, and a metallicity of $\text{[Fe/H]} = -0.25$ dex ($z = 0.0088$). We detect 17 blue straggler stars (BSSs) concentrated in its core, and its total mass is estimated to be $356 \pm 19~M_{\odot}$. The computed apex motion is $(A_o,~D_o) = (-142^\circ.61 \pm 0^\circ.08, -63^\circ.58 \pm 0^\circ.13)$. Similarly, King 5 consists of 403 probable members with mean proper motion components $(\mu_\alpha\cos\delta,~\mu_\delta) = (-0.291 \pm 0.005, -1.256 \pm 0.005)$ mas yr$^{-1}$ and a limiting radius of $11.33_{-2.16}^{+5.45}$ arcminutes. The cluster's age is determined as $1.45 \pm 0.10$ Gyr, with a distance of $2220 \pm 40$ pc and a metallicity of $\text{[Fe/H]} = -0.15$ dex ($z = 0.0109$). We identify 4 centrally concentrated BSSs, and the total mass is estimated as $484 \pm 22~M_{\odot}$. The apex motion is calculated as $(A_o,~D_o) = (-115^\circ.10 \pm 0^\circ.09, -73^\circ.16 \pm 0^\circ.12)$. The orbital analysis of King 2 and King 5 indicates nearly circular orbits, characterized by low eccentricities and minimal variation in their apogalactic and perigalactic distances. King 2 and King 5 reach maximum heights of $499 \pm 25$ pc and $177 \pm 2$ pc from the Galactic plane, respectively, confirming their classification as young stellar disc population.

 - **Abstract**
 We have carried out a systematic search for galaxy-scale lenses exploiting multi-band imaging data from the third public data release of the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) survey with the focus on false-positive removal, after applying deep learning classifiers to all 110 million sources with i-Kron radius above 0.8". To improve the performance, we tested the combination of multiple networks from our previous lens search projects and found the best performance by averaging the scores from five of our networks. Although this ensemble network leads already to a false-positive rate (FPR) of 0.01% at a true-positive rate (TPR) of 75% on known real lenses, we have elaborated techniques to further clean the network candidate list before visual inspection. In detail, we tested the rejection using SExtractor and the modeling network from HOLISMOKES IX, which resulted together in a candidate rejection of 29% without lowering the TPR. We carried out a comprehensive multi-stage visual inspection involving eight individuals and identified 95 grade A (average grade G >2.5) and 503 grade B (2.5 >G >1.5) lens candidates, including 92 discoveries reported for the first time. This inspection also incorporated a novel environmental characterization using histograms of photometric redshifts. We publicly release the average grades, mass model predictions, and environment characterization of all visually inspected candidates, while including references for previously discovered systems, which makes this catalog one of the largest compilation of known lenses. The results demonstrate that (1) the combination of multiple networks enhances the selection performance and (2) both automated masking tools as well as modeling networks, which can be easily applied to hundreds of thousands of network candidates, help reduce the number of false positives that is the main limitation in lens search to date.

          Excursion Sets with a "Perfect" Collapse Model

 - **Abstract**
 The $\Lambda$CDM model predicts structure formation across a vast mass range, from massive clusters ($\sim10^{15}\,\text{M}_\odot$) to Earth-mass micro-haloes ($\sim 10^{-6} \, \text{M}_\odot$), resolving which far exceeds the capabilities of current simulations. Excursion set models are the most efficient theoretical tool to disentangle this hierarchy in mass. We test the excursion set paradigm by combining smoothed initial density fields with a "perfect" collapse model -- $N$-body simulations. We find that a core excursion set assumption -- small-scale perturbations do not impact larger-scale collapse -- is approximately fulfilled but exhibits small quantitative violations dependent on the smoothing filter. For a sharp $k-$space cut-off $\sim 20\%$ of mass elements revert collapse as the smoothing scale decreases, while only $3.5\%$ do for a Gaussian and $5\%$ for a top-hat. Further, we test the simple deterministic mass-mapping $M \propto R^3$ (first-crossing scale to halo mass) relation. We find that particles that are first accreted into haloes at the same smoothing scale may end up in haloes of significantly different masses, with a scatter of 0.4-0.8 dex. We also demonstrate that the proportionally constant of this relation should be considered as a degree of freedom. Finally, we measure the mass fraction in different structure morphologies (voids, pancakes, filaments and haloes) as a function of filter scale. Typical particles appear to be part of a large-scale pancake, a smaller-scale filament and a notably smaller halo. We conclude that validating predictions of excursion set models on a particle-by-particle basis against simulations may enhance their realism.

          On the Origin of Abundance Variations in the Milky Way's High-$α$ Plateau

 - **Abstract**
 Using multi-element abundances from the SDSS APOGEE survey, we investigate the origin of abundance variations in Milky Way (MW) disk stars on the "high-$\alpha$ plateau," with $-0.8\leq\rm{[Fe/H]}\leq-0.4$ and $0.25\leq\rm{[Mg/Fe]}\leq0.35$. The elevated [$\alpha$/Fe] ratios of these stars imply low enrichment contributions from Type Ia supernovae (SNIa), but it is unclear whether their abundance patterns reflect pure core-collapse supernova (CCSN) enrichment. We find that plateau stars with higher [Fe/Mg] ratios also have higher [X/Mg] ratios for other iron-peak elements, suggesting that the [Fe/Mg] variations in the plateau population do reflect variations in the SNIa/CCSN ratio. To quantify this finding, we fit the observed abundance patterns with a two-process model, calibrated on the full MW disk, which represents each star's abundances as the sum of a prompt CCSN process with amplitude $A_{\text{cc}}$ and a delayed SNIa process with amplitude $A_{\text{Ia}}$. This model is generally successful at explaining the observed trends of [X/Mg] with $A_{\text{Ia}}/A_{\text{cc}}$, which are steeper for elements with a large SNIa contribution (e.g., Cr, Ni, Mn) and flatter for elements with low SNIa contribution (e.g., O, Si, Ca). Our analysis does not determine the value of [Mg/Fe] corresponding to pure CCSN enrichment, but it should be at least as high as the upper edge of the plateau at $\rm{[Mg/Fe]}\approx0.35$, and could be significantly higher. Compared to the two-process predictions, the observed trends of [X/Mg] with $A_{\text{Ia}}/A_{\text{cc}}$ are steeper for (C+N) but shallower for Ce, providing intriguing but contradictory clues about AGB enrichment in the early disk.

          Mechanical Torque Disruption of Dust Grains Induced by Supernova Shock Waves

 - **Abstract**
 The feedback from massive stars drives the evolution of interstellar dust grains by altering their physical properties via a number of radiative and mechanical processes. Through these interactions, interstellar grains can achieve high rotational velocities due to unbalanced torques, potentially leading to their disruption. Mechanical torque disruption occurs when gas-grain collisions, induced by the passage of shocks, spin grains to critical rotational velocities. This study aims to investigate the effects of stochastic mechanical torque disruption on both pre-existent and supernova-condensed dust grains located within wind-blown bubbles. The impact of mechanical torque disruption on supernova-condensed dust and dust grains in wind-blown bubbles is investigated through post-processing of three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulation outputs. The associated timescale is then compared to those of kinetic sputtering and grain shattering. Before the supernova explosion, dust grain disruption timescales within wind-driven bubbles are on the order of millions of years due to the low-density environment. The timescales for mechanical torque disruption (METD) are longer than those for kinetic sputtering and comparable to those of grain shattering, primarily due the high grain drift velocities typical of these regions.

 - **Abstract**
 The physical properties of stellar atmospheres in rapidly rotating massive stars, such as Be stars, are critical to understanding their evolution and their role as progenitors of supernovae. These stars, which often have near-critical rotation, exhibit equatorial stretching and gravity darkening, which significantly complicates the determination of parameters such as the inclination angle. Be stars, characterized by their extreme rotational velocities, serve as excellent candidates for exploring these phenomena. However, fundamental quantities such as polar and equatorial radii and inclination angles are typically derived from interferometry, which applies only to a limited number of stars. This study aims to enhance the determination of inclination angles for Be stars using the ZPEKTR spectral synthesis code. By incorporating advanced models of gravity darkening and stellar deformation, we evaluated the effectiveness of this method with a sample of ten Be stars from the BeSOS database, comparing results with established interferometric data. Methods. We used the ZPEKTR code to model the effects of stellar oblateness and gravity darkening on spectral lines, focusing on the HeI 4471 line. We applied a chi-squared test minimization approach to identify the best-fitting models, and we evaluated the inclination angles derived against interferometric measurements. Our analysis reveals a robust linear correlation between the inclination angles derived from ZPEKTR and using interferometric techniques, which demonstrates an excellent agreement. The ZPEKTR code effectively models high rotational velocity effects, providing precise stellar parameter determinations. The results underscore the potential of advanced spectroscopic techniques to yield inclination measurements comparable to interferometry, which offers a pathway to studying distant massive stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Low-energy neutrinos from the cosmic background are captured by objects in the sky that contain material susceptible of single beta decay. Neutrons, which compose most of a neutron star, capture low-energy neutrinos from the cosmic neutrino background and release a high-energy electron in the MeV range. Also, planets contain unstable isotopes that capture the cosmic neutrinos. We show that this process is feasible and results in a non-negligible flux of electrons in the MeV range in neutron stars. We present a novel observable, the redshift evolution of the temperature of neutron stars due to neutrino capture, that could provide a route for detection of the cosmic neutrino background from future gravitational waves observatories. For planets the flux is significantly smaller and a measurement is not possible with currently envisioned technology. While the signature from neutron stars is small and challenging, it could result in a novel way to detect the cosmic neutrino background.

          OGLE-2011-BLG-0462: An Isolated Stellar-Mass Black Hole Confirmed Using New HST Astrometry and Updated Photometry

 - **Abstract**
 The long-duration Galactic-bulge microlensing event OGLE-2011-BLG-0462 produced relativistic astrometric deflections of the source star, which we measured using HST observations taken at 8 epochs over ~6 years. Analysis of the microlensing light curve and astrometry led our group (followed by other independent groups) to conclude that the lens is an isolated stellar-mass black hole (BH)--the first and only one unambiguously discovered to date. There have now been three additional epochs of HST observations, increasing the astrometric time baseline to 11 years. Additionally, the ground-based OGLE data have been updated. We have re-analyzed the data, including the new HST astrometry, and photometry obtained with 16 different telescopes. The source lies only 0.4 arcsec from a bright neighbor, making it crucial to perform precise subtraction of its point-spread function (PSF) in the astrometric measurements of the source. Moreover, we show that it is essential to perform a separate PSF subtraction for each individual HST frame as part of the reductions. Our final solution yields a lens mass of 7.15 +/- 0.83 solar mass. Combined with the lack of detected light from the lens at late HST epochs, the BH nature of the lens is conclusively verified. The BH lies at a distance of 1.52 +/- 0.15 kpc, and is moving with a space velocity of 51.1 +/- 7.5 km/s relative to the stars in the neighborhood. We compare our results with those of other studies and discuss reasons for the differences. We searched for binary companions of the BH at a range of separations but found no evidence for any.

 - **Abstract**
 V4641 Sgr is a low-mass black hole X-ray binary system with somewhat puzzling spectral characteristics during its soft state. Recent high-resolution spectroscopic studies of V4641 Sgr have revealed strong ionized emission line features in both the optical and X-ray bands, including P-Cygni signatures, and an unusually low soft state luminosity, indicating that the central engine is obscured. Here we present an analysis of five NuSTAR observations of V4641 Sgr taken during its recent outburst in 2021, when the source was in the soft state. We identify highly ionized Fe K emission lines, consistent with a combination of the near-neutral $6.4$~keV Fe K$\alpha$ line, and the H-like and He-like Fe K$\alpha$ and Fe K$\beta$ transitions found at $6.7\mbox{--}7$~keV and $\sim8$~keV, and find no evidence for strong relativistic broadening. The line fluxes correlate linearly with the observed disk continuum flux, implying a direct connection between the central engine and the reprocessing region. Most interestingly, all five spectra also show a persistent highly ionized Fe K continuum edge feature at $\sim9$~keV with a stable optical depth, which is likely smeared, implying a localized reprocessing zone. We find tentative supporting evidence for obscuration of the inner accretion disk based on its unusually low intrinsic luminosity, however, the NuSTAR spectra do not require obscuration from cold, optically thick gas.

          Increasing Determinism of All-vs-all Orbital Evolution Simulators

 - **Abstract**
 All-vs-all orbital evolutionary simulations for the low Earth orbit (LEO) simulate the long term evolution of the LEO environment. Although these simulations typically offer the highest fidelity, they are also highly computationally intensive. One factor that effectively reduces the efficiency of the approach is that all-vs-all approaches are stochastic and the distribution of the output has large variance. This paper introduces a new, quasi-deterministic all-vs-all simulator, whose variance is greatly reduced compared to traditional methods. The proposed approach virtually simulates collisions happening everywhere and all the time; however, their effect is appropriately reduced to maintain an unbiased estimate of the mean. Additional techniques are used to augment the proposed approach and obtain very precise estimates of any number of standard deviations from the mean, for the evaluation of the Value at Risk (VaR) with a single, low-variance run. Depending on the settings, results show that the variance in total number of debris generated can be reduced by a factor that averages 1,500, while increasing the computational cost by a factor of less than 1.5. Variance can be reduced even more when computing the VaR, albeit a no longer negligible bias is introduced. Low-variance results enable several key applications, such as sensitivity analysis, sustainability assessment of small missions, and fast evaluation of collision risk induced by existing debris. Additionally, rapid computations of the VaR can improve the evaluation of policy robustness, and include confidence intervals in risk assessment.

 - **Abstract**
 Multiple-Amplifier Sensing (MAS) charge-coupled devices (CCDs) have recently been shown to be promising silicon detectors that meet noise sensitivity requirements for next generation Stage-5 spectroscopic surveys and potentially, future space-based imaging of extremely faint objects such as the Habitable Worlds Observatory. Building upon the capability of the Skipper CCD to achieve deeply sub-electron noise floors, MAS CCDs utilize multiple floating-gate amplifiers along the serial register to increase the readout speed by a factor of the number of output nodes compared to a Skipper CCD. We introduce and experimentally demonstrate on a 16-channel prototype device new readout techniques that exploit the MAS CCD's floating-gate amplifiers to optimize the correlated double sampling (CDS) by resetting once per line instead of once per pixel. With this new mode, we find an optimal filter to subtract the noise from the signal during read out. We also take advantage of the MAS CCD's structure to tune the read time by independently changing integration times for the signal and reference level. Together with optimal weighted averaging of the 16 outputs, these approaches enable us to reach a sub-electron noise of 0.9 e$^-$ rms pix$^{-1}$ at 19 $\mu$s pix$^{-1}$ for a single charge measurement per pixel - simultaneously giving a 30% faster readout time and 10% lower read noise compared to performance previously evaluated without these techniques.

 - **Abstract**
 The emerging population of long-period radio transients (LPTs) show both similarities and differences with normal pulsars. A key difference is that their radio emission is too bright to be powered solely by rotational energy. Various models have been proposed (including both white-dwarf or neutron star origins), and their nature remains uncertain. Known LPTs have minutes to hours long spin periods, while normal pulsars have periods ranging from milliseconds to seconds. Here, we report the discovery of PSR J0311+1402, an object with an intermediate spin period of 41 seconds, bridging the gap between LPTs and normal pulsars. PSR J0311+1402 exhibits low linear ($\sim25\%$) and circular polarisation ($\sim5\%$) and a relatively steep spectral index ($\sim-2.3$), features similar to normal pulsars. However, its observed spin-down properties place it below the pulsar death line, where pair production and thus radio emission are expected to cease. The discovery of PSR J0311+1402 suggests the existence of a previously undetected population within this intermediate period range, presumably missed due to selection biases in traditional pulsar search methods. Finding more such objects is important to fill the current gap in neutron star spin periods, improving our understanding of the relationships among rotation-powered pulsars and LPTs.

 Modelling is essential for studies that quantify the impact from satellite downlinks on radio astronomy sites. To estimate this impact it is necessary to know not only the position and velocity of satellites but also their behaviour in the radio spectrum domain. As many large satellite constellations are using steerable beam antennas, deterministically predicting the transmitted power towards a defined direction (in this case where a radio telescope points) becomes an almost impossible task and therefore another approach has to be used. This work presents a method to simulate and estimate the percentiles of the radiation pattern of satellites with steerable beam patterns based on simulations and a comparison with measurements of Starlink satellites using the Onsala Twin Telescopes in Sweden.

 - **Abstract**
 We present spatially-resolved spectroscopic observations of 10 isolated Galactic HII regions using data from the LAMOST Medium-Resolution Spectroscopic Survey of Nebulae (LAMOST MRS-N). The high spatial resolution of the data allows us to investigate the 1D radial profiles of emission line fluxes (Ha, [S II] and [N II]), flux ratios ([N II]/Ha, [S II]/Ha and [S II]/[N II]), and radial velocities of these three emission lines. Among these regions, two are ionization-bounded, while the remaining eight are matter-bounded. The matter-bounded HII regions exhibit shallower slopes in their radial flux profiles compared to the ionization-bounded ones. In most cases, the [N II]/Ha and [S II]/Ha ratios increase with distance from the center of the HII regions, consistent with model predictions that low-ionization emissions dominate the outer zones of these regions. The two ionization-bounded HII regions have kinematic ages (t) of 0.2 and 0.3 Myr, while the matter-bounded regions span ages from 1 to 12 Myr. For the matter-bounded HII regions, the optical emission flux decreases continuously beyond the photodissociation region (PDR), extending to approximately 1-4 times the radius of the PDR (r_PDR). The escape fraction f_esc of ionizing photons, derived from 1D Ha radial flux profiles, is ~ 0% for ionization-bounded HII regions, while it ranges from 50% to 90% for the matter-bounded HII regions. The correlation between f_esc and t suggests that evolved HII regions (with t > 1 Myr) contribute more significantly to ionizing the surrounding diffuse ionized gas compared to younger, newly formed HII regions.

 - **Abstract**
 We summarise a new approach for measuring the Hubble constant using standard sirens and the reconstructed matter density field obtained from observed galaxy surveys. Specifically, we describe and test this method using the Bayesian forward-modelled software BORG. This software evolves the initial density field to the present, sampling plausible density fields from the posterior, accounting for peculiar velocities, and automatically incorporating higher-order correlation functions. The advantage of adding additional information from correlations is expected to make this method more effective in low-signal-to-noise regimes, such as those with modest galaxy number density or incomplete surveys. Our results show that developing a cross-correlation framework between gravitational waves and galaxy surveys, based on the forward-modelled reconstructed density field, to measure H0 is promising. This review is based on the research conducted as part of Boruah's Ph.D. thesis.

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze the emission and absorption lines during photospheric radius expansion (PRE) X-ray bursts from the ultracompact binary 4U 1820--30, observed with the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER). Using Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the significance, we identified a 1 keV emission line from 14 bursts, a 3 keV absorption line from 12 bursts, and 1.6 keV absorption from one burst. By coadding the burst spectra at the maximum radius phase, we detected a 1.034 keV emission line with significance of $14.2\sigma$, and absorption lines at 1.64 and 3 keV with significances of $10.8\sigma$ and $11.7\sigma$, respectively. The observed energy shifts are consistent with the prediction from the burst-driven wind model, indicating that all three spectral features are produced by the PRE wind. Analysis of the ratios between the emission and absorption line energies suggests that the 1 keV feature is a superposition of several narrower Fe L-shell lines. To evaluate the scientific capabilities of the Hot Universe Baryon Surveyor (HUBS), we simulated mock observations of multiple narrow lines near 1 keV. The results demonstrate that HUBS is well suited for detailed studies of the 1 keV emission line during bursts, offering significant potential to advance our understanding of these phenomena.

 - **Abstract**
 Barnard's Star is an old, single M dwarf star that comprises the second-closest extrasolar system. It has a long history of claimed planet detections from both radial velocities and astrometry. However, none of these claimed detections have so far withstood further scrutiny. Continuing this story, extreme precision radial velocity (EPRV) measurements from the ESPRESSO instrument have recently been used to identify four new sub-Earth-mass planet candidates around Barnard's Star. We present here 112 radial velocities of Barnard's Star from the MAROON-X instrument that were obtained independently to search for planets around this compelling object. The data have a typical precision of 30\,cm\,s$^{-1}$ and are contemporaneous with the published ESPRESSO measurements (2021 -- 2023). The MAROON-X data on their own confirm planet b ($P$\,=\,3.154\,d) and planet candidates c and d ($P$\,=\,4.124\,d and 2.340\,d, respectively). Furthermore, adding the MAROON-X data to the ESPRESSO data strengthens the evidence for planet candidate e ($P$\,=\,6.739\,d), thus leading to its confirmation. The signals from all four planets are $<$50\,cm\,s$^{-1}$, the minimum masses of the planets range from 0.19 to 0.34\,$M_{\oplus}$, and the system is among the most compact known among late M dwarfs hosting low-mass planets. The current data rule out planets with masses $>0.57\,M_{\oplus}$ (with a $99\%$ detection probability) in Barnard Star's habitable zone ($P$\,=\,10 -- 42\,d).

 - **Abstract**
 The interaction between the accretion disc and its corona plays a critical role in the energy balance and emission mechanisms in astrophysical systems such as active galactic nuclei and X-ray binaries. However, the detailed physics of disc-corona interactions, including the mechanisms driving disc evaporation, and the impact of accretion rate and viscosity, remains poorly understood. Our study aims to extend the well-known disc evaporation model to investigate the disc-corona interaction in a 2D axisymmetric, time-dependent hydrodynamic model, focusing on the effects of viscosity, accretion rate, and their influence on disc evaporation, luminosity, and corona formation. We develop a hydrodynamic model consisting of a thin accretion disc, a corona, and a vacuum region. Our model is implemented in \textit{Athena++}, with the gas-vacuum interface tracking algorithm to handle the vacuum regions. We perform simulations incorporating turbulent viscosity, thermal conduction, Bremsstrahlung cooling, and artificial disc cooling, starting from an adiabatic state to explore the disc-corona interaction. We demonstrate the presence of acoustic shock heating, a mechanism widely studied in the solar physics community but less explored in the context of accretion discs. We find that the viscosity dominates the intensity of disc evaporation, the accretion rate primarily determines the disc truncation radius and the disc luminosity, and there may be a positive correlation between the corona luminosity and the evaporation intensity. We also compare our results with the observations and simulations, and estimate the $y$-parameters to explore the potential effects of Compton cooling.

 - **Abstract**
 Most (or possibly all) massive stars reside in multiple systems. From stellar evolution models, numerous systems with an OB star coupled to a black hole would be expected to exist. There have been several claimed detections of such pairs in recent years and this is notably the case of HD96670. Using high-quality photometry and spectroscopy in the optical range, we revisited the HD96670 system. We also examined complementary X-ray observations to provide a broader view of the system properties. The TESS light curves of HD96670 clearly show eclipses, ruling out the black hole companion scenario. This does not mean that the system is not of interest. Indeed, the combined analysis of photometric and spectroscopic data indicates that the system most likely consists of a O8.5 giant star paired with a stripped-star companion with a mass of ~4.5Msol, a radius of ~1Rsol, and a surface temperature of ~50kK. While several B+sdOB systems have been reported in the literature, this would be the first case of a Galactic system composed of an O star and a faint stripped star. In addition, the system appears brighter and harder than normal OB stars in the X-ray range, albeit less so than for X-ray binaries. The high-energy observations provide hints of phase-locked variations, as typically seen in colliding wind systems. As a post-interaction system, HD96670 actually represents a key case for probing binary evolution, even if it is not ultimately found to host a black hole.

 Machine-learning is playing an increasing role in helping the astronomical community to face data analysis challenges, in particular in the field of Galactic Archaeology and large scale spectroscopic surveys. We present recent developments in the field of convolutional neural-networks (CNNs) for stellar abundances in the context of the Galactic spectroscopic surveys Gaia-ESO, and Gaia-RVS. Especially, by combining the full Gaia data product, we manage to characterize for the first time the [alpha/M] vs. [M/H] bimodality in the Galactic disc with Gaia-RVS spectra at low-S/N. This work is highly relevant for the next generation of large scale surveys such as MSE, 4MOST, and WST.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate anisotropic inflation within the single-field model featuring an intermediate scale factor. Our analysis reveals that the anisotropic nature of the Friedmann equations in this framework affects the slow-roll parameters, which in turn influence key perturbation parameters. Using a numerical approach, we derive constraints on the intermediate parameter $\beta$ and the anisotropic parameter $c$. Our results show that the model is consistent with Planck2018 TT, TE, EE +lowE+lensing+BK14+BAO data at $68\%$ CL, for $0.84<\beta<1$ and $7.34<c<27.7$. At $95\%$ CL the consistency holds for $0.77<\beta<1$ and $7.17<c<28.9$. The model is also consistent with Planck2018 TT, TE, EE +lowE+lensing+BK18+BAO data, for $0.91<\beta<1$ and $8.00<c<27.4$ (at $68\%$ CL), and $0.88<\beta<1$ and $7.40<c<28.8$ (at $95\%$ CL). Additionally, we examine the reheating phase using these constraints on constraints on $\beta$ and $c$ and determine the observationally consistent ranges for the number of e-folds and the temperature during the reheating phase.

 - **Abstract**
 OB stars are crucial for our understanding of Galactic structure, star formation, stellar feedback and multiplicity. In this paper we have compiled a census of all OB stars within 1 kpc of the Sun. We performed evolutionary and atmospheric model fits to observed spectral energy distributions (SEDs) compiled from astro-photometric survey data. We have characterized and mapped 24,706 O- and B-type stars ($T_{\rm eff} > 10,000$ K) within 1 kpc of the Sun, whose overdensities correspond to well-studied OB associations and massive star-forming regions such as Sco-Cen, Orion OB1, Vela OB2, Cepheus and Circinus. We have assessed the quality of our catalogue by comparing it with spectroscopic samples and similar catalogues of OB(A) stars, as well as catalogues of OB associations, star-forming regions and young open clusters. Finally, we have also exploited our list of OB stars to estimate their scale height (76 $\pm$ 1 pc), a local star formation rate of $2896^{+417}_{-1}$ M$_{\odot}$ Myr$^{-1}$ and a local core-collapse supernova rate of $\sim$15--30 per Myr. We extrapolate these rates to the entire Milky Way to derive a Galactic SFR of $0.67^{+0.09}_{-0.01}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ and a core-collapse supernova rate of 0.4--0.5 per century. These are slightly lower than previous estimates, which we attribute to improvements in our census of OB stars and changes to evolutionary models. We calculate a near-Earth core collapse supernova rate of $\sim$2.5 per Gyr that supports the view that nearby supernova explosions could have caused one or more of the recorded mass extinction events on Earth.

 - **Abstract**
 Only one globular cluster (GC), 47 Tuc, has been found to contain intracluster medium, with an electron density 100 times higher than that of the ISM in its vicinity. The characteristics of this intracluster medium are closely related to GC evolution and the compact objects within. However, significant knowledge gaps remain regarding the ionized gas content of GCs, particularly in Galactic halo clusters. We carried out a polarization census of GC pulsars using MeerKAT and FAST. This first combined effort of observations from these two major radio telescopes resulted in high signal-to-noise ratio, full polarization pulse profiles for 43 pulsars in 8 GCs, doubling the number of rotation measures (RMs) known in these clusters. The accuracy of dispersion measures (DMs) was improved by a factor of 8 compared to previous publications. No intracluster medium was found, and at least two halo GCs showed more stringent upper limits on electron density than that detected in 47 Tuc. The surprising barrenness of GCs suggests effective gas removal mechanisms, such as strong winds from millisecond pulsars and/or ionizing radiation from post-AGB stars and young white dwarfs.

          Precise Parameters from Bayesian SED Fitting Indicate Thermally-Driven Mass Loss Likely Driver of Radius Valley

 - **Abstract**
 Several planet formation models have been proposed to explain the gap in the population of planets between $1.8$ $R_\oplus$ to $2.0$ $R_\oplus$ known as the Radius Valley. To apply these models to confirmed exoplanets, accurate and precise host star and planet parameters are required to ensure the observed measurements correctly match model predictions. Previous studies have emphasized the need for a larger, more precise sample to further confirm dominant formation processes. By enhancing standard SED (Spectral Energy Distribution) fitting using Bayesian methods we derived highly accurate and precise host star and planet parameters. Specifically, we achieved median fractional uncertainties for stellar and planet radii of 2.4% and 3.4%, respectively. We then produced the largest, most precise sample to date of 1923 planets when compared to previous studies. This full sample, as well as a sampled filtered for host stellar masses between $0.8$ and $1.2$ $M_\odot$, are then used to derive the slope and position of the radius valley as a function of orbital period, insolation flux and stellar mass to compare them to predictive models and previous observational results. Our results are consistent with thermally-driven mass loss with a planet radius vs. orbital period slope of $-0.142$ $\pm0.006$ for the full sample leaning toward core-powered mass loss. The planet radius vs. insolation flux slope of $0.136$ $\pm0.014$ for the filtered sample leaned toward photoevaporation. Also, the slope as a function of stellar mass for both samples appear more consistent with thermally driven processes when compared to models and previous studies.

 The search for weak components outside the main pulse (MP) in the radiation of pulsars at a frequency of 110 MHz observed on the LPA LPI telescope in the Pushchino Multibeam Pulsar Search (PUMPS) has been carried out. The sample included 96 pulsars, for which the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) in the MP of the average profile during accumulation over 10 years was more than 40. It was found that PSR J1543+0929 has radiation for almost the entire period. The profile is three-component. The relative amplitudes of the lateral weak components are 0.013 and 0.026. For PSR J2234+2114, a precursor was detected that is $53^o$ away from MP.

 We present a comprehensive study of the X-ray spectral variability observed in 13 TeV photon emitting high energy peaked BL Lacs(HBLs). These data come from 54 XMM-Newton EPIC-PN pointed observations made during its operational period from June 2001 through July 2023. We performed spectral studies in the energy range 0.6-10 keV by fitting X-ray spectra of the pointed observations with power law (PL) and log parabolic (LP) models. We found at 99% confidence level that 31 of these X-ray spectra were best fitted with a range of LP models with local photon indices (at 1.0 keV), alpha in the range of 1.75-2.66, and convex curvature parameter beta in the range of 0.02-0.25. PL models with photon index Gamma in the range of 1.78-2.68 best described the spectra of fourteen-pointed observations. Nine PN spectra resulted in negative curvature parameters in fitting an LP model, and eight among them were significant (beta is at least twice beta_err). We fitted broken power law (BPL) models to these eight X-ray spectra and found spectral hardening (Delta_Gamma) in the range of 0.06-0.54 for these observations. EPIC-MOS spectra were also studied for those eight observations to search for similar trends, and we were able to find them in only two, one observation each of PKS 0548-322 and Mrk 501. This indicates the possibility of the co-existence of an inverse Compton component along with the dominant synchrotron component for these two observations. We also performed correlation studies between various log-parabolic spectral parameters and briefly discuss their possible implications.

 - **Abstract**
 The low masses of M dwarfs create attractive opportunities for exoplanet radial-velocity (RV) detections. These stars, however, exhibit strong stellar activity that may attenuate or mimic planetary signals. We present a velocimetric analysis on one such M dwarf, GJ 3998 ($d=18.2\,\text{pc}$), with two published short-period super-Earths: GJ 3998 b and GJ 3998 c. We use additional data from the HARPS-N spectrograph to confirm these two planets and to look for more. We carry out joint modelling of: (i) RV planetary signals, (ii) stellar rotation in RV and activity indicators through Gaussian processes, (iii) long-term trends in RV and activity indicators. We constrain the rotational period of GJ 3998 to $P_\text{rot}=30.2\pm 0.3\,\text{d}$ and discover long-term sinusoidal imprints in RV and FWHM of period $P_\text{cyc}=316^{+14}_{-8}\,\text{d}$. We confirm GJ 3998 b and GJ 3998 c, and detect a third planet: GJ 3998 d, whose signal had been previously attributed to stellar activity. GJ 3998 d has an orbital period of $41.78\pm 0.05\,\text{d}$, a minimum mass of $6.07^{+1.00}_{-0.96}\,\text{M}_\oplus$ and a mean insolation flux of $1.2^{+0.3}_{-0.2}\,\Phi_\oplus$. This makes it one of the few known planets receiving Earth-like insolation flux.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the impact of nuclear input related to weak-decay rates and neutron-capture reactions on predictions for the $s$ process in AGB stars. We provide the first database of surface abundances and stellar yields of the isotopes heavier than iron from the $Monash$ models. We run nucleosynthesis calculations with the $Monash$ post-processing code for 7 stellar structure evolution models of low-mass AGB stars with 3 different sets of nuclear input. The reference set has constant decay rates and represents the set used in the previous $Monash$ publications. The second set contains the temperature and density dependence of $\beta$ decays and electron captures based on the default rates of NETGEN. In the third set, we update 92 neutron-capture rates based on reevaluated experimental cross sections from the ASTRAL. We compare and discuss the predictions of each set relative to each other in terms of isotopic surface abundances and total stellar yields. We also compare results to isotopic ratios measured in presolar stardust SiC grains from AGB stars. The new sets of models resulted in a $\sim$66% solar $s$-process contribution to the $p$-nucleus $\mathrm{^{152}Gd}$, confirming that this isotope is predominantly made by the $s$ process. The nuclear input updates resulted in predictions for the $\mathrm{^{80}Kr/^{82}Kr}$ ratio in the He intershell and surface $\mathrm{^{64}Ni/^{58}Ni}, \mathrm{^{94}Mo/^{96}Mo}$ and $\mathrm{^{137}Ba/^{136}Ba}$ ratios more consistent with the corresponding ratios measured in stardust, however, the new predicted $\mathrm{^{138}Ba/^{136}Ba}$ ratios are higher than the typical values of the stardust SiC grain data. The W isotopic anomalies are in agreement with data from analysis of other meteoritic inclusions. We confirm that the production of $\mathrm{^{176}Lu}$ and $\mathrm{^{205}Pb}$ is affected by too large uncertainties in their decay rates from NETGEN.

 - **Abstract**
 T CrA is a Herbig Ae-type young star in a complex circumstellar environment; it includes a circumstellar disk, accretion streamers, jets, and outflows. It has long been suspected to be a binary. However, until now, there has been no direct detection of a companion. Here we present new VLTI/MATISSE L- and N-band observations of T CrA taken between 2023 May and 2024 August with the aim of testing the binary nature of the system. We modeled the data with a geometric model using the Python tool oimodeler. We detected a companion (T CrA B) with a projected separation of $\Delta r = 153.2 \pm 1.2$ mas ($\approx 23$ au) toward the west direction at a position angle of $275.4 \pm 0.1^\circ$, in 2024 May-August. Our results support that the companion has a nearly edge-on orbit that is highly misaligned with respect to the circumprimary disk. Such a configuration could cause warping and tearing of the disk around the primary, which has been proposed by recent studies. In the L band the companion is extended, with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) size of $\sim 1$ au, suggesting that the emission comes from a disk around the secondary star. The companion flux is 0.2-0.3 Jy in the L band, and 0.2-0.7 Jy in the N band, accounting for 4-20% of the total emission at those wavelengths. The SED of the companion is compatible with thermal radiation of warm dust (600-800 K).

 - **Abstract**
 Most Sun-like and higher-mass stars reside in systems that include one or more gravitationally bound stellar companions. These systems offer an important probe of planet formation in the most common stellar systems, while also providing key insights into how gravitational perturbations and irradiation differences from a companion star alter the outcomes of planet formation. Recent dynamical clues have begun to emerge that reveal systematic, non-random structure in the configurations of many planet-hosting binary systems: in close- to moderate-separation ($s < 800$ au) binary star systems, the orbits of exoplanets around individual stellar components are preferentially aligned with the orbital plane of their host stellar binary. In this work, we flip this narrative and search for nearby, edge-on binary star systems that, due to this preferential alignment, are top candidates for radial velocity and transiting exoplanet searches. We present a sample of 591 moderate-separation, relatively bright ($G < 14$) Gaia-resolved binary star systems in likely near-edge-on configurations. Using a simulated population of exoplanets drawn from transit survey occurrence rate constraints, we provide an overview of the expected planet yields from a targeted search in these systems. We describe the opportunities for comparative exoplanet demographics in the case that both stars can be inferred to host edge-on planetary systems - a configuration toward which the presented sample may be biased, given recent observations of orbit-orbit alignment in exoplanet-hosting binary systems.

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxy-galaxy strong lensing provides a powerful probe of galaxy formation, evolution, and the properties of dark matter and dark energy. However, conventional lens-modeling approaches are computationally expensive and require fine-tuning to avoid local optima, rendering them impractical for the hundreds of thousands of lenses expected from surveys such as Euclid, CSST, and Roman Space Telescopes. To overcome these challenges, we introduce TinyLensGPU, a GPU-accelerated lens-modeling tool that employs XLA-based acceleration with JAX and a neural-network-enhanced nested sampling algorithm, nautilus-sampler. Tests on 1,000 simulated galaxy-galaxy lenses demonstrate that on an RTX 4060 Ti GPU, TinyLensGPU achieves likelihood evaluations approximately 2,000 times faster than traditional methods. Moreover, the nautilus-sampler reduces the number of likelihood evaluations by a factor of 3, decreasing the overall modeling time per lens from several days to roughly 3 minutes. Application to 63 SLACS lenses observed by the Hubble Space Telescope recovers Einstein radii consistent with the literature values (within $\lesssim 5\%$ deviation), which is within known systematic uncertainties. Catastrophic failures, where the sampler becomes trapped in local optima, occur in approximately 5\% of the simulated cases and 10\% of the SLACS sample. We argue that such issues are inherent to automated lens modeling but can be mitigated by incorporating prior knowledge from machine learning techniques. This work thus marks a promising step toward the efficient analysis of strong lenses in the era of big data. The code and data are available online: this https URL.

          There's more to life in reflected light: Simulating the detectability of a range of molecules for high-contrast, high-resolution observations of non-transiting terrestrial exoplanets

 - **Abstract**
 The upcoming extremely large telescopes will provide the first opportunity to search for signs of habitability and life on non-transiting terrestrial exoplanets using high-contrast, high-resolution instrumentation. However, the suite of atmospheric gases in terrestrial exoplanet environments that are accessible to ground-based reflected light observations has not been thoroughly explored. In this work, we use an upgraded Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) detectability pipeline to simulate the detectability of gases that can serve as habitability markers, potential biosignatures, and false positive discriminants in the atmospheres of Earth-sized and sub-Neptune planets. We calculate molecular detectability for five photochemically self-consistent atmosphere types, including the modern and Archean Earth, uninhabited biosignature ``false positive'' environments, and a sub-Neptune, over a grid of observational configurations for non-transiting targets within 10pc of Earth. For the most accessible nearby target, Proxima Centauri b, our results suggest that we may be able to rule out a sub-Neptune atmosphere in as little as a single hour of observing, and two biosignature disequilibrium pairs (O$_2$/CH$_4$ and CO$_2$/CH$_4$) may be accessible in $\sim 10$ hours for the most optimistic scenario. It may also be possible to discriminate uninhabited worlds, and rule out biosignature false positives by identifying contextual indicators (CO and H$_2$O) of abiotic O$_2$ and/or CH$_4$ buildup on similar timescales. In the near term, ELT reflected light observations will likely allow us to characterize multiple nearby terrestrial atmospheres, and ultimately search for signs of habitability and life.

          Nonparametric reconstructions of dynamical dark energy via flexknots

 - **Abstract**
 Recent cosmological surveys have provided unprecedented datasets that can be used to reconstruct the history of the dark energy equation of state. In this work, a free-form "flexknot'' parameterisation is employed to represent $w(a)$ as a linear spline between free-moving nodes, the number of which may vary. By combining DESI Baryon Acoustic Oscillation measurements with Pantheon+ or DES5Y supernovae, the functional posteriors of $w(a)$ reveal an unexpected W-shaped structure. While the Bayesian evidence may still favour $\Lambda$CDM, the robustness of these results suggests the structure is indeed present in the data. The tension $R$-statistic and suspiciousness have been marginalised over models, and demonstrate that while the reconstructions from DESI and Pantheon+ agree, DESI and DES5Y do not. We conclude that, while there is no smoking gun for dynamical dark energy, the structure unearthed in this work is generally too complex to be captured by the restrictive $w$CDM or CPL parameterisations.

          Extreme Jet Beaming Observed in Neutrino-Associated Blazars

 - **Abstract**
 Bright blazars were found to be prominent neutrino sources, and a number of IceCube events were associated with them over recent years. A particularly strong observational connection is present between neutrinos and blazars with bright, Doppler-boosted, parsec-scale radio emission. In this work, we further explore the nature of this connection by examining the jet geometry and kinematics of neutrino-associated blazars. We find that these blazars demonstrate remarkably strong jet beaming, even compared to other radio-bright sources. Their Doppler and Lorentz factors are larger, and viewing angles are smaller than for other blazars in the complete uniformly selected MOJAVE sample. Observationally, this serves as yet another piece of evidence for blazars forming a major population of neutrino sources. The strong neutrino-beaming correlation indicates that high-energy neutrino velocity is predominantly oriented along the jet, and the original PeV-scale protons exhibit a relativistic bulk motion along the jet. It suggests that neutrino production happens not too close to the black hole, but rather at sub-parsec distances, where the jet is already accelerated.

 - **Abstract**
 The Taurid Complex is a large interplanetary system that contains comet 2P/Encke, several meteoroid streams, and possibly a number of near-Earth asteroids. The size and nature of the system has led to the speculation that it was formed through a large-scale cometary breakup. Numerical investigations have suggested that planetary dynamics can create a resonant region with a large number of objects concentrated in a small segment of the orbit, known as the Taurid swarm, which approaches the Earth in certain years and provides favorable conditions to study the Taurid Complex. Recent meteor observations confirmed the existence of the swarm for mm- to m-sized objects. Here we present a dedicated telescopic search for potentially hazardous asteroids and other macroscopic objects in the Taurid swarm using the Zwicky Transient Facility survey. We determine from our non-detection that there are no more than 9--14 $H\leq24$ (equivalent to a diameter of $D\gtrsim100$~m) objects in the swarm, suggesting that the Encke--Taurid progenitor was $\sim10$~km in size. A progenitor of such a size is compatible with the prediction of state-of-the-art Solar System dynamical models, which expects $\sim0.1$ $D>10$~km objects on Encke-like orbits at any given time.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the eigenmodes of the spin-2 Laplacian in orientable Euclidean manifolds and their implications for the tensor-induced part of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature and polarization anisotropies. We provide analytic expressions for the correlation matrices of Fourier-mode amplitudes and of spherical harmonic coefficients. We demonstrate that non-trivial spatial topology alters the statistical properties of CMB tensor anisotropies, inducing correlations between harmonic coefficients of differing $\ell$ and $m$ and across every possible pair of temperature and $E$- and $B$-modes of polarization. This includes normally forbidden $TB$ and $EB$ correlations. We compute the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the pure tensor-induced CMB fluctuations in the usual infinite covering space and those in each of the non-trivial manifolds under consideration, varying both the size of the manifolds and the location of the observer. We find that the amount of information about the topology of the Universe contained in tensor-induced anisotropies does not saturate as fast as its scalar counterpart; indeed, the KL divergence continues to grow with the inclusion of higher multipoles up to the largest $\ell$ we have computed. Our results suggest that CMB polarization measurements from upcoming experiments can provide new avenues for detecting signatures of cosmic topology, motivating a full analysis where scalar and tensor perturbations are combined and noise is included.

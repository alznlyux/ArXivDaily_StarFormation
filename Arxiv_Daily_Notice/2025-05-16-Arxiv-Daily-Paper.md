          Disentangling the Galactic centre X-ray reflection signal using XMM-Newton data

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the X-ray emission from the Galactic Centre (GC) region, focusing on the 6.4 keV fluorescent line of neutral or weakly ionised iron, which is commonly attributed to X-ray reflection from dense molecular clouds. Our goal is to separate the reflection signal from other physical X-ray components. We aim to produce a clean map of the 6.4 keV emission, thus providing a better understanding of the X-ray reflection processes in the GC. We utilised a deep mosaic of all available XMM-Newton observations, encompassing the central 40 square degrees of the Galaxy. The mosaics of two narrow bands centred at 6.7 keV and 6.4 keV, and a broader continuum band at lower energies (5-6.1 keV), provided valuable spatial and spectral information on the X-ray emission. These combined with the stellar mass distribution of our Galaxy enabled us to decompose the observed signal into physically meaningful components. Our analysis shows that the cleaned 6.4 keV band map, free from the contribution of bright and unresolved point sources, is predominantly shaped by X-ray reflection from dense molecular clouds. The spatial distribution of this emission, which strongly correlates with the molecular gas distribution in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ), supports the interpretation that this map provides the best estimate of the X-ray reflection signal averaged over the last two decades. The cleaned reflection map produced could serve as a tool for future studies to quantify upper limits on the reflection contribution from low-energy cosmic rays in unilluminated regions. Moreover, we estimate that, on average within the CMZ, approximately 65% of the ridge emission contributes to the observed 6.4 keV emission, a factor that should be incorporated into upcoming investigations of the GC, such as polarisation studies of the reflected X-ray continuum from molecular clouds.

          Beyond the Power Spectrum: A New Framework for Non-Stationary Fields with Applications to Light-Cone Effects in Line Intensity Mapping

 - **Abstract**
 Modern cosmological surveys cover extremely large volumes and map fluctuations on scales reaching gigaparsecs. As a result, it is no longer a valid assumption to ignore cosmological evolution along the line of sight from one end of the survey to the other. When extracting cosmological information, the power spectrum becomes suboptimal because it relies on the assumption of translational invariance of the observed field. For example, during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR), the 21cm brightness temperature field on the nearby (low-redshift) end of a large survey volume exhibits statistical properties that differ significantly from those at far (high-redshift) end. To overcome these limitations, we have developed a eigen decomposition-inspired non-Fourier basis that captures evolution effects. Our work demonstrates that using this new basis integrated in a new summary statistic yields tighter constraints on astrophysical parameters compared to the traditional power spectrum. Additionally, we provide an illustrative example and a practical guide for applying this basis in the context of a realistic forecast for interferometers such as the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA).

          The curvaton ACTs again

 - **Abstract**
 The latest results from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope Collaboration have moved the preferred perturbation spectral index $n_{\rm s}$ towards one. We reanalyse constraints on the simplest version of the curvaton model, using $n_{\rm s}$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. We show that in the massless curvaton case the model gives the same locus of $n_{\rm s}$-$r$ predictions as the power-law model $V(\phi) \propto \phi^p$, but with a different and more elegant physical interpretation. The model gives an excellent account of current observational data, both in the regime where the curvaton dominates the observed perturbations and with an admixture of inflaton-originated perturbations of up to about one-third of the total. Forthcoming large-scale structure surveys, such as that of the recently-launched SPHEREx probe, could discriminate between curvaton and single-field inflation models using the bispectrum.

          Monitoring the Period Variation of KR Cyg Eclipsing Binary

 - **Abstract**
 This study examines the period variation of the eclipsing binary system KR Cyg, a near-contact binary characterized by its short orbital period and significant stellar interactions. The precise orbital parameters of the system have been determined through light curve data collected periodically since 1999 and were published in our previous studies. Additionally, minimum light observations have been continuously monitored to analyze the period variation of the system. In our earlier work, the masses of the primary and secondary components were determined as $2.88\pm0.20 M_{\odot}$ and $1.26\pm 0.07 M_{\odot}$, with corresponding radii of $2.59\pm 0.06 R_{\odot}$ and $1.80\pm 0.04 R_{\odot}$. The bolometric albedo and effective temperature of the less massive star were also investigated, and deviations caused by mutual illumination effects were identified. These results provide valuable insights into the evolutionary status of KR Cyg and shed light on the dynamic processes that occur in near-contact binary systems. Using updated eclipse timings, an (O-C) diagram was constructed, revealing both long-term trends and periodic oscillations. These cyclical variations are thought to indicate the presence of a tertiary component affecting the system via the light-time effect. Additional observations and modeling are recommended to confirm the tertiary hypothesis and further refine the parameters of the system.

          The slow brightening of WNTR23bzdiq / WTP19aalzlk : Possible onset of common-envelope evolution in an asymptotic giant branch star?

 - **Abstract**
 We present WNTR23bzdiq/WTP19aalzlk, a slow eruption of an early-asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star in M31 identified by the Wide-field Infrared Transient Explorer (WINTER) near-infrared and the NEOWISE mid-infrared surveyors. This source brightened gradually over seven years: a 0.5-mag optical rise (2018-2021), a 1-mag optical outburst lasting $\sim$1000 days (2021-2023), and another 1-mag optical rebrightening in 2024. This was accompanied by a steady mid-IR brightening of 1-mag over ten years in NEOWISE data. Archival optical data show only erratic, small amplitude ($<0.3$\,mag) brightness variations from 2003 to 2015, revealing a progenitor star with T$_{\rm{eff}} \approx 3500$K and L $\approx1.6\times10^{4}$L$_{\odot}$ - consistent with a 7$\pm$2M$_{\odot}$ star in its early-AGB phase. During the eruption, the luminosity rose to $\approx5\times10^{4}$L$_{\odot}$ with slow photospheric expansion ($\approx5$km-s$^{-1}$) and constant temperatures ($\approx3600$K) inferred from the spectral energy distribution. Optical and NIR spectra of the eruption resemble late M-type stars, with a mixed-temperature behavior - transitioning from M1 in the optical to M7/M8 in the NIR. These properties of WNTR23bzdiq resemble those of stellar merger transients, particularly the giant star merger OGLE-2002-BLG-360, but on longer timescales. As such, WNTR23bzdiq potentially marks the onset of common-envelope evolution (CEE) in a binary with an AGB primary, and is possibly a member of the emerging population of infrared transients from CEE in giant stars. Continued multiwavelength monitoring, particularly mid-IR observations with JWST to quantify dust production, will shed further light on WNTR23bzdiq.

 - **Abstract**
 We present high-resolution and spatially-matched observations with JWST and ALMA of a starburst galaxy (PACS-830) at $z=1.46$. The NIRCam observations mainly trace the stellar light while the CO ($J$=5--4) observations map the dense molecular gas at kpc scales. Both datasets reveal the morphology to be that of a gas/dust rich bulge with two extending arms, together resembling a grand-design spiral galaxy. The more pronounced arm contributes 21 $\pm$ 6\% of the total CO emission. These results demonstrate that starburst activity at high redshift can be triggered, without undergoing a highly disruptive major merger. We assess the strength and distribution of star formation using two tracers: (1) Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) emission detected at $8~\mu$m ($L_8$) with a MIRI/F1800W image, and (2) $L_\mathrm{IR}$, inferred from the CO ($J$=5--4) map. The spatial profiles of the $L_\mathrm{IR}$ and $L_8$ are dissimilar, thus leading to a significant deficit of mid-IR ($L_8$) emission in the nucleus. We hypothesize that this is due to the destruction of PAH molecules by the intense ionizing radiation field or decreased emission in the photodissociation region, as seen in nearby star-forming regions and consistent with the galaxy-wide properties of distant starbursts. This study reveals spatial variations in the $L_8$ to $L_\mathrm{IR}$ ratio for the first time at $z>1$, in agreement with expectations from theory. Our analysis underscores the pivotal role of joint high-resolution observations with JWST and ALMA in discerning the different phases of the interstellar medium (ISM) and revealing internal physics in galaxy substructures.

 - **Abstract**
 This review article delves into the study of low-mass exoplanets: super-Earths, mini-Neptunes and the new categories within and between that we are starting to discover. We provide an overview of current exoplanet observational capabilities, their limitations, and what they are allowing us to learn about low-mass planets. We briefly summarize the most important aspects of planet formation, with an emphasis on processes that may be testable with small exoplanets, in particular those that affect their composition. We also describe the observed compositional diversity of low-mass exoplanets and what it teaches us about planet formation pathways. We finish this review summarizing the study of the composition of small exoplanets during the very last stage of stellar evolution, by studying white dwarfs. This review is written as the JWST is making its first contributions to small planet characterization, rapidly opening new lines of inquiry.

 - **Abstract**
 In March of 2024 the AAS formed our Graduate Admissions Task Force (GATF), asking us to produce recommendations aimed at improving the state of graduate admissions in astronomy. The task was a timely one, as the past decade has seen dramatic shifts that are currently being exacerbated by rapidly-shifting funding and policy challenges. The GATF surveyed recent applicants to astronomy graduate school and admissions leaders in degree-granting graduate programs, held in-depth conversations with select programs, and explored how other fields approach admissions. Based on this work, we have quantified recent changes in the astronomy graduate admissions landscape, addressed mismatches between perception and reality, and identified several key ways to address some of our current challenges. In this report we summarize the results of this work and the four main recommendations we believe the AAS should take to make lasting positive changes. We emphasize that the goal of our report, and the GATF's work, is not to help programs select students, or to help applicants get into graduate school. Instead, we have focused on ways to make the admissions process itself more streamlined, fair, and efficient for everyone involved.

          Velocity shift and SNR limits for high-resolution spectroscopy of hot Jupiters using Keck/KPIC

 - **Abstract**
 High-resolution cross-correlation spectroscopy (HRCCS) is a technique for detecting the atmospheres of close-in planets using the change in the projected planet velocity over a few hours. To date, this technique has most often been applied to hot Jupiters, which show a large change in velocity on short timescales. Applying this technique to planets with longer orbital periods requires an improved understanding of how the size of the velocity shift and the observational signal-to-noise ratio impact detectability. We present grids of simulated Keck/KPIC observations of hot Jupiter systems, varying the observed planet velocity shift and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), to estimate the minimum thresholds for a successful detection. These simulations realistically model the cross-correlation process, which includes a time-varying telluric spectrum in the simulated data and data detrending via PCA. We test three different planet models based on an ultra-hot Jupiter, a classical hot Jupiter, and a metal-rich hot Saturn. For a ${6}\sigma$ detection suitable for retrieval analysis, we estimate a minimum velocity shift of $\Delta v_\text{pl} \sim {30, 50, 60}$ km/s, compared to an instrumental resolution of 9 km/s, and minimum SNR $\sim 370, 800, 1200$ for the respective planet models. We find that reported KPIC detections to-date fall above or near the ${6}\sigma$ limit. These simulations can be efficiently re-run for other planet models and observational parameters, which can be useful in observation planning and detection validation.

 - **Abstract**
 We constrain the evolution of dark matter energy density over time, specifically focusing on deviation from the standard model represented by the equation $\rho_{m}\propto(1+z)^{3-\varepsilon}$, where $\varepsilon$ is a constant parameter. Utilizing a diverse array of observational datasets, including baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) data from the first release of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), distance priors derived from cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations by the Planck satellite, Hubble rate data obtained through the cosmic chronometers (CC) method, type Ia supernova (SNIa) data from the Panthon sample, and the data from the redshift space distortion (RSD) measurements ($f\sigma_8$), we derive stringent constraints on the deviation parameter. We find that for the model under consideration, the deviation parameter is constrained to be $\varepsilon = -0.0073^{+0.0029}_{-0.0033}$, indicating a deviation of approximately $2.4\sigma$ from the scenario where dark matter and vacuum dark energy do not interact. When compared with previous studies and alternative analyses, our findings provide corroborative evidence for an interaction between dark matter and vacuum dark energy, particularly in light of the release of BAO data from DESI.

 - **Abstract**
 The interplay between radiation chemistry and sublimation dynamics of condensed organic compounds on cold grains is fundamental to describe observed gas-phase and ice-phase molecular abundances in the ISM. Infrared measurements are generally used to identify molecules synthesized in irradiated ices in lab experiments, while mass spectrometric techniques have been used to monitor the products following temperature programmed desorption. The IR measurements are often used quantitatively to monitor chemical transformation of ices during the course of irradiation, but the gas phase methods applied with TPD generally do not permit quantitative branching determination. Here we combine reflection-absorption infrared spectroscopy (RAIRS) of ices with broadband rotational spectroscopy of the sublimed products, to study the branching of photoproducts produced by the VUV irradiation of condensed CH3CN and CH3CH2CN ices. This permits direct comparison between the ice-phase and gas-phase branching following temperature programmed desorption. This comparison is analogous to astronomical observations of ices in protostellar disks such as by the James Webb Space Telescope employed in conjunction with ALMA observations in the corresponding warm-up regions of the same objects. In the condensed CH3CN VUV processed ices we quantified the HCN, CH3NC, CH2CCNH, CH3NH2, and CH4 abundances. The CH3CH2CN ices also readily produced the corresponding isocyanide and HCN in addition to a significant yield of CH2CHCN. The ethyl cyanide ice produced CH3CHNH rather than CH3NH2 and no CH4 formation was observed. In the gas phase we detected the isocyanides, HCN and vinyl cyanide. The ice and gas phase relative abundances could be brought into agreement if the unknown IR band strength of the isocyanides C-N stretch is assumed to be ~3 times larger than that of the cyanides.

 - **Abstract**
 To understand physical processes such as mass transfer and binary evolution in X-ray binaries, the orbital parameters of the system are fundamental and crucial information. Cygnus X-3 is a high-mass X-ray binary composed of a compact object of unknown nature and a Wolf-Rayet star, which is of great interest in the context of wind-fed mass accretion and binary evolution. Here we present XRISM/Resolve high-resolution spectroscopy focusing on the Fe Ly$\alpha$ lines in its hypersoft state. We perform an orbital phase-resolved spectral analysis of the lines to study the orbital modulation of the emission and absorption lines. It is found that the emission lines reflect the orbital motion of the compact object whose estimated velocity amplitude is $430^{~~+150}_{~~-140}~~\mathrm{km\,s^{~-1}}$, while the absorption lines show a variation that can be interpreted as originating from the stellar wind. We discuss possible mass ranges for the binary components using the mass function with the estimated value of the velocity amplitude in this work, combined with the relation between the mass loss rate and the orbital period derivative and the empirical mass and mass loss rate relation for Galactic Wolf-Rayet stars. They are constrained to be $(1.3\text{-}5.1)\,M_\odot$ and $(9.3\text{-}12)\,M_\odot$ for the assumed inclination angle of $i = 25$ deg, which becomes more relaxed to $(1.3\text{-}24)\,M_\odot$ and $(9.3\text{-}16)\,M_\odot$ for $i = 35$ deg, respectively. Thus, it remains unclear whether the system harbors a black hole or a neutron star.

          Probing the Dynamics of Gaussian Dark Energy Equation of State Using DESI BAO

 - **Abstract**
 We present an updated reconstruction of the various dark energy equation of state (EoS), $w(a)$, employing the newly released DESI DR2 Baryon Acoustic Oscillation data. This analysis constrains the cosmological scenarios influenced by these equations through the joint examination of a range of recently available cosmological probes, specifically the Pantheon+ sample and the DESY5 sample of Type Ia Supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, Hubble parameter measurements derived from cosmic chronometers, and cosmic microwave background distance priors based on the Planck 2018 data. Furthermore, we provide a concise perspective on the dynamical evolution of all models and the interrelations among them. A Bayesian inference procedure is adopted to estimate the model parameters that yield the best fit to the data. The EoS remains within the phantom regime at higher redshifts, while favoring the quintessence regime in the current epoch. In this context, we propose a new Gaussian form EoS, termed BellDE, which avoids phantom behavior (\(w \geq -1\)) at higher redshifts while remaining precisely calibrated at lower redshifts. Interestingly, BellDE exhibits a transient phantom nature (\(w < -1\)) only around the transition redshift \(z \sim 0.5\), subsequently evolving into a quintessential regime (\(w > -1\)), as indicated by comparisons with the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) and other parameterized EoS forms.

 - **Abstract**
 High-resolution spectroscopy (R > 25,000) has opened new opportunities to characterize exoplanet atmospheres from the ground. By resolving individual lines in planetary emission and transmission spectra, one can sensitively probe the chemical inventory and temperature structure of exoplanets. However, a significant challenge to reliable and reproducible atmospheric inferences from high-resolution datasets has been the lack of open source codes for high-resolution retrievals. Here, we present a unified high-resolution retrieval framework, for both emission and transmission spectroscopy, made publicly available within the open source POSEIDON retrieval code. Our high-resolution retrieval framework is fast (typically < 12 hours), accessible (no GPUs required), and well-documented via Python notebooks. We validate our framework by reproducing previous emission retrievals of the hot Jupiter WASP-77Ab and transmission retrievals of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-121b. Our results are broadly consistent with those of published works when making the same data detrending assumptions, but we demonstrate that user choices can subtly propagate into retrieved chemical abundances.

          Resonance Capture of a Test Particle by an Eccentric Planet in the Presence of Externally-Driven Apsidal Precession

 - **Abstract**
 Planets undergoing convergent migration can be captured into mean-motion resonance (MMR), in which the planets' periods are related by integer ratios. The dynamics of MMR are typically considered in isolation, including only the forces between the planets and with the central star. However, the planets are often subjected to external forces that induce apsidal precessions, which may split the MMR into two sub-resonances and give rise to chaotic motion due to resonance overlap. In this study, we investigate how such externally induced differential apsidal precession affects capture into first-order $j:j+1$ MMRs. We study the restricted three-body problem for a test particle outside of an eccentric planet, with the planet undergoing outward migration. We find that capture can be sensitive to the differential apsidal precession, even when the precession rate is much smaller than the resonance overlap criterion. We identify two critical precession frequencies -- related to resonance overlap and secular apsidal resonance -- around which capture is disrupted even for very small planet eccentricity. Our results may help clarify the capture process of resonant trans-Neptunian objects by outward-migrating Neptune in early Solar System.

 - **Abstract**
 Dark matter (DM) remains one of the most significant open questions in modern physics, with its nature and interactions largely unexplored. In this study, we investigate the behavior of massive fermionic DM particles in the context of neutron stars (NSs), extending prior studies which focused on the bosonic DM. By incorporating the motion of NSs in the Galaxy and considering scenarios with and without DM self-annihilation, we demonstrate their impact on the DM capture rate and the accumulation process inside NSs. Observational data from pulsars in the Milky Way are used to place constraints on DM properties, including the mass and the DM-nucleon scattering cross-section, offering a more comprehensive picture in probing DM interactions in astrophysical environments.

          A new approach for predicting the stability of hierarchical triple systems -- I. Coplanar Cases

 - **Abstract**
 Hierarchical triple systems play a crucial role in various astrophysical contexts, and therefore the understanding of their stability is important. Traditional empirical stability criteria rely on a threshold value of $Q$, the ratio between the outer orbit's pericenter distance and the inner orbit's semi-major axis. However, determining a single critical value of $Q$ is impossible because there is a range of the value of $Q$ for which both stable and unstable systems exist, referred to as the mixed-region. In this study, we introduce a novel method to assess the stability of triple systems within this mixed-region. We numerically integrate equal-mass, coplanar hierarchical triples within the mixed-region. By performing Fourier analysis of the time evolution of the semi-major axes ratio during the first 1000 inner orbital periods of the systems, we find notable features in stable systems: if the main peaks are periodically spaced in the frequency domain and the continuous components and irregularly spaced peaks are small, the system tends to be stable. This observation indicates that the evolution of stable triples is more periodic than that of unstable ones. We quantified the periodicity of the triples and investigated the correlation between the Fourier power distribution and the system's lifetime. Using this correlation, we show that it is possible to determine if a triple system in the mixed-region is stable or not with very high accuracy. These findings suggest that periodicity in orbital evolution can serve as a robust indicator of stability for hierarchical triples.

 - **Abstract**
 Neptune-sized exoplanets are key targets for atmospheric studies, yet their formation and evolution remain poorly understood due to their diverse characteristics and limited sample size. The so-called "Neptune desert", a region of parameter space with a dearth of short-period sub- to super-Neptunes, is a critical testbed for theories of atmospheric escape and migration. The HONEI program aims to confirm and characterize the best Neptune-sized candidates for composition, atmospheric and population studies. By measuring planetary masses with high precision, we want to provide the community with optimal targets whose atmosphere can be effectively explored with the JWST or by ground-based high-resolution spectroscopy. For this purpose, we started a radial velocity follow-up campaign, using the twin high-precision spectrographs HARPS and HARPS-N, to measure the masses of TESS Neptune-sized candidates and confirm their planetary nature. In this first paper of the series, we confirm the planetary nature of two candidates: TOI-5800b and TOI-5817b. TOI-5800b is a hot sub-Neptune ($R_p=2.44\pm0.29$ $R_\oplus$, $M_p=9.4\pm1.8$ $M_\oplus$, $T_{eq} = 1108\pm20$ K) located at the lower edges of the Neptune desert ($P=2.628$ days) and is the most eccentric planet ($e\sim0.3$) ever found within $P<3$ d. TOI-5800b is expected to be still in the tidal migration phase with its parent star, a K3 V dwarf ($V=9.6$ mag), although its eccentricity could arise from interactions with another object in the system. Having a high-transmission spectroscopy metric ($TSM\sim103$), it represents a prime target for future atmospheric characterization. TOI-5817b is a relatively hot sub-Neptune ($R_p=3.08\pm0.14$ $R_\oplus$, $M_p=10.3\pm1.4$ $M_\oplus$, $T_{eq}=950\pm21$ K) located in the Neptune savanna ($P=15.610$ d) [...]

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate nonradial $f$-mode oscillations of protoneutron stars in full general relativity, employing equations of state described by the Brueckner-Hartree-Fock theory or the relativistic mean field model, while assuming isentropy and fixed lepton fractions for the internal structure. The validity of various universal relations for cold neutron stars involving $f$-mode characteristics and macroscopic properties of the star is confirmed for those isentropic protoneutron stars. Prospects of observations are also discussed. According to simulation results, we then model details of the thermal and trapping profiles in a PNS with the canonical mass. The corresponding $f$-mode frequencies and gravitational-wave strain amplitudes are presented. The validity of the universal relations during the evolution to the formation of a cold neutron star is confirmed.

 Lunar mean-motion resonances (MMRs) significantly shape cislunar dynamics beyond GEO, forming stable-unstable orbit pairs with corresponding intermingled chaotic and regular regions. The resonance zone is rigorously defined using the separatrix of unstable resonant periodic orbits surrounding stable quasi-periodic regions. Our study leverages the planar, circular, restricted three-body problem (PCR3BP) to estimate the (stable) resonance widths and (unstable) chaotic resonance zones of influence of the 2:1 and 3:1 MMRs across various Jacobi constants, employing a Poincaré map at perigee and presenting findings in easily interpretable geocentric orbital elements. An analysis of the semi-major axis versus eccentricity plane reveals broader regions of resonance influence than those predicted by semi-analytical models based on the perturbed Kepler problem. A comparison with high-fidelity 3-dimensional ephemeris propagation of several spacecraft - TESS, IBEX, and Spektr-R - in these regions is made, which shows good agreement with the simplified CR3BP model.

 - **Abstract**
 The recent detections of bright optical/infrared kilonova signals following two long-duration gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs), GRB 211211A and GRB 230307A, have significantly challenged the traditional classification of GRBs. These merger-driven LGRBs may represent a distinct GRB population. Since traditional GRB classification methods often struggle to distinguish merger-driven LGRBs from traditional merger-driven short-duration GRBs resulting from compact object mergers and collapse-driven LGRBs produced by massive stars, this work aims to explore the shared properties in terms of hardness, energy, and duration among currently observed merger-driven LGRB events, thereby identifying their observed differences from the traditional GRB population. We collect a sample of merger-driven LGRBs with known redshifts, including observed information on their main emission (ME) and whole emission (WE) phases. Treating ME and WE properties as two independent sets of information, we apply several GRB classification methodologies to explore their potential shared properties. Using the phenomenologically defined Energy-Hardness (EH) parameter, we identify a probable universal linear correlation across merger-driven LGRBs, regardless of whether their ME or WE phases are considered. We propose that such shared properties of merger-driven LGRBs are unlikely to arise from the low-redshift selection effect and they become particularly intriguing when compared with the relatively weak correlations or lack of correlation observed in traditional merger-driven short-duration GRBs (with or without extended emissions) and collapse-driven LGRBs. Our newly proposed correlation highlights the necessity for further investigation into the observations of merger-driven LGRBs and the physical mechanisms underlying the empirical correlation.

 - **Abstract**
 Numerical simulations predict that clumps ($\sim$1 pc) should form stars at high efficiency to produce bound star clusters. We conducted a statistical study of 17 nearby cluster-forming clumps to examine the star formation rate and gas mass surface density relations (i.e. $\Sigma_{\rm{SFR}}$ vs. $\Sigma_{\rm{gas}}$) at the clump scale. Using near-infrared point sources and Herschel dust continuum analysis, we obtained the radius, age, and stellar mass for most clusters in the ranges 0.5$-$1.6 pc, 0.5$-$1.5 Myr, 40$-$500 M$_\odot$, respectively, and also found that they are associated with $\Sigma_{\rm{gas}}$ values ranging from 80$-$600 M$_\odot$ pc$^{-2}$. We obtained the best-fit scaling relations as $\Sigma_{\rm{SFR}}$ $\propto$ $\Sigma_{\rm{gas}}^{1.46}$ and $\Sigma_{\rm{SFR}}$ $\propto$ $(\Sigma_{\rm{gas}}/t_{\rm{ff}})^{0.80}$ for the studied sample of clumps. Comparing our results with existing scaling relations at cloud and extragalactic scales, we found that while the power-law exponent obtained in this work is similar to those found at these scales, the star formation rate surface densities are relatively higher for similar gas mass surface densities. From this work, we obtained instantaneous median star formation efficiency (SFE) and efficiency per free-fall time ($\epsilon_{\rm{ff}}$) of $\sim$20% and $\sim$13%, respectively, for the studied clumps. We discuss the cause of the obtained high SFE and $\epsilon_{\rm{ff}}$ in the studied clumps and also discuss the results in the context of bound cluster formation within molecular clouds. We conclude that our results do not favour a universal scaling law with a constant value of $\epsilon_{\rm{ff}}$ in star-forming systems across different scales.

 - **Abstract**
 Very massive stars (VMS) play a fundamental role in astrophysics due to their winds and supernovae (SN), and their role as massive black hole (BH) progenitors. However, their origin and evolution remain a significant challenge. Recent theoretical work and observations suggest that VMS approaching the Eddington limit may experience mass loss above the standard wind predictions. This study investigates how enhanced winds influence single and binary VMS evolution, observable properties, and resulting BH populations. New stellar wind prescriptions, sensitive to the Eddington parameter ($\Gamma_e$) and the luminosity-to-mass ratio, were implemented into the stellar evolution code PARSEC v2.0. These updated single-star tracks (100 - 600 M$_{\odot}$ at Z=0.006) were used to model the VMS population in the Tarantula Nebula and integrated into the SEVN binary evolution code. The $\Gamma_e$-enhanced single-star tracks match observed VMS properties better than standard models. Explaining the most massive star, R136a1, through a single-star origin suggests a zero-age main sequence (ZAMS) mass limit of $<$ 400 M$_{\odot}$ regardless of the wind recipe used. However, binary stellar mergers also offer a suitable origin for R136a1 and other observed VMS, potentially lowering the upper ZAMS mass limit by ~100 M$_{\odot}$. In binaries, enhanced winds inhibit main-sequence stellar mergers and limit BH production above the pair-instability mass gap's lower edge (~50 M$_{\odot}$). Binary BHs merging in a Hubble time with enhanced winds yield more primary BHs above 30 M$_{\odot}$ and enable secondary BHs between 30-40 solar masses, a range not found with standard stellar winds at LMC metallicity. This study highlights the crucial role that stellar winds and binary interactions play in VMS evolution and offers predictions relevant for interpreting VMS observations and gravitational wave source origins.

 - **Abstract**
 The fundamental plane (FP) relation connects gamma-ray luminosity to intrinsic pulsar properties, offering the potential to estimate distances for radio-quiet (RQ) gamma-ray pulsars, where direct measurements are often unavailable. The Fermi Third Pulsar Catalog presents spectral data for 294 gamma-ray pulsars, including 72 RQ pulsars, of which only 9 have known distances. This study investigates the FP relation's potential to predict distances for RQ gamma-ray pulsars using machine learning (ML) approaches. Ordinary least-squares regression was employed alongside ML methods, including random forest and support vector regression, to predict RQ gamma-ray pulsar distances. To ensure robustness, the analysis considered spectral cutoff significance and outlier data. Results confirm that the FP relation is valid only for pulsars exhibiting significant gamma-ray cutoffs, with FP exponents closely matching theoretical expectations. It was shown that gamma-ray emission origins significantly favor the curvature radiation regime over the synchrotron regime at the 4.2 sigma level. The distances for 62 RQ pulsars, for which no traditional measurements exist, are predicted for the first time. The luminosity and spatial distributions of the considered RQ pulsar population match known pulsar distributions. Predictions for RQ pulsars with known distances are consistent with measured data. This study provides a proof of principle that the FP relation, combined with ML methods, is a promising tool for distance estimation in RQ gamma-ray pulsars, using gamma-ray emission directly for the first time in pulsar distance estimates. Future improvements can be achieved with larger data sets, precise spectral cutoff determinations, and corrections for key factors like the beaming factor.

 - **Abstract**
 Correlated time-of-arrival measurements by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) have provided a new means of constraining astrophysical or cosmological models that produce a gravitational wave (GW) background. For this work, we discuss the implications of PTA observations for Gauss-Bonnet (GB) inflationary models through the production and propagation of inflationary GWs. We show that our GB inflationary scenario is consistent with present PTA and cosmological data. A blue-tilted tensor power spectrum supported by PTAs can be naturally accommodated in GB inflation. Using observational constraints, we derive general conditions for the inflaton potential and the GB coupling function, suggesting that in GB inflation, the inflaton must climb up the potential before rolling downhill and reaching the end of inflation. We provide two concrete GB inflationary models to demonstrate the viability of this mechanism.

 - **Abstract**
 The Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) has recently reported updated measurements of the scalar spectral index $n_s$, which exhibit tension with predictions from many conventional inflationary models when combined with other observational data. In this work, we adopt a parameterization of the spectral index of the form $n_s = 1 - p/(N + \alpha)$ and reconstruct an inflationary potential that is consistent with the latest ACT data. The resulting potential takes the form of an inverse-power plateau, $V(\phi)=V_0[1-(M/\phi)^n]$, where the power index is given $n = 2(p-1)/(2-p)$. To match ACT constraints, $n$ can be chosen as $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$, or $5$. The corresponding tensor-to-scalar ratio is $r \approx 16(p-1)/[C (N+\alpha)^p]$ with $C= 2^{2p-1} \left[\sqrt{p-1}/(2-p)\right]^{2p-2} /M^{2p-2}$. The reconstructed potential corresponds to the form of the Polynomial $\alpha$-attractor potential. Since the reconstruction is model-independent, any inflationary model yielding predictions of the form $n_s = 1 - p/(N + \alpha)$ and satisfying observational constraints will exhibit a potential profile at the slow-roll region closely resembling that of the Polynomial $\alpha$-attractor.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent pulsar timing array (PTA) observations have reported evidence of a gravitational wave background (GWB). If supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are indeed the primary source of this signal, future PTA observations, such as those from the Square Kilometer Array (SKA), are expected to simultaneously capture multiple continuous gravitational waves (CGWs) emitted by bright individual SMBH binaries alongside a gravitational wave background (GWB). To address this anticipated scenario in the SKA era, we revisit the F-statistic, a detection method for single source signals in PTA datasets, and introduce a new modeling that accounts for unresolved GWs as a stochastic GWB. Here, we applied this improved F-statistic to the mock datasets that include both CGW and GWB and evaluated how accurately F-statistic can identify the parameters of CGW. As a result, we demonstrate that our approach can successfully improve the estimation of the sky position and the amplitude of CGW, particularly when the GWB is dominant over white noise. This work serves as an initial step toward developing an efficient and robust algorithm based on the F-statistic for future PTA observations.

 Precise and accurate estimation of cosmological parameters is crucial for understanding the Universe's dynamics and addressing cosmological tensions. In this methods paper, we explore bio-inspired metaheuristic algorithms, including the Improved Multi-Operator Differential Evolution scheme and the Philippine Eagle Optimization Algorithm (PEOA), alongside the relatively known genetic algorithm, for cosmological parameter estimation. Using mock data that underlay a true fiducial cosmology, we test the viability of each optimization method to recover the input cosmological parameters with confidence regions generated by bootstrapping on top of optimization. We compare the results with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) in terms of accuracy and precision, and show that PEOA performs comparably well under the specific circumstances provided. Understandably, Bayesian inference and optimization serve distinct purposes, but comparing them highlights the potential of nature-inspired algorithms in cosmological analysis, offering alternative pathways to explore parameter spaces and validate standard results.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding exoplanet interiors is crucial for interpreting atmospheric observations and constraining their evolution and formation. However, due to limited observational constraints, interiors structures remain poorly understood. In this work, we investigate how new observational constraints, such as the Love number and atmospheric metallicity, improve our ability to characterize the interiors of hot Jupiters, planets for which Love number measurements are most feasible. We assess the precision required in Love number measurements to derive interior properties using both a simple two-layer homogeneous model and a more complex dilute core model. To account for observational uncertainties, we implement a retrieval framework. Our results show that accurately constraining core mass and bulk metallicity requires a high-precision Love number measurement, better than 40% for a homogeneous model and 15% for a dilute core model, along with an atmospheric metallicity measurement. We apply our retrieval framework to five planets with observed Love numbers, of which only WASP-19Ab has both an atmospheric metallicity constraint and a highly precise Love number measurement, with a precision of 12%. For this flagship planet, both models confirm the presence of a core, although we cannot yet distinguish between a compact core or diluted core. With the homogeneous model, we find a core mass fraction of $0.21^{+0.05}_{-0.04}$, corresponding to $79^{+21}_{-18}$ $M_\mathrm{earth}$. Upcoming JWST observations are expected to provide high-precision Love number measurements and precise atmospheric data, offering new insights into the structure and composition of gas giant interiors.

 - **Abstract**
 Early-type stars are key drivers of Galactic chemical evolution, enriching the interstellar medium with alpha elements through powerful stellar winds and core-collapse supernovae, fueled by their short lifetimes and high masses. However, their spectra remain challenging to analyse due to rapid rotation, weak metal lines, and non-LTE effects. While large spectroscopic surveys provide extensive low-resolution data, extracting reliable parameters remains difficult due to methodological limitations for hot stars. Our goal is to develop a unified framework combining data-driven and synthetic spectral approaches to determine atmospheric parameters and abundances for hot stars using low-resolution spectra, addressing limitations in current methodologies while retaining critical spectral information. We present a hybrid approach integrating the Stellar LAbel Machine (SLAM) and the Payne frameworks, for low-resolution ($R\sim 1800$) spectra from LAMOST DR9. Our method preserves full spectral information including Balmer series and metal-line blends, employing neural-network interpolation for efficient parameter estimation ($T_\mathrm{eff}$, $\log g$, and $v\sin i$) and abundance determination for O, Mg, Si, and Fe, across 8000 - 20000 K. We derive stellar parameters and abundances for 315,822 stars with $\mathrm{SNR} \geqslant 10$ in the $r$-band. Additionally, we detect abundance trends ([$\alpha$/Fe]-[Fe/H]) that exhibit temperature-dependent systematics and a distinct $\alpha$-poor stellar population within $0.0 \leqslant \mathrm{[Fe/H]} \leqslant 0.5$ dex. The radial abundance gradients are negative and consistent with that derived from Cepheids, with a slope of $-0.070\pm0.007$ in \feh in the region $6 \leqslant R_\mathrm{GC}\leqslant 15$ kpc.

 - **Abstract**
 In the context of a new systematic study of the properties of the most compact and massive star clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), here we present the determination of the chronological age, the structural parameters, and the dynamical age of NGC 1754. We used high-resolution images taken with the WFC3/HST instrument, both in optical and near-ultraviolet filters. The high quality of the images made it possible to construct the star density profile from resolved star counts, and to fit the observed profile with an appropriate King model to obtain the structural parameters (e.g. core, half-mass, and tidal radii). Our findings confirm that NGC 1754 is a very compact globular cluster with a core radius of only 0.84 pc. The analysis of the same dataset allowed us to confirm a very old age ($t=12.8\pm0.4$ Gyr) for this system, thus further consolidating the indication that the process of globular cluster formation started at the same cosmic time both in the LMC and in the Milky Way, independently of the characteristics of the host environment. We have also used the empirical method called ``dynamical clock'' to estimate the dynamical age of the system. This consists of quantifying the degree of central segregation of blue straggler stars (BSSs) using the $A^+_{rh}$ parameter, which is defined as the area enclosed between the cumulative radial distribution of BSSs and that of a reference (lighter) population. This method yielded a value of $A^+_{rh}=0.31\pm0.07$, which is the highest measured so far for LMC clusters, pointing to an advanced dynamical age for the cluster, possibly on the verge of core collapse. The results presented here for NGC 1754 confirm that the natural dynamical evolution of globular clusters plays a role in shaping the age-core radius distributions observed in the LMC.

 Though missions such as Kepler, K2, and TESS have discovered $>$2,000 sub-Neptune and Neptunian planets, there is a dearth of such planets at close-in (P$\lesssim$3 days) orbits. This feature, called the Neptune desert or the evaporation desert, is believed to be primarily shaped by planetary migration and photoevaporation. However, this region is not completely devoid of planets--a small number of very hot Neptunes reside within the desert. These planets provide an opportunity to directly probe the effects of migration and photoevaporation. We present confirmation of TOI-5800 b, an eccentric sub-Neptune on a $\approx$2.6 day period that is likely actively undergoing tidal migration. We use radial velocity measurements from the Carnegie Planet Finder Spectrograph (PFS) to constrain TOI-5800 b's mass and eccentricity. We find that it has an unusually high eccentricity (0.39$\pm$0.07) for its short orbit. TOI-5800 is therefore currently experiencing high levels of tidal heating as it moves into the desert. Ranked as a top candidate for transmission and emission spectroscopy within its temperature and radius regime, TOI-5800 b is a prime target for atmospheric characterization with JWST. TOI-5800 b presents a unique opportunity to study the atmosphere of a planet undergoing tidal heating and to probe the composition of sub-Neptune planets.

 Recent analyses on the properties of the central compact object in the HESS J1731-347 remnant and the PSR J1231-1411 pulsar indicated that these two compact objects are characterized by similar (low) masses and possibly different radii. This paper aims at reconciling the aforementioned measurements by utilizing the widely employed color-flavor locked (CFL) MIT bag model. The main objective is related to the examination of the acceptable values for the color superconducting gap $\Delta$ and the bag parameter $B$. Furthermore, our analysis involves two distinct hypotheses for the nature of compact stars. Firstly, we considered the case of absolute stability for strange quark matter and we found that it is possible to explain both measurements, while also respecting the latest astronomical constraints on the masses and radii of compact stars. Secondly, we studied the case of hybrid stellar matter (transition from hadrons to quarks), and concluded that, when early phase transitions are considered, the simultaneous reconciliation of both measurements leads to results that are inconsistent to the existence of massive compact stars. However, we showed that all current constraints may be satisfied under the consideration that the HESS J1731-347 remnant contains a slow stable hybrid star.

 - **Abstract**
 The rotational evolution of stars is still an open question of stellar physics because of the numerous phenomena that can contribute to the distribution of angular momentum. This paper aims at determining the time scale over which a rotating early-type star relaxes to a steady baroclinic state or, equivalently, in which case its nuclear evolution is slow enough to let the evolution of the star be modelled by a series of quasi-steady states. We investigate the damping time scale of baroclinic and viscous eigenmodes that are potentially excited by the continuous forcing of nuclear evolution. We first investigate this problem with a spherical Boussinesq model. Since much of the dynamics is concentrated in the radiative envelope of the star, we then improve the realism of the modelling by using a polytropic model of the envelope that takes into account a realistic density profile. The polytropic model of the envelope underlines the key role of the region at the core-envelope interface. The results of evolutionary models recently obtained with two-dimensional axisymmetric ESTER models turn out to be a consequence of the slow damping of viscous modes. Using a vanishing Prandtl number appears to be too strong an approximation to explain the dynamics of the models. Baroclinic modes previously thought as good candidates of this relaxation process turn out to be too quickly damped. The dynamical response of rotating stars to the slow forcing of its nuclear evolution appears as a complex combination of non-oscillating eigenmodes. Simple Boussinesq approach are not realistic enough to explain this reality. The present work underlines the key role of layers near the core-envelope interface in an early-type star and also the key role of any angular momentum transport mechanism, here played by viscosity, for early-type stars to reach critical rotation, presumably associated with the Be phenomenon.

 - **Abstract**
 The rotation period of a star is an important quantity that provides insight into its structure and state. For stars with surface features like starspots, their periods can be inferred from brightness variations as these features move across the stellar surface. TESS, with its all-sky coverage, is providing the largest sample of stars for obtaining rotation periods. However, most of the periods have been limited to shorter than the 13.7-day TESS orbital period due to strong background signals (e.g., scattered light) on those timescales. In this study, we investigated the viability of measuring longer periods (> 10 days) from TESS light curves for stars in the Northern Continuous Viewing Zone (NCVZ). We first created a reference set of 272 period measurements longer than 10 days for K & M dwarfs in the NCVZ using data from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) that we consider as the "ground truth" given ZTF's long temporal baseline of 6+ years. We then used the unpopular pipeline to de-trend TESS light curves and implemented a modified Lomb-Scargle (LS) periodogram that accounts for flux offsets between observing sectors. For 179 out of the 272 sources (66%), the TESS-derived periods match the ZTF-derived periods to within 10%. The match rate increases to 81% (137 out of 170) when restricting to sources with a TESS LS power that exceeds a threshold. Our results confirm the capability of measuring periods longer than 10 days from TESS data, highlighting the dataset's potential for studying slow rotators.

 - **Abstract**
 Mitigating risks posed by solar energetic particles (SEPs) to operations and exploration in space and Earth's atmosphere motivates the development of advanced, synergistic approaches for monitoring, modeling, and analyzing space weather conditions. The consequences of SEPs and their interactions with the near-Earth space environment are numerous, including elevated radiation levels at aviation altitudes during major events, satellite damage, and health risks to astronauts, resulting in economic impacts and potential hazards for space exploration. This contribution will present a high-level overview of the operational requirements and research capabilities for SEP event environment monitoring and forecasting that were highlighted during a workshop at Georgia State University, held on October 16-19, 2024. Specifically, it summarizes the presented activities concerning the following: (1) Identifying needs for SEP event forecasting and nowcasting, including practical forecast timeframes; (2) Reviewing availability and coverage of the current observational data and identifying tangible data resources for research, operations and the R2O2R loop; (3) Mapping existing forecast capabilities and identifying meaningful modeling advances for research and operations.

 - **Abstract**
 With the goal of searching for very low modulation amplitudes among fundamental mode RR Lyrae stars and assess their incidence rate, we performed a survey of 36 stars observed by the Kepler satellite during the entire four-year period of its mission. The search was conducted by a task-oriented code, designed to find low-amplitude signals in the presence of high-amplitude components and instrumental systematics. We found 7 new modulated stars and negate one earlier claimed star, whereby increasing the number of known Blazhko stars from 17 to 24 and yielding an observed occurrence rate of 67% for the Kepler field. Six of the new stars have the lowest modulation amplitudes found so far, with ~250 ppm Fourier side-lobe amplitudes near the fundamental mode frequency. Because of the small sample size in the Kepler field, we extended the survey to 12 campaign fields observed by K2, the ``two-wheeled'' mission of Kepler. From the 1061 stars we found 514 Blazhko stars. After correcting for the short duration of the time spent on each field, and for the noise dependence of the detections, we arrived at an underlying occurrence rate of ~75% - likely a lower limit for the true rate of Blazhko stars in the K2 fields.

 - **Abstract**
 Near infrared (NIR) 0.9--2.5$\mu$m spectra of the remarkable recurrent nova M31N 2008-12a were obtained on days 6.3 and 10.3 after discovery of its 2024 outburst, and are the first NIR spectra of this object. The only prominent line seen in the spectra is that of HeI 1.083$\mu$m, on day 6.3. Apart from this HeI line, there are only two other weak emission features: one at 1.0786$\mu$m, suggested to be the [FeXIII] 1.075$\mu$m coronal line, and one unidentified feature at 1.0969$\mu$m. The observed full width at half maximum of the HeI line on day 6.3 (1350 km s$^{-1}$) is consistent with the behaviour of optical HeI lines during earlier eruptions of this RN, which show that the nova ejecta decelerate as they interact with the secondary's wind. The HeI 1.083$\mu$m line faded rapidly, and was absent in the day 10.3 spectrum, along with any other emission lines. We use the relative strengths of optical He and H lines in previous eruptions to estimate the expected strengths of the HeI 1.083$\mu$m line and of other infrared (including coronal) lines at 6.3 days after eruption. Our findings are consistent with the infrared spectra we observed during the 2024 eruption. We apply our analysis to account for the relative weakness of NIR coronal emission in known Galactic recurrent novae with giant secondaries.

 - **Abstract**
 Genetic algorithm (GA) belongs to a class of nature-inspired evolutionary algorithms that leverage concepts from natural selection to perform optimization tasks. In cosmology, the standard method for estimating parameters is the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach, renowned for its reliability in determining cosmological parameters. This paper presents a pedagogical examination of GA as a potential corroborative tool to MCMC for cosmological parameter estimation. Utilizing data sets from cosmic chronometers and supernovae with a curved $\Lambda$CDM model, we explore the impact of GA's key hyperparameters -- such as the fitness function, crossover rate, and mutation rate -- on the population of cosmological parameters determined by the evolutionary process. We compare the results obtained with GA to those by MCMC, analyzing their effectiveness and viability for cosmological application.

 - **Abstract**
 Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are mysterious millisecond-duration radio transients from the distant universe. Some of them repeat, while others do not. In order to explore their origin, periodic examinations have been conducted on repeating FRBs. Most of them show irregular properties, including burst rate, dispersion measure (DM), and rotation measure (RM). A notable exception is FRB~20180916B, which shows a significant 16-day periodic burst rate. Possible periodic activities have also been reported in FRB~20121102A and FRB~20240209A. However, periodic studies of other properties are sparse. FRB~20220529 was monitored by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) for nearly three years, enabling periodic examinations of its properties. Here we report a possible period of $\sim 200$ days in the RM evolution, with a significance of 4.2 $\sigma$ estimated via the Lomb-Scargle algorithm and 3.5 $\sigma$ with a phase-folding method. The burst rate was also examined for periodicity. This is consistent with the binary origin indicated by the significant RM increase and its prompt recovery.

          The Relationship between the Kinematics of Coronal Mass Ejections and the Brightness of the Corona

 - **Abstract**
 We present an investigation into an apparent relationship between white-light coronal brightness and the kinematics of flare-associated CMEs. Using a unique dataset known as the LASCO Coronal Brightness Index (CBI), we conduct a study that explores the brightness in the lower solar corona and its relationship to the velocity of flare-associated coronal mass ejections (CMEs). We analyze all M- and X-class flares that take place on or near the limbs of the Earth-facing disk of the Sun between 1996 and 2022, determine if these flares are associated with CMEs, and record the projection-corrected velocity of the eruptions if they occurred. Using the CBI dataset, we evaluate the brightness in the corona directly overlying the flare source locations between 2.4 and 6.2 solar radii, and find that above a certain level of coronal brightness, the likelihood of a high-velocity CME significantly decreases. This result implies coronal brightness could be an important indicator of the kinematics of solar CMEs. We also highlight and discuss the unique nature of Active Region (AR) 12192 in 2014, observing that its unprecedented overlying coronal brightness may be related to the low CME productivity of that region.

          ACT-ing on inflation: Implications of non Bunch-Davies initial condition and reheating on single-field slow roll models

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate a class of slow roll inflationary models in the light of the recent Cosmic Microwave Background constraints from Planck 2018, ACT DR6, DESI DR1, and BICEP/\textit{Keck} 2018. The combined dataset favors a higher value of the scalar spectral index $n_{_\mathrm{S}}=0.9743 \pm 0.0034$, which places increased pressure on several conventional inflationary scenarios. In this study, we analyze the observational viability of various well-motivated models, including the $\alpha$-attractor E- and T-models, chaotic inflation, hilltop inflation, and natural inflation. We incorporate the effects of a post-inflationary phase of reheating and examine how the dynamics of reheating influence the predictions in the $n_{_\mathrm{S}}-r$ plane. We also impose a lower bound on the reheating temperature based on the constraint from the effective number of relativistic species ($\Delta{N}_{\mathrm{eff}}$) arising from primordial gravitational waves. While reheating improves agreement with observations for some models, significant regions of parameter space remain disfavored. Finally, we explore the impact of a non Bunch-Davies initial state and demonstrate that it can substantially improve the fit to the $n_{_\mathrm{S}}-r$ data across a broader class of inflationary models, thereby offering a potentially viable mechanism for reconciling theory with the latest observations.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an overview and catalogue of all known mass-transferring binary systems that have white dwarf accretors and orbital periods shorter than 70 minutes, including the AM CVn-type binary systems and a number of related objects. In this paper, we provide an overview of the literature background and describe recent breakthroughs, open questions, and connections to other fields. This overview is intended to provide a starting point for researchers who are relatively new to the fields of ultracompact binaries or AM CVn-type binaries. We define the scope of the catalogue (the criteria for inclusion) and describe its format and contents (what data have been included for each target). We also summarise the observed properties of the known mass-transferring ultracompact binaries, including their orbital periods and component stellar masses and radii. The catalogue presented here aims to provide a central resource to enable researchers to track the current status of the known sample. At the time of writing, the catalogue includes 123 confirmed binaries and 29 candidates. The catalogue is hosted on a public platform (Zenodo) with version control, and will be updated regularly.

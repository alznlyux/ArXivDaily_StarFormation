          Modeling spectral filtering effects on color-matching functions: Implications for observer variability

 - **Abstract**
 This study investigates the impact of spectral filtering on color-matching functions (CMFs) and its implications for observer variability modeling. We conducted color matching experiments with a single observer, both with and without a spectral filter in front of a bipartite field. Using a novel computational approach, we estimated the filter transmittance and transformation matrix necessary to convert unfiltered CMFs to filtered CMFs. Statistical analysis revealed good agreement between estimated and measured filter characteristics, particularly in central wavelength regions. Applying this methodology to compare between Stiles and Burch 1955 (SB1955) mean observer CMFs and our previously published "ICVIO" mean observer CMFs, we identified a "yellow" (short-wavelength suppressing) filter that effectively transforms between these datasets. This finding aligns with our hypothesis that observed differences between the CMF sets are attributable to age-related lens yellowing (average observer age: 49 years in ICVIO versus 30 years in SB1955). Our approach enables efficient representation of observer variability through a single filter rather than three separate functions, offering potentially reduced experimental overhead while maintaining accuracy in characterizing individual color vision differences.

          STCTM: a forward modeling and retrieval framework for stellar contamination and stellar spectra

 - **Abstract**
 Transmission spectroscopy is a key avenue for the near-term study of small-planet atmospheres and the most promising method when it comes to searching for atmospheres on temperate rocky worlds, which are often too cold for planetary emission to be detectable. At the same time, the small planets that are most amenable for such atmospheric probes orbit small and cool M dwarf stars. As the field becomes increasingly ambitious in the search for signs of even thin atmospheres on small exoplanets, the transit light source effect (TLSE), caused by unocculted stellar surface heterogeneities, is becoming a limiting factor: it is imperative to develop robust inference methods to disentangle planetary and stellar contributions to the observed spectra. Here, I present STCTM, the STellar ConTamination Modeling framework, a flexible Bayesian retrieval framework to model the impact of the TLSE on any exoplanet transmission spectrum, and infer the range of stellar surface parameters that are compatible with the observations in the absence of any planetary contribution. With the "exotune" sub-module, users can also perform retrievals directly on out-of-transit stellar spectra in order to place data-driven priors on the extent to which the TLSE can impact any planet's transmission spectrum. The input data formats, stellar models, and fitted parameters are easily tunable using human-readable files and the code is fully parallelized to enable fast inferences.

          Identification of Strongly Lensed Gravitational Wave Events Using Squeeze-and-Excitation Multilayer Perceptron Data-efficient Image Transformer

 - **Abstract**
 With the advancement of third-generation gravitational wave detectors, the identification of strongly lensed gravitational wave (GW) events is expected to play an increasingly vital role in cosmology and fundamental physics. However, traditional Bayesian inference methods suffer from combinatorial computational overhead as the number of events grows, making real-time analysis infeasible. To address this, we propose a deep learning model named Squeeze-and-Excitation Multilayer Perceptron Data-efficient Image Transformer (SEMD), based on Vision Transformers, which classifies strongly lensed GW events by modeling morphological similarity between time-frequency spectrogram pairs. By integrating Squeeze-and-Excitation attention mechanisms and multilayer perceptrons , SEMD achieves strong feature extraction and discrimination. Trained and evaluated on simulated datasets using Advanced LIGO and Einstein Telescope noise, the model demonstrates robustness and generalization across different detector sensitivities and physical conditions, highlighting the promise of deep learning for rapid identification of strongly lensed GW signals.

 - **Abstract**
 The detection of compact binary mergers with sub-solar masses at gravitational-wave observatories could mark the groundbreaking discovery of primordial black holes (PBHs). Concurrently, evidence for a nHz stochastic gravitational wave background observed by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) could suggest a non-astrophysical origin, potentially arising from scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGW). In this work, we analyze the connection between the two phenomena in the case where they share a common origin: the collapse of large primordial curvature perturbations in the early universe. We focus on sub-solar PBH populations within reach of upcoming experiments, including the current and future runs of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA as well as the third generation observatories such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer. Using a Bayesian framework with physically motivated priors, we perform a consistent model comparison that incorporates existing astrophysical bounds together with the discovery potential of future detectors. Our analysis lends stronger support for the SIGW interpretation over the astrophysical one, as the narrowed priors place greater weight on the region of highest likelihood. Ultimately, we illustrate that combining PTA data with interferometer searches can deliver correlated evidence for new physics across multiple gravitational-wave bands.

 - **Abstract**
 NGC 6302 is a spectacular bipolar planetary nebula (PN) whose spectrum exhibits fast outflows and highly ionized emission lines, indicating the presence of a very hot central star (~220,000 K). Its infrared spectrum reveals a mixed oxygen and carbon dust chemistry, displaying both silicate and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) features. Using the JWST Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) and Medium Resolution Spectrometer, a mosaic map was obtained over the core of NGC 6302, covering the wavelength range of 5--28 micron and spanning an area of ~18.5 arcsec x15 arcsec. The spatially resolved spectrum reveals ~200 molecular and ionized lines from species requiring ionisation potentials of up to 205 eV. The spatial distributions highlight a complex structure at the nebula's centre. Highly ionized species such as Mg VII and Si VII show compact structures, while lower-ionization species such as H^+ extend much farther outwards, forming filament-defined rims that delineate a bubble. Within the bubble, the H^+ and H_2 emission coincide, while the PAH emission appears farther out, indicating an ionization structure distinct from typical photodissociation regions, such as the Orion Bar. This may be the first identification of a PAH formation site in a PN. This PN appears to be shaped not by a steady, continuous outflow, but by a series of dynamic, impulsive bubble ejections, creating local conditions conducive to PAH formation. A dusty torus surrounds the core, primarily composed of large (micron-sized) silicate grains with crystalline components. The long-lived torus contains a substantial mass of material, which could support an equilibrium chemistry and a slow dust-formation process.

 We present GammaPBHPlotter, a public Python code for calculating and plotting the Hawking radiation gamma-ray spectra of primordial black holes in the mass range of $10^{14}$ to $10^{18}$ grams. This tool allows users to compute the monochromatic and mass-averaged spectra of black holes over a range of parameters. We include the primary/direct Hawking emission, the secondary emission from the decay and hadronization of unstable particles, the final state radiation, and the in-flight annihilation gamma-ray emission components.

 - **Abstract**
 The growing number of gravitational-wave detections from binary black holes enables increasingly precise measurements of their population properties. The observed population is most likely drawn from multiple formation channels. Population-synthesis simulations allow detailed modelling of each of these channels, and comparing population-synthesis models with the observations allows us to constrain the uncertain physics of binary black hole formation and evolution. However, the most detailed population-synthesis codes are computationally expensive. We demonstrate the use of normalising flows to emulate five different population synthesis models, reducing the computational expense, and allowing interpolation between the populations predicted for different simulation inputs. With the trained normalising flows, we measure the branching ratios of different formation channels and details of binary stellar evolution, using the current catalogue of gravitational-wave observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Reliable, autonomously, deployment of telescopes enables a wide range of possible science cases. In this paper, we present a method for multi-stage telescope alignment with a simple commercial imaging sensor. For these studies, we use a design of an example three mirror anastigmat telescope and consider how the average spot size across the detector changes as a function of primary and secondary mirror positioning. This multi-stage alignment procedure will consist of three subprocesses, starting with a coarse alignment and converging down to a finer alignment before moving on to a stage where the telescope will refine its misalignments for data acquisition. This alignment strategy has been tested and meets diffraction limited requirements on a subset of misalignment cases from a statistical Monte Carlo simulation given misalignment tolerances on the telescope.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. We investigate the binding energies of atoms to interstellar dust particles, which play a key role in their growth and evolution, as well as for the chemical reactions on their surfaces. Aims. We aim to compute the binding energies of abundant atoms in the interstellar medium (C, N, O, Mg, Al, Si, S, Ca, Fe, and Ni) to silicate dust. Methods. We used the Geometries, Frequencies, and Non-covalent Interactions Tight Binding (GFN1-xTB) method to compute the binding energies. An FeMgSiO$_4$ periodic surface model, containing 81 local minima on the surface, was used. Results. A range of binding energies was found for each element. The median of the binding energies follows the order Si (14.8 eV) > Al (12.8 eV) > Ca (12.7 eV) > C (9.5 eV) > O (8.1 eV) > N (6.2 eV) > Fe (6.0 eV) > S (5.2 eV) > Mg (2.4 eV). The probability distribution of binding energies for each element except Ca is statistically consistent with a log-normal distribution. Conclusions. In general, Si, Ca, and Al atoms have large binding energies. Thus, these atoms can stay on the silicate dust particles at high temperatures. The binding energies of the other atoms, C, N, O, Mg, S, Fe and Ni, are relatively weak. However, the computed binding energies for these elements are still far stronger than the energies associated with dust temperatures typical of the ambient interstellar medium (ISM), suggesting that silicate grains are generally stable against sublimation. We estimate sublimation temperatures for silicate grains to range from 1600 K to 3000K depending on assumed grain size and lifetime. These binding energies on silicate dust grains, estimated from first principles for the first time, provide invaluable input to models of dust evolution and dust-catalyzed chemical reactions in the interstellar medium.

 - **Abstract**
 As a benchmark for galaxy evolution and dark matter studies, the total mass of the Milky Way is a parameter of cosmological significance, and its value at large radii from the Galactic center remains highly uncertain. Following a hierarchical Bayesian inference approach, we measure the cumulative mass of the Milky Way using full 6D phase-space information of stars from the first data release of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). We employ 330 blue horizontal-branch stars (BHBs) and 110 RR Lyrae stars (RRLs) in DESI covering Galactocentric distances in the range $\sim$50--100 kpc. Within 100 kpc from the Galactic center, we report an enclosed mass of $M(<100\ {\rm kpc}) = 0.57^{+0.08}_{-0.07}\times10^{12}$ M$_\odot$ and $M(<100\ {\rm kpc}) = 0.55^{+0.12}_{-0.10}\times10^{12}$ M$_\odot$ when using BHBs and RRLs, respectively. Extrapolating our mass profiles beyond the extent of our data, we find the virial mass of the Galaxy to be $M_{200}=0.85^{+0.16}_{-0.14}\times10^{12}$ M$_\odot$ and $M_{200}=0.78^{+0.19}_{-0.15}\times10^{12}$ M$_\odot$, respectively. We validate the effectiveness and limitations of our method using mock BHBs and RRLs from two AuriDESI halos. These tests show that the code recovers the enclosed mass of the mock galaxy with high precision and accuracy between 50 and 200 kpc, independent of the stellar tracer used and their spatial distribution. The tests also suggest an underestimation of the galaxy's cumulative mass at a level of up to $\sim20$\% if stars close to the Galactic center are used in the models. Our mass estimates lay the groundwork for future inference of the Galactic mass with upcoming DESI data releases and spectroscopic surveys mapping the halo.

 - **Abstract**
 Local helioseismology comprises of imaging and inversion techniques employed to reconstruct the dynamic and interior of the Sun from correlations of oscillations observed on the surface, all of which require modeling solar oscillations and computing Green's kernels. In this context, we implement and investigate the robustness of the Hybridizable Discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method in solving the equation modeling stellar oscillations for realistic solar backgrounds containing gravity and differential rotation. While a common choice for modeling stellar oscillations is the Galbrun's equation, our working equations are derived from an equivalent variant, involving less regularity in its coefficients, working with Lagrangian displacement and pressure perturbation as unknowns. Under differential rotation and axisymmetric assumption, the system is solved in azimuthal decomposition with the HDG method. Compared to no-gravity approximations, the mathematical nature of the wave operator is now linked to the profile of the solar buoyancy frequency N which encodes gravity, and leads to distinction into regions of elliptic or hyperbolic behavior of the wave operator at zero attenuation. While small attenuation is systematically included to guarantee theoretical well-posedness, the above phenomenon affects the numerical solutions in terms of amplitude and oscillation pattern, and requires a judicious choice of stabilization. We investigate the stabilization of the HDG discretization scheme, and demonstrate its importance to ensure the accuracy of numerical results, which is shown to depend on frequencies relative to N, and on the position of the Dirac source. As validations, the numerical power spectra reproduce accurately the observed effects of the solar rotation on acoustic waves.

 - **Abstract**
 The Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) is a flagship mission concept proposing to characterize earth-like exoplanets at high contrast with a coronagraph instrument. The most in-depth, validated contrast error budgets made to date have been at the $10^{-9}$ planet-to-star contrast levels for the Roman Space Telescope. To obtain the raw contrast levels of $\leq 10^{-10}$ contrast needed for HWO, more modeling is needed of the vector diffraction effects within a coronagraph instrument. Several coronagraph architectures are based on the Lyot coronagraph, which utilizes a small occulting spot to block most of the on-axis starlight at a focal plane. In this paper, we present a study of the polarization aberrations generated by internal occulting spots. First, we use finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) modeling to produce the complex transmission of the occulter in each polarization state, and then we separately run those through a closed-loop wavefront control model in FALCO\cite{rigss2018falco} to determine the degradation in achievable contrast. We perform sweeps of such parameters as spot diameter, spot thickness, and angle of incidence to inform the HWO instrument design.

 - **Abstract**
 The galaxy LEDA 1313424 has recently been discovered to have nine rings [1]. The authors of the discovery paper interpret the rings to be the result of the passing of a smaller galaxy through the center of the LEDA galaxy 56 Myr ago. We point out several difficulties with this interpretation and propose instead that the rings of LEDA are the imprint upon baryonic matter of caustic rings of dark matter. Caustic rings of dark matter, with the pattern of radii observed in the LEDA galaxy, form if the dark matter is axions. Because they move slowly (LEDA's 70 kpc ring, for example, has speed 6.6 km/s) caustic rings of dark matter are plausible sites for the star formation observed in LEDA.

 - **Abstract**
 Carbon-deficient giants (CDGs) are a rare and chemically peculiar class of stars whose origins remain under active investigation. We present an asteroseismic analysis of the entire known CDG population, selecting 129 stars observed by $Kepler$, K2, and TESS to obtain seismic constraints. We detect solar-like oscillations in 43 CDGs. By measuring $\nu_{\rm max}$ and applying seismic scaling relations, we determine precise masses for these stars, finding that 79\% are low-mass ($M \lesssim 2~M_\odot$). The luminosity distribution is bimodal, and the CDGs separate into three chemically and evolutionarily distinct groups, characterized by clear trends in sodium and CNO abundances, $\alpha$-element enhancement, and kinematics. We find that two of these groups are only distinguished by their initial $\alpha$-element abundances, thus effectively reducing the number of groups to two. Lithium enrichment is common across all groups, linking CDGs to lithium-rich giants and suggesting a shared evolutionary origin. We find that spectroscopic $\log g$ is systematically offset from seismic values. Group~1 CDG patterns are most consistent with formation through core He-flash mixing, while the more massive and more chemically processed Groups~2 and 2$\alpha$ likely formed through mergers involving helium white dwarfs, possibly in hierarchical triples. Pollution from AGB stars appears very unlikely, given the unchanged [C+N+O] abundance across all groups.

 - **Abstract**
 Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites are crucial for communications, navigation, and Earth observation. However, their operational lifetimes are strongly influenced by orbital decay due to atmospheric drag. This work presents a simplified analytical model of orbital decay in LEO, incorporating atmospheric density variations and satellite parameters. Using standard drag force equations and density models, we explore how altitude, satellite mass, and cross-sectional area affect decay timescales. Comparisons are made with existing NASA models and previous literature. The results highlight the importance of accurate atmospheric density representation and solar activity in predicting satellite lifetimes, especially relevant in the context of increasing space debris and mega-constellations.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of a vertical velocity anomaly (VVA) in the stellar component of the Galactic disk, consistent with the impact of a dark, ultra-compact dwarf galaxy (UCD)-sized object plunging into the Milky Way. The anomaly spatially coincides with a suite of gaseous disturbances -- including an \Hone\ void, a molecular shell (CO 16.134--0.553), and a vertical \Hone\ filament -- previously interpreted as signatures of a dark matter subhalo (DMSH) collision. Analysis of Gaia DR2 astrometry reveals a statistically significant vertical velocity dip co-located with these features, supporting a dynamical origin. The absence of a luminous source at the filament's terminus suggests a dark or failed UCD. These results provide rare observational evidence for a low-mass DMSH, with implications for the substructure of dark matter halos and constraints on the $\Lambda$CDM model.

 - **Abstract**
 Protoplanetary nebulae (PPNs) represent a critical evolutionary bridging stage between the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) and planetary nebula (PN) stages. Their dynamical structures provide key insights into late stellar evolution. Here, we report CO and $^{13}$CO imaging observations of the carbon-rich PPN IRAS 06530$-$0213, a source exhibiting the unidentified 21 micron emission band, conducted with the Northern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA). The CO maps reveal a spherical halo (diameter $\sim10''$) surrounding a central barrel-shaped torus, where the torus displays an inner diameter of $\sim1.5''$ and an outer diameter of $\sim2''$. Through three-dimensional morpho-kinematic modeling with the SHAPE software, we determine that IRAS 06530$-$0213 experienced its final thermal pulse during the AGB phase $\sim6500$ years ago, transitioning into the PPN phase $\sim4500$ years ago. Our analysis indicates that the blue-shifted CO emission, a feature also detected in several other PPNs and PNs previously misattributed to the interstellar clouds, actually originates from the obscuration of the central nebula by the remnant AGB halo. These findings are expected to deepen our understanding of the dynamical structures of PPNs, as well as their pivotal transitional role in the late-stage evolution of low-to-intermediate mass stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Accretion variability is ubiquitous in YSOs. While large outbursts may strongly affect the disk, the effects of moderate bursts are less understood. We aim to study the physical response of the disk around the eccentric binary system DQ Tau to its periodic accretion changes. We organized a multi-wavelength campaign centered on four JWST/MIRI spectra. We targeted three periastrons (high accretion state) and one apastron (quiescence). We used optical and near-infrared spectroscopy and photometry to measure how the accretion luminosity varies. We decomposed the multi-epoch SEDs into stellar, accretion, and rim components. We fitted the solid-state features using various opacity curves and the molecular features using slab models. We find the inner disk of DQ Tau to be highly dynamic. The temperature, luminosity, and location of the inner dust rim vary in response to the movement of stars and the L_acc variations. This causes variable shadowing of the outer disk, leading to an anti-correlation between the rim temperature and the strength of the silicate feature. The dust mineralogy remains constant, dominated by large amorphous olivine and pyroxene grains, with smaller fractions of crystalline forsterite. The excitation of CO (1550-2260 K), HCN (880-980 K), and hot H2O (740-860 K) molecules as well as the luminosity of the [NeII] line correlate with the accretion rate, while the warm (650 K) and cold (170-200 K) H2O components are mostly constant. CO emission, originating from a hot (>1500 K) region likely within the dust sublimation radius, is most sensitive to L_acc changes. In comparison with other T Tauri disks, DQ Tau is highly C-poor and displays moderately inefficient pebble drift. We conclude that even moderate accretion rate changes affect the thermal structure in the planet-forming disk regions on short timescales, providing a crucial benchmark for understanding disk evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Small-pitch populated focal planes are a critical enabling technology for the next generation of highly multiplexed astronomical instruments. This work reports on ongoing prototyping activities for 6.2 mm-pitch alpha-beta (theta-phi) fiber positioner modules. Following a concise review of the underlying concept, the performance of trillium-based and independently actuated robotic designs is compared. Key operational parameters including XY positioning repeatability, non-linearity, backlash, and tilt are quantitatively assessed, with emphasis on their implications for overall instrument performance. Initial prototyping results are highly encouraging, indicating performance levels approaching the preliminary design specifications.

 - **Abstract**
 The behavior of lithium (Li) in Population I main sequence stars challenges standard stellar theory. Two phenomena stand out: the solar Li problem which extends to Li depletion in solar analogs and the Li dip observed in mid-F stars within open clusters. Building on the meridional circulation-driven radial mixing framework previously developed to explain Li-enriched red clump stars, we explore its relevance to Li depletion on the main sequence. First, our models reproduce the observed $A(\text{Li})$-Age correlation in solar analogs. Through detailed isochrone analysis, we find good agreement between the simulated and observed $A(\text{Li})$-$T_{\text{eff}}$ relationships within the solar analog parameter space. However, the predicted solar Li abundance ($\sim 1.5\,\text{dex}$) is still higher than current solar measurements. Second, our models partially explain the Li dip phenomenon in mid-F cluster stars. The models accurately reproduce Li distributions on the cool side of the Li dip in most clusters and capture the Li behaviors on the hot side observed in systems like the Hyades. However, we identify limitations in the models' ability to fully reproduce the dip morphology, particularly due to the rotation velocity distribution of sample stars in this temperature zone.

 - **Abstract**
 Many galactic globular clusters (GCs) contain at least two stellar populations. Recent observational studies found that the radial distributions of the first (P1) and second population (P2) differ in dynamically-young GCs. Since P2 is conventionally assumed to form more centrally concentrated, the rapid mixing (or even inversion) in some GCs but not others is puzzling. We investigate whether dynamical processes specific to certain GCs might cause this. Specifically, we evaluate the expansion of P2 by binary-single interactions in the cluster core and whether these can mix the P1/P2 radial distributions, using a set of toy-models with varying numbers and masses of primordial binaries. We find that even one massive binary star can push the central P2 outwards, but multiple binaries are required to fully mix P1 and P2 within a few relaxation times. We also compare our results to observed properties of mixed young GCs (NGC 4590, 5053, or 5904).

          The Corona-Australis star-forming region: New insights on its formation history from detailed stellar and disk analysis

 - **Abstract**
 The star-forming complex of Corona Australis (CrA) is one of the closest and most isolated molecular clouds. It belongs to a chain of clusters that show age gradients with distance from the galactic plane. We aim to provide suggestions regarding its formation history by examining the stellar and disk populations, stellar multiplicity, and interstellar absorption. We made a census of stars and disks using Gaia DR3 and infrared data. Interstellar absorption in the direction of each star was derived by comparing SpTy from the literature and Gaia colors. Stellar multiplicity analysis accounts for both direct observation of visual companions (Gaia data and high-contrast imaging) and indirect detection of the presence of companions (eclipsing and spectroscopic binaries, and astrometry). The properties of the disks were obtained from the slopes of the spectral energy distributions. As found in previous studies, the CrA complex can be divided into two regions: a younger region (CrA-Main: 3+/-1Myr) and an older one (CrA-North: 6.7+/-0.3Myr), slightly younger than previously thought. While CrA-Main still appears bound to the gas, CrA-North is unbound and expanding. The stars that belong to CrA-North were in the most compact configuration 3.72Myr ago. At that time, CrA-Main and CrA-North were much closer to each other than they appear now. The fraction of disk-bearing stars is higher in Main than in North, as also expected due to the younger age of CrA-Main. We propose a formation history scenario for the CrA-complex. It started between 15 and 18 Myr ago with SNe explosions in the Upper Centaurus-Lupus complex, followed by a quiescent phase with little star formation. A star formation episode about 7Myr ago formed CrA-North stars. About 3.7Myr ago, a second SN explosion south of CrA-North triggered star formation in CrA-Main. This last SN might have been the origin of the pulsar RX J1856.5-3754.

          Probe the missing baryons in cosmic filaments with Fast Radio Bursts

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic filaments are thought to host a substantial fraction of the missing baryons at redshifts $z<2$. In this study, we probe the baryonic content of these filaments using localized Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). Filaments are identified from the galaxy distribution in the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) imaging surveys using the DisPerSe algorithm. We find tentative evidence ($\sim 3 \sigma$ significance) for a divergence in the relationship between the dispersion measure (DM) contributed by the intergalactic medium and redshift for FRBs whose signals intersect cosmic filaments compared to those that do not, suggesting excess baryons in the filamentary structures. Assuming an isothermal $\beta$-model gas profile with $\beta=2/3$, this discrepancy is best explained by a central baryon overdensity of $\delta = 20.78$, broadly consistent with previous simulation and observational results. The inferred baryon fraction residing in filaments decreases with redshift, from approximately $0.25-0.30\,\Omega_b$ at $z=0.02$ to $0.15-0.30\,\Omega_b$ at $z=0.5$, and $0.03-0.04\,\Omega_b$ at $z=0.8$. These estimates are likely lower bounds, particularly at $z>0.5$, due to the limited number of identified filaments and localized FRBs at higher redshifts. We also examine various factors that may affect the statistical significance of our results. Our method offers an independent approach to tracing baryons in cosmic filaments and underscores the importance of expanding localized FRB samples and deepening galaxy surveys, which are key steps toward refining these estimates and addressing the missing baryon problem.

          Jupiter Trojans spectrophotometry using Gaia DR3 catalog

 - **Abstract**
 We present the spectral characterization of Jupiter Trojans using data from the Gaia mission DR3 spectral catalog (320 spectra of good quality) and from the literature. Gaia spectrophotometry is available in 16 spectrophotometric points covering the 0.33-1.08 $\mu$m range. The final dataset includes 519 Trojans, 291 in the leading swarm (L4) and 228 in the trailing swarm (L5), which we classified using the Bus-Demeo and Mahlke classification schemes. The Trojan population is dominated by featureless asteroids with red spectral slopes belonging to the D-type, and an important fraction ($\sim$ 40\%) belong to the Z-class (in Mahlke taxonomy), characterized by very red slopes. The L4 swarm shows a higher spectral variability and a higher amount, by a factor of 2, of less spectrally red asteroids belonging to the C, P, and X classes, mainly associated with families members. Once excluding peculiar families members the two swarms have very similar average slope and albedo values (7.86 $\pm$ 0.15\% and 7.35 $\pm$0.15\% for the L4 and L5 swarms, respectively). This points toward a common origin of the bodies of the two swarms, likely from the Transneptunian region. We do not observe a spectral color bi-modality distribution, conversely to the results previously reported in the literature. The spectral slope distribution, peaked at 9-11 \%/1000 Å, it is very narrow compared to that of Transneptunian objects (TNOs) or cometary nuclei. Trojans visible spectral slopes match those of the less red TNOs, and lack of extremely red and organic rich bodies. We suggest that the Jupiter Trojans might have been captured by Jupiter from the Centaurs and scattered disk population, and that the lack of extremely red objects among Trojans is due to removal of the organic-rich crust through the sublimation of volatiles and collisions as TNOs migrated inward in the Solar System.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we find constraints on the parameter space of the Ricci-Cubic Holographic dark energy (RCHDE) from various observational data sets like Hubble data, cosmic-chronometer data, Baryon-acoustic oscillation data, and also data from gamma-ray bursts. RCHDE is formed from the cubic invariant, which in turn is built from the cubic contractions of the Riemann and Ricci tensors. We have used the Markov chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) sampling technique to find constraints on the model parameters via Bayesian inference. Contour plots have been obtained for the model parameters, showing their marginalized and joint probability distributions. The best-fit regression lines are found for the constrained model and compared with the standard $\Lambda$CDM model to verify and validate the model. To complement this data analysis mechanism, we have also performed an enhanced machine learning analysis using observational Hubble parameter data. This approach serves to validate the model's predictive power through independent, data-driven regression techniques. Different graphical illustrations of the machine learning techniques have been presented to understand the results. These illustrations reveal a strong agreement between the Hubble parameter predictions from the machine learning models, the theoretical RCHDE model, and observational data.

 - **Abstract**
 This study examines the communication of astrobiology and the Search for Life Elsewhere (SLE) in academic papers, press releases, and news articles over three decades. Through a quantitative content analysis, it investigates the prevalence of speculations and promises/expectations in these sources, aiming to understand how research results are portrayed and their potential impact on public perception and future research directions. Findings reveal that speculations and promises/expectations are more frequent in news articles and press releases compared to academic papers. Speculations about conditions for life and the existence of life beyond Earth are common, particularly in news articles covering exoplanet research, while promises of life detection are rare. Press releases tend to emphasize the significance of research findings and the progress of the field. Speculations and promises/expectations in news articles often occur without attribution to scientists and in quotes of authors of the studies, and slightly less so in quotes of outside experts. The study highlights the complex dynamics of science communication in astrobiology, where speculations and promises can generate public excitement and influence research funding, but also risk misrepresenting scientific uncertainty and creating unrealistic expectations. It underscores the need for responsible communication practices that acknowledge the speculative dimension of the field while fostering public engagement and informed decision-making.

 - **Abstract**
 Blue horizontal-branch (BHB) stars are evolved low-mass objects that have completed their core hydrogen burning main-sequence (MS) stage and have lost significant mass during the red giant phase culminating in the helium flash. We determine the fraction of BHBs in binary systems over a wide range of separations in the inner Galactic Halo to constrain mass-loss mechanisms and evolutionary pathways. Using a catalog of 22,336 BHB candidates from Gaia DR3, we analysed radial velocity variations found in spectra (263 spectra of 89 targets) acquired using the Ondrejov Echelle spectrograph at the Astronomical Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences together with archival spectra from the Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph (UVES) and Fiber-fed Extended Range Optical Spectrograph (FEROS). We searched for wide common proper motion pairs, binary candidates with enhanced astrometric noise, and binaries with astrometric orbital solutions in Gaia DR3. Archival light curves from Gaia DR3 and the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) were checked for binary induced variations. Synthetic SEDs and binary detection probabilities were modelled to account for selection effects. We find a binary fraction of <2.2%, far lower than the rates for their main-sequence (MS) and red-giant branch (RGB) progenitors (30-50%). This suggests that BHBs are either not descendants of binary systems, or that existing companions do not survive the BHB formation process. The negligible binary fraction implies single-star evolution could dominate BHB formation, contrasting with EHB stars where binarity is critical. Our results challenge models of mass loss on the RGB and highlight the need for alternative mechanisms.

 - **Abstract**
 The day-side atmospheres of the hottest ultra-hot Jupiters (UHJs) have long been subject to speculation about cloud formation, often without direct observational evidence. Here, we present a detailed analysis of the panchromatic day-side emission spectrum of WASP-121b$\unicode{x2014}$one of the hottest known UHJs$\unicode{x2014}$covering a broad wavelength range of $\sim$0.6-5.1$\unicode{x00B5}$m, based on archival JWST observations from NIRISS and NIRSpec/G396H. We report statistically significant detections of several key molecular species, including H$_2$O (13.4 $\sigma$), CO (14.7 $\sigma$), SiO (4.9 $\sigma$), TiO (5.4 $\sigma$), and VO (6.6 $\sigma$), establishing WASP-121b as one of the most thoroughly characterized exoplanetary atmospheres to date. Additionally, we present the robust detection of Titanate (CaTiO$_3$) clouds at 6.7$\sigma$$\unicode{x2014}$the first such detection in any exoplanet atmosphere. Our analysis further reveals strong evidence of TiO depletion, likely due to sequestration into refractory condensates such as Titanate clouds. The precisely constrained molecular abundances yield a super-solar C/O ratio of 0.963$\pm$0.024, a sub-solar Si/O ratio of 0.034$\pm$0.024, and a metallicity of 4.7$_{-1.38}^{+1.99}$ $\times$solar. These findings offer a unique window into the atmospheric chemistry of an extreme UHJ, positioning WASP-121b as a key benchmark for next-generation models of atmospheric evolution and dynamics.

 Titania doped with tantala is the high index material (high n) for the optical coatings used in LIGO and Virgo and its thermal noise limits LIGO/Virgo observations of astrophysical sources. In this paper, we study temperature induced changes to optical scatter of a multilayer highly reflective coating comprised of silica (low n) and titania doped with germania (high n) as a potential candidate to reduce coating thermal noise in ground-based observatories operating at room temperature. We observe that the scatter measured at 8 degree in a small region is low, with a median starting BRDF of $1.1 \times 10^{-7}\,\mathrm{str}^{-1}$ increasing to $1.2 \times 10^{-6}\,\mathrm{str}^{-1}$ through annealing. The results presented here show the potential of adopting titania doped with germania coatings for future upgrades to LIGO and Virgo and as a pathfinder coating for Cosmic Explorer, a next-generation detector.

 - **Abstract**
 We present very high-energy optical photometry and spectroscopic observations of SN 2024bch in the nearby galaxy NGC 3206 (\sim 20 Mpc). We used gamma-ray observations performed with the first Large-Sized Telescope (LST-1) of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) and optical observations with the Liverpool Telescope (LT) combined with data from public repositories to evaluate the general properties of the event and the progenitor star. No significant emission above the LST-1 energy threshold for this observation (\sim 100 GeV) was detected in the direction of SN 2024bch, and we computed an integral upper limit on the photon flux of F_\gamma(>100 GeV) \le 3.61 \times 10^{-12} cm^{-2} s^{-1} based on six nonconsecutive nights of observations with the LST-1, between 16 and 38 days after the explosion. Employing a general model for the gamma-ray flux emission, we found an upper limit on the mass-loss-rate to wind-velocity ratio of \dot M/u_{w} \le 10^{-4} \frac{M_\odot}{yr}\frac{s}{km}, although gamma-gamma absorption could potentially have skewed this estimation, effectively weakening our constraint. From spectro-photometric observations we found progenitor parameters of M_{pr} = 11 - 20 M_\odot and R_{pr} = 531 \pm 125 R_\odot. Finally, using archival images from the Hubble Space Telescope, we constrained the luminosity of the progenitor star to log(L_{pr}/L_\odot) \le 4.82 and its effective temperature to T_{pr} \le 4000 K. Our results suggest that SN 2024bch is a type IIn-L supernova that originated from a progenitor star consistent with a red supergiant. We show how the correct estimation of the mass-loss history of a supernova will play a major role in future multiwavelength observations.

 - **Abstract**
 In the incremental growth model, planetesimal formation constitutes the least understood step in the process of planetary formation. The two main difficulties in this regard are the collision/fragmentation and the drift barriers. Numerous solutions have been proposed to overcome these barriers, but often need a conjunction of processes to reach the conditions for planetesimal formation. We present numerical simulations, in which the protoplanetary disk turbulence is fully captured rather than modeled with a turbulent diffusion or turbulent viscosity parameter. When the turbulent cascade is taken into account, and in the case of weakly turbulent disks, not only can solid grains be highly concentrated in clusters, but their radial drift can also be slowed or even halted. These results open a unique path to planetesimal formation starting at disk canonical dust-to-gas ratio, namely Keplerian turbulence.

 - **Abstract**
 Photonic lanterns (PLs) are fiber-based waveguides that are capable of focal-plane wavefront sensing while simultaneously directing light to downstream science instruments. The optimal choice of wavefront reconstruction algorithm has yet to be determined, and likely depends on the particular observing scenario under consideration. Previous work in simulation suggests that PLs can be used for nonlinear wavefront sensing for several applications, including sensing the low-wind effect and correcting large-amplitude aberrations. We present the design of muirSEAL (miniature IR SEAL), a testbed designed to test PL wavefront reconstruction over Zernike modes and segmented-mirror offsets. We demonstrate throughput and linear wavefront reconstruction at multiple f-numbers. We further present initial laboratory imaging of a new photonic lantern fabricated at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.

 - **Abstract**
 The astrophysics of Long GRB (LGRB) progenitors as well as possible cosmological evolution in their properties still poses many open questions. Previous studies suggest that the LGRB rate density (LGRB-RD) follows the cosmic star formation rate density (SFRD) only at high-z and attribute this to the metallicity evolution of progenitor stars. For low z, opinions differ on whether the uptick in the LGRB RD is due to a distinct class of low-luminosity GRBs or perhaps even a different progenitor subclass. To investigate these questions, we utilize data from the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory and ground-based observatories (redshift). To test the hypothesis that the observations can be mapped (with/without evolution) to the well-established cosmic SFRD, we consider three cases: no evolution, beaming angle evolution, and a simple power-law evolution. The comparison shows that the 'no evolution' case can be ruled out. Our study highlights that the beaming angle evolution or the simple power law evolution are also not sufficient to obtain a good match between the LGRB-RD and SFRD. Rather, the inclusion of multiple evolving properties of LGRBs in combination appears to be required to match the two rate densities in their entirety.

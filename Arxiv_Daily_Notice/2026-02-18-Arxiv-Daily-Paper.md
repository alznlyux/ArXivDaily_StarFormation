- **Abstract**
 We present a new dynamic formation model of a star, a disk, arms, and companions using a coupled map lattice (CML), a complex systems approach. This CML simulates the viscoelastic and chaotic dynamics and evolution of gas clumps containing a little dust with a minimal set of one Eulerian procedure for the flow formation of gas clumps due to gravitational interaction, and one Lagrangian procedure for the collision and mixture of gas clumps due to viscoelastic advection. Despite its simplicity, this CML successfully obtains four typical astronomical objects consistent with protoplanetary disk observations: a central star, Keplerian disk, spiral arms, and even stellar, substellar, and planetary companions. All these formation processes are truly dynamic, with the central star "starring" in them, and they are not based on the conventional disk gravitational instability but on the central star gravitational instability with high-dimensional chaotic gas ejection, namely the chaotic itinerancy. Of particular note is the process in which diverse companions are formed due to the rapid density increase caused by the intersection of spiral arms. This suggests a novel companion formation scenario that should be called "arm-crossing companion formation" with a view to planet formation, which may overcome the radial drift barrier and angular momentum problem.

- **Abstract**
 We present the results of a comprehensive survey conducted among members of the Spanish Astronomical Society (Sociedad Espanola de Astronomia, SEA) to assess well-being, professional satisfaction, and family-work balance of researchers in astronomy. The survey addressed multiple aspects of professional life, including happiness, career stability, publication pressure, and access to childcare services during scientific meetings. Responses were examined across gender and career stages to identify trends and sources of dissatisfaction.

          Searching for Extragalactic Exoplanets: A Survey of the Sagittarius Dwarf Galaxy Stream with TESS

- **Abstract**
 To date no exoplanets have been detected outside the Milky Way, and their extragalactic occurrence rates are poorly constrained. Using available data from TESS we perform the first transit survey of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy stream using 15,176 main sequence stars identified as likely members. We calculate an upper limit of $<$1.01% for hot Jupiters with radii of 1-2 R$_{Jup}$ and periods of 0.6-10 days after detecting zero planets. We compare our calculated occurrence rate upper limits to the upper limits found in the Milky Way globular clusters M4 and 47 Tuc. Our 1-$\sigma$ occurrence rate upper limit of $<$0.37% for the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy stream, for planets with radii of 1.5-2 R$_{Jup}$ and periods $<$10 days, is lower than the $<$0.57% upper limit measured in 47 Tuc. Similarly, our 2 sigma upper limit of $<$0.78% for planets with radii of 1.4-2 $_{Jup}$ and periods $<$8 days is below the $<$0.81% upper limit measured in M4. We predict that a future analysis of TESS data with a high detection efficiency for hot Jupiter transit depths would require $\eta_{extragalactic}$ $\geq$ 11,467 target stars to detect a planet of extragalactic origin. Therefore, we predict that a future investigation of TESS data which includes additional extragalactic stellar streams will be able to either detect the first extragalactic origin planet or provide evidence that older, lower metallicity extragalactic environments may experience a lower hot Jupiter occurrence rate than is observed for the Milky Way.

          Detection horizon for the neutrino burst from the stellar helium flash

- **Abstract**
 Low-mass stars ($M\lesssim 2\,M_\odot$) ignite helium under degenerate conditions, eventually causing a nuclear run-away -- the helium flash. The alpha-capture process on $^{14}$N produces a large amount of $^{18}$F, whose subsequent decay spawns an intense $\nu_e$ burst (with average energy of $0.38$ MeV) lasting about a day. We show that, in addition, a strong $1.7$ MeV neutrino line is generated by electron capture on $^{18}$F. Detection is hindered by large backgrounds in state-of-the-art neutrino observatories, such as JUNO. In next-generation facilities, such as the Jinping neutrino experiment, the horizon for a detection with a local significance of $3 \sigma$ would be extended to almost $3$ pc. Although helium flashes occur a few times per year in our Galaxy, there are no stellar candidates approaching the tip of the red giant branch within $10$ pc. Hence, to date, asteroseismology remains the most promising tool for probing the most energetic thermonuclear event in the life of a low-mass star.

          The eruptive young star IRAS 21204+4913

- **Abstract**
 The results of photometric, polarimetric, and spectroscopic observations are presented for the young star IRAS 21204+4913, whose visible brightness has increased by $\approx 5^{\rm m}$ since October 2025. The star's absorption spectrum in the $0.36 - 0.75 \mu$m range resembles those of A - F giants and supergiants, but it also exhibits molecular TiO bands. The brightening was accompanied by a significant increase in the degree of polarization of the stellar radiation (to $\approx 16 \%$ in the I-band), likely due to scattering by dust in an expanding circumstellar shell. The P Cygni profile of the H$\alpha$ line implies a dusty wind velocity of $\approx 300$ km/s. We believe that the outburst of IRAS 21204+4913 is caused by an increase in the accretion rate of protoplanetary disk's matter onto the young star with a mass of $\lesssim 0.5$ M$_\odot$ to $\gtrsim 3\times 10^{-5}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. Furthermore, IRAS 21204+4913 displays several unusual features: the dependence of the width and radial velocity of absorption lines on the excitation potential, emission in the TiO molecular bands, and a comparably bright outburst that occured in 1948. Several T Tauri stars and a group of Herbig-Haro objects are found in the vicinity of the star.

          A Response to paper Critical Evaluation of Studies Alleging Evidence for Technosignatures in the POSS1-E Photographic Plates by Watters et al. (2026)

- **Abstract**
 We respond to the critique by Watters et al. (2026) of the statistical analyses in Villarroel et al. (2025) and Bruehl & Villarroel (2025). We argue that the critique conflates object-level validation with ensemble-level statistical inference and relies on a reduced, heterogeneously filtered subset originally constructed for a different scientific purpose. We further question whether the aggressively filtered subset used in Watters et al. (2026) demonstrates a meaningful improvement in sample purity, given the twenty-fold reduction in sample size. Our simple, visual check does not suggest that it does. The subset further lacks complete temporal information and is seriously statistically underpowered for testing the reported Earth-shadow deficit. We emphasise that the horizontal separation metric used for plate assignment and time reconstruction as in Watters et al. (2026) depends on the inclusion of the cos(Dec) factor to ensure geometric consistency. Any omission would alter plate assignment and inferred observation times. Moreover, the analyses presented in Watters et al. (2026) do not include uncertainty estimates or error propagation, limiting the interpretability of the claimed null results. We conclude that the principal findings reported in Villarroel et al. (2025) and Bruehl & Villarroel (2025) are not invalidated by the analyses presented in Watters et al. (2026).

- **Abstract**
 We have calibrated the Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) using our recent catalog of homogeneous, high-accuracy Globular Cluster (GC) distances. The GC distances were determined by a global joint fit to optical period-Wesenheit relations of their member RR Lyrae stars and type-II Cepheids, anchored by trigonometric parallaxes; all data taken from the ESA Gaia mission's (early) third data release (GDR3). Using I-band measurements in 48 GCs from P. Stetson's database, we determined $M_{I,0} = -3.948^{+0.037}_{-0.034}$ mag (1.6% in distance). Calibrating the TRGB using Gaia's homogeneous, space-based RP photometry of 53 GCs, we found $M_{RP,0} = -3.807^{+0.041}_{-0.035}$ mag (1.8%). The stated uncertainties include statistical and systematic effects, including the correlated nature of the GC distances. The robustness of our calibrations is demonstrated via tests against small-number statistics and analysis choices. Specifically, we found no significant metallicity effect for our sample of old, low-metallicity GCs. We measured $\sim 2\%$ distances to the Large (LMC) and Small Magellanic Clouds (SMC), $18.447^{+0.036}_{-0.042}$ mag ($48.9 \pm 0.9$ kpc) and $18.898^{+0.049}_{-0.054}$ mag ($60.2 \pm 1.4$ kpc), respectively, using a single well calibrated photometric system: RP (spectro-)photometry from GDR3. Our new TRGB distances, whose absolute scale derives from Gaia parallaxes, are fully independent of the well-known detached eclipsing binary (DEB) distances and agree with them to within the uncertainties. Combining our new TRGB and existing DEB distances, we illustrate how additional constraints may be incorporated in the Local Distance Network and obtain $H_0 = 73.52 \pm 0.80$ km/s/Mpc. Expected improvements due to the upcoming fourth Gaia data release are discussed.

          The Montreal Open Clusters and Associations (MOCA) Database: A Census of Nearby Associations, Open Clusters, and Young Substellar Objects within 500 pc of the Sun

- **Abstract**
 We present the Montreal Open Clusters and Associations database (MOCAdb), a public MySQL database with a Python interface. MOCAdb provides a census of memberships for 10259 associations and open clusters within 500 pc of the Sun, with a comprehensive compilation of literature measurements such as spectral types, kinematics, rotation periods, activity indices, spectral indices, and photometry. All known substellar objects are cataloged in MOCAdb, along with 2943 public spectra, to enable the characterization of substellar association members. MOCAdb also features periodically updated calculations such as Galactic UVW space velocities. We use this compilation to construct mappings between independent association definitions, and to update the BANYAN $\Sigma$ membership classification tool, which now includes 8125 associations. The BANYAN $\Sigma$ model construction is improved to account for heterogeneous and correlated errors and to capture complex association shapes using Gaussian mixture models. Combined with Gaia DR3, this enabled us to identify 11535 yet unrecognized candidate members of young associations within 500 pc, mostly M dwarfs. Our results corroborate a recent observation that systematics up to $\approx$4 km/s remain in Gaia DR3 radial velocities for A-type stars. We present an updated census of age-calibrated exoplanets and substellar objects: 134 age-calibrated exoplanet systems (plus 121 TESS exoplanet candidates), 99 of which did not appear to have known memberships so far, and 455 substellar (L0 or later) candidate members of young associations, 196 of which appear newly recognized. We bring the total of candidate isolated planetary-mass objects to 101, 53 of which are newly recognized candidate members.

          Between Plateaus and Slopes: A Data-Driven Exploration of Spectral Diversity Across Type IIP/L Supernovae

- **Abstract**
 Type II supernovae (SNe II) have been traditionally separated into several subgroups based on their photometric and spectroscopic properties, but whether these represent distinct progenitors or a continuous distribution remains debated. Over the past decade, growing observational evidence has suggested a possible continuity between slow- (IIP) and fast-declining (IIL) SNe. We investigate the continuity of the SNe IIP/L subclasses through a data-driven statistical analysis of spectral time series, aiming to determine whether significant correlations exist between overall spectral shapes and light-curve decline rates. We introduce a novel standardization method for SN II spectra. After empirically flattening the spectra via continuum normalization, we interpolate the resulting "feature spectra" onto a fixed grid of epochs using Gaussian Process regression. The interpolated spectra are then analyzed using Principal Component Analysis to explore correlations. We find that SNe IIP and IIL form a continuum spectroscopically, though some clustering remains. The spectral diversity is characterized mainly by two components: one continuous group with well-defined P-Cygni profiles and another with "less-regular" features likely driven by enhanced circumstellar material (CSM) interaction. Our results reveal that the spectral diversity of SNe IIP/L diminishes over time. We confirm observational correlations: steeper light-curve declines correspond to weaker spectral features, indicating that SNe IIL tend to show weaker emission and, in some cases, a lack of distinct absorption lines. These trends seemingly break down by enhanced CSM interaction that affects the P-Cygni profiles. Our data-driven method reveals underlying spectral correlations and supports a continuous distribution between IIP and IIL subtypes. This method paves the way for more refined classification algorithms.

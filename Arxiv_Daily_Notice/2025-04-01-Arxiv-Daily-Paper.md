 - **Abstract**
 Source inference for deterministic gravitational waves is a computationally demanding task in LISA. In a novel approach, we investigate the capability of Gaussian Processes to learn the posterior surface in order to reconstruct individual signal posteriors. We use GPry, which automates this reconstruction through active learning, using a very small number of likelihood evaluations, without the need for pretraining. We benchmark GPry against the cutting-edge nested sampler nessai, by injecting individually three signals on LISA noisy data simulated with Balrog: a white dwarf binary (DWD), a stellar-mass black hole binary (stBHB), and a super-massive black hole binary (SMBHB). We find that GPry needs $\mathcal O(10^{-2})$ fewer likelihood evaluations to achieve an inference accuracy comparable to nessai, with Jensen-Shannon divergence $D_{\scriptscriptstyle \mathrm{JS}} \lesssim 0.01$ for the DWD, and $D_{\scriptscriptstyle \mathrm{JS}} \lesssim 0.05$ for the SMBHB. Lower accuracy is found for the less Gaussian posterior of the stBHB: $D_{\scriptscriptstyle \mathrm{JS}} \lesssim 0.2$. Despite the overhead costs of GPry, we obtain a speed-up of $\mathcal O(10^2)$ for the slowest cases of stBHB and SMBHB. In conclusion, active-learning Gaussian process frameworks show great potential for rapid LISA parameter inference, especially for costly likelihoods, enabling suppression of computational costs without the trade-off of approximations in the calculations.

 - **Abstract**
 Hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) are among the most energetic explosions in the universe, reaching luminosities up to 100 times greater than those of normal supernovae. Detailed spectral analysis hold the potential to reveal their progenitors and underlying energy sources. This paper presents the largest compilation of SLSN photospheric spectra to date, encompassing data from ePESSTO+, the FLEET search and all published spectra up to December 2022. The dataset includes a total of 974 spectra of 234 SLSNe. By constructing average phase binned spectra, we find SLSNe initially exhibit high temperatures (10000 to 11000 K), with blue continua and weak lines. A rapid transformation follows, as temperatures drop to 5000 to 6000 K by 40 days post peak, leading to stronger P-Cygni features. These averages also suggest a fraction of SLSNe may contain some He at explosion. Variance within the dataset is slightly reduced when defining the phase of spectra relative to explosion, rather than peak, and normalising to the population's median e-folding time. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) supports this, requiring fewer components to explain the same level of variation when binning data by scaled days from explosion, suggesting a more homogeneous grouping. Using PCA and K-Means clustering, we identify outlying objects with unusual spectroscopic evolution and evidence for energy input from interaction, but find not support for groupings of two or more statistically significant subpopulations. We find Fe II {\lambda}5169 lines velocities closely track the radius implied from blackbody fits, indicating formation near the photosphere. We also confirm a correlation between velocity and velocity gradient, which can be explained if all SLSNe are in homologous expansion but with different scale velocities. This behaviour aligns with expectations for an internal powering mechanism.

 - **Abstract**
 Motivated by JWST observations of dense, clumpy and clustered high redshift star formation, we simulate the hierarchical assembly of nine $M_{\mathrm{cl}}=10^6 M_\odot$ star clusters using the BIFROST N-body code. Our low metallicity models ($0.01Z_\odot$) with post-Newtonian equations of motion for black holes include evolving populations of single, binary and triple stars. Massive stars grow by stellar collisions and collapse into intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs) up to $M_\mathrm{\bullet}\sim6200 M_\odot$, stellar multiplicity boosting the IMBH masses by a factor of $2$--$3$. The IMBHs tidally disrupt (TDE) $\sim50$ stars in $10$ Myr with peak TDE rates of $\Gamma\sim10^{-5}$ yr$^{-1}$ per cluster. These IMBHs are natural seeds for supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and the hierarchical assembly frequently leads to $>2$ SMBH seeds per cluster and their rapid mergers ($t<10$ Myr). We propose that a gravitational wave (GW) driven merger of IMBHs with $1000 M_\odot \lesssim M_\bullet \lesssim 10000 M_\odot$ with comparable masses is a characteristic GW fingerprint of SMBH seed formation at redshifts $z>10$, and IMBH formation in similar environments at lower redshifts. Massive star clusters provide a unique environment for the early Universe GW studies for the next-generation GW observatories including the Einstein Telescope and the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna.

 - **Abstract**
 Proxima Centauri (Cen) has been the subject of many flaring studies due to its proximity and potential to host habitable planets. The discovery of millimeter flares from this M dwarf with ALMA has opened a new window into the flaring process and the space-weather environments of exoplanets like Proxima b. Using a total of ~50 hours of ALMA observations of Proxima Cen at 1.3 mm (233 GHz), we add a new piece to the stellar flaring picture and report the first cumulative flare frequency distribution (FFD) at millimeter wavelengths of any M dwarf. We detect 463 flares ranging from energies 10$^{24}$ erg to 10$^{27}$ erg. The brightest and most energetic flare in our sample reached a flux density of 119 $\pm$ 7 mJy, increasing by a factor of 1000x the quiescent flux, and reaching an energy of 10$^{27}$ erg in the ALMA bandpass, with t$_{1/2}$~16s. From a log-log linear regression fit to the FFD, we obtain a power law index of $\alpha_\mathrm{FFD}$ = 2.92 $\pm$ 0.02, much steeper than $\alpha_\mathrm{FFD}$ values (~2) observed at X-ray to optical wavelengths. If millimeter flare rates are predictive of flare rates at extreme-UV wavelengths, the contribution of small flares to the radiation environment of Proxima b may be much higher than expected based on the shallower power-law slopes observed at optical wavelengths.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar occultations by asteroids observed from several stations are routinely used to reconstruct the asteroid's sky-plane projections. Together with the asteroid's shape model reconstructed from photometry, such occultations enable us to precisely determine its size and reveal details of its shape. When reducing occultation timings, the usual assumption is that the star has a negligible angular diameter compared to the asteroid, so it is modeled as a point source. The occultation of Betelgeuse (alpha Orionis) by asteroid (319) Leona on 12 December 2023 was a rare exception - the apparent angular diameter of the star was $\sim 50$ mas, about the same as that of the asteroid. This work aimed to reconstruct the shape and spin model of asteroid Leona. Then, the projection of that model for the time of the occultation can be computed, which is necessary to interpret the occultation timings and infer valuable information about Betelgeuse itself. We collected available photometric data of Leona, carried out new observations, and reconstructed a unique convex shape model. Using three other occultations observed in 2023, we scaled this convex model. We also reconstructed an alternative nonconvex model with the same spin parameters and size but showing some surface details that explain better one of the occultations. We confirmed the tumbling rotation state of Leona and uniquely determined the rotation period $P_\psi = 1172.2 \pm 0.3$ h and the precession period $P_\phi = 314.27 \pm 0.02$ h. The volume-equivalent diameter determined by occultations is $59.1 \pm 0.9$ km. The reconstructed shape model of Leona enabled us to compute its sky-plane projection for the time of the Betelgeuse occultation. A reliable shape model can be used to interpret the observed occultation of Betelgeuse by Leona.

          Irradiated Atmospheres III : Radiative-Convective-Mixing Equilibrium for Non-Grey Picket-Fence Model

 - **Abstract**
 The non-grey picket-fence model predicts more accurately the temperatures in low-density regions compared to semi-grey models. This study investigates how the vertical mixing and convection fluxes modify the picket-fence model. The usual radiative-convective-equilibrium (RCE) is now extended to radiative-convective-mixing-equilibrium (RCME). The temperature profile, characterized by an increase with pressure in the upper region and an inversion in the lower, is influenced by Rosseland opacity, spectral bands, and chemical composition. The atmosphere consists of five distinct layers: a pseudo-adiabatic zone shaped by mixing flux, two convective layers driven by convective flux with a smaller adiabatic gradient, and two radiative layers. In scenarios with lower Rosseland opacity, vertical mixing significantly reduces the width of temperature inversion, counteracting the cooling effect of the convective layers and driving the deep convective layer inward. The convective flux lowers the upper temperature and expands the upper convective layer. In the low-Rosseland-opacity five-band model, these fluxes significantly cool the mid-atmosphere when temperature increases with pressure, enlarging the pseudo-adiabatic region. Without TiO/VO, the pseudo-adiabatic region shrinks, indicating that TiO/VO enhances the mixing effect. Moreover, less mixing intensity is essential to maintain a stable five-layer structure. Therefore, future studies of chemical equilibrium with multi-frequency atmospheric opacity should clearly define the constraints on vertical mixing.

          MIRACLE I.: Unveiling the Multi-Phase, Multi-Scale physical properties of the Active Galaxy NGC 424 with MIRI, MUSE, and ALMA

 - **Abstract**
 We present the analysis of the multi-phase gas properties in the Seyfert II galaxy NGC 424, using spatially resolved spectroscopic data from JWST/MIRI, part of the Mid-InfraRed Activity of Circumnuclear Line Emission (MIRACLE) program, as well as VLT/MUSE and ALMA. We trace the properties of the multi-phase medium, from cold and warm molecular gas to hot ionised gas, using emission lines such as CO(2-1), H2 S(1), [OIII]5007, [NeIII]15, and [NeV]14. These lines reveal the intricate interplay between the different gas phases within the circumnuclear region, spanning approximately 1.4x1.4 kpc^2, with a resolution of 10 pc. Exploiting the multi-wavelength and multi-scale observations of gas emission we model the galaxy disc rotation curve from scales of a few parsec up to 5 kpc from the nucleus and infer a dynamical mass of 1.09\pm0.08x10^10 M_{\odot} with a disc scale radius of 0.48\pm0.02 kpc. We detect a compact ionised outflow with velocities up to 10^3 km/s, traced by the [OIII], [NeIII], and [NeV] transitions, with no evidence of cold or warm molecular outflows. We suggest that the ionised outflow might be able to inject a significant amount of energy into the circumnuclear region, potentially hindering the formation of a molecular wind, as the molecular gas is observed to be denser and less diffuse. The combined multi-band observations also reveal, in all gas phases, a strong enhancement of the gas velocity dispersion directed along the galaxy minor axis, perpendicular to the high-velocity ionised outflow, and extending up to 1 kpc from the nucleus. Our findings suggest that the outflow might play a key role in such enhancement by injecting energy into the host disc and perturbing the ambient material.

          Dust-void evolution driven by turbulent dust flux can induce runaway migration of Earth-mass planets

 - **Abstract**
 Torques from asymmetric dust structures (so-called dust-void and filamentary structures) formed around low-mass planets embedded in a non turbulent dust-gas disk can exceed the torques produced by the gas disk component, then governing the planet's orbital dynamics. Here, we investigate how these structures (hence the dust torque) change when the effect of turbulent dust diffusion and dust feedback are included, and the direct implications on the migration of Earth-like planets. Using the \textsc{Fargo3D} code, we perform 2D and 3D multifluid hydrodynamic simulations, focusing on a non-migrating planet with the mass $M_p=1.5\,M_\oplus$ in 2D and on migrating planets with $M_p\in[1.5,12]\,M_\oplus$ in 3D. We vary the $\delta$-dimensionless diffusivity parameter in the range $[0,3\times10^{-3}]$ and consider three different Stokes numbers $\mathrm{St}=\{0.04,0.26,0.55\}$, which are representative of the gas, transitional and gravity-dominated regimes, respectively. In our 2D models, we find that turbulent diffusion of dust prevents the formation of the dust-void and filamentary structures when $\delta>3\times10^{-4}$. Otherwise, dust structures survive turbulent diffusion flow. However, dust and total torques become positive only in transitional and gravity-dominated regimes. In our 3D models, we find that the dust-void is drastically modified and the high-density ring-shaped barrier delineating the dust-void disappears if $\delta\gtrsim10^{-4} $, due to the effect of dust turbulent diffusion along with the back-reaction of the dust. For all values of $\delta$, the filament in front of the planet is replaced by a low-density trench. Remarkably, as we allow the planets to migrate, the evolving dust-void can drive either runaway migration or outward (inward) oscillatory-torque migration. Our study thus suggests that low-mass Earth-like planets can undergo runaway migration in dusty disks.

 - **Abstract**
 Early B-type stars ($M_i=8-15$ M$_\odot$) are frequently in multiple systems, as evidenced by spectroscopic campaigns in the Milky Way (MW) and the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Previous studies have shown no strong metallicity dependence in the close-binary (a>10 au) fraction or orbital-period distributions between the MW's solar metallicity (Z$_\odot$) and that of the LMC (Z=0.5 Z$_\odot$). However, similar analyses in more metal-poor environments are still scarce. We focus on 309 early B-type stars (luminosity classes III-V) from the Binarity at LOw Metallicity campaign in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC, Z=0.2 Z$_\odot$) using VLT/FLAMES multi-epoch spectroscopy. By applying binary detection criteria consistent with previous works, we identify 153 stars (91 SB1, 59 SB2, 3 SB3) exhibiting significant radial-velocity (RV) variations, resulting in an observed multiplicity fraction of $f^{obs}_{mult}=50\pm3\%$. Using Monte Carlo simulations to account for observational biases, we infer an intrinsic close-binary fraction of $f_{mult}=80\pm8\%$. A Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis of the peak-to-peak RV distribution ($\Delta{\rm RV}_{\rm max}$) confirms a high multiplicity fraction of $f_{mult}=78\pm5\%$. These findings suggest a possible anti-correlation between metallicity and the fraction of close B-type binaries, with the SMC multiplicity fraction significantly exceeding previous measurements in the LMC and MW. The enhanced fraction of close binaries at SMC's low metallicity may have broad implications for massive-star evolution in the early Universe. More frequent mass transfer and envelope stripping could boost the production of exotic transients, stripped supernovae, gravitational-wave progenitors, and sustained UV ionising flux, potentially affecting cosmic reionisation. Theoretical predictions of binary evolution under metal-poor conditions will provide a key test of our results.

 - **Abstract**
 We report new branching fraction measurements for 156 ultraviolet and optical transitions of Gd II. These transitions range in wavelength (wavenumber) from 2574 to 6766 Angstroms (38838 - 14777 cm-1) and originate in one odd-parity and 11 even-parity upper levels. Nine of the 12 levels, accounting for 126 of the 156 transitions, are studied for the first time. Branching fractions are determined for three levels studied previously for the purpose of comparison. The levels studied for the first time are high lying, ranging in energy from 36845 to 40774 cm-1. The branching fractions are determined from emission spectra from two different high-resolution spectrometers. These are combined with radiative lifetimes reported in an earlier study to produce a set of transition probabilities and log(gf) values with accuracy ranging from 5% to 30%. Comparison is made to experimental and theoretical transition probabilities from the literature where such data exist. Abundances derived from these new log(gf) values for 21 Gd II lines in two metal-poor stars yield results consistent with previous studies, and they demonstrate that the new log(gf) values can be used in stellar abundance analysis as a self-consistent extension of previous work.

 - **Abstract**
 Some stars orbiting supermassive black holes (SMBH) are expected to undergo a gravitational-wave (GW)-driven inspiral and initiate mass transfer on nearly circular orbits. However, the stability and duration of such phases remain unexplored. In this work, we focus on the evolution of a low-mass, radiative-envelope subgiant star being stripped by an SMBH. We find that such systems can undergo a long-lasting, stable mass-transfer phase, even if none of the angular momentum of the transferred material returns to the orbit to counterbalance the GW-driven decay. We show an example where a 2 Msun subgiant is stripped before entering the LISA band and loses almost its entire hydrogen envelope. The remaining helium core undergoes a prolonged GW-driven inspiral, becoming a loud LISA source. If formed in our galaxy, the system would be detectable for several hundred thousand years, ultimately reaching extreme signal-to-noise ratios of a million. Hydrogen shell flashes in the residual envelope cause temporary radial expansions of the stripped star. As a result, a few additional phases of rapid mass transfer occur at orbital periods of 20 - 30 hours. Eventually, the core possibly undergoes circular partial tidal disruption at an orbital period of ~10 minutes, corresponding to a GW emission frequency of a few mHz. We estimate a chance of about 1% that such a detectable LISA source exists in our own galactic center. The loud final GW transient may lead to a few detections reaching as far as ~1 Gpc, including, e.g., the Abell clusters.

          Measurement of Methane Line Broadening in Hot Hydrogen/Helium Atmospheres at $λ$ = 1.60-1.63 μm for Substellar Object Spectroscopy

 - **Abstract**
 Recent high-dispersion spectroscopy from ground-based telescopes and high-precision spectroscopy from space observatories have enabled atmospheric observations of substellar objects, such as brown dwarfs and hot gaseous exoplanets, with sufficient precision to make ambient gas differences in molecular line broadening a significant factor. In this paper, we experimentally measured the pressure broadening of methane in a high-temperature hydrogen-helium background atmosphere in the H band, which had not been previously measured. The experiment used glass cells, inserted in a tube furnace, filled with methane in a hydrogen-helium background atmosphere or pure methane gas. Spectra were obtained at four temperatures ranging from room temperature to 1000 K, in the wavelength range 1.60-1.63 $\mu$m, using a tunable laser, yielding eight high-resolution spectra in total. A full Bayesian analysis was performed on the obtained spectra, using the differentiable spectral model ExoJAX and the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo for inferring a large number of parameters, allowing us to infer the H2/He pressure broadening for 22 transitions mainly in the R-branch of the 2$\nu_3$ band. As a result, we found a temperature exponent of approximately 0.27 and a reference width at 296 K of around 0.040 for $ J_{lower} $ = 13-20. This temperature dependency is much milder than that provided by the molecular database ExoMol, yielding a line width approximately 5-45% smaller than ExoMol at 296 K, but similar at 1000 K. Our results suggest the need for further accumulation of experimental data for spectral analysis of substellar objects with hydrogen-helium atmospheres.

 - **Abstract**
 The dark and dynamic parts of the Galaxy, including the bulk shape and movement of the Galactic Bulge and characteristics of dark compact object populations, such as a hypothetical population of primordial black holes (PBHs), are difficult to study directly by their very nature, but are critical to our understanding of the universe. Fortunately, all of these mysteries can be uniquely studied via gravitational microlensing, a method of astronomical detection that traces mass and dynamics as opposed to light. Using the OGLE-IV microlensing survey bulge fields, we apply a Bayesian hierarchical model to jointly infer properties of the Galaxy, the characteristics of compact objects, and and test PBHs with an extended mass distribution as a test PBHs as a viable explanation of dark matter, extending work focused on the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds, both with much lower event-rates. We infer a preference within the data for a lower patternspeed in the galactic model and a wider mass spectrum for compact objects. When adding a PBH component to the favored astrophysical model from our initial investigations, we find a Bayes factor of $\ln\mathcal{B} = 20.23$ preferring the PBH model. Upon further investigation of these results, we find the critical feature in the PBH model to be the velocity distribution, which is fundamentally different than the velocity distribution of astrophysical objects and uniquely able to explain a large number of low parallax, low timescale microlensing events. Noting that this effect is not unique to PBHs, we consider the implications of these results as applied to a hypothetical population of PBHs and discuss alternative explanations, including a variety of other possible astrophysical and survey or analysis systematics.

          A Main Sequence CH-star in the globular cluster M55 (NGC 6809)

 - **Abstract**
 Spectra have been obtained with multi-fibre instrument 2dF on the Anglo-Australian Telescope of 89 candidate main sequence stars in the globular cluster M55 (NGC 6809). Radial velocities and Gaia proper motions confirm 72 candidates as cluster members. Among these stars one stands out as having a substantially stronger G-band (CH) than the rest of the member sample. The star is a dwarf carbon star that most likely acquired the high carbon abundance ([C/Fe] approx 1.2 +/- 0.2) via mass transfer from a 1-3 Msun binary companion (now a white dwarf) during its AGB phase of evolution. Interestingly, M55 also contains a CH-star that lies on the cluster red giant branch -- the low central concentration/low density of this cluster presumably allows the survival of binaries that would otherwise be disrupted in denser systems. The existence of carbon stars in six other globular clusters is consistent with this hypothesis, while the origin of the carbon-enhanced star in M15 (NGC 7078) is attributed to a merger process similar to that proposed for the origin of the carbon-rich R~stars.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the evolution of star clusters containing intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) of $300$ to $5000\ \mathrm{M}_\odot$, focusing on the formation and evolution of IMBH-stellar mass black holes (SBHs; $M_{\rm BH} \lesssim 10^2\ \mathrm{M}_\odot$) binaries. Dense stellar systems like globular clusters (GCs) or nuclear star clusters offer unique laboratories for studying the existence and impact of IMBHs. IMBHs residing in GCs have been under speculation for decades, with their broad astrophysical implications for the cluster's dynamical evolution, stellar population, GW signatures, among others. While existing GW observatories such as the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (aLIGO) target binaries with relatively modest mass ratios, $q \lesssim 10$, future observatories such as the Einstein Telescope (ET) and the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will detect intermediate-mass ratio inspirals (IMRIs) with $q > 10$. This work explores the potential for detecting IMRIs adopting these upcoming telescopes. For our experiments, we perform multiple direct $N$-body simulations with IMBHs utilizing Nbody6++GPU, after implementing the GW merger schemes for IMBHs. We then study the statistical properties of the resulting IMRIs, such as the event rates and orbital properties. Assuming that IMRIs with a signal-to-noise ratio $S/N > 8$ are detectable, we derive the following detection rates for each observatory: $\lesssim 0.02\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ for aLIGO, $\sim 101 - 355 \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ for ET, $\sim 186 - 200 \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ for LISA, $\sim 0.24 - 0.34 \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ for aSOGRO, and $\sim 3880 - 4890 \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ for DECIGO. Our result confirms the capability of detecting IMRIs with future GW telescopes.

 - **Abstract**
 If sub-GeV Dark matter(DM) annihilates to the charged particles such as $e^+ e^-$, $\mu^+ \mu^-$, or $\pi^+ \pi^-$, it generates an additional source of electrons and positrons in the cosmic ray (CR) population within our Milky Way. During propagation, these secondary electrons and positrons undergo reacceleration processes, boosting their energies to the GeV scale. Observatories like AMS-02 can detect these high-energy particles, enabling constraints on the properties of sub-GeV DM. By analyzing AMS-02 electron and positron data, the 95\% upper limits on the DM annihilation cross-section have been established in the range of $10^{-28}$ to $10^{-27}$ cm$^3\,$s$^{-1}$, corresponding to DM masses ranging from 100 MeV to 1 GeV. Meanwhile, MeV telescopes will provide complementary constraints on DM properties by detecting photon emissions from such annihilation processes. Notably, the sensitivity of future MeV gamma-ray observatories is projected to approach or match the constraints derived from CR data.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the result of two binary classifier ensembled neural networks to identify catastrophic outliers for photo-z estimates within the COSMOS field utilizing only 8 and 5 photometric band passes, respectively. Our neural networks can correctly classify 55.6% and 33.3% of the true positives with few to no false positives. These methods can be used to reduce the errors caused by the errors in redshift estimates, particularly at high redshift. When applied to a larger data set with only photometric data available, our 8 band pass network increased the number of objects with a photo-z greater than 5 from 0.1% to 1.6%, and our 5 band pass network increased the number of objects with a photo-z greater than 5 from 0.2% to 1.8%.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the results obtained with a XMM-Newton observation, performed in April 2023, of the poorly known Galactic Be X-ray binary pulsar 4U 0728-25. It was revealed at a flux level (not corrected for the absorption) $f_{\rm X}$(0.2-12 keV) = 1.7$\times 10^{-11}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, which implies an unabsorbed source luminosity $L_{\rm X} \simeq 1.3 \times 10^{35}$ erg s$^{-1}$: this is the minimum luminosity ever observed for this source. We measured a pulse period $P_{\rm spin}$ = 103.301(5) s, a value $\simeq $ 0.15 % longer than that estimated in 2016 with AstroSat. The pulse profile shows a broad single peak at all energies, with a limited energy dependence and a small increase in the pulsed fraction with energy. The time-averaged EPIC spectrum can be described equally well by four different emission models, either with a single non-thermal component (a partially covered power law or a cut-off power law), or with a thermal component in addition to the non-thermal one (a black body plus a power law, or a collisionally ionised gas plus a cut-off power law). All of them provided an equally good fit and, in the case of the power-law plus black-body model, the thermal component is characterized by a high temperature ($kT_{\rm BB} \simeq$ 1.5 keV) and a small size ($R_{\rm BB} \simeq$ 240 m), comparable with that of the neutron-star polar caps. A spectral variability along the pulse phase is present, which suggests a flux variation of the black-body component. These results show that, for its luminosity level, flux variabilty over long time scales, and spectral properties, 4U 0728-25 is very similar to most of the persistent Be X-ray binaries. Therefore, it can be considered a member of this class of sources.

 - **Abstract**
 WISEA J181006.18-101000.5 (WISE1810) is the nearest metal-poor ultracool dwarf to the Sun. It has a low effective temperature and has been classified as extreme early-T subdwarf. However, methane, the characteristic molecule of the spectral class T, was not seen in the previous low-resolution spectrum. Using the 10.4-m Gran Telescopio Canarias, we collected a high-quality JHK-band intermediate-resolution R~5000 spectrum of WISE1810, in which a 17+/-6 ppm of methane is clearly detected, while carbon monoxide is absent. Based on customly computed ATMO2020++ model, we estimated an effective temperature of 1000+/-100 K, a high surface gravity of log g = 5.5+/-0.5 dex, a carbon abundance [C/H]=-1.5+/-0.2 dex, inferring [Fe/H]=-1.7+/-0.2 dex. Potassium is not seen in our data, and the upper limits of pseudo-equivalent width of J-band atomic lines are at least 25 to 60 times weaker than those measured from solar-metallicity early-T counterparts. We measured a heliocentric radial velocity of -83+/-13 km/s, inferring that WISE1810 is more likely a thick disk member.

 - **Abstract**
 $\require{mediawiki-texvc}$Galactic outflows shape galaxy evolution, but their mass, energy, and momentum transfer remain uncertain. High-resolution spectroscopy can help, but systematic discrepancies hinder model interpretation. In this study, we evaluate the performance of semi-analytical line transfer (SALT) and empirical partial covering models (PCMs) to recover the properties of outflows in the FIRE-2 simulation suite from synthetic Si II lines (1190 $Å$, 1193 $Å$, 1260 $Å$, 1304 $Å$, 1527 $Å$). When applicable, we assess each model's ability to recover mass, energy, and momentum outflow rates, as well as radial density and velocity profiles, column densities, and flow geometries. We find that the PCM underestimates column densities by 1.3 dex on average in the range $15 < \log N\ [\text{cm}^{-2}] < 17$ with dispersion 1.3 dex. We attribute this bias to instrumental smoothing. Since the PCM underestimates column densities, it also underestimates flow rates, though its predictions are independent of radius, with a dispersion of 0.55 dex. We detect no bias in the SALT estimates of the column density with dispersion 1.3 dex. When the velocity and density field obey power laws, SALT can constrain the mass, momentum, and energy outflow rates to 0.36 (0.63), 0.56 (0.56), and 0.97 (0.80) dex at $0.15(0.30)R_{\text{vir}}$, respectively. However, certain profiles in FIRE-2 fall outside the SALT framework, where the model breaks down. We find that SALT effectively tracks the flow geometry, capturing the temporal evolution of the photon escape fraction that is out of phase with the star formation rate, fully consistent with hydrodynamic simulations. We advocate for integral field unit spectroscopy to better constrain flow properties.

          Auto- and cross-correlations for multiple images of corotating hotspots in accretion disks

 - **Abstract**
 Recent horizon-scale observations of the Sgr A* might open up a new window to study spacetime geometry and accretion matter in the strong-field regime of gravity. Due to the short gravitational timescale for Sgr A*, variable emissions near the galactic center are expected in the observations, including variability in the Sgr A* images and flare motions within ten times gravitational radius. In this paper, we investigate the spatiotemporal auto- and cross-correlations for multiple images of a long-lived corotating hotspot near the black hole. Using the recently developed efficient ray-tracing scheme for point-like sources, we extensively consider multiple images from primary to eighth-order in the correlations. We show that these correlations exhibit a repeated inclined band-like structure in the $\Delta \Phi$-$\Delta t$ plane. And there is a periodic modulation of width of the correlated bands, with the maximum bandwidth increasing with the inclination angles. The point-slope of correlated bands is determined by the lapse in azimuthal angle and time of multiple images, as well as the apparent rotation speed of hotspots. By comparing correlations for lower-order with those for higher-order images, it is found that the fixed points for cross-correlations between lower-order images depend on the orbital configurations of hotspots. It challenges the use of correlations for lower-order images to infer black hole geometries. Additionally, we also examine the influence from hotspot shapes based on semi-analytical formulas. Although the emission shape can significantly influence light curves, it does not change the correlated bands of the correlations.

 - **Abstract**
 This study introduces a time-based cleaning method for H.E.S.S. using CT5 in monoscopic mode and presents an optimization workflow for image-cleaning algorithms to enhance telescope sensitivity while minimizing systematic biases. We evaluate three methods - tail-cut cleaning and two flavours of time-based cleaning TIME3D and TIME4D - and find best-cut configurations for two cases: optimal overall sensitivity and minimal energy threshold. TIME3D achieves a $\sim 15\%$ improvement with regard to the standard tail-cut cleaning for $E < 300$ GeV, with a $\sim 200\%$ improvement for the first energy bin (36.5 GeV < E < 64.9 GeV), providing a more stable performance across a wider energy range by preserving more signal. TIME4D achieves a $\sim 20\%$ improvement at low energies due to superior NSB noise suppression, allowing for an enhanced capability of detecting sources at the lowest energies. We demonstrate that using first-order estimations of the performance of a cleaning, such as image size retaining or NSB pixel reduction, cannot provide a full picture of the expected result in the final sensitivity. Beyond expanding the effective area at low energies, sensitivity improvement requires precise event reconstruction, including improved energy and directional accuracy. Enhanced gamma-hadron separation and optimized pre-selection cuts further boost sensitivity. The proposed pipeline fully explores this, providing a fair and robust comparison between different cleaning methods. The method is general and can be applied to other IACT systems like VERITAS, MAGIC. By advancing data-driven image cleaning, this work lays the groundwork for detecting faint astrophysical sources and deepening our understanding of high-energy cosmic phenomena.

 - **Abstract**
 The Near-Infrared Spectrometer and Photometer onboard the Euclid space mission has obtained near-infrared (NIR) slitless spectra of millions of objects, including hundreds of ultracool dwarfs. Euclid observations retrieve images and spectra simultaneously. This observing mode marks a new era in the discovery of new objects, such as L- and T-type dwarfs, which can be found from direct identification through the H2O and CH4 absorption bands. NISP spectral resolution (R~450) is enough to classify the objects by the spectral type using known standard templates. Q1 provided more than 4 million NIR spectra in one visit to the Euclid Deep Fields. The large amount of spectra released in these fields allowed us to: a) confirm almost half of the UCD photometric candidates by Zang et al. (2024); b) discover at least 10 new late L- and T-type dwarfs searching directly in the spectra database; and c) spectroscopically confirm one hundred more candidates from a new photometric selection conducted by Zerjal et al. (in prep.). We present a preliminary list of Euclid UCD templates built by the combination of the best spectra from all these searches. We include the first spectral analysis of confirmed UCDs from Q1 data; spectral classifications; determination of effective temperatures; H2O, CH4, and NH3 spectral indices; and measurements of the KI absorption doublet. This paper is a first step in the study of Euclid UCDs and will be improved with each subsequent data release.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar intensity interferometry consists in measuring the correlation of the light intensity fluctuations at two telescopes observing the same star. The amplitude of the correlation is directly related to the luminosity distribution of the star, which would be unresolved by a single telescope. This technique is based on the well-known Hanbury Brown and Twiss effect. After its discovery in the 1950s, it was used in astronomy until the 1970s, and then replaced by direct (``amplitude'') interferometry, which is much more sensitive, but also much more demanding. However, in recent years, intensity interferometry has undergone a revival. In this article, we present a summary of the state-of-the-art, and we discuss in detail the signal-to-noise ratio of intensity interferometry in the framework of photon-counting detection.

 - **Abstract**
 We explore transformations of the Friedman-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric and cosmological parameters that align with observational data, aiming to gain insights into potential extensions of standard cosmological models. We modify the FLRW metric by introducing a scaling factor, $e^{2\Theta(a)}$ (the cosmological scaling function, CSF), which alters the standard relationship between cosmological redshift and the cosmic scale factor without affecting angular measurements or Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies. Using data from DESI Year 1, Pantheon+ supernovae, and the Planck CMB temperature power spectrum, we constrain both the CSF and cosmological parameters through a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach. Our results indicate that the CSF model fits observational data with a lower Hubble constant (although it is compatible with the value given by Planck 2018 within 1$\sigma$) and is predominantly dark-matter-dominated. Additionally, the CSF model produces temperature and lensing power spectra similar to those predicted by the standard model, though with lower values in the CSF model at large scales. We have also checked that when fitting a CSF model without dark energy to the data, we obtain a more negative conformal function. This suggests that the CSF model may offer hints about missing elements and opens up a new avenue for exploring physical interpretations of cosmic acceleration.

 - **Abstract**
 Violent relaxation (VR) is often regarded as the mechanism leading stellar systems to collisionless meta equilibrium via rapid changes in the collective potential. We investigate the role of chaotic instabilities on single particle orbits in leading to nearly-invariant phase-space distributions, aiming at disentangling it from the chaos induced by collective oscillations in the self-consistent potential. We explore as function of the systems size (i.e. number of particles $N$) the chaoticity in terms of the largest Lyapunov exponent of test trajectories in a simplified model of gravitational cold collapse, mimicking a $N-$body calculation via a time dependent smooth potential and a noise-friction process accounting for the discreteness effects. A new numerical method to evaluate effective Lyapunov exponents for stochastic models is presented and tested. We find that the evolution of the phase-space of independent trajectories reproduces rather well what observed in self-consistent $N-$body simulations of dissipationless collapses. The chaoticity of test orbits rapidly decreases with $N$ for particles that remain weakly bounded in the model potential, while it decreases with different power laws for more bound orbits, consistently with what observed in previous self-consistent $N$-body simulations. The largest Lyapunov exponents of ensembles of orbits starting from initial conditions uniformly sampling the accessible phase-space are somewhat constant for $N\lesssim 10^9$, while decreases towards the continuum limit with a power-law trend. Moreover, our numerical results appear to confirm the trend of a specific formulation of dynamical entropy and its relation with Lyapunov time scales.

 - **Abstract**
 We show that using a Taylor expansion for the dark energy equation-of-state parameter and limiting it to the zeroth and first-order terms, i.e., the so-called Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization, instead of allowing for higher-order terms and then marginalizing over them, adds extra information not present in the data and leads to markedly different and potentially misleading conclusions. Fixing the higher-order terms to zero, one concludes that vacuum energy that is currently non-dynamical (e.g., the cosmological constant) is excluded at several $\sigma$ significance as the explanation of cosmic acceleration, even in Dark Energy Spectroscopic Survey (DESI) DR1 data. Meanwhile, instead marginalizing over the higher-order terms shows that we know neither the current dark energy equation of state nor its current rate of change well enough to make such a claim. This issue has become more prominent now with the recent release of high-quality Stage IV galaxy survey data. The results of analyses using simple Taylor expansions should be interpreted with great care.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic voids are low-mass-density regions on intergalactic scales. They are where cosmic expansion and acceleration are most dominant, important places to understand and analyse for cosmology. This entry summarises theoretical underpinnings of cosmic voids, and explores several observational aspects, statistics and applications of voids. The density profiles, velocity profiles, evolution history and the abundances of voids are shown to encode information about cosmology, including the sum of neutrino masses and the law of gravity. These properties manifest themselves into a wide range of observables, including the void distribution function, redshift-space distortions, gravitational lensing and their imprints on the cosmic-microwave background. We explain how each of these observables work, and summarise their applications in observations. We also comment on the possible impact of a local void on the interpretations of the expansion of the Universe, and discuss opportunities and challenges for the research subject of cosmic voids.

 - **Abstract**
 Motivated by misaligned discs observed in eccentric orbit Be/X-ray binaries, we examine the evolution of a retrograde disc around one component of an eccentric binary with hydrodynamic simulations, $n$-body simulations and linear theory. Forced eccentricity growth from the eccentric orbit binary causes the initially circular disk to undergo eccentricity oscillations. A retrograde disc becomes more radially extended, more highly eccentric and undergoes more rapid apsidal precession compared to a prograde disc. We find that a retrograde disc can be subject to disc breaking where the disc forms two rings with different eccentricities and longitude of periastrons while remaining coplanar. This could have implications for the lightcurves and the X-ray outbursts observed in Be/X-ray binaries.

 - **Abstract**
 The sub-Neptune GJ 1214b has an infamously flat transmission spectrum, likely due to thick aerosols in its atmosphere. A recent JWST MIRI spectroscopic phase curve of GJ 1214 b added to this picture, suggesting a highly reflective and metal-rich atmosphere. Using a 3D General Circulation Model with both photochemical hazes and condensate clouds, we characterize how different aerosol types affect the atmospheric structure of GJ 1214 b and manifest in its spectroscopic phase curve. Additionally, we reanalyze the original GJ 1214 b JWST phase curve. The reanalysis shows a hotter nightside, similar dayside temperature, and a lower, but still elevated, Bond albedo (0.42 +/- 0.11) than the original results. We find that a scenario with both clouds and hazes is most consistent with the JWST phase curve. Reflective clouds or hazes are needed to explain the large Bond albedo, and hazes or a super-solar metallicity help account for the several hundred Kelvin day-night temperature difference measured by the phase curve.

 This study examines the mineral composition of volcanic samples similar to lunar materials, focusing on olivine and pyroxene. Using hyperspectral imaging from 400 to 1000 nm, we created data cubes to analyze the reflectance characteristics of samples from samples from Vulcano, a volcanically active island in the Aeolian Archipelago, north of Sicily, Italy, categorizing them into nine regions of interest and analyzing spectral data for each. We applied various unsupervised clustering algorithms, including K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, GMM, and Spectral Clustering, to classify the spectral profiles. Principal Component Analysis revealed distinct spectral signatures associated with specific minerals, facilitating precise identification. Clustering performance varied by region, with K-Means achieving the highest silhouette-score of 0.47, whereas GMM performed poorly with a score of only 0.25. Non-negative Matrix Factorization aided in identifying similarities among clusters across different methods and reference spectra for olivine and pyroxene. Hierarchical clustering emerged as the most reliable technique, achieving a 94\% similarity with the olivine spectrum in one sample, whereas GMM exhibited notable variability. Overall, the analysis indicated that both Hierarchical and K-Means methods yielded lower errors in total measurements, with K-Means demonstrating superior performance in estimated dispersion and clustering. Additionally, GMM showed a higher root mean square error compared to the other models. The RMSE analysis confirmed K-Means as the most consistent algorithm across all samples, suggesting a predominance of olivine in the Vulcano region relative to pyroxene. This predominance is likely linked to historical formation conditions similar to volcanic processes on the Moon, where olivine-rich compositions are common in ancient lava flows and impact melt rocks.

 - **Abstract**
 Cometary impacts play an important role in the early evolution of Earth, and other terrestrial exoplanets. Here, we present a numerical model for the interaction of weak, low-density cometary impactors with planetary atmospheres, which includes semi-analytical parameterisations for the ablation, deformation, and fragmentation of comets. Deformation is described by a pancake model, as is appropriate for weakly cohesive, low-density bodies, while fragmentation is driven by the growth of Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities. The model retains sufficient computational simplicity to investigate cometary impacts across a large parameter space, and permits simple description of the key physical processes controlling the interaction of comets with the atmosphere. We apply our model to two case studies. First, we consider the cometary delivery of prebiotic feedstock molecules. This requires the survival of comets during atmospheric entry, which is determined by three parameters: the comet's initial radius, bulk density, and atmospheric surface density. There is a sharp transition between the survival and catastrophic fragmentation of comets at a radius of about 150m, which increases with increasing atmospheric surface density and decreasing cometary density. Second, we consider the deposition of mass and kinetic energy in planetary atmospheres during cometary impacts, which determines the strength and duration of any atmospheric response. We demonstrate that mass loss is dominated by fragmentation, not ablation. Small comets deposit their entire mass within a fraction of an atmospheric scale height, at an altitude determined by their initial radius. Large comets lose only a small fraction of their mass to ablation in the lower atmosphere.

 Measuring the atmospheric composition of hazy sub-Neptunes like GJ~1214b through transmission spectroscopy is difficult because of the degeneracy between mean molecular weight and haziness. It has been proposed that phase curve observations can break this degeneracy because of the relationship between mean molecular weight (MMW) and phase curve amplitude. However, photochemical hazes can strongly affect phase curve amplitudes as well. We present a large set of GCM simulations of the sub-Neptune GJ~1214b that include photochemical hazes with varying atmospheric composition, haze opacity and haze optical properties. In our simulations, photochemical hazes cause temperature changes of up to 200~K, producing thermal inversions and cooling deeper regions. This results in increased phase curve amplitudes and adds a considerable scatter to the phase curve amplitude--metallicity relationship. However, we find that if the haze production rate is high enough to significantly alter the phase curve, the secondary eclipse spectrum will exhibit either emission features or strongly muted absorption features. Thus, the combination of a white-light phase curve and a secondary eclipse spectrum can successfully distinguish between a hazy, lower MMW and a clear, high MMW scenario.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent analyses of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations from CAMELS have shown that machine learning models can predict the parameter describing the total matter content of the universe, $\Omega_{\rm m}$, from the features of a single galaxy. We investigate the statistical properties of two of these simulation suites, IllustrisTNG and ASTRID, confirming that $\Omega_{\rm m}$ induces a strong displacement on the distribution of galaxy features. We also observe that most other parameters have little to no effect on the distribution, except for the stellar-feedback parameter $A_{SN1}$, which introduces some near-degeneracies that can be broken with specific features. These two properties explain the predictability of $\Omega_{\rm m}$. We use Optimal Transport to further measure the effect of parameters on the distribution of galaxy properties, which is found to be consistent with physical expectations. However, we observe discrepancies between the two simulation suites, both in the effect of $\Omega_{\rm m}$ on the galaxy properties and in the distributions themselves at identical parameter values. Thus, although $\Omega_{\rm m}$'s signature can be easily detected within a given simulation suite using just a single galaxy, applying this result to real observational data may prove significantly more challenging.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the first detection of the X-ray polarisation of the transient black hole X-ray binary IGRJ17091-3624 taken with the Imaging X-ray polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) in March 2025, and present the results of an X-ray spectro-polarimetric analysis. The polarisation was measured in the 2--8 keV band with 5.2$\sigma$ statistical confidence. We report a polarisation degree (PD) of $9.1\pm1.6$ per cent and a polarisation angle of $83^{\circ} \pm 5^{\circ}$ (errors are $1\sigma$ confidence). There is a hint of a positive correlation of PD with energy that is not statistically significant. We report that the source is in the corona-dominated hard state, which is confirmed by a hard power-law dominated spectrum with weak reflection features and the presence of a Type-C quasi-periodic oscillation at $\sim0.2$~Hz. The orientation of the emitted radio jet is not known, and so we are unable to compare it with the direction of X-ray polarization, but we predict the two to be parallel if the geometry is similar to that in Cygnus X-1 and Swift J1727.8-1613, the two hard state black hole binaries previously observed by IXPE. In the Comptonisation scenario, the high observed PD requires a very favourable geometry of the corona, a high inclination angle (supported by the presence of a dip in the light curve) and possibly a mildly relativistic outflow and/or scattering in an optically thick wind.

          Effect of irradiation model on 2D hydrodynamic simulations of self-gravitating protoplanetary discs

 - **Abstract**
 Young protoplanetary discs are expected to be gravitationally unstable, which can drive angular momentum transport as well as be a potential mechanism for planet formation. Gravitational instability is most prevalent in the outer disc where cooling timescales are short. At large radii, stellar irradiation makes a significant contribution to disc heating and is expected to suppress instability. In this study, we compare two models of implementing irradiation in 2D hydrodynamic simulations of self-gravitating discs: supplying a constant heating rate per unit mass and per unit area of the disc. In the former case, instability is quenched once the stellar irradiation becomes the dominant heating source. In the latter case, we find instability persists under high levels of irradiation, despite large values of the Toomre Q parameter, in agreement with analytic predictions. Fragmentation was able to occur in this regime with the critical cooling timescale required decreasing as irradiation is increased, corresponding to a maximum threshold for the viscosity parameter: $\alpha\sim0.03-0.09$.

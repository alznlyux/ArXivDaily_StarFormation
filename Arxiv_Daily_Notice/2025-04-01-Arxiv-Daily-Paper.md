          A formula for the area of a triangle: Useless, but explicitly in Deep Sets form

 - **Abstract**
 Any permutation-invariant function of data points $\vec{r}_i$ can be written in the form $\rho(\sum_i\phi(\vec{r}_i))$ for suitable functions $\rho$ and $\phi$. This form - known in the machine-learning literature as Deep Sets - also generates a map-reduce algorithm. The area of a triangle is a permutation-invariant function of the locations $\vec{r}_i$ of the three corners $1\leq i\leq 3$. We find the polynomial formula for the area of a triangle that is explicitly in Deep Sets form. This project was motivated by questions about the fundamental computational complexity of $n$-point statistics in cosmology; that said, no insights of any kind were gained from these results.

 - **Abstract**
 Johannes Kepler's attempt to explain the arrangement of the six innermost planets of the Solar System using his Platonic Solid Model-which postulates that planetary orbits are nested within the five Platonic solids-was ultimately unsuccessful. However, while his model failed to describe our own planetary system, Kepler was remarkably prescient in hypothesizing the existence of exoplanetary systems that might conform to this geometric framework. In this study, we analyze all known multiple exoplanet systems containing three to six planets and identify those that best match the Keplerian Platonic model. Using a semi-major-axis (SMA) ratio metric defined as the sum of squared differences between observed and theoretical semi-major-axis ratios, we find that the most well-matched three-, four-, five-, and six-planet exoplanetary systems exhibit significantly lower discrepancy values $(4.38 \times 10^{-6}, 1.05 \times 10^{-2}, 8.21 \times 10^{-2}$, and $2.43 \times 10^{-1}$, respectively) compared to the inner six planets of the Solar System at 12.68. These results demonstrate that Kepler's Platonic Model is applicable to certain exoplanetary systems, suggesting that while the Solar System does not adhere to this idealized structure, other planetary systems may be governed by underlying geometric and mathematical principles akin to Kepler's vision. This study highlights the special nature of these exoplanetary systems and their potential alignment with the Platonic five-element framework.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper explores an unexpected yet compelling parallel between the evolution of the universe, as described by cosmological eras, and the artistic evolution of Taylor Swift, delineated by her distinct album eras. By mapping key characteristics and transitions in the universe's history to corresponding themes and milestones in Swift's career, I offer a novel perspective on both. I culminate with predictions for Swift's future work and dare to ask a question of cosmic importance: Could Taylor Swift's thirteenth album hold the secret to the universe's ultimate destiny?

 - **Abstract**
 We study line driven stellar winds using multifrequency, time-dependent radiation hydrodynamics. We compute the radiation force due to lines, the so called force multiplier, using precomputed photoionization tables and a time-dependent, local SED using a three band approximation within the hydro. We find that accounting for changes in the local SED changes the global properties of the flow. This is due to a combination of a change in the available momentum in the radiation field but also due to changes in the gas/radiation coupling mediated by the force multiplier. The acceleration can be suppressed, due to attenuation of UV flux but the force multiplier itself can be enhanced due to the overall SED hardening. We do not see evidence of a changing SED leading to formation or growth of azimuthal instabilities, as this effect appears subdominant to other instabilities in the wind. The computational methods presented can be extended to other outflow problems, notably multi-temperature disc winds and shocking in Wolf-Rayet stars.

 Understanding our place in the universe is an eternal quest. Through the analysis of the 3D structures of 66 nearby open clusters using Gaia DR3 data, we discovered an intriguing pattern: most clusters show their elongation directions pointing at the Sun, suggesting that the Solar System might just be the universe's favorite spot, a cosmic feng shui hotspot! This surprising result hints at a subtle blend of geometry and geomancy.

 - **Abstract**
 Conventional frame-based cameras often struggle with limited dynamic range, leading to saturation and loss of detail when capturing scenes with significant brightness variations. Neuromorphic cameras, inspired by human retina, offer a solution by providing an inherently high dynamic range. This capability enables them to capture both bright and faint celestial objects without saturation effects, preserving details across a wide range of luminosities. This paper investigates the application of neuromorphic imaging technology for capturing celestial bodies across a wide range of flux levels. Its advantages are demonstrated through examples such as the bright planet Saturn with its faint moons and the bright star Sirius A alongside its faint companion, Sirius B.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Protoplanetary discs are formed due to the fragmentation and collapse of giant molecular cloud cores. The physical properties and structure of a formed disc are of great importance when studying the onset of planet formation processes. Aims. Starting from the isothermal collapse of a rotating Bonnor-Ebert sphere, and assuming the conservation of angular momentum, we look for the structure equations of the newly formed protoplanetary disc. We take into account the possible role of pressure gradient in forming the initial disc structure, and compare our results with those obtained from a Keplerian infall model. Our aim is to obtain initial conditions to numerically study the evolution of the gaseous and solid components of protoplanetary discs. Methods. The structure equations developed for protoplanetary discs have been derived analytically, while these equations have been solved numerically. Results. The surface density profiles of the newly formed protoplanetary discs strongly depend on the initial rotation state of the Bonnor-Ebert sphere. According to our results, for slow rotators, gravitational instabilities can develop in the early phases of disc formation, while for relatively fast rotators, the outermost regions of the resulting discs are gravitationally stable, quite massive and highly sub-Keplerian, allowing rapid dust transport to the inner disc and subsequent planet formation.

          The Laplace Surface of a Circumplanetary Disc

 - **Abstract**
 The classical Laplace surface defines the location of circular particle orbits that do not undergo nodal precession around a planet with some obliquity. Close to the planet the surface coincides with the equator of the planet, while far from the planet it coincides with the orbital plane of the planet. We determine the shape of the Laplace surface of a circumplanetary disc that results from accretion of circumstellar gas and experiences the effects of gas pressure, self-gravity, and viscosity, as well as the gravitational effects due to the planetary spin and the star. We apply the linear theory of warped discs in the wavelike regime for a small-obliquity planet such as Jupiter. As a result of dissipation, a disc that begins slightly away from its Laplace surface will evolve to it. Because of pressure effects in typically warm circumplanetary discs, the disc is highly flattened compared with the classical Laplace surface, meaning that it is much less warped but still significantly tilted. For the case of Jupiter, the disc does not align anywhere with the equator of the planet. For such discs, the effects of self-gravity and viscosity on warping are typically small. The disc tilt is intermediate between the planet's equatorial and orbital planes. Circumplanetary discs that are much cooler than expected can undergo warping and alignment with the planet's equator at small radii. The results have implications for the orbital evolution of satellites in the solar system that are observed to be somewhat aligned with their classical Laplace surface.

          Probing plasma scattering screens towards the quasar 2005+403 with long-term RATAN-600 observations

 - **Abstract**
 We continue investigating the observed properties of the quasar 2005$+$403 seen through the highly turbulent plasma in the Cygnus region. Our earlier study Koryukova+2023 revealed a great influence of propagation effects on the observed data, e.g. numerous episodes of multiple imaging formation, angular broadening of the source size, and the detection of an extreme scattering event (ESE) in 2019, making it a good probe for thermal plasma in the interstellar medium (ISM). We report the first detection of multi-frequency and multi-epoch ESEs revealed with the RATAN-600 daily light curves of the quasar 2005$+$403. The most prominent ESE flux density modulations are found in 2011, 2015, and 2020 and each lasted about $4-5$ months. We fitted the detected ESEs jointly at 4.7/4.8, 7.7/8.2, and 11.2~GHz using the models, which allowed us to constrain the angular and linear size of the scattering lens averaged over the three ESEs $0.3\pm0.1$ mas and $0.6\pm0.1$ au, proper motion $8.3\pm0.7$ mas yr$^{-1}$ and transverse velocity $70.1\pm5.7$ km s$^{-1}$ assuming that the lens distance is 1.8 kpc, maximum free-electron density on the line of sight $1183\pm124$ cm$^{-3}$ and lens mass $(0.8\pm0.4)\times10^{-15}\,\rm M_\odot$. Using the fitting results, we reconstructed the intrinsic unscattered angular size of the quasar at the ESE epochs. We also report on the first detection of up to six ESEs in a row that occurred in the period of $2015-2016$, apparently created by multiple lenses successively crossing the line of sight.

          The Gaia AVU-GSR solver: a CPU + GPU parallel code toward Exascale systems

 - **Abstract**
 The solver module of the Astrometric Verification Unit - Global Sphere Reconstruction (AVU-GSR) pipeline aims to find the astrometric parameters of $\sim$$10^8$ stars in the Milky Way, besides the attitude and instrumental settings of the Gaia satellite and the parametrized post Newtonian parameter $\gamma$ with a resolution of 10-100 micro-arcseconds. To perform this task, the code solves a system of linear equations with the iterative Least Squares (LSQR) algorithm, where the coefficient matrix is large (10-50 TB) and sparse and the iterations stop when convergence is reached in the least squares sense. The two matrix-by-vector products performed at each LSQR step were GPU-ported, firstly with OpenACC and then with CUDA, resulting in a $\sim$$1.5$x and $\sim$$14$x speedup, respectively, over an original code version entirely parallelized on the CPU with MPI + OpenMP. The CUDA code was further optimized and then ported with programming frameworks portable across different GPU architectures, obtaining a further $\sim$$2$x acceleration factor. One critical section of the code consists in the computation of covariances, whose total number is $N_{\rm unk} \times (N_{\rm unk} - 1)/2$ and occupy $\sim$1 EB, being $N_{\rm unk}$$\sim$$5 \times 10^8$ the total number of unknowns. This "Big Data" issue cannot be faced with standard approaches: we defined an I/O-based pipeline made of two concurrently launched jobs, where one job, i.e., the LSQR, writes the files and the second job reads them, iteratively computes the covariances and deletes them. The pipeline does not present significant bottlenecks until a number of covariances elements equal to $\sim$$8 \times 10^6$. The code currently runs in production on Leonardo CINECA infrastructure.

          Dual Directional Expansion of Classical Cepheids in the Small Magellanic Cloud Revealed by Gaia DR3

 - **Abstract**
 We present the three-dimensional kinematics of classical Cepheids (CCs) in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) using Gaia DR3 data. By cross-matching the CCs obtained from the fourth phase of the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment with Gaia DR3, we obtain distances and proper motions (PMs) for 4,236 CCs. Among them, 91 stars with available radial velocities (RVs) enable the construction of accurate relationship between distance and RV. Furthermore, we calculate the internal PMs of the CCs, providing the internal dynamics of the SMC while removing the distance projection effects. The CCs exhibit a northeast-southwest distance gradient, with internal PMs pointing northeast for nearer stars and southwest for more distant stars, indicating a northeast-southwest elongation. The RVs of the CCs show a northwest-southeast gradient, consistent with RVs of other stellar populations and suggesting that the SMC's northwest-southeast elongation results from interactions with the Large Magellanic Cloud. The distances and RVs of the CCs are nearly uncorrelated, implying that the two elongations arise from distinct causes.

 - **Abstract**
 Between 2005 and 2015, the BL Lacertae object PG 1553+113 exhibited multiple very high-energy (VHE; > 100 GeV) gamma-ray flares, which were detected by the Cherenkov telescopes, High Energy Stereoscopic System (HESS), Major Atmospheric Gamma Imaging Cherenkov (MAGIC), and the Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System (VERITAS). Despite the uncertainty surrounding its redshift (z), various studies have sought to estimate this value. In this study, seventeen independently observed VHE gamma-ray spectra of PG 1553+113 are analyzed using four distinct extragalactic background light (EBL) models alongside the photohadronic framework. A global $\chi^2$ fit is applied to all observational data to determine the best-fitting redshift for each EBL model. Additionally, confidence level (CL) intervals for the redshift are calculated across all EBL models. The findings demonstrate that the photohadronic framework effectively describes all observed spectra. Among the EBL models, the lowest total $\chi^2$ value of 58.82 (with 58 degrees of freedom) was obtained using the model from Saldana-Lopez et al. (2021), while the highest value of 75.67 was associated with the model from Dominguez et al. (2011). The 95 per cent CL intervals for the statistical error of the redshift of PG 1553+113 are 0.500 < z < 0.537 for the Saldana-Lopez et al. (2021) model and 0.491 < z < 0.527 for the Dominguez et al. (2011) model. These results highlight the consistency of the photohadronic approach in interpreting the observed VHE gamma-ray spectra.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a novel and somewhat whimsical approach to pulsar hotspot modeling by drawing inspiration from the iconic one-eyed monster, Mike Wazowski, from \emph{Monsters, Inc.}. Utilizing X-ray high-quality timing data from NICER, we apply a Bayesian inference framework to model the X-ray pulse profile of PSR J0437--4715. Our analysis employs a \emph{Wazowski Configuration} (WC) in which the conventional hotspot parametrization is replaced with a predefined image template, whose redness and size are adjusted to mimic temperature variations. The results reveal a configuration where two hotspots--one brighter and smaller in the north represents the energetic ``University time Wazowski", and one larger yet cooler in the south represents the ``Monster, Inc. time Wazowski"--combine to produce the observed X-ray pulse profile. These findings not only demonstrate the sensitivity of pulse profile modeling to hotspot morphology but also open up the intriguing possibility that the X-ray emission of some pulsars may be interpreted as a cosmic homage to our favorite animated character.

 - **Abstract**
 The colonization of Mars presents extraordinary challenges, including radiation exposure, low atmospheric pressure, and toxic regolith. Recent advancements in synthetic biology and genetic engineering offer unprecedented opportunities to address these obstacles by utilizing terrestrial extremophiles and engineered organisms. This paper examines the potential for creating symbiotic relationships between terrestrial microbes and hypothetical Martian life forms, should they exist, to support a sustainable human presence on Mars. Inspired by natural examples of endosymbiosis, such as mitochondria and chloroplasts, we propose methods to engineer life forms capable of enduring Martian conditions. Key components include experimental designs, laboratory simulations, and bioengineering approaches essential to this endeavor. The ethical, political, and technological challenges of introducing engineered life to Mars are critically evaluated, with an emphasis on international collaboration and robust planetary protection policies. This research underscores engineered symbiosis as a transformative strategy for enabling life to adapt and thrive on Mars while advancing humanity's aspirations for interplanetary habitation and exploration. By addressing these challenges, this work highlights a path toward sustainable life on Mars, reflecting both scientific ingenuity and ethical stewardship.

          Sub-parsec precision measurement of pulsar distances with nanohertz gravitational waves

 - **Abstract**
 The recent evidence of nanohertz (nHz) gravitational wave (GW) background by pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations has sparked considerable interest in understanding its astrophysical origins, particularly regarding supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs). In this work, we focus on individual SMBHBs that will be hopefully detected in upcoming PTA observations. The effect of nHz GWs on the pulse arriving times is in general decomposed as a pulsar term and an Earth term, where the pulsar term encodes the pulsar-Earth distance as a phase shift relative to the Earth term, but is usually treated as an extra noise source since the pulsar distance is in general not well measured with uncertainty larger than the wavelength of nHz GWs. We propose that the pulsar distance could be constrained by combining the phase information of multiple SMBHBs that are individually resolved. Using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations, we demonstrate that the pulsar distances can be measured to better than $0.4$ pc (1 pc) for pulsars at $D\sim 1$ kpc ($\sim 2.2$ kpc) with 30 years of observations by a 20-pulsar PTA with a noise level of $\sigma_{\rm n}=20$ ns in the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) era.

          Conformational isomerism of methyl formate: new detections of the higher-energy trans conformer and theoretical insights

 - **Abstract**
 In recent astrochemical studies it has become crucial to study all the complete conformational panorama of the molecule, some of which are potentially detectable in the interstellar medium (ISM). In this context, the isomeric ratio can be used as a powerful tool to distinguish between different formation routes of molecules with increasing levels of complexity. While the most stable cis conformer of methyl formate (CH3OCHO, MF) is ubiquitous in the ISM, there is just one tentative detection of the higher-energy trans form toward the envelope of the star-forming region Sgr B2(N). Here, we present the detections of trans-methyl formate toward the Galactic Center molecular cloud G+0.693-0.027 and the protostellar shock L1157-B1, providing definite observational evidence of its presence in the ISM. Numerous unblended or slightly blended $a$-type $K_a$ = 0, 1 transitions belonging to the $A$-substate of trans-MF have been identified in both sources. We derive a molecular column density for trans-methyl formate of N = (8.2 $\pm$ 0.4) $\times$10$^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$ and N = (1.6 $\pm$ 0.3) $\times$10$^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$, respectively, yielding a molecular abundance with respect to H$_2$ of $\sim$6 $\times$ 10$^{-11}$ and $\sim$8 $\times$ 10$^{-10}$. Therefore, we obtain cis/trans isomeric ratios of $\sim$72 and $\sim$34 toward G+0.693 and L1157-B1, which are $\sim$7 and 3 times larger than that found in the Sgr B2(N) region. These results are compared with new grain-surface theoretical computations, which suggest that a stereoespecific formation of trans-MF via the CH3O + HCO route on grain surfaces can qualitatively explain the observed cis/trans abundance ratio. Nevertheless, we show that additional stereoespecific gas-phase routes could also play a crucial role in maintaining the intricate balance between formation and destruction of trans-MF, ultimately leading to its detection.

 - **Abstract**
 Binary neutron-star mergers offer crucial insights into the matter properties of neutron stars. We present direct evidence of phase transition on the observational signatures from such events. Our study employs a range of equations of states with hadron-quark phase transition surveying from Maxwell construction smoothened up to the Gibbs construction using a control parameter $\Delta p$. This smoothening parameter allows us to explore different mixed phases and analyse their direct impact on merger dynamics. Post-merger gravitational wave emissions reveal the expression of specific signatures in the spectogram and power spectral density, serving as a distinct signature of equations of state with mixed phases. We found additional peaks in power spectral density that were fully responsible from the post-merger remnant experiencing a phase transition. Alongside this signature, the nature of phase transition transition leaves specific imprints on the spectrogram, leading to a two-folded signature from gravitational wave analysis. Furthermore, we establish a direct correlation between our findings and the threshold mass for prompt collapse. Our analysis also provides key evidence against a Maxwell-type phase transition for GW170817 if the post-merger is believed to have experienced a prompt collapse into a black hole. We show that $\Delta p \gtrsim 0.04$ is required for such a scenario. Effects of $\Delta p$ have also been observed on the ejecta mass from the event, which can affect the kilonova afterglow.

 - **Abstract**
 Metal-poor stars are key to understanding the first stellar generation in the Galaxy. Asteroseismic characterisation of red giants has traditionally relied on global seismic parameters, not the full spectrum of individual oscillation modes. Here, we present the first characterisation of two evolved very metal-poor stars, including the detailed mixed-mode patterns. We demonstrate that incorporating individual frequencies into grid-based modelling of red-giant stars enhances its precision, enabling detailed studies of these ancient stars and allowing us to infer the stellar properties of two $[\mathrm{Fe}/\mathrm{H}]{\sim}{-}2.5$ dex Kepler stars: KIC 4671239 and KIC 7693833. Recent developments in both observational and theoretical asteroseismology allows for detailed studies of the complex oscillation pattern of evolved giants. We employ Kepler time series and surface properties from high-resolution spectroscopic data to asteroseismically characterise the two stars using the BAyesian STellar Algorithm, BASTA. Both stars show agreement between constraints from seismic and classical observables; an overlap unrecoverable when purely considering the global seismic parameters. KIC 4671239 and KIC 7693833 were determined to have masses of $0.78^{+0.04}_{-0.03}$ and $0.83^{+0.03}_{-0.01} M_{\odot}$ with ages of $12.1^{+1.6}_{-1.5}$ and $10.3^{+0.6}_{-1.4}$ Gyr, respectively. A $\sim10$% discrepancy between observed and modelled $\nu_{\mathrm{max}}$ suggests a metallicity dependence of its scaling relation, leading to overestimated masses and incorrect age inferences for metal-poor stars. Utilising the full spectrum of individual oscillation modes, we circumvent the dependence on the asteroseismic scaling relations, providing direct constraints on the stars themselves, pushing the boundaries of state-of-the-art detailed modelling of evolved stars at metallicities far different from solar.

 - **Abstract**
 We present $BVi$ multi-band high-cadence observations of a Type II supernova (SN) KSP-SN-2022c from a star-forming galaxy at $z$ $\simeq$ 0.041 from its infant to nebular phase. Early light curve fitting with a single power-law is consistent with the first detection of roughly 15 minutes after shock breakout. The SN light curves feature a rapid rise and decline across its luminous ($V$ $\simeq$ -18.41 mag) peak together with a short plateau. The presence of the short plateau and rapid post-peak decline place the SN within a small group of transitional type between Type II-P and II-L subtypes. Its (i) broad and asymmetric H profiles with large emission-to-absorption ratios and (ii) near-peak luminosity in excess of predictions from SN shock cooling models both point to circumstellar interactions in this SN. Early colour evolution exhibits a short-lived blueward motion in $B-V$ within the first few days and continuous reddening in $V-i$, inconsistent with simple blackbody heating. Our simulations of SN light curves estimate 13 $M_\odot$ and 680 $R_\odot$ for the mass and radius of the progenitor, respectively, together with CSM of 0.73 $M_\odot$ to account for the excess luminosity and rapid post-peak declines. We discuss the origin of its short plateau and early colour evolution in the context of partial envelope stripping of the progenitor star and a delayed SN shock breakout near the edge of the CSM, respectively, as indicated by our simulations. We establish a correlation between post-peak decline rates and CSM mass in Type II SNe, highlighting that CSM interactions play a major role in shaping the post-peak evolution of transitional types.

 - **Abstract**
 Accurate synchrotron transfer coefficients are essential for modeling radiation processes in astrophysics. However, their current calculation methods face significant challenges. Analytical approximations of the synchrotron emissivity, absorptivity, and rotativity are limited to a few simple electron distribution functions that inadequately capture the complexity of cosmic plasmas. Numerical integrations of the transfer coefficients, on the other hand, are accurate but computationally prohibitive for large-scale simulations. In this paper, we present a new numerical method, Chorus, which evaluates the transfer coefficients by expressing any electron distribution function as a weighted sum of functions with known analytical formulas. Specifically, the Maxwell-Jüttner distribution function is employed as the basic component in the weighted sum. The Chorus leverages the additivity of transfer coefficients, drawing inspiration from an analogous approach that uses stochastic averaging to approximate the $\kappa$ distribution function. The key findings demonstrate median errors below $5\%$ for emissivity and absorptivity, with run times reduced from hours to milliseconds compared to first-principles numerical integrations. Validation against a single $\kappa$ distribution, as well as its extension to more complex distributions, confirms the robustness and versatility of the method. However, limitations are found, including increased errors at higher energies due to numerical precision constraints and challenges with rotativity calculations arising from fit function inaccuracies. Addressing these issues could further enhance the method's reliability. Our method has the potential to provide a powerful tool for radiative transfer simulations, where synchrotron emission is the main radiative process.

 Cookies are enjoyed best when they are both crispy and soft. I investigate in which proportion the cookies are crispy and soft, and disentangle whether it makes them biscuits, cakes, or none of the above. I baked cookies for colleagues at KTH, Stockholm, and University of Geneva, Switzerland, adopting my mum's mum's mum's etc. recipe. I created a dedicated survey for my colleagues with three well-selected questions to answer while eating one cookie. The weighted-average mean of the crispiness and softness, weighted by the respective enjoyment of the cookie, over the whole population amount to 7.0 +/- 1.1 and 5.3 +/- 1.4, respectively. The enjoyment of the cookies amounts to 9.1 +/- 2.3. People like (my) cookies, and cookies are neither cakes, nor biscuits, they are just... cookies!

 - **Abstract**
 In the big data era of Astrophysics, the improvement of visualization techniques can greatly enhance the ability to identify and interpret key features in complex datasets. This aspect of data analysis will become even more relevant in the near future, with the expected growth of data volumes. With our studies, we aim to drive progress in this field and inspire further research. We present the second release of pastamarkers, a Python-based matplotlib package that we initially presented last year. In this new release we focus on big data visualization and update the content of our first release. We find that analyzing complex problems and mining large data sets becomes significantly more intuitive and engaging when using the familiar and appetizing colors of pasta sauces instead of traditional colormaps.

          Galaxy Imaging with Generative Models: Insights from a Two-Models Framework

 - **Abstract**
 Generative models have recently revolutionized image generation tasks across diverse domains, including galaxy image synthesis. This study investigates the statistical learning and consistency of three generative models: light-weight-gan (a GAN-based model), Glow (a Normalizing Flow-based model), and a diffusion model based on a U-Net denoiser, all trained on non-overlapping subsets of the SDSS dataset of 64x64 grayscale images. While all models produce visually realistic images with well-preserved morphological variable distributions, we focus on their ability to learn and generalize the underlying data distribution. The diffusion model shows a transition from memorization to generalization as the dataset size increases, confirming previous findings. Smaller datasets lead to overfitting, while larger datasets enable novel sample generation, supported by the denoising process's theoretical basis. For the flow-based model, we propose an "inversion test" leveraging its bijective nature. Similarly, the GAN-based model achieves comparable morphological consistency but lacks bijectivity. We then introduce a "discriminator test", which shows successful learning for larger datasets but poorer confidence with smaller ones. Across all models, dataset sizes below O(100,000) pose challenges to learning. Along our experiments, the "two-models" framework enables robust evaluations, highlighting both the potential and limitations of these models. These findings provide valuable insights into statistical learning in generative modeling, with applications certainly extending beyond galaxy image generation.

 - **Abstract**
 In order to shed light on the quantum-to-classical transition of the primordial perturbations in single field inflation, we investigate the decoherence and associated quantum corrections to the correlation functions of superhorizon scalar curvature perturbations. The latter are considered as an open quantum system which undergoes quantum decoherence induced by a time-dependent environment of deep subhorizon tensorial modes through the trilinear interactions predicted by General Relativity. We first prove that, in full generality, a time dependent subhorizon environment can be relevant for decoherence during inflation, by considering derivativeless interactions, which, in our case, give the most important results. For the first time, the time dependence of the environment is properly taken into account by modifying the quantum master equation. Important non-Markovian effects pop up, instead, when dealing with derivative interactions. We adopt a possible way to treat them which has been recently proposed and seems well suited for our case. Our results show that when considering the interplay between derivativeless and derivative interactions, decoherence is slowed down. This underlines the importance of accounting for all the interactions in open quantum-system calculations in an inflationary setting. We finally compute the quantum corrections to cosmological correlation functions, by solving the transport equations induced by the quantum master equation. We also compare the results to the solutions obtained by an alternative method previously used in the literature. We observe a resummation of the quantum corrections to the power-spectrum, which is a general property of quantum master equations. We extend these results to the bispectrum, showing a decay of this correlation function in time which is analogous to the one found, previously, for the power-spectrum.

 - **Abstract**
 The spectra of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) in the low corona play a crucial role in understanding their origins and physical mechanism, and enhancing space weather forecasting. However, capturing these spectra faces significant challenges. This paper introduces a scheme of a multi-slit spectrometer design with five slits, acquiring the global spectra of the solar corona simultaneously with a focus on the spectra of CMEs in the low corona. The chosen wavelength range of the spectrometer (170-180 Å) includes four extreme ultraviolet emission lines (Fe x 174.53 Å, Fe ix 171.07 Å, Fe x 175.26 Å, Fe x 177.24 Å), which provides information of plasma velocity, density and temperature. Utilizing a numerical simulation of the global corona for both the on-disk and the off-limb scenarios, we focus on resolving the ambiguity associated with various Doppler velocity components of CMEs, particularly for a fast CME in the low corona. A new application of our decomposition technique is adopted, enabling the successful identification of multiple discrete CME velocity components. Our findings demonstrate a strong correlation between the synthetic model spectra and the inverted results, indicating the robustness of our decomposition method and its significant potential for global monitoring of the solar corona, including CMEs.

 The Solar Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (SUIT) on board the AdityaL1 mission observes the Sun in the 200-400 nm wavelength range. This paper presents the results of various on ground and on board tests and their comparison with the specifications. Moreover, we also present the scheme for data calibration. We demonstrate that the test results are compliant with the specified figures, except the spatial resolution. Such discrepancy will limit the photometric measurements only, at a scale of 2.2" instead of 1.4" as originally envisioned. The results obtained here show that SUIT observations open up a new window for solar observations.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the formation of the Hercules stream in the model Galactic disk which includes the outer resonance ring R1R2 located near the Outer Lindblad Resonance (OLR) of the bar. The Hercules region and the anti-Hercules region introduced for calibration were restricted in space by the solar neighborhood, r<0.5 kpc, and on the (VR, VT) plane by ellipses centered at VR=25 and VT=200 km s-1 (Hercules), and at VR=-25 and VT=200 km s-1 (anti-Hercules). The number of stars in the Hercules region reaches a maximum at the time period of 2--3 Gyr from the start of simulation and the number of stars in the anti-Hercules region oscillates with a period of 1.8 +/-0.1 Gyr. The majority of stars in the model disk located in the Hercules and anti-Hercules regions have orbits elongated perpendicular and parallel to the bar, respectively. There are two types of orbits in the Hercules region. Orbits of the first type always lie inside a figure bounded by two ellipses elongated perpendicular to the bar. Orbits of the second type are elongated at the angles of -60 or 60 degrees to the major axis of the bar most of the time. The distribution of stars in the Hercules region along the period of slow oscillations in the angular momentum has two maxima: P=0.7 and 2.6 Gyr corresponding to orbits of the first and second type. In the anti-Hercules region, most orbits are captured by libration relative to the major axis of the bar with a period of 1.9 Gyr. In general, orbits in the Hercules and anti-Hercules regions support the outer rings R1 and R2 elongated perpendicular and parallel to the bar, respectively. Stars from the Gaia DR3 catalog located in the Hercules region appear to be, on average, brighter, bluer and more luminous than stars in the anti-Hercules region which is probably caused by selection effects due to different distributions of these stellar samples over the Galactic latitude b.

 We analyzed period changes of the high-amplitude Delta Scuti variable star CSS_J102714.3+205943 for about 20 years, utilizing data from the automated sky surveys along with our own observations. With the help of the O-C diagram, we found that the period decreased noticeably between JD2454800 and JD2457300. A possible cause of the change could be intrinsic processes in the star. However, the observed behavior of the O-C diagram can also be explained by the light-time effect if the star is a component of a binary system. Times of maxima for the star, derived from the surveys and our observations, are listed.

 - **Abstract**
 Context: Photometric variability is a defining characteristic of young stellar objects (YSO), which can be traced back to a range of physical processes taking place at different stages of young stars' formation and early evolution. Gaia's third Data Release (GDR3) has provided an unprecedented dataset of photometric time series, including 79375 light curves for YSO candidates. With its all-sky coverage, Gaia provides a unique opportunity for large-scale studies of YSO variability. Aims: Our goal was to characterise the GDR3 sample of YSO variables further and verify the recurrence of YSO variability modes due to accretion, extinction, rotation modulation, etc. By adapting the Q&M methodology for Gaia's sparse and long-term light curves, we seek to bridge the gap between low and high-cadence surveys' insights on YSO variability. Methods: We piloted the application of the asymmetry (M) and periodicity (Q) variability metrics to characterise YSO variability with Gaia light curves. Through refined sample selection, we identified sources with appropriate sampling for the Q&M methodology. We used the Generalised Lomb Scargle periodogram and structure functions to infer variability timescales. Results: We successfully derived Q&M indices for ~23000 sources in the GDR3 YSO sample. These variables were then classified into eight variability morphological classes. We linked morphological classes with physical mechanisms by using H$\alpha$ as a proxy of accretion and $\alpha_\mathrm{IR}$-indices to gauge circumstellar material's presence. Conclusions: We demonstrate that the Q&M metrics can be successfully applied to Gaia's sparse time-series. We applied them to distinguish between the several variability modes. While our results are generally consistent with previous high-cadence, short-term studies, we find that GDR3's long timespan yields an enhanced variety of variability mechanisms.

          The $i$-processes nucleosynthesis during the formation of He-rich hot-subdwarf stars

 - **Abstract**
 It has been shown that proton ingestion episodes can happen in the formation of hot-subdwarf stars, and that neutron-capture processes are possible in those cases. Moreover, some helium-rich hot subdwarfs display extraordinarily high abundances of heavy elements such as Zr, Yr and Pb on their surfaces. We explore under which conditions neutron-capture processes can occur in late helium core flashes, i.e. those occurring in the cores of stripped red-giant stars. We compute evolutionary models through the helium core flash and the subsequent hydrogen ingestion episode in stripped red giant stars. Stellar structure models are then used in post-processing to compute the detailed evolution of neutron-capture elements. We find that for metallicities of $10^{-3}$ and below, neutron densities can be as high as $10^{15}\,$cm$^{-3}$ and intermediate neutron capture processes occur in some of our models. The results depend very strongly on the H-envelope mass that survives after the stripping. Interestingly, we find that computed abundances in some of our models closely match the element abundances up to tin observed for EC 22536-5304, the only well-studied star for which the hot-flasher scenario assumed in our models is the most likely evolutionary path. Intermediate neutron capture processes can occur in the He-core flash experienced by the cores of some stripped red giants, and might be connected to the abundances of heavy elements observed in some helium-rich hot-subdwarf stars. The agreement between the observed abundances in EC 22536-5304 and those of our models offers support to our nucleosynthesis calculations. Moreover, if confirmed, the idea that heavy element abundances retain signatures of the different evolutionary channels opens the possibility that heavy element abundances in iHe-sdOB stars can be used to infer their evolutionary origin.

 - **Abstract**
 Solar Cycle (SC) 24 was the weakest in the space age, yet it produced many sustained gamma ray emission (SGRE) events from the Sun. Solar cycle (SC) 25, which is a bit stronger than SC 24 observed only a handful of SGRE events over the first five years. Here we report on the 2024 September 14 SGRE event, which has the longest duration (\~11.29 hrs) as of this writing. The associated type II radio burst is also of long duration (\~16 hr). Detailed analysis of the SGRE event reveals that the event is in good agreement with the linear relation of the SGRE duration with the ending frequency and duration of the type II burst. The kinematics of the associated coronal mass ejection (CME) shows that it is one of the fastest CMEs of SC 25, capable of driving a shock that accelerated >300 MeV protons to account for the observed SGRE. By comparing with an event with similar durations in SC 24, we find that it had a lower-speed CME but resulted in a larger-sized SGRE event. We speculate that the difference may be due to the change in the heliospheric state between the two cycles.

 - **Abstract**
 Catsteroseismology, or asterocatsmology, is an unexplored area of observational and theoretical research that proposes to use purr-mode oscillations to study the much-beloved but poorly-understood species Felis catus. In this work, we conduct a survey to measure fundamental purrameters of cats and relate them to their purr-modes. Relations between these fundamental cat purrameters, which include physical (eg. size, cuddliness) and personality (eg. aggression, intelligence) traits, and purr-modes can help probe their inner lives and emotions. We find that while purr characteristics tentatively trend with several physical and personality traits, more data is required to better constrain these relationships and infer the direct predictive power of personality on purr-modes, or vice versa.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive analysis of AstroSat/LAXPC data of the second spin-up and second spin-down phases of the persistent X-ray pulsar 4U 1626-67. Flares followed by a broad dip are detected in the spin-up observations. The pulse profiles changed from a shoulder-like structure to a broad sinusoidal shape as the source underwent a torque reversal from spin-up to spin-down. Energy-resolved pulse profiles in lower energies showed a double-horned profile in the spin-up state and a flat top with multiple peaks in the spin-down state. Regardless of the torque state, the pulse profiles exhibit a broad single-peaked shape at higher energies. The observation in the spin-down era is characterised by the presence of a prominent QPO at 46.5 +/- 1.0 mHz frequency. The QPO rms and centre frequency show a correlation with energy. Spin-up and spin-down states show a difference in the shape of the power density spectrum. After the torque reversal, a gradual flux drop and the hardening of the spectra were observed. The difference in the shape of the pulse profiles and the presence and absence of QPOs can be explained by the change in accretion flow geometry of the pulsar, from pencil-beam to fan-beam, between spin-down and spin-up states.

 - **Abstract**
 We report on the observation of first, second, and third harmonic components during an interplanetary (IP) type II solar radio burst observed on 2024 September 14 by the radio instruments on board Wind, the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO), and the Parker Solar Probe. The eruption resulted in an ultrafast coronal mass ejection (CME) that had a sky plane speed of \~2366 km per sec, and an X4.5 flare from NOAA active region 13825 (S15E56). Also observed were a large solar energetic particle (SEP) event and a sustained gamma ray emission (SGRE) event. The IP type II burst consists of multiple features. The first, second, and third harmonic bursts are smooth and diffuse with additional patchy bursts superposed only on the fundamental component. The existence of fundamental harmonic structure including the third harmonic can be readily explained by the coherent plasma emission mechanism and works against the possibility of synchrotron mechanism.

 - **Abstract**
 Supernova remnants (SNRs) provide crucial information of yet poorly understood mechanism of supernova explosion. Here we present XRISM high-resolution spectroscopy of the intermediate-mass-element (IME) ejecta in the SNR Cas A to determine their velocity distribution and thermal properties. The XRISM/Resolve spectrum in the 1.75-2.95 keV band extracted from each $1' \times 1'$ region in the southeast and northwest rims is fitted with a model consisting of two-component plasmas in non-equilibrium ionization with different radial velocities and ionization timescales. It is found that the more highly ionized component has a larger radial velocity, suggesting that this component is distributed in the outer layer and thus has been heated by the SNR reverse shock earlier. We also perform proper motion measurement of the highly ionized component (represented by the Si XIV Ly$\alpha$ emission), using archival Chandra data, to reconstruct the three-dimensional velocity of the outermost IME ejecta. The pre-shock (free expansion) velocity of these ejecta is estimated to range from 2400 to 7100 km s$^{-1}$, based on the thermal properties and the bulk velocity of the shocked ejecta. These velocities are consistent with theoretical predictions for a Type IIb supernova, in which the progenitor's hydrogen envelope is largely stripped before the explosion. Furthermore, we find a substantial asymmetry in the distribution of the free expansion velocities, with the highest value toward the direction opposite to the proper motion of the neutron star (NS). This indicates the physical association between the asymmetric supernova explosion and NS kick.

 - **Abstract**
 Second-generation circumbinary discs around evolved binary stars, such as post-Asymptotic Giant Branch (post-AGB) stars, provide insights into poorly understood mechanisms of dust processing and disc evolution across diverse stellar environments. We present a multi-wavelength polarimetric survey of five evolved binary systems - AR Pup, HR 4049, HR 4226, U Mon, and V709 Car - using the SPHERE/ZIMPOL instrument. Post-AGB discs show significant polarimetric brightness at optical and near-IR wavelengths, often exceeding 1% of the system's total intensity. We also measured a maximum fractional polarization of the scattered light for AR Pup of ~0.7 in the V-band and ~0.55 in the I-band. To investigate wavelength-dependent polarization, we combine the SPHERE/ZIMPOL dataset with results from previous SPHERE/IRDIS studies. This analysis reveals that post-AGB discs exhibit a grey to blue polarimetric colour in the optical and near-IR. Along with high fractional polarization and polarized intensity distribution, these findings indicate that porous dust aggregates dominate the surface dust composition. We also find evidence of diverse disc geometries within the post-AGB sample, including arcs, asymmetries and variations in disc size across optical and near-IR wavelengths for some systems. Combining our findings with existing multi-technique studies, we question the classification of two systems in our sample, HR 4226 and V709 Car, which were originally identified as post-AGB binaries based on their near-IR excess. On comparing post-AGB discs to circumstellar environments around AGB stars and YSOs, we found that post-AGB systems exhibit a higher degree of polarization than single AGB stars and are comparable to the brightest protoplanetary discs around YSOs. Overall, our results reinforce the importance of polarimetric observations in probing dust properties and complex circumbinary structures.

          The persistent shift in spin-down rate following the largest Crab pulsar glitch rules out external torque variations due to starquakes

 - **Abstract**
 It was previously believed that, the long-term persistent increase in the spin-down rate of the Crab pulsar following a glitch is direct evidence of a starquake-induced glitch or at least related to a starquake. Using radio data covering 1710 days following the 2017 glitch, we obtain an extreme persistent increase of the spin-down rate, which allows to test two prevailing models related to starquake through an interrelation analysis between glitch size (the amplitude of the frequency step at a glitch) and persistent increase in the spin-down rate of the star. Our results do not support the hypothesis that glitches induce the external torque variation of the Crab pulsar, which may indicate no occurrence of starquake during the Crab pulsar glitch. This can explain why no changes in the radio and X-ray flux, pulse profile and spectrum of the Crab pulsar have been observed. We also suggest an internal mechanism due to superfluidity as an explanation for the long-term persistent shift in spin-down rate of the Crab pulsar following the relatively large glitches.

 - **Abstract**
 The Milky Way's Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) is measured to form stars 10 times less efficiently than in the Galactic disk, based on emission from high-mass stars. However, the CMZ's low-mass protostellar population, which accounts for most of the initial stellar mass budget and star formation rate (SFR), is poorly constrained observationally due to limited sensitivity and resolution. We present the Dual-band Unified Exploration of Three CMZ Clouds (DUET) survey, targeting the 20 km/s Cloud, Sgr C, and Dust Ridge cloud e using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) at 1.3 and 3 mm. The mosaicked observations achieve a comparable resolution of 0.2-0.3" (~1600-2500 au) and a sky coverage of 8.3-10.4 square arcmin, respectively. We report 563 continuum sources at 1.3 mm and 330 at 3 mm, respectively, and a dual-band catalog with 450 continuum sources. These sources are marginally resolved at the 2,000 au resolution. We find a cloud-wide deviation (>70%) from commonly-used dust modified blackbody (MBB) models, characterized by either low spectral indices or low brightness temperatures. Three possible explanations for the deviation are discussed. (1) Optically thick Class 0/I Young stellar objects (YSOs) with very small beam filling factors can lead to lower brightness temperatures than what MBB models predict. (2) Large (mm/cm-sized) dust grains have more significant self-scattering, and therefore frequency-dependent albedo could cause lower spectral indices. (3) Free-free emission over 30 uJy can severely contaminate dust emission and cause low spectral indices for mJy sources in our sample, although the needed number of massive protostars (embedded UCHII regions) is infeasibly high for the normal stellar initial mass function. A reliable measurement of the SFR at low protostellar masses will require future work to distinguish between these possible explanations.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a statistical study on the formation and growth of black holes (BHs) seeded by gravothermal core-collapse of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) halos at high redshifts, using a semi-analytical framework based on Monte-Carlo merger trees. We demonstrate that BH formation via gravothermal collapse naturally occurs in high-concentration halos at a characteristic mass scale determined by the SIDM cross section, and only during the early Universe. This mechanism is particularly promising for explaining the abundance of little red dots (LRDs) -- a population of early, apparently galaxy-less active galactic nuclei hosting supermassive BHs. By incorporating this seeding process with simplified models of BH growth and mergers, we successfully reproduce the observed LRD mass function for moderately large cross sections of $\sigma_{0m} \sim 30 \mathrm{cm^2\,g^{-1}}$ and $\omega \sim 80\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$, intriguingly consistent with independent local constraints derived from galaxy rotation curves. Our results highlight the potential of high-redshift BH statistics as a complementary probe for constraining SIDM models.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the detection of whisky in the atmosphere of the extrasolar super-Earth planet GJ 1132b from transmission spectroscopic data. It is seen both in atmospheric absorption as well as in chromospheric emission, the latter probably due to the intense heating of the co-rotating planet's day-side surface. This detection cannot be explained using natural sources of alcohol, implying that there must be a technically advanced civilisation -- possibly originating from the neighboring habitable planet GJ 1132c -- that is engaged in massive distilling operations accompanied by high levels of industrial pollution. The reason for the necessarily vast scale of production is either to produce rocket fuel for an interplanetary economy or, more likely, for an unusually high level of personal consumption. The latter hypothesis suggests a novel explanation for the Fermi Paradox (the lack of indirect or direct contact with extraterrestrials): a technically versed civilisation would be incapable of achieving the higher technical levels necessary for the development of a detectable radio signature -- much less interstellar travel -- at the suggested rates of consumption.

 - **Abstract**
 Investigations of the Galactic black hole low-mass X-ray binaries (BH-LMXBs) offer valuable insights into the elusive black hole population in the Milky Way. Motivated by recent tensions in the natal kick velocity distribution and BH mass distribution of BH-LMXBs, we revisit the spatial distribution of the Galactic BH-LMXBs using a new set of distance measurements obtained from an X-ray spectral modelling framework that we introduced in earlier work. We perform a multiparameter simulation study to mitigate part of the bias present in our prior estimates and gain insights into possible observational selection effects that affect the observed population. We derive a bias correction factor, well described by a Pareto probability density function that closely follows an inverse-square law dependence on distance. We then construct a bias-corrected, literature-independent, Galactic spatial distribution that clearly traces spiral arm structures and shows a deficit of sources very close to the Galactic centre, which might be explained due to high extinction or a true paucity of these sources at that region. Further analysis of the simulation results provides hints for a hidden population of BH-LMXBs at low Galactic heights. Lastly, we estimate the root-mean-squared Galactic height and find that it is most compatible with a hybrid scenario of BH formation, with some BHs receiving high natal kicks and thus propelled further from the thin disc plane while others receiving low natal kicks and remaining close to their birth place.

 - **Abstract**
 Observation of multifrequency angular power spectrum of the redshifted 21-cm brightness temperature fluctuation from the neutral hydrogen holds the key to understand the structure formation and its evolution during the reionization and post-reionization era. A major challenge in observing the neutral hydrogen arises from presence of strong foreground signals in the frequency range of interest. Mitigating the direct effect of foregrounds are being addressed through various techniques in literature. An additional second order effect arises, in presence of foreground, with limited accuracy in time and frequency dependent gain calibrations. This manifests as the residual gain and bandpass error in the observed data, introduces bias and increases uncertainty in the estimates of multifrequency angular power spectrum. In this work, we present an analytic method to estimate the bias and excess uncertainty in the estimates of multifrequency angular power spectrum in presence of residual gain and bandpass errors. We use this framework to estimate the effect of these errors for detection of redshifted 21-cm emission from a redshift of $\sim 8$ with the upcoming SKA1-Low. Due to the high baseline density at the required range of angular multipoles, the SKA1-Low is found to be a tuned instrument for the redshifted 21-cm signal detection. We find that, there are scenario with residual gain and bandpass errors where there can be significant bias in these estimates. Certain foreground mitigation strategies, is expected to reduce a part of the bias. The detailed study of different aspects of gain and bandpass errors and their relative effects are discussed. We find, with assumed models of gain and bandpass errors, signal detection is possible at this redshift with $128$ hours of observations. However, to achieve this one needs to have better calibration accuracy than present day interferometers.

 - **Abstract**
 A program to search for radio emission from dwarf-novae-type cataclysmic variables was conducted with the South African MeerKAT radio telescope. The dwarf novae RU Pegasi, V426 Ophiuchi and IP Pegasi were detected during outburst at L-band (1284 MHz central frequency). Previously, only one cataclysmic variable was radio-detected at a frequency this low. We now bring the number to four. With these three newly found radio-emitters, the population of dwarf novae confirmed to be radio-emitting at any frequency reaches 10 systems. We found that the radio luminosity is correlated with the optical luminosity. For V426 Ophiuchi and RU Pegasi we found a radio decline contemporary with the outburst's optical decline. The peak radio luminosity of dwarf novae in outburst is very similar to that of novalike Cataclysmic Variables and no correlation with orbital period is seen.

          A search for the three isomers of cyano-1,3-butadiene in TMC-1: Implications for bottom-up routes involving 1,3-butadiene

 - **Abstract**
 The molecule 1,3-butadiene (CH2CHCHCH2) could play a key role in the synthesis of the cyclic molecules cyclopentadiene and benzene in cold dense clouds. Since 1,3-butadiene is non-polar, we searched for its cyano derivative, which exists in the form of three different polar isomers, in the cold dense cloud TMC-1. We used the most recent data obtained with the Yebes 40m telescope in the Q band (31.0-50.3 GHz) in the frame of the QUIJOTE project. We do not detect any of the two isomers of 1-cyano-1,3-butadiene, and derive 3sigma upper limits to their column densities of 1.2e10 cm-2 and 2.0e10 cm-2 for E- and Z-1-cyano-1,3-butadiene, respectively. Our results are not consistent with those from Cooke et al. (2023), who determine a column density of 3.8e10 cm-2 for E-1-cyano-1,3-butadiene in TMC-1 using GBT data and a line stack technique. At the current level of sensitivity of our data, there is tentative evidence for the presence of the third cyano derivative isomer, 2-cyano-1,3-butadiene, although a firm detection must await more sensitive data. We derive an upper limit to its column density of 3.1e10 cm-2. This isomer cannot be formed in the reaction between CN and 1,3-butadiene, according to experimental and theoretical studies, and thus we speculate whether it could arise from neutral-neutral reactions like C2H3 + CH2CHCN and CH2CCN + C2H4. From the upper limit on the abundance of 1-cyano-1,3-butadiene derived here, we estimate that the abundance of 1,3-butadiene in TMC-1 is below 1e-11 - 1e-10 relative to H2. The low abundance inferred for 1,3-butadiene makes it unlikely that it plays an important role in bottom-up routes to cyclopentadiene and benzene.

 - **Abstract**
 In this contribution we give a brief account of the problem of the Global Astrometric Sphere Reconstruction in Astrometry, with particular reference to the Gaia and Gaia-like astrometric missions, namely those adopting a scanning strategy with observations in TDI mode. We sketch the design of the Gaia mission, the mathematical modelling that comes naturally from its observing strategy, and how the problem of the global sphere reconstruction translates into that of the solution of large, sparse, and overdetermined system of linearized equations. After a short description of the two approaches to this problem implemented in the Gaia data reduction pipelines, we list the main known problems of the current approaches, with specific reference to the calibration and the correlation issues. Finally, we suggest how an arc-based solution could help to alleviate some of these problems, how it would be possible to devise a mathematical model for such an observable despite the TDI observing mode, and the main difficulty that a parallel implementation of this model would have to solve.

 - **Abstract**
 We report on the 2024 September 9 sustained gamma ray emission (SGRE) event observed by the Large Area Telescope onboard the Fermi satellite. The event was associated with a backside solar eruption observed by multiple spacecraft such as the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO), Parker Solar Probe (PSP), Solar Orbiter (SolO), Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), Wind, and GOES, and by ground based radio telescopes. SolO Spectrometer Telescope for Imaging X rays (STIX) imaged an intense flare, which occurred about 41 deg behind the east limb, from heliographic coordinates S13E131. Forward modeling of the CME flux rope revealed that it impulsively accelerated (3.54 km s^{-2}) to attain a peak speed of 2162 km s^{-1}. SolO energetic particle detectors (EPD) observed protons up to about 1 GeV from the extended shock and electrons that produced a complex type II burst and possibly type III bursts. The durations of SGRE and type II burst are consistent with the linear relation between these quantities obtained from longer duration (exceeding 3 hours) SGRE events. All these observations are consistent with an extended shock surrounding the CME flux rope, which is the likely source of high energy protons required for the SGRE event. We compare this event with six other BTL SGRE eruptions and find that they are all consistent with energetic shock driving CMEs. We also find a significant east west asymmetry in the BTL source locations.

 - **Abstract**
 Massive stars undergoing iron core collapse at the end of their evolution terminate their lives either in successful or failed supernovae (SNe). The physics of core collapse supernovae (CCSNe) is complex, and their understanding requires computationally expensive simulations. The sampling of large, densely sampled parameter spaces of SN progenitors, as is needed e.g. for population synthesis studies, is thus not feasible. To remedy this situation, we present criteria that allow us to predict the final fates of stars by evaluating multiple explodability proxies derived from the stellar structure at the onset of core collapse. These are formulated based on the outcomes of a semi-analytic supernova model, evaluated over a set of ~3,900 heterogeneous stellar progenitors (single stars, binary-stripped and accretor stars). Over these, the explodabiliy criteria achieve an accuracy of >99% agreement with the semi-analytic model. The criteria are tested on 29 state-of-the-art 3D CCSN simulation outcomes from two different groups. Furthermore, we find that all explodability proxies needed for our pre-SN criteria have two distinct peaks and intervening valleys as a function of the carbon-oxygen (CO) core mass $M_\mathrm{CO}$, which coincide with failed and successful SNe, respectively. The CO core masses of explodability peaks shift systematically with metallicity, $Z$, and with the timing of hydrogen-rich envelope removal in binary-stripped stars. With these, we identify critical values in $M_\mathrm{CO}$ that define windows over which black holes form by direct collapse. The outcome is a CCSN recipe based on $M_\mathrm{CO}$ and $Z$, applicable for rapid binary population synthesis and other studies. Our explodability formalism is consistent with SN observations that constrain the progenitor $M_\mathrm{CO}$ and partially addresses the missing red supergiant problem by direct black hole formation.

 - **Abstract**
 The advent of next-generation radio telescopes is set to transform radio astronomy by producing massive data volumes that challenge traditional processing methods. Deep learning techniques have shown strong potential in automating radio analysis tasks, yet are often constrained by the limited availability of large annotated datasets. Recent progress in self-supervised learning has led to foundational radio vision models, but adapting them for new tasks typically requires coding expertise, limiting their accessibility to a broader astronomical community. Text-based AI interfaces offer a promising alternative by enabling task-specific queries and example-driven learning. In this context, Large Language Models (LLMs), with their remarkable zero-shot capabilities, are increasingly used in scientific domains. However, deploying large-scale models remains resource-intensive, and there is a growing demand for AI systems that can reason over both visual and textual data in astronomical analysis. This study explores small-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as AI assistants for radio astronomy, combining LLM capabilities with vision transformers. We fine-tuned the LLaVA VLM on a dataset of 59k radio images from multiple surveys, enriched with 38k image-caption pairs from the literature. The fine-tuned models show clear improvements over base models in radio-specific tasks, achieving ~30% F1-score gains in extended source detection, but they underperform pure vision models and exhibit ~20% drop on general multimodal tasks. Inclusion of caption data and LoRA fine-tuning enhances instruction-following and helps recover ~10% accuracy on standard benchmarks. This work lays the foundation for future advancements in radio VLMs, highlighting their potential and limitations, such as the need for better multimodal alignment, higher-quality datasets, and mitigation of catastrophic forgetting.

 - **Abstract**
 Massive star evolution plays a crucial role in astrophysics but bares large uncertainties. This problem becomes more severe by the majority of massive stars being born in close binary systems, whose evolution is affected by the interaction of their components. We want to constrain major uncertainties in massive binary star evolution, in particular the efficiency and the stability of the first mass transfer phase. We use the rapid population synthesis code ComBinE to generate synthetic populations of post-interaction binaries, assuming constant mass-transfer efficiency. We employ a new merger criterion that adjusts self-consistently to any prescribed mass-transfer efficiency. We tailor our synthetic populations to be comparable to the expected binary populations in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). We find that the observed populations of evolved massive binaries can not be reproduced with a single mass-transfer efficiency. Instead, a rather high efficiency (>50%) is needed to reproduce the number of Be stars and Be/X-ray binaries in the SMC, while a low efficiency (~10%) leads to a better agreement with the observed number of Wolf-Rayet stars. We construct a corresponding mass-dependent mass-transfer efficiency recipe to produce our fiducial synthetic SMC post-interaction binary population. It reproduces the observed number and properties of the Be/X-ray and WR-binaries rather well, and is not in stark disagreement with the observed OBe star population. It further predicts two large, yet unobserved populations of OB+BH binaries, that is ~100 OB+BH systems with rather small orbital periods (<20 days) and ~40 longer period OBe+BH systems.

 - **Abstract**
 In the report by BICEP and Keck collaborations, the tensor-to-scalar ratio is $r_{0.05}<0.036$ (95\% C.L.) and $ <1.3\sigma$ non-zero (with pre-DESI BAO data). However, recent datasets have significantly shifted the bestfit values of relevant $\Lambda$CDM cosmological parameters, and thus possibly alter the amplitude of lensing B-mode spectrum, which would affect the search for $r$. Here, the joint analysis of Planck and BICEP/Keck data with DESI DR2 reveals that the lower bound of $r_{0.05}$ is $2.0\sigma$ and $2.1\sigma$ non-zero for PantheonPlus and DES-Y5, respectively, and the bestfit $r$ is $r_{0.05}\simeq 0.01$. The results are consistent with those with DESI DR1, but slightly strengthened. There might be still systematic uncertainties in B-mode measurements due to the foreground contamination, however, our work is to not say what about the value of $r$, but emphasize that the detection for $r$ is model-dependent and depends potentially on our insight into the dark universe, highlighting the important role of cosmological surveys in comprehending our very early universe.

 - **Abstract**
 It has been suggested that Jupiter's fuzzy core could be a result of a giant impact. Here, we investigate the expected impact conditions from N-body simulations. We then use state-of-the-art SPH simulations to investigate the results of impacts with different conditions including various impactor masses and composition, different formation stages in Jupiter's growth, and different resolutions. We next simulate the long-term thermal evolution of Jupiter post-impact. We find that N-body simulations predict rather oblique impacts, and that head-on collisions are rare. Moreover, our results show that even under a head-on collision, Jupiter's fuzzy core cannot be formed. We next simulated Jupiter's thermal evolution and showed that unless post-impact temperatures are extremely low, a giant impact would not lead to an extended dilute core as inferred by interior models. We conclude that Jupiter's fuzzy core is not caused by an impact and is likely to be an outcome of its formation process.

 To exhume the buried signatures of free-floating planets (FFPs) with small angular Einstein radius $\theta_\mathrm{E}$, we build a new full-frame difference image for the Korean Microlensing Telescope Network (KMTNet) survey based on the newly optimized pySIS package. We introduce the detailed processes of the new pipeline, including frame registration, difference image analysis, and light curve extraction. To test this pipeline, we extract the light curves for 483,068 stars with $I \lesssim 17$ and conduct a model-independent search for microlensing events. The search finds 36 microlensing events, including five new events and six events discovered by other collaborations but missed by previous KMTNet searches. We find that the light curves from the new pipeline are precise enough to be sensitive to FFPs with $\theta_\mathrm{E} \sim 1~\mu$as. Using the new pipeline, a complete FFP search on the eight-year KMTNet images can be finished within six months and then yield the FFP mass function. The new pipeline can be used for a new KMTNet AlertFinder system, with significantly reduced false positives.

 The field of astrophysics is continuously advancing, with an ever-growing influx of data requiring robust and efficient analysis tools. As the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) radio telescopes come fully operational, we anticipate the generation of hundreds of petabytes of data annually, characterized by unprecedented resolution and detail. In this context, scientific visualization becomes a critical component, enabling researchers to interpret complex datasets and extract meaningful insights. The immense volume of data demands not only suitable tools but also substantial infrastructure and computational capacity to analyze it effectively. In this work, we will discuss how we are addressing these challenges with the development of our interactive visualization tool named VisIVO Visual Analytics. The tool is transitioning from a local visualizer to a remote visualizer, utilizing a client-server architecture. This evolution will allow the software to run parallel visualization pipelines on high-performance computing (HPC) clusters, thereby enhancing its capacity to handle extensive datasets efficiently.

 Popular culture plays a significant role in shaping public interest in science, and Taylor Swift's discography frequently incorporates astrophysics terminology. This study examines the occurrence of astrophysics-related words in her lyrics and their representation in the Eras tour set list. By analyzing the frequency of words in Swift's total discography, we identify that astrophysics is promoted the most within her most recent album, The Tortured Poets Department, whereas songs from Midnights promoted astrophysics the most throughout the Eras tour. We catagorize words into various disciplines of astrophysics and find that multimessenger astronomy is promoted the most, both in Swift's total discography and throughout the Eras tour. We perform Taylor expansion and predict $12 \pm 5$ astrophysical terms in Swift's next album. This analysis offers a unique perspective on the intersection of music and science, revealing how Swift's artistry may unintentionally promote interest in different fields of astrophysics.

 - **Abstract**
 High angular resolution holds the key to extending our knowledge in several domains of astronomical research. In addition to the development of new instruments, advancements in post-processing algorithms can enhance the performances attainable in an observation, turning archival observations into a treasure. We developed a machine-learning tool, named zoom-in, that is able to improve the angular resolution of an astronomical image by a factor of $\sim 100$ by optimally recombining short-cadence sequences of images. After training our model on real-life photographs, we tested our method on archival images of the Moon taken through ESO instruments. We were able to achieve a remarkable spatial resolution of $\sim 1$ m of the lunar surface. While analyzing one of the fields from the sample, we discovered structures of clear anthropic origin inside the Aristarchus crater. The features appear to be consistent with ancient ruins of cities and castles. A thorough analysis of the relevant literature allowed us to conclude that this valley corresponds to the one described in Ludovico Ariosto's "Orlando Furioso": a place where all the items lost by humans gather and pile up. Analyses of the surface brightness from our images, indicating an abnormally high albedo of $\sim 0.25$, further corroborate this idea suggesting a conspicuous presence of glass. We infer the presence of >1 billion flasks of human wits on the lunar surface, whose origin we investigate in detail. We urge for a dedicated mission, astolfo, to be carried out by Artemis astronauts in order to recover human wits and bring them back to the Earth.

This novel technique can allow authors to reduce or eliminate publication charges for journals such as MNRAS and ApJ. In order to offset publication costs entirely, we recommend that authors include anywhere from 200-700 corner plots per paper, with the exact number depending on the journal used. Finally, we discuss other opportunities to generate ad revenue through publications.

 - **Abstract**
 When a relativistic jet is launched following the core-collapse of a star, its interaction with the stellar envelope leads to the formation of a hot cocoon, which produces various viewing-angle-dependent observational phenomena following the breakout from the surface. We study the observational signatures of fast X-ray transient (FXT) EP240414a, which may originate from a jet-cocoon system viewed slightly off-axis. In our model, (1) the prompt X-ray emission lasting $\sim\! 100\,{\rm{s}}$ is attributed to the cooling emission from the inner cocoon (shocked jet material); (2) the $\sim\! 0.1\,{\rm{d}}$ X-ray emission comes from the inner cocoon's afterglow; (3) the $\sim\! 0.4\,{\rm{d}}$ thermal-dominated optical emission arises from the cooling of the outer cocoon (shocked stellar material); (4) the $\sim\! 3\,{\rm{d}}$ non-thermal optical component and subsequent radio emission can be explained by the afterglow from a jet with a viewing angle of $10^{\circ}\lesssim \theta_{\rm{v}}\lesssim15^\circ$; and (5) the associated broad-lined Type Ic supernova only dominates the optical emission after $\sim\! 7\rm\, d$. Both the jet inferred from the off-axis afterglow and the inner cocoon constrained by the cooling emission are found to have similar kinetic energies, on the order of $10^{51}\,{\rm{erg}}$. We find that the progenitor's radius is $\sim3\,R_\odot$ as constrained by the { inner cocoon's} cooling emissions, indicating that the pre-explosion star may be a massive helium star that is slightly inflated. More FXTs associated with off-axis jets and supernovae will be further examined by the Einstein Probe, leading to a deeper understanding of jet-cocoon systems.

 - **Abstract**
 The formation and migration history of a planet is expected to be imprinted in its atmosphere, in particular its carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratio and metallicity. The BOWIE-ALIGN programme is performing a comparative study of JWST spectra of four aligned and four misaligned hot Jupiters, with the aim of characterising their atmospheres and corroborating the link between the observables and the formation history. In this work, we present the $2.8-5.2$ micron transmission spectrum of TrES-4b, a hot Jupiter with an orbit aligned with the rotation axis of its F-type host star. Using free chemistry atmospheric retrievals, we report a confident detection of H$_2$O at an abundance of $\log X_\mathrm{H_2O}=-2.98^{+0.68}_{-0.73}$ at a significance of $8.4\sigma$. We also find evidence for CO and small amounts of CO$_2$, retrieving abundances $\log X_\mathrm{CO}= -3.76^{+0.89}_{-1.01}$ and $\log X_\mathrm{CO_2}= -6.86^{+0.62}_{-0.65}$ ($3.1\sigma$ and $4.0\sigma$ respectively). The observations are consistent with the the atmosphere being in chemical equilibrium; our retrievals yield $\mathrm{C/O}$ between $0.30-0.42$ and constrain the atmospheric metallicity to the range $0.4-0.7\times$ solar. The inferred sub-stellar properties (C/O and metallicity) challenge traditional models, and could have arisen from an oxygen-rich gas accretion scenario, or a combination of low-metallicity gas and carbon-poor solid accretion.

 - **Abstract**
 Spectra of the nearly edge-on protoplanetary disks observed with the JWST have shown ice absorption bands of varying optical depths and peculiar profiles, challenging radiative transfer modelling and our understanding of dust and ice in disks. We build models including dust grain size, shape, and composition to reproduce JWST IFU spectroscopy of the large edge-on disk Tau042021. We explore radiative transfer models using different dust grain size distributions, including grains of effective radii a_eff = 0.005-3000 microns. Scattering properties of distributions of triaxial ellipsoidal grains are calculated. We consider compositions with silicates, amorphous carbon, and mixtures of H2O, CO2, and CO. We use RADMC-3D Monte Carlo radiative transfer models of Tau042021 to simulate the spectral cubes observed with JWST-NIRSpec and MIRI. We compare the results to observations, including H2O at 3.05 microns, CO at 4.67 microns, and CO2 at 4.27 microns and to archival JWST-NIRCam and ALMA continuum images. The observed near- to mid-infrared imply dust distributions with grain sizes up to several tens of microns. The intensity distribution perpendicular to the disk exhibits emission profile wings extending into the upper disk atmosphere at altitudes exceeding the classical scale height expected in the isothermal hydrostatic limit. We produce ice map images demonstrating the presence of icy dust grains up to altitudes high above the disk midplane, more than three hydrostatic equilibrium scale heights. We demonstrate the presence of a wind containing the carriers of astronomical PAH bands. The wind appears as an X-shaped emission at 3.3, 6.2, 7.7 and 11.3 microns, characteristic wavelengths of the infrared astronomical PAH bands. We associate the spatial distribution of this component with carriers of astronomical PAH bands that form a layer of emission at the interface with the H2 wind.

 - **Abstract**
 The Lyman-break technique has been used to successfully identify high-redshift candidates in broad-band photometric data in the rest-frame optical and NIR using the dropout technique. We pioneer the application of this technique to new wavelength regimes, and search for dropouts in combined ALMA and JWST data. We find a candidate that is undetected in NIRCam imaging including and blueward of the F444W filter, but clearly identified in ALMA band 3. Assuming this is a Lyman-break candidate, we measure a redshift in the range $40 < z < 21\,380$. This is the highest redshift galaxy candidate discovered to date, and is in significant tension with current and future predictions from cosmological simulations, with implications for galaxy evolution in the (very) early Universe.

 - **Abstract**
 Recently the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) provided constraints on the expansion history from their Data Release 2 (DR2). The DESI baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements are well described by a flat $\Lambda$CDM model, but the preferred parameters are in mild ($2.3\sigma$) tension with those determined from the cosmic microwave background (CMB). The DESI collaboration has already explored a variety of solutions to this tension relying on variations in the late-time evolution of dark energy. Here we test an alternative -- the introduction of an ``early dark energy'' (EDE) component. We find that EDE models can alleviate the tension, though they lead to differences in other cosmological parameters that have observational implications. Particularly the EDE models that fit the acoustic datasets prefer lower $\Omega_m$, higher $H_0$, $n_s$ and $\sigma_8$ in contrast to the late-time solutions. We discuss the current status and near-future prospects for distinguishing amongst these solutions.

          The End of the Road for Far-infrared Reddening Maps? Evidence for Reddening Errors Driven by Changes in PAH Abundance

 - **Abstract**
 Accurate correction for extinction by Galactic dust is essential for studying the extragalactic sky. In the low-extinction regions of the Ursa Major molecular cloud complex, we demonstrate that Galactic dust reddening maps constructed from observations of far-infrared emission are insensitive to variations in the abundance of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and, as a result, to PAH-induced variations in reddening. Using galaxy counts to validate various reddening maps, we find evidence that maps based on far-infrared emission erroneously under-predict reddening compared to stellar reddening maps. This underestimation by far-infrared emission based reddening maps -- representing the largest discrepancy between maps of up to $E(B-V)=0.08$ mag -- is correlated with the relative brightness of PAH emission. Furthermore, we demonstrate theoretically that changes in PAH abundance via accretion from the gas phase is capable of altering extinction significantly with only minor changes to far-infrared emission. We show that modeling the extinction of Ursa Major using both far-infrared and mid-infrared emission more accurately traces dust extinction variations due to changes in PAH abundance. Finally, we discuss how SPHEREx observations of the 3.3 $\mu$m PAH feature are a promising way to overcome this limitation of far-infrared emission.

          A Panchromatic View of Late-time Shock Power in the Type II Supernova 2023ixf

 - **Abstract**
 We present multi-wavelength observations of the type II supernova (SN II) 2023ixf during its first two years of evolution. We combine ground-based optical/NIR spectroscopy with Hubble Space Telescope (HST) far- and near-ultraviolet spectroscopy and James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) near- and mid-infrared photometry and spectroscopy to create spectral energy distributions of SN 2023ixf at +374 and +620 days post-explosion, covering a wavelength range of ~0.1-30 $\mu$m. The multi-band light curve of SN 2023ixf follows a standard radioactive decay decline rate after the plateau until ~500 days, at which point shock powered emission from ongoing interaction between the SN ejecta and circumstellar material (CSM) begins to dominate. This evolution is temporally consistent with 0.3-10 keV X-ray detections of SN 2023ixf and broad ''boxy'' spectral line emission from reprocessing of shock luminosity in a cold dense shell located between forward and reverse shocks. Using the expected absorbed radioactive decay power and the detected X-ray luminosity, we quantify the total shock powered emission at the +374 and +620 day epochs and find that it can be explained by nearly complete thermalization of the reverse shock luminosity as SN 2023ixf interacts with a continuous, ''wind-like'' CSM with a progenitor mass-loss rate of $\dot M \approx 10^{-4}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ ($v_w = 20 \pm 5$ km/s). Additionally, we construct multi-epoch spectral models from the non-LTE radiative transfer code CMFGEN, which contain radioactive decay and shock powers, as well as dust absorption, scattering, and emission. We find that models with shock powers of $L_{sh} = (0.5-1) \times 10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and $(0.5 - 1) \times 10^{-3}$ M$_{\odot}$ of silicate dust in the cold dense shell and/or inner SN ejecta can effectively reproduce the global properties of the late-time (>300 days) UV-to-IR spectra of SN 2023ixf.

 - **Abstract**
 Based on the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN), we present a novel emulator of the global 21 cm cosmology signal, $\texttt{21cmKAN}$, that provides extremely fast training speed while achieving nearly equivalent accuracy to the most accurate emulator to date, $\texttt{21cmLSTM}$. The combination of enhanced speed and accuracy facilitated by $\texttt{21cmKAN}$ enables rapid and highly accurate physical parameter estimation analyses of multiple 21 cm models, which is needed to fully characterize the complex feature space across models and produce robust constraints on the early universe. Rather than using static functions to model complex relationships like traditional fully-connected neural networks do, KANs learn expressive transformations that can perform significantly better for low-dimensional physical problems. $\texttt{21cmKAN}$ predicts a given signal for two well-known models in the community in 3.7 ms on average and trains about 75 times faster than $\texttt{21cmLSTM}$, when utilizing the same typical GPU. $\texttt{21cmKAN}$ is able to achieve these speeds because of its learnable, data-driven transformations and its relatively small number of trainable parameters compared to a memory-based emulator. We show that $\texttt{21cmKAN}$ required less than 30 minutes to train and fit these simulated signals and obtain unbiased posterior distributions. We find that the transparent architecture of $\texttt{21cmKAN}$ allows us to conveniently interpret and further validate its emulation results in terms of the sensitivity of the 21 cm signal to each physical parameter. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of KANs and their ability to more quickly and accurately mimic expensive physical simulations in comparison to other types of neural networks.

 - **Abstract**
 Exozodiacal dust disks (exozodis) are populations of warm (~300K) or hot (~1000K) dust, located in or interior to a star's habitable zone, detected around ~25% of main-sequence stars as excess emission over the stellar photosphere at mid- or near-infrared wavelengths. Often too plentiful to be explained by an in-situ planetesimal belt, exozodi dust is usually thought to be transported inwards from further out in the system. There is no consensus on which (if any) of various proposed dynamical models is correct, yet it is vital to understand exozodis given the risk they pose to direct imaging and characterisation of Earth-like planets. This article reviews current theoretical understanding of the origin and evolution of exozodi dust. It also identifies key questions pertinent to the potential for exozodis to impact exoplanet imaging and summarises current understanding of the answer to them informed by exozodi theory. These address how exozodi dust is delivered, its size and spatial distribution, and the effect of its composition on exozodi observability, as well as the connection between hot and warm exozodis. Also addressed are how common different exozodi levels are and how that level can be predicted from system properties, as well as the features that planets impart in dust distributions and how exozodis affect a planet's physical properties and habitability. We conclude that exozodis present both a problem and an opportunity, e.g., by introducing noise that makes planets harder to detect, but also identifying systems in which ingredients conducive to life, like water and volatiles, are delivered to the habitable zone.

 - **Abstract**
 We present far- and near-ultraviolet (UV) spectra of the Type II supernovae (SNe) SN~2023ixf from days 199 to 722 and SN~2024ggi at days 41 and 232. Both supernovae show broad, blueshifted, and asymmetric UV emission lines with an initial maximum velocity of $\sim9000\,km\,s^{-1}$ and narrow unresolved emission in CIV. We compare the optical and UV emission-line profiles, showing that they evolve from two distinct velocity profiles to a single profile tracing the UV emission. We interpret this as shock power from interaction with circumstellar material coming to dominate over the radioactive-decay power from the inner ejecta. Comparing our observations to radiative transfer models with injected shock power, we find SN~2024ggi is best matched by $P_{\mathrm{shock, abs}}=1\times10^{41}\,erg\,s^{-1}$ at day 40, SN~2023ixf at day 300 and SN~2024ggi at day 200 are best matched by $P_{\mathrm{shock,abs}}=1\times10^{40}\,erg\,s^{-1}$, and SN~2023ixf at day 600 is best matched by $P_{\mathrm{shock,abs}}=5\times10^{39}\,erg\,s^{-1}$. From these models, we find the mass-loss rate of both supernovae increased just before explosion. For SN~2023ixf our mass-loss rates go from $4\times10^{-5}\,M_{\odot}\,yr^{-1}$ at 600 yr before explosion to $2\times10^{-2}\,M_{\odot}\,yr^{-1}$ at 15 yr prior to explosion. For SN~2024ggi, we find a mass-loss rate of $9\times10^{-5}\,M_{\odot}\,yr^{-1}$ at 150 yr before explosion and $1\times10^{-3}\,M_{\odot}\,yr^{-1}$ at 30 yr before explosion.

          MINDS. Strong oxygen depletion in the inner regions of a very low-mass star disk?

 - **Abstract**
 JWST is discovering a plethora of species in planet-forming disks around very low-mass stars such as C2H2, C6H6, C4H2, CH3 etc. The column densities of these species retrieved from 0D slab models are very large, e.g. of the order of $10^{20}$\,cm$^{-2}$. This is indicating a carbon-dominated chemistry in a gas with a high C/O ratio. The disk around 2MASS-J1605321-1993159 (M4.5) is one such source showing a molecular pseudo-continuum of C2H2. Still two oxygen-bearing molecules, CO and CO2 are also detected in this source. We aim to take the next step beyond 0D slab models to interpret the spectrum. We examine whether 2D thermo-chemical disk models can produce the large inferred column densities of \ce{C2H2} in the inner regions of the disk and produce a pseudo-continuum in the mid-IR spectrum. We also want to constrain whether depletion of oxygen or enrichment of carbon is causing the high C/O ratio triggering a carbon-dominated chemistry. We utilize the radiative thermo-chemical disk model P{\tiny RO}D{\tiny I}M{\tiny O} to identify a disk structure which is capable of producing the observed molecular emission of species such as CO, CO2, C2H2, and H2O simultaneously. The spectrum is generated using the fast line tracer FLiTs. We derive the gas temperature $\langle T \rangle$, column density $\langle$ log$_{\rm {10}} N\rangle$ and the emitting area $\langle r_{\rm{1}} - r_{\rm{2}} \rangle$ for these molecules from the 2D disk model and compare them to the parameters retrieved originally from 0D slab models. We use the different effect that changing the O or C abundance has on CO and C2H2 respectively to discriminate between O depletion and C enhancement. We find that a disk structure characterised by the presence of a gap can best explain the observations. The inner disk is strongly depleted in dust, especially small grains ($<5\,\mu$m), and ..

 - **Abstract**
 The Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI) is a gamma-ray survey telescope utilizing a compact Compton imager design, enabled by an array of 16 high-resolution germanium cross-strip detectors. After its launch into an equatorial Low Earth Orbit (LEO) in 2027, COSI will experience radiation damage primarily due to energetic protons, with the proton fluence dominated by the passage of COSI through the edge of the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA) for a few minutes each orbit. We have developed a comprehensive program focused on the modeling, characterization, data correction, and physical repair of radiation damage effects in the COSI detectors. We have performed energetic proton beam irradiations of a spare COSI detector at a proton synchrotron, with proton fluences consistent with multiple years of exposure to the COSI space radiation environment. These exposures allow us to characterize the relationship between proton fluence and induced charge trapping. We demonstrate our techniques to correct for trapping effects, as well as characterize the effectiveness of high-temperature annealing on correcting this damage, as characterized by the resulting spectral performance of the detector. We will present our efforts to characterize the effects of radiation damage in the COSI detectors, as well as our techniques for correcting these effects in the data analysis pipeline and ultimately repairing the detectors on orbit every few years through high-temperature annealing.

 Data on five Washington Double Star catalog binaries were collected from the Dimension Point Observatory (Mayhill, New Mexico) and Las Cumbres Observatory (Cerro Tololo, Chile) on February 19, 2025, and March 5, 2025, respectively. Student researchers participating in the Four Corners Research Seminar measured the position angle (theta/deg) and separation (rho/arcsec) of each target using AstroImageJ and an author-created script utilizing the Astropy module in Python3. Each target was imaged using a variety of instruments, filters, and exposure times. Compared to the extrapolated 6th Orbit Catalog estimates, measurements using AstroImageJ were within 1.52% of theta and 14.87% of rho, while the author's automated code method provided measurements within 4.09% of theta and 16.59% of rho.

 - **Abstract**
 Next-generation gamma-ray observatories aim to enable precision measurements in high-energy astrophysics using advanced semiconductor detector technologies. Meeting the scientific requirements of modern instruments demands detector systems that provide high spatial and spectral resolution across large detection areas, with strict limits on power consumption and mass. These needs drive innovation in front-end electronics and mixed-signal processing to support compact detector electrode geometries. Application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) are essential in front-end readout electronics, enabling high-channel-density and low-power systems, while maintaining low-noise performance suitable for space-based instruments and balloon-borne payloads. The NRL4 (Naval Research Laboratory 4) is a recently developed 32-channel front-end ASIC featuring low-power, low-noise channels consisting of charge-sensitive preamplifiers, 4 configurable gain settings, dual configurable shapers for optimized timing and energy resolution, trimmable per-channel discrimination, time-to-analog conversion, and peak-detect output. The NRL4 has been integrated with a high-purity germanium (HPGe) dual-sided strip detector with a 1.16 mm strip pitch. Energy resolution of 3 keV full width at half maximum (FWHM) at 59.54 keV was achieved with a gain of 18.4 mV/fC and a slow shaper peaking time of 2 {\mu}s. Preliminary results from ongoing research demonstrate the suitability of the NRL4 for high-resolution, low-power gamma-ray spectroscopy for ground and space-based missions.

 - **Abstract**
 Light curve analysis of W UMa-type contact binary systems using MCMC or MC methods can be time-consuming, primarily because the repeated generation of synthetic light curves tends to be relatively slow during the fitting process. Although various approaches have been proposed to address this issue, their implementation is often challenging due to complexity or uncertain performance. In this study, we introduce the BSN application, whose name is taken from the BSN project. The application is designed for analyzing contact binary system light curves, supporting photometric data, and employing an MCMC algorithm for efficient parameter estimation. The BSN application generates synthetic light curves more than 40 times faster than PHOEBE during the MCMC fitting process. The BSN application enhances light curve analysis with an expanded feature set and a more intuitive interface while maintaining compliance with established scientific standards. In addition, we present the first light curve analyses of four contact binary systems based on the TESS data, utilizing the BSN application version 1.0. We also conducted a light curve analysis using the PHOEBE Python code and compared the resulting outputs. Two of the target systems exhibited asymmetries in the maxima of their light curves, which were appropriately modeled by introducing a cold starspot on one of the components. The estimated mass ratios of these total-eclipse systems place them within the category of low mass ratio contact binary stars. The estimation of the absolute parameters for the selected systems was carried out using the $P-a$ empirical relationship. Based on the effective temperatures and masses of the components, three of the target systems were classified as A-subtype, while TIC 434222993 was identified as a W-subtype system.

          Limitations in constraining neutron star radii and nuclear properties from inspiral gravitational wave detections

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the constraints on the neutron star equation of state (EoS) and nuclear properties achievable with third-generation gravitational wave detectors using the Fisher information matrix approach. Assuming an optimistic binary neutron star (BNS) merger rate, we generate synthetic inspiral gravitational wave (GW) signals corresponding to one year of observation. From these simulated data, we compute the covariance matrix and posterior distributions for nuclear properties and EoS. Our results show that the EoS can be tightly constrained, particularly in the density range between one and four times nuclear saturation density. However, due to the scarcity of of low-mass neutron stars in the GW sample, the EoS at sub-saturation densities remains poorly constrained. Thus, in turn, leads to weaker constraints on neutron star radii, as the radii are sensitive to the low-density EoS. Additionally, We note that the nuclear properties are degenerate in their influence on the EoS, making them difficult to be constrained through GW observations alone. These highlights inherent limitations of inspiral GW signals in probing dense matter properties. Therefore, precise radius measurements, post-merger GW observations, and supplementary constraints from terrestrial nuclear experiments remain essential for a comprehensive understanding of dense matter.

 - **Abstract**
 This study provides the first comprehensive analysis of eight total-eclipse W Ursae Majoris-type contact binary systems. Ground-based photometric multiband observations were conducted at a Mexican observatory, and new times of minima were extracted. The O-C analysis reveals that four of our target binaries exhibit a long-term increase in their orbital periods, while the others show a long-term decrease in their orbital periods. We analyzed the light curves using the PHOEBE Python code and BSN application. Among the target systems, two required the inclusion of a cold starspot on one of the components to achieve an adequate fit. The light curve analysis revealed that the target systems exhibit a shallow fillout factor. Absolute parameters were estimated using the Gaia DR3 parallax and astrophysics equations. Considering the effective temperatures and component masses, each system was classified as either the A- or W-subtype. The stellar evolution of the systems was represented through the mass-radius and mass-luminosity diagrams. Additionally, we calculated the initial masses of the companion stars and the total mass lost for each target system.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the behavior of the water-ammonia system at high pressure-high temperature conditions is important for modeling the internal dynamics of exoplanet icy mantles. Conventionally, mixtures of ammonia hemihydrate AHH (2:1 ammonia-water molar ratio) and H2O ice VII have been regarded as the ultimate solid phase assembly in the system. Here we report evidence for chemical reactions between AHH and ice VII above 750 K and 16 GPa that stabilize water-rich ammonia hydrates, including a novel ultra-water rich hydrate NH3.6H2O (1:6 ratio) coexisting with ammonia dihydrate ADH (1:2 ratio) and excess ice VII. This assembly is stable up to at least 30 GPa and 1600 K and can be quenched to room temperature. Our results demonstrate that water-rich ammonia hydrates are favored in the icy mantle of 1-2 MEarth exoplanets regardless of the ammonia content of the hydrate crystallized during accretion and/or evolution as long as excess H2O ice is available. The buoyancy contrast between water-rich hydrates and ice VII may lead to chemical stratification in exoplanet icy mantles, hence affecting their thermal evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 All the four giant planets in our Solar System have rings, but their characteristics are very different. The rings consist of a number of small particles, although individual particles have not been directly imaged. Near the central planet, colliding particles bounce off each other in low-velocity impacts but cannot gravitationally merge due to the effect of the tidal force, resulting in the formation of rings, whereas in more distant regions particles can gravitationally accrete to form satellites. Rings exhibit various types of fine structure, and the mutual gravitational forces between particles and the gravity from satellites play an important role in rings of macroscopic particles, while non-gravitational forces are important for dusty rings. There are several theories about the origin of rings, and formation mechanisms are likely to be different among different ring systems. The rings of small Solar System bodies were discovered through observations of occultations of stars by these bodies. It is natural to expect that some exoplanets should also have rings, but their detection remains challenging. Future discovery of more ring-moon systems around small bodies and exoplanets will provide clues to understanding the formation and evolution of the central bodies that host them.

 - **Abstract**
 Classifying variable stars is crucial for advancing our understanding of stellar evolution and dynamics. As large-scale surveys generate increasing volumes of light curve data, the demand for automated and reliable classification techniques continues to grow. Traditional methods often rely on manual feature extraction and selection, which can be labor-intensive and less effective for managing extensive datasets. In this study, we present a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based method for classifying variable stars using raw light curve data and their known periods. Our approach eliminates the need for manual feature extraction and preselected preprocessing steps. By applying phase-folding and interpolation to structure the light curves, the model learns variability patterns critical for accurate classification. Trained and evaluated on the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN) dataset, our model achieves an average accuracy of 90% and an F1 score of 0.86 across six well-known classes of variable stars. The CNN effectively handles the diverse shapes and sampling cadences of light curves, offering a robust, automated, data-driven solution for classifying variable stars. This automated, data-driven method provides a robust solution for classifying variable stars, enabling the efficient analysis of large datasets from both current and future sky surveys.

          Bayesian Inference of Gravity through Realistic 3D Modeling of Wide Binary Orbits: General Algorithm and a Pilot Study with HARPS Radial Velocities

 - **Abstract**
 When 3D relative displacement $\mathbf{r}$ and velocity $\mathbf{v}$ between the pair in a gravitationally-bound system are precisely measured, the six measured quantities at one phase can allow elliptical orbit solutions at a given gravitational parameter $G$. Due to degeneracies between orbital-geometric parameters and $G$, individual Bayesian inferences and their statistical consolidation are needed to infer $G$ as recently suggested by a Bayesian 3D modeling algorithm. Here I present a fully general Bayesian algorithm suitable for wide binaries with two (almost) exact sky-projected relative positions (as in the Gaia data release 3) and the other four sufficiently precise quantities. Wide binaries meeting the requirements of the general algorithm to allow for its full potential are rare at present, largely because the measurement uncertainty of the line-of-sight (radial) separation is usually larger than the true separation. As a pilot study, the algorithm is applied to 32 Gaia binaries for which precise HARPS radial velocities are available. The value of $\Gamma \equiv \log_{10}\sqrt{G/G_{\rm N}}$ (where $G_{\rm N}$ is Newton's constant) is $-0.002_{-0.018}^{+0.012}$ supporting Newton for a combination of 24 binaries with Newtonian acceleration $g_{\rm N}>10^{-9}$m s$^{-2}$, while it is $\Gamma=0.063_{-0.047}^{+0.058}$ or $0.134_{-0.040}^{+0.050}$ for $7\text{ or }8$ binaries with $g_{\rm N}<10^{-9}$m s$^{-2}$ (depending on one system) showing tension with Newton. The Newtonian ``outlier'' is at the boundary set by the Newtonian escape velocity, but can be consistent with modified gravity. The pilot study demonstrates the potential of the algorithm in measuring gravity at low acceleration with future samples of wide binaries.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) B-mode polarization provide a way to probe primordial gravitational waves and test inflationary predictions. Extragalactic point sources become a major source of contamination after delensing and can bias estimates of the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ at the $10^{-3}$ level. We introduce Generalized Point Spread Function Fitting (GPSF), a method for removing point-source contamination in polarization maps. GPSF uses the full pixel-domain covariance, including off-diagonal terms, and models overlapping sources. This allows accurate flux estimation under realistic conditions, particularly for small-aperture telescopes with large beams that are more susceptible to source blending. We test GPSF on simulated sky maps, apply foreground cleaning using the Needlet Internal Linear Combination (NILC) method, and compare its performance with standard masking and inpainting. The results show GPSF reduces point-source contamination without significantly affecting the background signal, as seen in both the maps and their power spectra. For the constraint on $r$, GPSF reduces the bias from $1.67 \times 10^{-3}$ to $2.9 \times 10^{-4}$, with only a 2% increase in standard deviation. Compared to inpainting and masking, GPSF yields lower bias while maintaining comparable variance. This suggests that it may serve as a promising method for future CMB experiments targeting measurements of $r \sim 10^{-3}$.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a framework that combines physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) inference to constrain dynamical dark energy models using the Pantheon+ Type Ia supernova compilation. First, we train a physics-informed neural network to learn the solution of the Friedmann equation and accurately reproduce the matter density term x_m(z) = Omega_m,0 (1+z)^3 across a range of Omega_m,0. For each of five two-parameter equation-of-state (EoS) forms: Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL), Barboza-Alcaniz (BA), Jassal-Bagla-Padmanabhan (JBP), Linear-z, and Logarithmic-z, we derive the analytic dark energy factor x_de(z), embed the trained surrogate within a GPU-accelerated likelihood pipeline, and sample the posterior of (h0, Omega_m,0, w0, wa, M0) using the emcee ensemble sampler with the full Pantheon+ covariance. All parameterizations remain consistent with a cosmological constant (w0 = -1, wa = 0) at the 95% credible level, with the tightest bounds from the CPL form. While the surrogate does not reduce computation time for a single run in simple models, it becomes advantageous for repeated analyses of the same EoS or for models with expensive likelihood evaluations, and can be shared as a reusable tool with different datasets within the training range of SNe redshifts. This flexibility makes the approach a scalable tool for future cosmological inference, especially in regimes where conventional ODE-based methods are computationally prohibitive.

 - **Abstract**
 Cygnus X-1 is a persistent, high-mass black hole X-ray binary (BHXRB) which in the hard state shows many similar properties to transient BHXRBs, along with intriguing differences, such as the lack of quasi-periodic oscillations. Here, we compare for the first time the detailed spectral-timing properties of Cyg X-1 with a transient BHXRB, MAXI J1820+070, combining data from XMM-Newton and NICER with contemporaneous INTEGRAL data to study the power spectra, rms spectra and time-lags over a broad 0.5 - 200 keV range. We select bright hard state MAXI J1820+070 data with similar power-spectral shapes to the Cyg X-1 data, to compare the source behaviours while accounting for the evolution of spectral-timing properties, notably the lags, through the hard state. Cyg X-1 shows no evidence for soft lags in the 1 - 10 Hz frequency range where they are clearly detected for MAXI J1820+070. Furthermore the low-frequency hard lags and rms-spectra evolve much more strongly during the hard state of Cyg X-1 than for MAXI J1820+070. We argue that these differences cannot be explained by the different black hole masses of these systems, but may be related to their different accretion rates and corresponding locations on the hardness-intensity diagram. We conjecture that there is a significant luminosity-dependence of coronal geometry in the hard state of BHXRBs, rather than an intrinsic difference between Cyg X-1 and transient BHXRBs. This possibility has also been suggested to explain a common time-lag feature that appears in the hard intermediate states of Cyg X-1 and transient BHXRBs.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent work has successfully achieved sub-arcsecond wide-field imaging with high-band observations from the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR). However, the scalability of this work remains limited due to the need for manual intervention, poor calibration solutions for the Dutch LOFAR stations, and high computational costs. We address these issues by: (1) improving automated self-calibration using a signal-to-noise metric and a neural network for image artefact detection; (2) implementing a refined calibration strategy for the Dutch LOFAR stations; and (3) cutting computational costs by optimising the data processing strategy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our automated processing strategy by reprocessing one previously reduced dataset and a new dataset from the ELAIS-N1 deep field, which features more severe ionospheric conditions. We find calibration artefacts across facet boundaries to be reduced with our improved automated calibration strategy and achieve a computational cost reduction of about a factor of 4 to 6 compared to previous work, where the exact factor depends on whether a single observation is processed or multiple observations of the same sky area are combined. Further optimisation and improved handling of data with baseline-dependent averaging could reduce this in the near future by another factor of two, bringing the total cost for an 8-hour observation below 30,000 CPU core hours. This work enables ultra-deep imaging at sensitivities on the order of a few $\mu$Jy/beam. Furthermore, it also lays the foundation for a fully automated survey pipeline for sub-arcsecond wide-field imaging of the northern sky with LOFAR.

 - **Abstract**
 Comparing the dynamical and stellar masses of Milky Way (MW) globular clusters (GCs) reveals a discrepancy exceeding a factor of two. Since this substantial invisible mass is concentrated in the cluster centre, it is attributed to stellar remnants. The majority of mass in remnants consists of white dwarfs (WDs). Allocating over half of a GC's current mass to WDs could significantly restrict the dynamical evolution scenarios governing stellar clusters. As the most massive stars in GCs, black holes (BHs) exert a substantial effect on the escape rate of lower mass stars, such as WDs. This paper aims to identify which scenarios of BH natal kicks can accurately reproduce the notable dark remnant fraction observed in MW GCs. We compare the observed remnant fraction of MW GCs with a comprehensive grid of direct \Nbody simulations while adjusting the natal kick received by BHs. Our results reveal that simulations employing low natal kicks to BHs are the only ones capable of mirroring the remnant fraction of MW GCs. According to the Spitzer instability, the presence of a BH population prompts the formation of a BH sub-system (BHSub) at the centre of a star cluster. The BHSub serves as an energetic power plant, continually releasing kinetic energy through few-body encounters between single and binary BHs, and transferring the generated energy to the entire stellar population. This energy induces a significant difference in the ejection rate of stellar remnants and luminous stars, ultimately increasing the fraction of dark remnants within the star cluster.

 - **Abstract**
 LDN 1616 is a cometary globule located approximately 8 degrees west of the Orion OB1 associations. The massive OB stars in the Orion belt region act as catalysts, triggering the star formation activity observed in the L1616 region, which is a photodissociation region (PDR). This paper provides an in-depth analysis of gas kinematics within the L1616 PDR, leveraging the Heterodyne Array Receiver Program (HARP) on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) to observe 13CO and C18O (3-2) emissions. Employing the Clumpfind algorithm on the C18O emission data, we identify three distinct clumps within this PDR. For each of these clumps, we derive key physical parameters, including the mean kinetic temperature, optical depth, and velocity dispersion. In addition, we compute the non-thermal velocity dispersion and Mach number, providing critical insights into the turbulent dynamics of the gas. A comprehensive evaluation of mass, including virial and energy budget evaluations, is conducted to assess the gravitational stability and star-forming potential of the identified clumps. While previous studies have proposed that radiation-driven implosion (RDI) is the dominant mechanism initiating star formation in LDN 1616, our results suggest that the clumps may represent pre-existing substructures within the PDR. This interpretation is supported by our estimation of a relatively low interstellar radiation field, which, although insufficient to form clumps independently, may enhance gravitational instability through additional compression. Thus, our findings offer a more nuanced perspective on the role of RDI, highlighting its capacity to trigger star formation by amplifying the instability of pre-existing clumpy structures in PDRs like LDN 1616.

 - **Abstract**
 Core-collapsed globular clusters are ideal targets to explore the presence of stellar collision products. Here, we have studied seventeen FUV bright white dwarf members in the globular cluster NGC 362 using data obtained from the Ultra Violet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) mounted on AstroSat and from HST. Multi-wavelength spectral energy distributions (SEDs) are analyzed using UV and optical data sets to characterize and determine the parameters of white dwarfs. Fourteen of the white dwarfs fit single-component SEDs well, while three showed a good fit with a two-component SED model,indicating a binary system comprising a white dwarf and a low-mass main-sequence star. The effective temperature, radius, luminosity, and mass of white dwarfs range between 22000 - 70000 K, 0.008 - 0.028 Rsun, 0.09 - 3.0 Lsun, and 0.30 - 1.13 Msun, respectively. The effective temperature, radius, luminosity, and mass of the companions (low-mass main-sequence stars) are 3500 - 3750 K, 0.150 - 0.234 Rsun,0.003 - 0.01 Lsun, and 0.14 - 0.24 Msun, respectively. The three binary systems (WD-MS), along with the massive WDs may have formed through dynamical processes that occurred during the core collapse of the cluster. This is the first evidence of a massive WD formation in a core-collapsed cluster, which is the missing link in the formation of a fast radio burst (FRB) progenitor in a globular cluster. This study provides evidence that NGC 362 hosts stellar systems that may evolve into exotic stars such as Type Ia supernovae, and/or FRBs in the future. *This is paper VI of the Globular Cluster UVIT Legacy Survey.

 - **Abstract**
 We re-investigate the HD208487 system to test the reality of the proposed HD208487c world. We also search for additional companions using applied Bayesian statistics and 15+ years of new RV data from the HARPS and the PFS instruments that were taken post-discovery of HD208487b. The RV data was analyzed with GLS Periodograms, followed by Bayesian analysis using the EMPEROR code. We scrutinised various stellar activity indices to search for any corresponding peaks in the power spectra, correlations with the RV measurements, or significant signals from a Bayesian analysis methodology. Finally, photometric data was checked to test for any transits or possible activity manifestations that could lead to possible false RV signals or excess noise. Our analysis points towards a candidate second planet in the system, positioned near the period of a previously proposed and subsequently challenged signal. This signal, HD208487c, would relate to a cool Saturn with an orbital period of 923.06 +2.02 -2.76 d and a minimum mass of Mj sini = 0.32 +/- 0.01Mj. Our analysis also gives rise to a newly discovered candidate planet, HD208487d, which would be the result of a cool super-Neptune/sub-Saturn with a period of 1380.13 +19.20 -8.25 d and a minimum mass of Mj sini = 0.15 +/- 0.01Mj. Neither stellar activity indices nor photometric data show signals statistically matching these periods. We have uncovered a candidate three planet system that would consist of an inner gas giant, a central Saturn and an outer super-Neptune/sub-Saturn. A dynamical analysis suggests that gravitational scattering of an initially ordered, equally-spaced system in a long resonant chain of six Neptunes can explain the current proposed architecture of HD208487. More RVs may also shed light on the reality of a fourth Doppler signal uncovered in the data that sits close to the 2:1 period-ratio with signal of HD208487c.

 - **Abstract**
 We report first results from the JWST Rocky Worlds Director's Discretionary Time program. Two secondary eclipses of the terrestrial exoplanet GJ 3929b were recently observed using MIRI photometric imaging at 15 um. We present a reduction of these data using the updated SPARTA pipeline. We also refine the planet mass, radius, and predicted time of secondary eclipse using a new sector of TESS data and new, high-precision radial velocities from the MAROON-X spectrograph. For the two JWST observations, we recover secondary eclipse depths of 177+47-45ppm and 143+34-35ppm at times consistent with a nearly circular orbit, as expected from the radial velocity data. A joint fit of the two visits yields a dayside brightness temperature Tp,dayside = 782+/-79K for GJ 3929b, which is consistent with the maximum brightness temperature Tmax = 737+/-14K for a bare, black rock (i.e., assuming zero Bond albedo and no heat redistribution). These results rule out CO2-rich atmospheres thicker than 100mbar at >3sigma, suggesting that GJ 3929b has lost any significant secondary atmosphere. The radial velocity data also indicate two additional non-transiting planets in the system: a previously-identified planet in a 15.0d orbit, and a newly-identified planet candidate in a 6.1d orbit.

 - **Abstract**
 Following a type Ia supernova (SN Ia) in a double white dwarf (WD) binary, a surviving WD companion leaves at its orbital velocity $\approx 1$,000 - 3,000 km/s. The Gaia mission has discovered seven such hypervelocity WDs with inflated radii indicative of shock heating by SN ejecta. We study the interaction between SN ejecta and Roche lobe-filling 0.08 - 0.45 $M_{\odot}$ helium WD companions using three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations with Athena++. Given the importance of the later thermal evolution, we include an accurate equation-of-state for the degenerate helium WD donor. We show that a lower-mass, larger-radius WD companion is more strongly impacted by SN ejecta and undergoes substantial mass loss. We find a tight relation between the fractional mass loss and the ratio between the ejecta ram pressure and donor volume-averaged pressure, which can be used for predicting mass loss in other systems. In the most extreme case, the companion becomes a very inflated $\approx0.02\,M_{\odot}$ object. We find helium mass loss $\approx 0.005 - 0.06\,M_{\odot}$ with velocities $\approx $ 1,000$-$4,000 km/s, which may lead to emission lines in the nebular phase. The surviving helium WD receives a kick velocity, but its final velocity is essentially determined by its orbital velocity $\lesssim$ 1,600 km/s. We model the post-explosion evolution of the shock-heated companions using MESA, and find reasonable agreement with the hypervelocity stars D6-2, J0546+0836, J1332-3541 & SDSS J1637+3631. A surviving $\gtrsim 0.3\,M_{\odot}$ helium WD can be ruled out in SN1972E & SN2011fe, and any surviving helium WD is likely ruled out in SN remnants 0509-67.5 & SN1006.

 - **Abstract**
 Infrared spectra of hydrocarbon dust absorption bands toward the bright hypergiant Cygnus OB2-12 are compared to published spectra of the Quintuplet Cluster, a sightline to the Galactic center. The Cyg OB2-12 data include a new ground-based 2.86-3.70 microns spectrum and a previously published, but here further analyzed, spectrum of the 5.50-7.34 microns region. Higher spectral resolution data for the Cyg OB2-12 sightline in the 3 micron region allows a detailed comparison of the 3.4 micron aliphatic bands to those observed toward the Quintuplet. Despite differences in interstellar environments along each sightline, strong similarities are observed in the central wavelengths and relative strengths for bands at 3.3, 3.4, 5.85, 6.2, and 6.85 microns. Analysis of these bands, produced by aromatic, aliphatic, olefinic, hydrogenated, and oxygenated components, shows that carbonaceous dust is a significant component of the diffuse interstellar medium, second in abundance only to silicates, and is primarily aromatic in nature. The grains producing these bands likely consist of large aromatic carbon cores with thin aliphatic mantles composed of hydrogenated amorphous carbon (HAC). Laboratory analog spectra reproduce the observed aliphatic absorption bands well, supporting the presence of such mantles. We present evidence that the carriers of both the 3.4 micron aliphatic and the 3.3 micron aromatic bands reside exclusively in the diffuse ISM, and that the 3.3 micron bands observed in the diffuse ISM differ from those seen in dense clouds, implying chemically distinct carriers.

 - **Abstract**
 Stripped-envelope supernovae (SESNe) mark the deaths of massive stars without hydrogen-rich envelopes. Most SESNe likely originate from binary systems where a companion stripped the progenitor of its envelope. Years of HST imaging of nearby SESNe sites have produced a statistically meaningful sample of constraints on surviving binary companions. We assemble the current sample of six companion detections and six non-detections from the literature, re-analyzing whenever needed. We then conduct the first statistical comparison with binary population-synthesis predictions, primarily based on new calculations performed with the POSYDON framework. Across a metallicity range, our models predict that 80-90% of Type Ib/c and 60-85% of IIb SNe explode with a rapidly rotating, main-sequence companion. The observed luminosity distribution favors fairly inefficient mass accretion and failed explosions of the most massive stripped stars. The companion detection fraction broadly matches predictions, given the imaging depth, but appears elevated for Type IIb SNe. In all but one non-detection, a faint, undetected companion is the most likely scenario. The red, apparently evolved companions in a few Type Ib/c SNe may result from strong interaction with the ejecta, expected in $\sim$12% of them. Companion demographics offer a powerful, independent probe of SESN progenitor systems, with the current sample disfavoring efficient accretion and supporting Wolf-Rayet non-explodability. Larger companion samples and follow-up studies will further clarify binary pathways to SESNe, serving as benchmarks for transient surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 The LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA consortium has sporadically detected purely inspiral gravitational-wave events like GW170817 and GW190425. These events offer an opportunity to constrain the presence of possible initial (residual) orbital eccentricities while using purely inspiral template families. We detail the implementation of a LSC Algorithm Library Suite approximant, TaylorF2Ecck, which models analytically inspiral gravitational waves from non-spinning compact binaries in Post-Newtonian accurate eccentric orbits while restricting the initial-eccentricity contributions to its leading order. Specifically, our frequency domain approximant consistently incorporates the orbital, advance of periastron, and gravitational-wave emission effects fully up to the 3PN order. We pursue detailed parameter estimation studies of GW170817 and GW190425 using TaylorF2Ecck, after performing comprehensive sanity checks to validate the model's performance and investigate the influence of periastron advance in the relevant parameter space. The results indicate that initial-eccentricity at 20 Hz is essentially zero (less than 0.011 for GW170817 and less than 0.028 for GW190425) at a 90 percent confidence level. We compare posteriors for these two events that arise from a few purely inspiral eccentric approximants and point out certain subtle effects arising due to the inclusion of periastron advance. Additionally, these detailed studies reveal the importance of incorporating initial eccentricity contributions at least up to 3.5PN-order and discuss its implications. We substantiate this inference by employing versions of quasi-circular TaylorF2 approximant that incorporate Fourier phase contributions beyond the conventional 3.5PN order.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. A significant fraction (~30%) of massive stars in our Galaxy are moving supersonically through the interstellar medium, which strongly governs their location at the time they end their lives, e.g. die as a supernova and give birth to a supernova remnant (SNR). These dead stellar environments accelerate particles, emitting by non-thermal mechanisms up to the TeV range, and they are considered as a major contributor to the very-high-energy band of the local cosmic-ray spectrum. Aims. This study investigates the effect of the runaway motion of supernova progenitors on the spatial distribution of SNRs in the Milky Way and how this influences the deduced properties of the population. Methods. We construct Galactic populations of SNRs by Monte Carlo simulation, taking into account the bulk motion and the evolution history of their progenitor stars once ejected from their parent clusters. The gamma-ray domain emission of each population is then calculated, to be compared with the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) Galactic Plane Survey. Results. We find that including the runaway motion of supernova progenitors strongly modifies the detectability of the simulated emission of their remnants in the very-high-energy band. Particularly, our best fit model using a Reid Milky Way model for core-collapse supernova progenitors requires 33% of massive runaway stars, which is close to the known fraction of runaway high-mass stars, to be in accordance with the H.E.S.S. Galactic Plane Survey data. Conclusions. Our results show that the runaway nature of supernova progenitors must be taken into account in the study of the Galactic population of SNRs within the H.E.S.S. Galactic Plane Survey and the forthcoming Galactic Plane Survey of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory, as it is a governing factor of the detectability of non-thermal emission of their subsequent SNRs.

 Two main models coexist for the environment in which stars form. The clustered model stipulates that the bulk of star formation occurs within dense embedded clusters, but only a minority of them survive the residual gas expulsion phase caused by massive stellar feedback unbinding the clusters. On the other hand, the hierarchical model predicts that star formation happens at a range of scales and densities, where open clusters (OCs) only emerge from the densest regions. We aim to exploit a recent catalog of compact OCs, corrected for completeness, to obtain an updated estimation of the surface density star formation rate within OCs ($\sum_{\rm SFR,OC}$), which we compare with recent estimates of $\sum_{\rm SFR}$ to determine which model is more likely. We have applied two methods. The first one consisted of integrating over the power law that was fit for the mass function of the youngest OCs using a MC sampling. The second one consisted of counting the total compact mass within these youngest OCs within 1 kpc, so that the result could be directly compared with local values of $\sum_{\rm SFR}$. We estimated new $\sum_{\rm SFR,OC}$ values between $736^{+159}_{-176}$ and $875^{+34}_{-35}$ M$_{\odot}$ Myr$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-2}$, depending on the methodology. These results are significantly higher than previous $\sum_{\rm SFR,OC}$ estimates, which we attribute to the incompleteness of past catalogs, and are consistent with the majority ($\geq$ 50 \%) or even the vast majority ($\geq$ 80 \%) of the star formation occurring in initially compact clusters, through comparisons with $\sum_{\rm SFR}$ from the recent literature. Our new $\sum_{\rm SFR,OC}$ values are consistent with clustered formation being the most dominant mode of star formation.

 The transition from a once-dense Martian atmosphere to the thin one observed today implies a substantial loss of carbon, either through atmospheric escape or surface deposition. Accurately modeling this carbon escape necessitates accounting for collisions between energetic carbon atoms and the primary atmospheric constituents, including oxygen. To this end, we computed a highly accurate and comprehensive set of potential energy curves (PECs) for the C($^3$P) + O($^3$P) system. Based on these PECs, we derived statistically averaged total elastic and differential cross sections. Comparison with literature data for O($^3$P) + O($^3$P) collisions reveals that cross sections involving carbon can differ by up to a factor of two, indicating that oxygen is not a good proxy for modeling carbon escape. Furthermore, we evaluated the impact of all possible isotopic combinations in C($^3$P) + O($^3$P) collisions and found variations in cross sections of up to 8\%. Given the observed isotopic enrichment of carbon and oxygen in the Martian atmosphere, even such moderate differences can have a significant effect on escape models and the interpretation of planetary evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 The Cosmic Shoreline concept was introduced as a way to separate planets with and without atmosphere, based on the relationship between the cumulative instellation and the escape velocity observed in the Solar System. The exoplanet community has tried to refine the way we understand the cosmic shoreline in order to provide a consistent tool for establishing the hierarchy for exoplanet observations. This is particularly relevant when trying to unveil small exoplanet atmospheres with the JWST or the upcoming ELTs. Here, our goal is to use an empirical approach to refine the Cosmic Shoreline concept. In particular, we used the data provided by the ExoAtmospheres database, using the largest available sample of exoplanets with confirmed atmospheric detections. We reconcile limitations in the classical shoreline definition by anchoring our Empirical Cosmic Shoreline (ECS) to both Mars and the irradiated super-Earth 55 Cnc e. The resulting relation exhibits a significantly steeper slope than previously theorized. Applied to planets orbiting M dwarfs, prime targets for habitable-zone studies, the ECS suggests that a larger fraction retain atmospheres than predicted by classical models when using standard Ixuv estimates. However, incorporating revised XUV fluence histories for low-mass M dwarfs (M< 0.35 Ms) reveals severe atmospheric vulnerability: only seven small planets (R<1.7 Re) orbit securely within the retention zone of these stars. We finally identify high-priority targets for the JWST Rocky Worlds survey and future ELT observations based on their ECS positioning and Transmission Spectroscopy Metrics. Future efforts must focus on expanding the empirical validations of the ECS, particularly through high-precision observations of borderline candidates and systems with well-constrained XUV histories.

 - **Abstract**
 Some planetary nebulae (PNe) host X-ray-emitting hot bubbles shaped by stellar wind interactions and/or harbor X-ray-emitting central stars due to accretion, shocks within their fast stellar winds, or even chromospheric emission from binary companions. In both cases, the properties of the X-ray emission critically probe late-stages of stellar evolution for such low- and intermediate-mass stars. While extant Chandra and XMM-Newton observations have detected X-ray emission in PNe, the numbers known remain very small ($\sim40$) compared to the overall Galactic PNe population ($\sim4000$). We have initiated a project aimed at increasing the sample of known PNe with X-ray emission using both current and new space-based X-ray telescopes such as the Einstein probe. To further investigate their X-ray properties to elucidate what drives current X-ray PN detections, we have cross-searched the SRG {\it eROSITA-DE} eRASS1 source catalogue and Hong Kong (HASH) PNe Database. Five known X-ray PNe have been detected (Abell\,30, NGC\,2392, NGC\,3242, NGC\,5315, and LoTr\,5), two new X-ray PNe are revealed (IC\,1297 and NGC\,2867), one (K\,1-27) is removed from previous X-ray compilations, and another 11 previously detected X-ray emitting PNe are not recovered. A comparison of the X-ray flux of detected and undetected X-ray PNe reveals that eROSITA eRASS1 is sensitive to PNe with X-ray fluxes larger than $\approx2\times10^{-14}$ erg~cm$^{-2}$~s$^{-1}$. The frequency of occurrence is $\simeq$0.5\% among the 1430 HASH True PNe in the eRASS1 footprint.

 - **Abstract**
 Doppler Imaging (DI) is a well-established technique to map a physical field at a stellar surface from a time series of high-resolution spectra. In this proof-of-concept study, we aim to show that traditional DI algorithms, originally designed for rapidly-rotating stars, have also the ability to model the activity of Sun-like stars, when observed with new-generation highly-stable spectrographs, and search for low-mass planets around them. We used DI to retrieve the relative brightness distribution at the surface of the Sun from radial velocity (RV) observations collected by HARPS-N between 2022 and 2024. The brightness maps obtained with DI have a typical angular resolution of about 36 degrees and are a good match to low-resolution disc-resolved Dopplergrams of the Sun at epochs when the absolute, disc-integrated RV exceeds ~2 m/s. The RV residuals after DI correction exhibit a dispersion of about 0.6 m/s, comparable with existing state-of-the-art activity correction techniques. Using planet injection-recovery tests, we also show that DI can be a powerful tool for blind planet searches, so long as the orbital period is larger than ~100days (i.e. 3 to 4 stellar rotation periods), and that it yields planetary mass estimates with an accuracy comparable to, for example, multi-dimensional Gaussian process regression. Finally, we highlight some limitations of traditional DI algorithms, which should be addressed to make DI a reliable alternative to state-of-the-art RV-based planet search techniques.

 Recent observations and simulations indicate that solar flares undergo extremely complex three-dimensional (3D) evolution, making 3D particle transport models essential for understanding electron acceleration and interpreting flare emissions. In this study, we investigate this problem by solving Parker's transport equation with 3D MHD simulations of solar flares. By examining energy conversion in the 3D system, we evaluate the roles of different acceleration mechanisms, including reconnection current sheet (CS), termination shock (TS), and supra-arcade downflows (SADs). We find that large-amplitude turbulent fluctuations are generated and sustained in the 3D system. The model results demonstrate that a significant number of electrons are accelerated to hundreds of keV and even a few MeV, forming power-law energy spectra. These energetic particles are widely distributed, with concentrations at the TS and in the flare looptop region, consistent with results derived from recent hard X-ray (HXR) and microwave (MW) observations. By selectively turning particle acceleration on or off in specific regions, we find that the CS and SADs effectively accelerate electrons to several hundred keV, while the TS enables further acceleration to MeV. However, no single mechanism can independently account for the significant number of energetic electrons observed. Instead, the mechanisms work synergistically to produce a large population of accelerated electrons. Our model provides spatially and temporally resolved electron distributions in the whole flare region and at the flare footpoints, enabling synthetic HXR and MW emission modeling for comparison with observations. These results offer important insights into electron acceleration and transport in 3D solar flare regions.

 - **Abstract**
 This study presents all available, multi-epoch 3.6 and 4.5 $\mu$m photometry from Spitzer Space Telescope observations of white dwarf debris disks, including weekly cadence observations of 16 relatively bright systems, and 5 h staring-mode observations for five of these. Significant variability is detected in 85 per cent of disks and across all timescales probed, from minutes to weeks to years, where the largest flux changes correlate with the longest time baselines, and the infrared excesses persist utterly. While each source is idiosyncratic, the overall results indicate the most variable disks correlate with those that are the brightest (dustiest), and also among those with detected gas, demonstrating both dust and gas are produced via ongoing collisions. There is a correlation between flux and colour changes, where disks tend to appear redder when dimmer and bluer when brighter, consistent with an excess of small dust grains produced in collisions, followed by a gradual return to equilibrium. The overall results are a drastic departure from the predictions of the canonical - geometrically thin, optically thick - disk in both flux and colour, but are broadly consistent with collisional evolution based on a simple model. The data presented herein constitute a legacy resource that can inform time-series studies of polluted and dusty white dwarfs, and importantly serve as a basis for future disk modelling, beyond the pioneering canonical framework.

 - **Abstract**
 Hot Jupiters (HJs) are $2-3\times$ less common around early M dwarfs than around AFGK stars, suggesting that HJs may form and/or migrate via distinct pathways around different types of stars. One source of insight into HJ formation mechanisms is to trace their dynamical histories through measurements of host stellar obliquities via the Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect. Here we present measurements of the RM effect for the HJs TOI-3714 b and TOI-5293 A b using the Gemini-North/MAROON-X spectrograph. Our measurements represent just the second and third hot Jupiters around M dwarfs (HJMD) with a detection of the RM effect. We find that both systems are well-aligned with sky-projected obliquities of $\lambda = 21^{+14}_{-11}$$\mathrm{^{\circ}}$ and $-12^{+19}_{-14}$$\mathrm{^{\circ}}$ and deprojected obliquities of $\psi = 26^{+11}_{-10}$$\mathrm{^{\circ}}$ and $24^{+11}_{-10}$$\mathrm{^{\circ}}$ for TOI-3714 and TOI-5293 A, respectively. Both stars are in wide binary systems. We refine the stellar parameters by decontaminating their unresolved $K_s$-band photometry and constrain the binary orbits using Gaia DR3 astrometry. We find that the minimum mutual inclination of the planet and binary companion in the TOI-5293 system is sufficiently large to drive Kozai-Lidov (KL) migration while the result for TOI-3714 is inconclusive. We present a population-level analysis of HJs around AFGK versus early M dwarfs and argue that KL migration is more efficient around the latter, which is expected to produce misaligned stellar obliquities in HJMD systems in the absence of efficient tidal damping. The emerging population of well-aligned HJMD hosts supports the expectation that M dwarfs, with their deep convective envelopes, do efficiently dampen misaligned obliquities.

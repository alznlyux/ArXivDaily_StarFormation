- **Abstract**
 We present the longest-term optical analysis of the AM CVn system KL Dra using $\sim11$ years of monitoring from TESS and wide-field ground-based surveys. The continuous TESS coverage allows us to characterise its frequent outbursts with unprecedented detail, providing the first comprehensive study of an AM CVn during outbursts and enabling detailed modelling of these systems. The superoutbursts in KL Dra generally include a precursor, and are followed by a series of rebrightenings after which a sequence of 3-4 large amplitude normal outbursts is observed. We fit parametric profiles to each superoutburst component (precursor, rise to plateau, plateau, decay), to rebrightenings, and to normal outbursts, which let us quantify every high state feature and investigate correlations with the system's long term supercyle evolution. Our continuous coverage reveals an average value for the supercycles, superoutbursts and normal outbursts of $60.4 \pm 0.1$ d, $5.67\pm0.03$ d and $1.17 \pm0.01$ d, respectively. The supercycle duration may be correlated with the rebrightenings duration and superoutburst amplitude, and anticorrelated with the plateau length. Within a supercycle, normal outbursts grow in amplitude and duration, and the first normal outburst is usually highly asymmetric, while subsequent normal outbursts are more symmetric. We detected superhumps in TESS superoutbursts but not in the rebrightenings or normal outbursts. We interpret the results within the disk instability model, considering additional effects, such as changes in the donor mass transfer rate.

- **Abstract**
 The field of time-domain astronomy has experienced unprecedented growth due to the increasing deployment of robotic telescopes capable of autonomous, round-the-clock sky monitoring. These instruments have revolutionized the detection and characterization of transient phenomena such as supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, variable stars, and gravitational wave counterparts. This paper explores the transformative role of robotic telescopes such as ZTF, ATLAS, and LCOGT in enabling rapid-response observations and building large time-series datasets. We review the design principles and scheduling algorithms behind robotic observatories and assess their scientific contributions across different wavelength regimes. Particular attention is given to the synergy between robotic systems and machine learning pipelines that enable real-time classification of transient events. We also discuss challenges such as data deluge, follow-up prioritization, and observational biases, as well as future directions in global telescope networks
#### Title:
          Investigating the High-energy Radiation Environment of Planets in Sun-like Binary Systems

- **Abstract**
 Far-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation is a driving source of photochemistry in planetary atmospheres. Proper interpretation of atmospheric observations requires a full understanding of the radiation environment that a planet is exposed to. Using the Suborbital Imaging Spectrograph for Transition-region Irradiance from Nearby Exoplanet host stars (SISTINE) rocket-borne spectrograph, we observed the Sun-like binary system $\alpha$ Centauri AB and captured the FUV spectrum of both stars simultaneously. Our spectra cover 980--1570 Å, providing the broadest FUV wavelength coverage taken in a single exposure and spanning several key stellar emission features which are important photochemical drivers. Combining the SISTINE spectrum with archival observations, model spectra, and a novel stellar activity model, we have created spectral energy distributions (SEDs) spanning 5 Å--1 mm for both $\alpha$ Centauri A and B. We use the SEDs to estimate the total high-energy flux (X-ray--UV) incident on a hypothetical exoplanet orbiting $\alpha$ Centauri A. Because the incident flux varies over time due to the orbit of the stellar companion and the activity level of each star, we use the VULCAN photochemical kinetics code to estimate atmospheric chemical abundances in the case of minimum and maximum flux exposure. Our results indicate that enhanced atmospheric mass loss due to stellar binarity will likely not be an issue for future exoplanet-hunting missions such as the Habitable Worlds Observatory when searching for Earth-like planets around Sun-like stars.

          Spectroscopy of a sample of RV Tauri stars without IR excess

- **Abstract**
 We observed high-resolution optical spectra of 11 RV Tauri stars without IR excess, with the primary goal of searching for chemical depletion patterns. Using equivalent widths of absorption lines, we calculated photospheric parameters and chemical element abundances for five stars in the sample: HD 172810, V399 Cyg, AA Ari, V457 Cyg, and V894 Per. Only the abundance pattern of V457 Cyg suggests depletion. In the spectrum of this star, TiO lines are also observed in emission in addition to metal emissions. V457 Cyg is likely a binary system that was once surrounded by a circumbinary disc. In the spectrum of V894 Per, we find a set of spectral lines that appear to belong to another star, corroborating that it is an eclipsing variable rather than an RV Tauri star. The high overabundance of sodium may result from mass transfer within the binary system.

- **Abstract**
 Context. Turbulent convection models in nonlinear radial stellar pulsation models rely on an extra equation for turbulent kinetic energy and fail to adequately explain mode-selection problems. Since multidimensional calculations are computationally expensive, it is reasonable to search for generalizations of physically grounded 1D models that approximate multidimensional results with sufficient accuracy, at least in a given parameter range. A natural way of progressing from one-equation models is to use additional nonlocal equations. While these types of models also exist in the literature, they have not been adopted for this type of object. Aims. We aim to adapt the three-equation turbulent convection model from Kuhfuss to radial stellar pulsation modeling. Methods. We use a Reynolds-stress one-point closure approach to derive our extensions alongside the model, while using additional models from the literature to close the anisotropy and dissipation terms. Results. We provide five extensions to the original model. These include an enhanced dissipation correction to the mixing length, a local anisotropy model replacing eddy viscosity, a second-order correction for turbulent ion transport in the atmosphere (alongside opacity effects), and turbulent damping of entropy fluctuations and convective flux.

          Mutual Orbit Alignment in Resolved Triple Systems

- **Abstract**
 A sample of 278 triple systems with outer separations under 300 au and resolved inner pairs is studied, focusing on the mutual alignment between inner and outer orbits. The degree of alignment increases with (i) decreasing outer separation, (ii) decreasing ratio of outer and inner separations, (iii) decreasing mass of the inner primary component, and (iv) increasing inner mass ratio. There is no dependence on the outer mass ratio. The average mutual inclination is ~40deg for the full sample and ~10deg for 38 triples with primary components less massive than 1 solar and outer separations below 50 au. Inner eccentricities in aligned triples are smaller compared to misaligned ones. In another sample of 371 hierarchies with known outer orbits and inner eclipsing subsystems, only 22% show mutual alignment within 20deg, while the rest are aligned randomly. These findings match qualitatively current understanding of the formation of hierarchical systems, where the N-body dynamics dominates at large scales, while the accretion and migration shape systems closer than $\sim$100 au. Fragmentation of isolated cores apparently produces approximately aligned low-mass hierarchies.

- **Abstract**
 The central molecular zone (CMZ), surrounding the Galactic centre, is the largest reservoir of dense molecular gas in the Galaxy. Despite its relative proximity, the 3D structure of the CMZ remains poorly constrained, primarily due to projection effects. We aim to constrain the line-of-sight location of two molecular clouds in the CMZ -the 50 and 20 km/s clouds- and to investigate their possible physical connection using stellar kinematics and photometry. This study serves as a pilot for future applications across the full CMZ. We estimated the line-of-sight position of the clouds by analysing stellar kinematics, stellar densities, and stellar populations towards the cloud regions and a control field. We find an absence of westward moving stars in the cloud regions, which indicates that they lie on the near side of the CMZ. This interpretation is supported by the stellar density distributions. The similar behaviour observed in the two clouds, as well as in the region between them (the ridge), suggests that they are located at comparable distances and are physically linked. We also identified an intermediate-age stellar population (2-7 Gyr) in both regions, consistent with that observed on the near side of the CMZ. We estimated the line-of-sight distances at which the clouds and the ridge become kinematically detectable (i.e. where the proper motion component parallel to the Galactic plane differs from that of the control field at the 3 sigma level) by converting their measured proper motions parallel to the Galactic plane using a theoretical model of the stellar distribution. We find that the 50 and 20 km/s clouds are located at $43\pm8$ pc and $56\pm11$ pc from Sgr A*, respectively, and that the ridge lies at $56\pm11$ pc; this supports the idea that the clouds are physically connected through the ridge.

          Testing $f(T)$ Gravity with Cosmological Observations: Confronting the Hubble Tension and Implications for the Late-Time Universe

 - **Abstract**
 In recent years, modifications to General Relativity (GR) have been explored to address cosmological observations, particularly in the context of late-time cosmic acceleration. Among these, modifications based on the Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity (TEGR), particularly $f(T)$ gravity, have gained significant attention. In this work, we investigate the scalar perturbations in $f(T)$ gravity, focusing on how these perturbations modify the Poisson and lensing equations and how they impact cosmological observables. By incorporating observational data from cosmic chromatometers, Big Bang nucleosynthesis, the DESI BAO survey, and Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia), we derive constraints on the parameters of the $f(T)$ power-law model. Our results suggest that $f(T)$ gravity can effectively alleviate some of the tensions observed in the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, including the Hubble constant ($H_0$) discrepancy. Furthermore, the evolution of the supernova luminosity and its dependence on the gravitational constant are considered to refine the measurement of cosmological parameters. The model's ability to address the $H_0$ tension is critically examined, and we find that $f(T)$ gravity offers a viable alternative to the standard model. The work concludes by comparing the fits of the $f(T)$ gravity model to the $\Lambda$CDM model using various information criteria, revealing key insights into the viability of modified gravity in contemporary cosmology.

 - **Abstract**
 Quasi-Periodic Eruptions (QPEs) are luminous, recurring X-ray outbursts from galactic nuclei, with timescales of hours to days. While their origin remains uncertain, leading models invoke accretion disk instabilities or the interaction of a massive black hole (MBH) with a lower-mass secondary in an extreme mass ratio inspiral (EMRI). EMRI scenarios offer a robust framework for interpreting QPEs by characterizing observational signatures associated with the secondary's orbital dynamics. This, in turn, enables extraction of the MBH/EMRI physical properties and provides a means to test the EMRI scenario, distinguishing models and addressing the question: what can QPE timings teach us about massive black holes and EMRIs? In this study, we employ analytic expressions for Kerr geodesics to efficiently resolve the trajectory of the secondary object and perform GPU-accelerated Bayesian inference to assess the information content of QPE timings. Using our inference framework, referred to as QPE-FIT (Fast Inference with Timing), we explore QPE timing constraints on astrophysical parameters, such as EMRI orbital parameters and MBH mass/spin. We find that mild-eccentricity EMRIs ($e\sim0.1-0.3$) can constrain MBH mass and EMRI semimajor axis/eccentricity to the 10% level within tens of orbital periods, while MBH spin is unconstrained for the explored semimajor axes $\geq 100R_g$ and monitoring baselines $\mathcal{O}(10-100\rm)$ orbits. Introducing a misaligned precessing disk generally degrades inference of EMRI orbital parameters, but can constrain disk precession properties within 10-50%. This work both highlights the prospect of QPE observations as dynamical probes of galactic nuclei and outlines the challenge of doing so in the multimodal parameter space of EMRI-disk collisions.

 - **Abstract**
 An increasing number of applications in exoplanetary science require spectrographs with high resolution and high throughput without the need for a broad spectral range. Examples include the search for biosignatures through the detection of the oxygen A-band at 760 nm, and the study of atmospheric escape through the helium 1083 nm triplet. These applications align well with the capabilities of a spectrograph based on a Virtually Imaged Phased Array (VIPA), a high-throughput dispersive element that is essentially a modified Fabry-Perot etalon. We are developing VIPER, a high-resolution, narrowband, multimode fiber-fed VIPA spectrograph specifically designed to observe the helium 1083 nm triplet absorption line in the atmospheres of gaseous exoplanets. VIPER will achieve a resolving power of 300,000 over a wavelength range of 25 nm, and will be cross-dispersed by an echelle grating. VIPER is intended for operation on the 1.5 m Tillinghast Telescope and potentially on the 6.5 m MMT, both located at the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory (FLWO) on Mount Hopkins, Arizona, USA. In this paper, we present VIPER's instrument requirements, derived from the primary science goal of detecting anisotropic atmospheric escape from exoplanets. We discuss the design methodology for VIPA-based spectrographs aimed at maximizing throughput and diffraction efficiency, and we derive a wave-optics-based end-to-end model of the spectrograph to simulate the intensity distribution at the detector. We present an optical design for VIPER and highlight the potential of VIPA-based spectrographs for advancing exoplanetary science.

          Do White Dwarfs Sample Water-Rich Planetary Material?

 - **Abstract**
 Polluted white dwarfs offer a unique way to directly probe the compositions of exoplanetary bodies. We examine the water content of accreted material using the oxygen abundances of 51 highly polluted white dwarfs. Within this sample, we present new abundances for three H-dominated atmosphere white dwarfs that showed promise for accreting water-rich material. Throughout, we explore the impact of the observed phase and lifetime of accretion disks on the inferred elemental abundances of the parent bodies that pollute each white dwarf. Our results indicate that white dwarfs sample a range of dry to water-rich material, with median uncertainties in water mass fractions of $\approx$15\%. Amongst the He-dominated white dwarfs, 35/39 water abundances are consistent with corresponding H abundances. While for any individual white dwarf it may be ambiguous as to whether or not water is present in the accreted parent body, when considered as a population the prevalence of water-rich bodies is statistically robust. The population as a whole has a median water mass fraction of $\approx$25\%, and enforcing chondritic parent body compositions, we find that 31/51 WDs are likely to have non-zero water concentrations. This conclusion is different from a similar previous analysis of white dwarf pollution and we discuss reasons why this might be the case. Pollution in H-dominated white dwarfs continues to be more water-poor than in their He-dominated cousins, although the sample size of H-dominated white dwarfs remains small and the two samples still suffer a disjunction in the range of host star temperatures being probed.

          Aerosol dynamics on hot exoplanets: the role of radiation pressure

 - **Abstract**
 Aerosols appear to be ubiquitous in exoplanetary atmospheres. However because our understanding of the physical processes that govern aerosols is incomplete, their presence makes the measurement of atmospheric properties, such as molecular abundance ratios, difficult. We show that aerosol particles in highly-irradiated exoplanets experience an additional acceleration due to stellar radiation pressure. The strength of this radiative acceleration often exceeds the planet's gravity and can approach values of ~10-20x gravity's for low-density planets (typically sub-Saturns) hosting ~0.1--1 micron aerosols. Since these highly irradiated, low-density planets are often the best targets for atmospheric characterisation with current instrumentation, radiation pressure is likely an important process when considering aerosol dynamics. We find that radiation pressure accelerates hazes produced by photochemistry at high altitudes to faster terminal velocities, causing them to grow more slowly. Hence, the particles are smaller and have lower mass concentrations in the presence of radiation pressure. By simulating haze-like aerosols in a 2D equatorial band model, we show that radiation pressure steepens optical slopes in transmission spectra, resulting in less muted molecular features in the Near-IR and gives rise to a correlation between the strength of radiation pressure and the molecular feature amplitude. Furthermore, the interaction of zonal winds and radiation pressure impacts both the optical slopes and amplitudes on the individual morning and evening terminators.

 - **Abstract**
 The Roche limit, or the threshold separation within which a celestial object (the donor) M cannot remain in a stable configuration due to a companion's tidal field, has been well established when M is in hydrostatic equilibrium and has synchronous rotation in a circular orbit. However, limited analyses exist considering corrections to the Roche limit due to hydrodynamical effects. We fill in the gap by providing a general theoretical framework involving nonlinear hydrodynamics. We consider both exact nonlinear equations derived from an affine model describing incompressible ellipsoids and series-expanded ones that can be calculated for realistic stars and planets. Our formulation addresses the Roche problem in generic orbits and synchronization levels of M, and fully accounts for the history-dependent hydrodynamical effects. We show that as the orbital eccentricity increases, fluid instability is more likely to develop at the pericenter due to the increased dynamical tide that accumulates over multiple orbits. When M moves in a highly eccentric orbit (with eccentricity around 0.9) and the damping of the fluid is small, the threshold pericenter separation at which mass loss from M can occur can be at least 30% higher than the value predicted for a circular orbit with hydrostatic equilibrium. If only a single passage is considered, however, the threshold separation is 20% smaller than the static limit. The nonlinear interaction at each pericenter passage can also trigger a chaotic fluid evolution inside M even with moderate eccentricities, complementing previous studies of chaotic tides caused by random propagation phases. Our work has broad implications for interacting binaries in eccentric orbits, including migrating gaseous exoplanets, repeated partial tidal disruption events, and more.

          Removing atmospheric turbulence from ground-based astrometry with fast correlation function measurements

 - **Abstract**
 We present a code that removes $\sim 90\%$ of the variance in astrometric measurements caused by atmospheric turbulence, by using Gaussian process regression (GPR) to interpolate the turbulence field from the positions of stars measured by Gaia to the positions of arbitrary targets. This enables robust and routine accuracy of 1-3 milliarcsec on bright sources in single exposures of the Dark Energy Survey (DES) and the upcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). For the kernel of the GPR, we use the anisotropic correlation function of the turbulent displacement field, as measured directly from the Gaia reference stars, which should yield optimal accuracy if the displacement field is Gaussian. We test the code on 26 simulated LSST exposures and 604 real DES exposures in varying conditions. The average correlation function of the astrometric errors for separations $<1^{\prime}$ is used to estimate the variance of turbulence distortions. On average, for DES, the post-GPR variance is $\sim 12 \times$ smaller than the pre-GPR variance. Application of the GPR to LSST is hence equivalent, for brighter stars and asteroids, to having 12 Rubin observatories running simultaneously. The expected improvement in the RMS of turbulence displacement errors is the square root of this value, $\sim 3.5.$ The post-GPR RMS displacement decreases with the density of reference stars as $\sim n_\star^{-0.5}$ for noiseless LSST simulations, and $\sim n_\star^{-0.3}$ for DES data.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an analysis of gamma-ray burst (GRB) progenitor classification, through their positions on a Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) plot, constructed by Negro et al. 2024, from Fermi-GBM waterfall plots. The embedding plot has a head-tail morphology, in which GRBs with confirmed progenitors (e.g. collapsars vs. binary neutron star mergers) fall in distinct regions. We investigate the positions of various proposed sub-populations of GRBs, including those with and without radio afterglow emission, those with the lowest intrinsic luminosity, and those with the longest lasting prompt gamma-ray duration. The radio-bright and radio-dark GRBs fall in the head region of the embedding plot with no distinctive clustering, although the sample size is small. Our low luminosity GRBs fall in the head/collapsar region. A continuous duration gradient reveals an interesting cluster of the longest GRBs ($T_{90} > 100s$) in a distinct region of the plot, possibly warranting further investigation.

          Low-ionization structures in planetary nebulae -- IV. The molecular hydrogen counterpart

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Low-ionization structures (LISs), found in all morphological types of planetary nebulae (PNe), are small-scale features prominent in emission from low-ionization species such as [N ii], [S ii], [O ii] and [O i]. Observational and theoretical efforts have aimed to better understand their origin and nature. Recently, the detection of molecular hydrogen (H$_2$) emission associated with LISs in a few PNe has added a new piece to the puzzle of understanding these nebular structures. Aims. Although observational studies indicate that LISs are characterized by lower electron densities than their host PNe, model predictions suggest higher total densities in these structures. The detection of H$_2$ emission from LISs in more PNe could help reconcile the observations with model predictions. Methods. Observations of five PNe with already known LISs were conducted using the Near InfraRed Imager and Spectrometer (NIRI) mounted on the 8 m Gemini North telescope. A narrow band filter, centered on H$_2$ 1-0 2.122 ${\mu}$m emission line, was used along with a continuum filter, to ensure continuum subtraction. Results. We present a deep, high-angular resolution near-IR narrowband H$_2$ 1-0 S(1) imaging survey of five Galactic PNe with LISs. We nearly double the sample of LISs detected in the H$_2$ 1-0 2.122 ${\mu}$m emission line as well as the number of host PNe. These findings allows us to prove that the systematically lower electron density in LISs --relative to the rims and shells of their host nebulae-- is linked to the presence of H2 molecular gas. Additionally, we provide the first estimation of the excited H$_2$ molecular mass in LISs, which is found between 200 and 5000 times lower than the corresponding ionized gas mass.

 - **Abstract**
 We present new high-spectral-resolution MeerKAT observations of $\mathrm{HI}$ absorption against the central region of the restarted, giant, X-shaped radio galaxy PKS2014-55, which exhibits morphological evidence of three distinct cycles of activity. We report a wide component $(\mathrm{FWHM}=38 \pm 7~\mathrm{kms^{-1}})$ redshifted to $96 \pm 50~\mathrm{kms^{-1}}$, a deep narrow detection $(\mathrm{FWHM}=19 \pm 6~\mathrm{kms^{-1}})$ redshifted to $160 \pm 40~\mathrm{kms^{-1}}$, and a shallow component $(\mathrm{FWHM}=22 \pm 6~\mathrm{kms^{-1}})$ redshifted to $240 \pm 40~\mathrm{kms^{-1}}$. One of the three components exceeds the typical rotational velocity of $100~\mathrm{kms^{-1}}$, suggesting complex kinematics of the inflowing gas. These $\mathrm{HI}$ observations support the correlation between the occurrence of $\mathrm{HI}$ absorption and the rejuvenation of radio activity via possible galaxy-galaxy interactions.

          The impact of pre-main sequence stellar luminosity on giant planet formation

 - **Abstract**
 Luminosities of pre-main sequence stars evolve during the protoplanetary disc lifetime. This has a significant impact on the heating of their surrounding protoplanetary disks, the natal environments of planets. Moreover, stars of different masses evolve differently. However, this is rarely accounted for in planet formation models. We carry out pebble-driven core accretion planet formation modelling with focus on the impact of pre-main sequence stellar luminosity evolution on giant planet formation around host stars in the range of $1{-}2.4\ \rm M_{\odot}$. We find that giant planet formation is sensitive to the evolution of stellar luminosity, specifically the locations and times at which giant planet formation can occur depend on it. High stellar luminosity causes an increase in the scale height of the gas and pebbles, which may decrease the efficiency of pebble accretion, making it more challenging to form giant planets. This has important consequences for the composition of these giant planets, stressing the need to incorporate such aspects into planet formation models.

 - **Abstract**
 We derive atmospheric parameters and chemical abundances in young G-, K-, and M-type stars (temperatures between 6500 and 3100 K) using infrared APOGEE-2 spectra. Atmospheric parameters were determined for 548 young stars in the Orion complex (Orion A, B, OB1, and $\lambda$ Ori) using the TONALLI code. For 340 slow rotators v sini $\leq$ 30 km s$^{-1}$), we derived C, Mg, Si, K, Ti, and Fe abundances using 19 atomic lines, MARCS model atmospheres, and BACCHUS. To mitigate the impact of circumstellar material, we excluded stars with infrared excess identified via 2MASS and WISE photometry. We find sub-solar [X/H] abundance ratios, consistent across elements and among all four groups, suggesting a chemically homogeneous Orion complex. We computed [$\alpha$/Fe] from [Mg/Fe], [Si/Fe], and [Ti/Fe], obtaining a median of $-0.14 \pm 0.04$, about 0.10 dex lower than the value for nearby main-sequence stars ($-0.04 \pm 0.04$) at similar [Fe/H]. This result aligns with predictions from Galactic chemical evolution models. Furthermore, the median [C/H] abundance we derived for Orion agrees with previous estimations based on the analysis of the ionized gas of the Orion nebula. This work sets the stage for extending the analysis to stars with circumstellar material and higher rotational velocities, which will not only improve our understanding of Orion, but also provide critical insight into the formation and evolution of young stars, as well as the chemical evolution of the Milky Way.

          The Close Binary Properties of Massive Stars across Different Environments within the LMC

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze 4,859 O-stars in the OGLE-III photometric survey of the LMC, including 415 eclipsing binaries (EBs). After accounting for the geometrical probability of eclipses, the period distribution of O-type binaries across $P$ = 2.5-200 days follows a power-law $f_{\rm logP}$ $\propto$ (logP)$^{\Pi}$ with $\Pi$ = $-$0.34$\pm$0.06, which is skewed toward shorter periods compared to Opik's law ($\Pi$ = 0). We divide our O-stars into seven environments based on their clustering with B-stars and other O-stars. The EB fraction of O-stars in young clusters is 10.2%$\pm$0.6%, which matches the 10.8%$\pm$2.1% for O-stars in young Milky Way clusters. O-stars in old clusters exhibit a lower EB fraction of 5.5%$\pm$0.9% due to the effects of binary evolution. O-stars in young dense clusters, young sparse associations, and even low-mass clusters that formed in situ in the field have similar EB fractions. This uniformity suggests that the formation of close massive binaries depends on small-scale gas physics, e.g., fragmentation and migration within protostellar disks, whereas N-body interactions that scale with cluster density do not affect the close binary properties of massive stars that remain in clusters. Conversely, ejected O-stars in the field exhibit a lower close binary fraction. The EB fractions of field walkaways (projected velocities $v_{\rm proj}$ $<$ 24.5 km s$^{-1}$) and field runaways ($v_{\rm proj}$ $>$ 24.5 km s$^{-1}$) are 7.3%$\pm$1.0% and 4.7%$\pm$1.0%, respectively. These values suggest that most field O-stars were dynamically ejected via N-body interactions from their birth clusters, whereas field O-stars that formed in situ or were kicked from supernova explosions in binaries contribute 17% and $<$28%, respectively, to the field population.

 - **Abstract**
 SPHEREx is a NASA infrared astronomy mission that launched on March 12th, 2025 and is operating successfully in low-Earth orbit (LEO). The mission is currently observing the entire sky in 102 spectral channels in four independent all-sky surveys and also achieves enhanced coverage in two deep fields. This data will resolve key science questions about the early universe, galaxy formation, and the origin of water and biogenic molecules. In this paper, we describe the survey planning software (SPS) that enables SPHEREx to observe efficiently while mitigating a range of operational challenges in LEO. Our optimal target selection algorithm achieves the required high coverage in both the All-Sky and Deep Surveys. The algorithm plans observations to stay within our time-varying allowable pointing zone, interleaves required data downlink passes, and mitigates outages due to the South Atlantic Anomaly and other events. As demonstrated by the sky coverage achieved in the first SPHEREx public data release, our approach is performing well in flight. The SPHEREx SPS is a key new capability that enables the mission to deliver groundbreaking science from LEO.

 - **Abstract**
 The increased sensitivity and spectral resolution of observed spectra towards the pre-stellar core L1544 are challenging the current physical and chemical models. With the aim of further constraining the structure of L1544 as well as assessing the completeness of chemical networks, we turn to radiative transfer modelling of observed molecular lines towards this source. We obtained high-sensitivity and high-spectral resolution observations of HCO+ (J = 1 - 0), CS (J = 2 - 1), C34S (J = 2 - 1), H2CO (J ,Ka,Kc = 2,1,2 - 1,1,1), c-C3H2 (J,Ka,Kc = 2,1,2 - 1,0,1), SO (N,J = 2,3 - 1,2) and 34SO (N,J = 2,3 - 1,2) with the IRAM 30m telescope towards the dust peak of L1544. A non-Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium radiative transfer code is coupled to the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to model the observations. We find that with just one transition for each isotope, the modelling cannot find a global minimum that fits the observations. The derived fractional abundance profiles are compared to those computed with chemical models. The observed transitions trace gas components with distinct dynamics at different distances along the radius of the core. Moreover, the results evidence a poor reproduction of sulphur chemistry by chemical modelling and stresses the need to include a more consistent S-depletion process to accurately reproduce the S-chemistry towards dense cores.

          Revisiting the Radial Metallicity Gradient-Age Relation in the Milky Way's Thin and Thick Disks

 - **Abstract**
 Galactic disks typically exhibit a negative radial metallicity gradient, indicating faster enrichment in the inner regions. Recent studies report that this gradient becomes flatter with increasing stellar age in the Milky Way's (MW) thin disk, while the thick disk exhibits a mildly positive gradient across all ages. In this work, we revisit the metallicity gradient-age relation (MGAR) in both the thin and thick disks of the MW. We use spectroscopic data from LAMOST DR8 and stellar ages calibrated with asteroseismology. Our results show a steadily flattening MGAR in the thin disk and confirm a positive gradient $\sim0.013\,\mathrm{dex\,kpc^{-1}}$ in the thick disk. The flattening in the thin disk may be caused by large-scale radial migration induced by transient spiral arms, or by a time-dependent steepening of the interstellar medium (ISM) metallicity gradient as suggested by recent FIRE2 simulations. The positive gradient in the thick disk may reflect early enrichment of the outer regions by strong feedback or starburst-driven outflows in a turbulent, gas-rich proto-disk. These findings suggest distinct chemodynamical evolution paths for the MW's thin and thick disks and provide valuable constraints for future models of Galactic chemical evolution.

          The frequency-independent radio luminosity -- period relation of RS CVn stars

 - **Abstract**
 Radio emissions from RS CVn objects exhibit distinct characteristics at low and high frequencies, widely attributed to differing radiation mechanisms. The disparate processes of high-frequency gyrosynchrotron and low-frequency electron cyclotron maser emissions have traditionally suggested an absence of correlation in their radio luminosities. Our study presents a frequency-independent linear correlation between radio luminosity ($L_R$) and orbital/rotational periods ($P$) in RS CVn binaries. Analyzing the Sydney Radio Star Catalogue (SRSC) data, we derived orbital periods for 42 of 60 RS CVn sources using TESS light curves, revealing a strong positive correlation (PCC = 0.698, $P$ = 3.95e-7) between $\log_{10}L_R$ and $\log_{10}P$. This correlation remains across frequencies from 144-3000 MHz, showing uniform luminosity behavior. By combining light curve analysis with stellar mass-radius-luminosity relationships, we calculated parameters like binary mass, primary/secondary mass, Rossby number, and binary separation for eight RS CVn systems. The results show a notable correlation between radio luminosity and binary mass, primary mass, and separation (PCC = 0.663, 0.663, 0.719), with separation showing the strongest correlation. This suggests the radio emission may largely originate from the binary components' interaction, challenging existing models of RS CVn radio emission mechanisms and offering insights into the individual versus collective origins of these emissions.

 - **Abstract**
 Infrared-blocking, aerogel-based scattering filters have a broad range of potential applications in astrophysics and planetary science instruments in the far-infrared, sub-millimeter, and microwave regimes. This paper demonstrates the ability of conductively-loaded, polyimide aerogel filters to meet the mechanical and science instrument requirements for several experiments, including the Cosmology Large Angular Scale Surveyor (CLASS), the Experiment for Cryogenic Large-Aperture Intensity Mapping (EXCLAIM), and the Sub-millimeter Solar Observation Lunar Volatiles Experiment (SSOLVE). Thermal multi-physics simulations of the filters predict their performance when integrated into a cryogenic receiver. Prototype filters have survived cryogenic cycling to 4\,K with no degradation in mechanical properties. Measurement of total hemispherical reflectance and transmittance, as well as cryogenic tests of the aerogel filters in a full receiver context, allow estimates of the integrated infrared emissivity of the filters. Knowledge of the emissivity will help instrument designers incorporate the filters into future experiments in planetary science, astrophysics, and cosmology.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a potassium (K) abundance analysis in extremely metal-poor (EMP) stars based on high-resolution ($R\sim 60000$) spectra obtained with the High Dispersion Spectrograph on the Subaru Telescope, covering the K I resonance lines at 766 and 769 nm. One-dimensional local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) abundances of K and other elements, including Na, Mg, Ca, Ti, Cr, and Ni, were derived using spectral synthesis. Non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) corrections were applied to the K abundances by interpolating a precomputed grid of corrections based on stellar parameters and the LTE K abundance. We detected K I lines in seven stars with [Fe/H]$< -3.0$ and derived upper limits for other stars in the same metallicity regime, making this sample well-suited for investigating the nucleosynthesis origins of K in the early universe. We found that the [K/Fe] and [K/Ca] ratios of the seven stars are enhanced relative to the solar value, with a scatter of approximately 0.1 dex, as small as the typical measurement uncertainty. Under the assumption that each star formed from gas purely enriched by a single or a few massive stars' supernovae, the small scatter in [K/Fe] and [K/Ca], contrasted with the $\sim$0.7 dex scatter in [Na/Mg] ratios (after NLTE correction), suggests that the production of K in massive stars or their supernovae is independent of the processes that drive Na/Mg variation. These findings demonstrate that K abundances in EMP stars, and their correlations with other elemental abundances, can serve as sensitive tracers of the physical mechanisms governing the final evolutionary stages of massive stars and their supernova explosions.

 - **Abstract**
 WASP-52 b is an inflated hot Jupiter with a large Roche lobe filling fraction, positioned in the hot Neptune desert. Previous in-transit observations of the helium triplet at 10833 A have reported a range of excess absorption values (1.5%-5.5%) and a lack of net blueshift relative to the planet's rest frame, distinguishing it from other escaping atmospheres. This study investigates the extent and morphology of material escaping from WASP-52 b, assessing whether its outflow resembles a stream-like structure, as suggested for HAT-P-67 b and HAT-P-32 b. We obtained high-resolution spectra with CRIRES+ and CARMENES, covering a broader orbital phase range ($\varphi \approx \pm0.1, \pm0.2, 0.5$) than previous studies. By analyzing the He I 10833 A line as a tracer of escape, we search for extended absorption beyond transit. Additionally, we explore possible outflow morphologies with three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamic simulations, coupled with an improved radiative transfer approach, assessing the He I 10833 A triplet. The helium line shows no significant evidence of planetary material at the orbital phases observed in this work, though 3D modeling suggests such a structure could exist below observational detection limits. We conclude that the atmospheric outflow of WASP-52 b can be characterized by an intermediate hydrodynamic escape parameter, placing it in a transitional regime between cold outflows forming a stream-like morphology and hot outflows forming a tail. Additionally, the absence of a detectable in-transit blueshift in the helium line rules out a strong day-to-nightside anisotropy scenario.

 - **Abstract**
 The Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) effect provides a powerful cosmological probe. We demonstrate that the corresponding relativistic SZ signal can be accurately calculated using the recently developed boost operator approach. We obtain formally exact expressions for the required differential operator that can be used to generate relativistic temperature and velocity correction functions to any order. Many of the otherwise cumbersome intermediate steps can be avoided and the required boost operator elements can be quickly generated using recurrence relations of the underlying aberration kernel. We confirm previous analytic expressions describing the relativistic SZ effect and give new expressions at third order in the cluster's peculiar velocity, demonstrating the feasibility of the boost operator method. Our derivation also highlights general properties of the boost operator and showcases its application to radiative transfer problems of broader interest.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of three stars, HD 23734, HD 68703, and HD 73345, which were previously observed as chemically peculiar candidates within the Nainital-Cape survey and reported as null results for the pulsational variability. Frequency analyses of \ktwo\ and \tess\ time-series photometric data reveal the co-existence of rotational modulation and pulsation. We use the spectrum synthesis technique to determine fundamental parameters and chemical composition, which shows that all the three stars are likely to be chemically normal. The evolutionary status of the target stars corresponds to the main-sequence phases and places them within the $\delta$ Scuti instability strip of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. The line profile variability is observed in all three stars, especially intriguing in HD\,68703 and a typical signature of the non-radial pulsation, demands further detailed examination. Using \tess\ photometry, we identified the radial modes of orders $n$=3 and 4 for HD\,23734, $n$=1, 3, and 4 for HD\,68703, and $n$=3,4 and 5 for HD\,73345. In addition to the presence of pulsation and rotation, HD\,73345 exhibits a steady increase in radial velocity that we interpret as the star being likely to be part of a long-period binary system. Finally, we propose an extended campaign aimed for the in-depth spectroscopic and spectropolarimetric study of selected pulsating stars monitored under the Nainital-Cape survey project.

 - **Abstract**
 The Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) is a next-generation gamma-ray observatory in both the Southern (Paranal, Chile) and Northern Hemisphere (La Palma, Spain) and will consist of up to 100 imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes. With sensitivity far exceeding current facilities, CTAO will provide detailed measurements of gamma rays from GeV up to a few 100s of TeV. CTAO has a nominal field of view of 10° and will rely on external alerts from observatories such as IceCube (neutrinos), Fermi-LAT (GeV gamma rays), LIGO (gravitational waves (GWs)) or the upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory (optical) to trigger observations of targets of opportunity (ToOs). The Transients Handler (TH) is a subsystem of the Array Control and Data Acquisition that will provide the means of handling alerts and schedule follow-up observations. The TH is responsible for (i) filtering of thousands of internal and external alerts per night, (ii) processing of alerts according to the corresponding observation proposal to determine the optimal observation schedule with minimum interruptions to observations and (iii) broadcasting of events detected by CTAO to external facilities. In this work, we will discuss the architecture of the Transients Handler, its latest improvements and future updates

          Solar peculiar motion inferred from dipole anisotropy in redshift distribution of quasars appears to lie along the Galactic Centre direction

 - **Abstract**
 According to the Cosmological Principle an observer stationary with respect to the comoving coordinates of the expanding universe should find the redshift distribution of distant quasars to be isotropic. However, the observed redshift distribution in a large sample of 1.3 million quasars shows a significant dipole anisotropy. A peculiar motion of the observer could introduce such a dipole anisotropy in the observed redshift distribution. However, the motion inferred therefrom turns out to be not only many times the peculiar motion estimated from the anisotropy in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), but also nearly in a direction at a right angle. The Solar peculiar motion, in fact, turns out to be, quite unexpectedly, in the direction of the Galactic Centre. Such a statistically significant discrepancy in peculiar motion, derived by different methodologies, could imply a violation of the cosmological principle, a cornerstone in the foundation of the standard model.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The outer Solar System is believed to host a vast reservoir of long-period comets (LPCs), but our understanding of their spatial distribution and dynamical history remains limited due to observational biases and uncertainties in orbital solutions for really observed comets. Aims. We aim to provide a comprehensive and dynamically homogeneous orbital database of LPCs to support the study of their origin, evolution, dynamical status, and 6D distribution of orbital elements. Methods. We updated the Catalogue of Cometary Orbits and their Dynamical Evolution (CODE catalogue) by computing original and future barycentric orbits, orbital parameters at previous and next perihelion, using full Monte Carlo swarms of real comets for the uncertainties estimation and taking into account the planetary, Galactic and passing stars perturbations according to the latest data and algorithms. Results. This update of the CODE catalogue focuses on the dynamical status of near-parabolic comets. Using current stellar data, we formulate new constraints for dynamically new comets. Now, the CODE database includes 983 orbital solutions for 369 comets with full uncertainty estimates and dynamical classifications, covering nearly all comets with original semi-major axes exceeding 10,000 au and discovered before 2022, as well as all LPCs discovered beyond 10 au from the Sun during during this period, and over 80% of the known LPCs with perihelion distances beyond 7 au.

 - **Abstract**
 Detailed stellar evolution and supernova models yield a bimodal black-hole mass distribution with a narrow peak around 10 solar masses from stars within a narrow range of progenitor properties and a second broader peak starting around 20 solar masses from very massive progenitors. This bimodal black-hole mass distribution leads to a characteristic distribution of chirp masses of merging binary black holes, with two main peaks arising from the merger of two black holes where both come either from the low- or the high-mass peak and a smaller peak in between from the mixed merger of a low-mass and a high-mass black hole. We carry out a population synthesis study of binary black hole formation and compare the results to the observed chirp masses of gravitational-wave events. We find that only the bimodal black-hole mass prescription is able to reproduce the structure of peaks and gaps in the observed chirp-mass distribution, which is not matched by predictions from other remnant mass prescriptions in the literature.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the amount, size distribution and material composition of (sub-)mic aerosol particles in the lower Venus atmosphere < 50 km. Our GGchem phase-equilibrium model predicts metal-chloride and metal-fluoride molecules to be present in the gas over the Venus surface in trace concentrations < 2.E-12, in particular FeCl2, NaCl, KCl and SiF4. Using an improved version of the DiffuDrift model developed by Woitke et al.2020, we find that these molecules deposit to form solid potassium sulphate K2SO4, sodium sulphate Na2SO4, and pyrite FeS2 above about 15.5 km, 9.5 km and 2.4 km, respectively. These heights coincide well with the three potential haze layers found in the Pioneer Venus Large Probe neutral mass spectrometer data by Mogul et al.2023. The particles with radius < 0.3 mic can be dredged up from the ground to reach the sulphuric acid cloud base from below by diffusion. The particle density decreases from ~ 5000/cm3 at ground level to ~100/cm3 at a height of 45 km. Particles larger than about 1 mic are found to stay confined to the ground < 10 km, indicating that the larger, so-called mode 3 particles, if they exist, cannot originate from the surface. All particles are expected to be coated by a thin layer of FeS2, Na2SO4 and K2SO4. We have included the repelling effect of particle charges on the coagulation, without which the model would predict much too steep gradients close to the surface, which is inconsistent with measured opacity data. Our models suggest that the particles must have at least 100 negative charges per micron of particle radius at ground level, and > 50/mic at a height of 45 km.

 - **Abstract**
 We describe an attempt to derive the binarity rate of samples of 166 A-, F-, G-, and K-type stars from LAMOST DR5 and 1000 randomly selected presumably single stars from Gaia DR3 catalogs. To this end, we compared continua of the observed spectra with the continua of synthetic spectra in the 3700 to 9097 Angstrom range. The latter spectra were reduced to the LAMOST set of wavelengths, while the former ones were smoothed. Next, we searched for every observed star the nearest synthetic spectrum using a four-parameter representation - effective temperature, gravity, [Fe/H], and a range of interstellar absorption values. However, rms deviations of observed spectra from synthetic ones appeared to be not sufficient to claim that any of the stars is a binary. We conclude that comparison of the intensity of pairs of spectral lines remains the best way to detect binarity.

          High-resolution models of the vertical shear instability

 - **Abstract**
 (abridged) Context: The vertical shear instability (VSI) is a promising mechanism to generate turbulence and transport angular momentum in protoplanetary discs. While most recent work has focused on adding more complex physics, the saturation properties of the instability in radially extended discs and its convergence as a function of resolution are still largely unknown. We tackle the question of VSI saturation and associated turbulence using radially extended fully 3D global disc models at very high resolution so as to capture both the largest VSI scales and the small-scale turbulent cascade. We use the GPU-accelerated code Idefix to achieve resolutions of up to 200 points per scale height in the 3 spatial directions, with a full 2pi azimuthal extent and disc aspect ratio H/R=0.1. Results: We demonstrate that large-scale transport properties are converged with 100 points per scale height, leading to a Shakura-Sunyaev alpha=1.3e-3. Inner boundary condition artifacts propagate deep inside the computational domain, leading to reduced alpha in these regions. The large-scale corrugation wave zones identified in 2D models survive in 3D, albeit with less coherence. Our models show no sign of long-lived zonal flows, pressure bumps or vortices, in contrast to lower-resolution simulations. Finally, we show that the turbulent cascade resulting from VSI saturation can be interpreted in the framework of critically balanced rotating turbulence. Conclusion: The VSI leads to vigorous turbulence in protoplanetary discs, associated with outward angular momentum transport but without any significant long-lived features that could enhance planet formation. The innermost regions of VSI simulations are always polluted by boundary-condition artifacts affecting the first VSI wave train, so radially extended domains should be used in a more systematic manner.

 - **Abstract**
 We study three extraordinarily bright X-ray flares originating from Cyg X-1 seen on 2023 July 10 detected with INTEGRAL. The flares had a duration on the order of only ten minutes each, and within seconds reached a 1-100 keV peak luminosity of $1.1-2.6\times10^{38}$ erg/s. The associated INTEGRAL/IBIS count rate was about ${\sim}$10x higher than usual for the hard state. To our knowledge, this is the first time that such strong flaring has been seen in Cyg X-1, despite the more than 21 years of INTEGRAL monitoring, with almost ${\sim}$20 Ms of exposure, and the similarly deep monitoring with RXTE/PCA that lasted from 1997 to 2012. The flares were seen in all three X-ray and $\gamma$-ray instruments of INTEGRAL. Radio monitoring by the AMI Large Array with observations 6 h before and 40 h after the X-ray flares did not detect a corresponding increase in radio flux. The shape of the X-ray spectrum shows only marginal change during the flares, i.e., photon index and cut-off energy are largely preserved. The overall flaring behavior points toward a sudden and brief release of energy, either due to the ejection of material in an unstable jet or due to the interaction of the jet with the ambient clumpy stellar wind.

          Unsupervised Classification of Gamma-ray Bursts from Blazars (GRBBLs) with Machine Learning

 - **Abstract**
 Blazars dominate the extragalactic $\gamma$-ray sky and show pronounced flares. Using public Fermi-LAT light curves for 732 blazars with secure redshifts, I implement an automated pipeline to identify and characterize $\gamma$-ray bursts from blazars (GRBBLs). Each event is modeled with an exponential rise/decay profile, and spectral variability is quantified via a constant fit. From 679 high-quality GRBBLs, I apply extreme deconvolution for unsupervised classification. The GRBBL population is remarkably homogeneous; the most robust split is in achromatic vs. chromatic events, with significant overlap. Removing spectral information yields a luminosity-driven classification in type-1 and type-2 GRBBLs, although this classification is not identified in all tests. This study establishes GRBBL population studies as a tool to study blazars. As a by-product of this project I identify a correlation between peak luminosity and timescales in GRBBLs.

 - **Abstract**
 We present cosmo_learn, an open-source python-based software package designed to simulate cosmological data and perform data-driven inference using a range of modern statistical and machine learning techniques. Motivated by the growing complexity of cosmological models and the emergence of observational tensions, cosmo_learn provides a standardized and flexible framework for benchmarking cosmological inference methods. The package supports realistic noise modeling for key observables in the late Universe, including cosmic chronometers, supernovae Ia, baryon acoustic oscillations, redshift space distortions, and gravitational wave bright sirens. We demonstrate the internal consistency of the simulated data with the input cosmology via residuals and parameter recovery using a fiducial $w$CDM model. Built-in learning and inference modules include traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo, as well as more recent approaches such as genetic algorithms, Gaussian processes, Bayesian ridge regression, and artificial neural networks. These methods are implemented in a modular and extensible architecture designed to facilitate comparisons across inference strategies in a common pipeline. By providing a flexible and transparent simulation and learning environment, cosmo_learn supports both educational and research efforts at the intersection of cosmology, statistics, and machine learning.

          The power of binaries on stripped-envelope supernovae across metallicity: uniform progenitor parameter space and persistently low ejecta masses, but subtype diversity

 - **Abstract**
 Stripped-envelope supernovae (SESNe) originate from massive stars that lose their envelopes through binary interactions or stellar winds. The connection between SESN subtypes and their progenitors remains poorly understood, as does the influence of initial mass, binarity, explodability, and metallicity on their evolutionary pathways, relative rates, ejecta masses, and progenitor ages. Here, we investigate these properties across a wide metallicity range (0.01-2 $Z_{\odot}$) using POSYDON, a state-of-the-art population synthesis code that incorporates detailed single- and binary-star model grids. We find that the common-envelope channel contributes less than 6% of SESNe, since unstable mass transfer is found less frequent than previously thought and rarely leads to CE survival when envelope binding energies are computed from detailed stellar models. The secondary channel accounts for less than 11%, while the vast majority of SESNe originate from primary stars in binaries undergoing stable mass-transfer episodes. These interactions maintain a largely metallicity-independent SESN parameter space, making the overall SESN rate almost insensitive to metallicity. In contrast, subtype fractions exhibit strong metallicity dependence, though their exact values remain affected by classification thresholds. The age distributions and therefore the progenitor masses of different SESN types also vary significantly with metallicity, revealing metallicity-dependent trends that can be tested observationally. Predicted SESN ejecta masses remain nearly constant across metallicity, in contrast to single-star models, and fall within observed ranges. Future transient surveys, combined with statistical environmental studies that constrain metallicity dependence, will provide decisive tests of these predictions and of the dominant role of binary interactions in shaping SESNe.

          Constraints on Logarithmic Model Extensions of Symmetric Teleparallel Gravity

 - **Abstract**
 We address various cosmological phenomenologies in the symmetric teleparallel framework both in background and perturbation such as cosmic expansion, gravitational coupling constant, gravitational waves propagation. Focusing on logarithmic extensions of $f(Q)$ models, we performed Bayesian analysis using the most-recent cosmological data, DESI DR2, Pantheon+. We also utilized a compilation of redshift space distortions ($f \sigma_8$) dataset to constrain the growth of structures in each of the models modulated by the effective gravitational coupling. We find that our extended Logarithmic $f(Q)$ models are well-constrained by the current cosmological data and are able to describe the late-time cosmic acceleration. The inverse Logarithmic model we introduce is also able to accommodate a phantom-like dark energy equation of state at late times, which is consistent with the recent DESI DR2 observations. We report explicitly predictions for the effective gravitational coupling ($\mu$), and the amplitude damping parameter of gravitational wave ($\nu$) solely based on the background data, which can be tested against future observations. While the two Log-based extensions we have introduced here perform equivalently on the background level, they provide contrasting predictions for the evolution of effective Gravitational constant and propagation of gravitational waves, which should be constrained against the future perturbation data.

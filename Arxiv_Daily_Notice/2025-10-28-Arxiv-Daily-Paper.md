- **Abstract**
 Icy interstellar dust grains are a source of complex organic molecule (COM) production, although their formation mechanisms are debated. Laboratory experiments show that atomic C deposited onto interstellar ice analogs can react with solid-phase NH3 to form a CHNH2 radical, a possible precursor to COMs, including aminoketene (NH2CHCO). We used astrochemical kinetics models to explore the role of the reaction of atomic C with NH3 and subsequent reaction with CO in the formation of NH2CHCO and other COMs. We applied the three-phase chemical model MAGICKAL to hot molecular core conditions from the cold-collapse through to the hot-core stage. The chemical network was extended to include NH2CHCO and a range of associated gas-phase, grain-surface, and bulk-ice products and reactions. We also approximated conditions in a shocked cloud, including sputtering of ice mantles. NH2CHCO is formed on grains at low temperatures (~10 K) with a peak solid-phase abundance of ~2x10^-10 nH. Its formation is driven by nondiffusive reactions, in particular the Eley-Rideal reaction of C with surface NH3, followed by immediate reaction with CO. Surface hydrogenation of NH2CHCO produces ethanolamine with a significant abundance of ~8x10^-8 nH. In the gas-phase, although ethanolamine reaches a modest abundance peak immediately following its desorption from grains under hot-core conditions, it is destroyed more rapidly due to its high proton affinity. Molecular survival is much higher in the shocked regions, where these species seem most likely to be detected. NH2CHCO is produced efficiently on simulated interstellar grain surfaces, acting subsequently as an important precursor to more complex organics, including ethanolamine and glycine. Ion-molecule gas-phase destruction of NH3-bearing COMs is less efficient in shocked lower-density regions, in contrast to hot cores, enhancing their abundances and lifetimes.

- **Abstract**
 Observations by the SpectroPhotometer for the History of the Universe, Epoch of Reionization, and Ices Explorer (SPHEREx) are combined with Spitzer spectral map data to study the aromatic, aliphatic, and PAH size evolution across the northwest photo-dissociation region (PDR) of the Iris Nebula (NGC7023). The 3.3-3.4 $\mu$m complex (I$_{3.3}$) and 11.2 $\mu$m (I$_{11.2}$) PAH band strength are determined through direct integration. In addition, the former is decomposed into a 3.3 (I'$_{3.3}$) and 3.4 $\mu$m (I'$_{3.4}$) sub-feature by fitting SPHEREx bandpass-integrated photometry using a modeled, highly sampled, multi-component spectrum. I$_{3.3}$, I$_{11.2}$, I'$_{3.3}$, and I'$_{3.4}$ all peak at the PDR. The NASA Ames PAH IR Spectroscopic Database is used to obtain the average number of carbon atoms ($\overline{\rm N_{C}}$) and small PAH fraction ($f_{\rm small}$) by fitting the isolated PAH component of the Spitzer segment; $70\lesssim\overline{N_{C}}\lesssim76$ and $0.24\lesssim\text{f}_{\rm small}\lesssim0.36$. I'$_{3.4}$/I'$_{3.4}$, I$_{11.2}$/I$_{3.3}$, $\overline{\rm N_{C}}$, and $f_{\rm small}$ all show a demarcation that matches the large-scale morphology of the region. For I'$_{3.3}$ and I'$_{3.4}$ this is reflected by two distinct trends when plotted against each other, one associated with the dense, the other with the diffuse medium; $[N_{\rm H,ali}/N_{\rm H,aro}]_{\rm dense}$ = 0.49$\pm$0.01 and $[N_{\rm H,ali}/N_{\rm H,aro}]_{\rm diffuse}$ = 0.090$\pm$0.005. $\overline{\rm N_{C}}$ and $f_{\rm small}$ are tentatively correlated with I$_{11.2}$/I$_{3.3}$ (R=0.53$\pm$0.04 and -0.45$\pm$0.04, respectively). A wider variety of large(r) extended interstellar medium objects is required to tighten the correlations, turn them into quantitative calibrators for PAH size, and pin down the discrepancy of correlations with I'$_{3.3}$ involved.

- **Abstract**
 We describe a novel scheme for analyzing particle detector measurements when a well-calibrated, similarly instrumented spacecraft is present in a similar orbit. To prepare ground truth from measurements provided by a reference spacecraft, the method uses dynamic time warping (DTW)--a technique often used for pattern-matching in time series data. An artificial neural network (ANN) is created and trained to reproduce this ground truth from measurements at the target spacecraft. Unlike previous approaches, this procedure is insensitive to calibration errors in the target data stream, as the neural network may be trained from poorly calibrated particle spectra or even directly from low-level data in engineering units. We demonstrate a proof-of-concept by training an ANN to estimate solar wind proton densities, temperatures, and speeds from the DSCOVR PlasMag Faraday Cup, using the \textit{Wind} Solar Wind Experiment as a reference. We present both deterministic and Bayesian neural network approaches. Applications for Parker Solar Probe, HelioSwarm, and other missions are discussed.
#### Title:
          Parametrisation of the wave-zonal flow interactions taking into account the full Coriolis acceleration. The necessity of going beyond the traditional approximation in the sub-inertial regime and in weakly stratified regions

- **Abstract**
 From the Earth's atmosphere and oceans to stellar radiation zones, inertia-gravity waves, which are called gravito-inertial waves (hereafter GIWs) in Astrophysics, are transporting momentum and mixing matter when they are damped through heat and viscous diffusions and when they break. Their short-time scale dynamics is governed by the buoyancy force and the Coriolis acceleration. Because of the transport they trigger, they modify the long-term evolution of the large-scale planetary atmospheric (oceanic) circulation and of the structure and rotation of stars. In many state-of-the-art models, the so-called Traditional Approximation of Rotation (hereafter denoted TAR), where the local projection of the rotation vector along the horizontal direction is neglected, is assumed. We aim to identify the applicability regime of this approximation and to propose a non-traditional parametrisation of wave - zonal flow interactions, in which the full Coriolis acceleration is taken into account. We build a prototype local non-traditional Cartesian model in which we take into account the full Coriolis acceleration, buoyancy, and heat and viscous diffusions. On the one hand, the TAR is strongly underestimating GIWs damping in the sub-inertial regime. In this regime a non-traditional modelling must be adopted to predict the correct altitude where momentum is deposited, which is closer to the excitation region of waves than the one predicted using the TAR. On the other hand, non-traditional modellings of GIWs convective and shear-induced breakings are proposed. Taking into account the full Coriolis acceleration leads to a stronger inhibition of the efficiency of the convective and shear-induced overturnings and to a weaker transport than those predicted when assuming the TAR. Finally, a fully non-traditional parametrisation of GIWs - mean zonal flows interaction is derived.

          Modelling the scattering by porous aggregate dust grains in the Far-Ultraviolet halos of Spica and Achernar

- **Abstract**
 Far-Ultraviolet (FUV) halos have been detected around six bright stars by Murthy and Henry (2011) using GALEX observations. These halos are thought to be caused by forward scattering of the starlight by dust grains present in thin foreground clouds. The optical constants of grains producing such halos have been constrained earlier by using a single scattering model, that considered the Henyey-Greenstein empirical phase function instead of theoretical phase functions for the scattering grains. In this work, we have modelled the FUV halos for two stars, Spica and Achernar, by considering the realistic porous aggregates of different sizes and compositions. As the Henyey-Greenstein phase function is known to deviate from theoretical predictions, we have utilized theoretical scattering phase functions for modelling. The dust is placed in a double-layered plane-parallel sheet with its distance and optical depth varied to get the best fit. We find that the halo intensities are dominated by scattering due to 0.05 {\mu}m sized porous dust aggregates made of amorphous silicate and carbonaceous aggregates for Spica and Achernar, respectively. We find that the medium in front of Achernar has a lower optical depth ({\tau}) of 0.032 compared to Spica which has a value of {\tau} = 0.1. This low value is close to the optical depth of the local ISM (0.01) within 40 pc of the Sun. This study demonstrates an effective method to constrain the dust grain properties in the local interstellar medium.

- **Abstract**
 Detached eclipsing binary stars (dEBs) are a key source of data on fundamental stellar parameters. Within the light curve databases of survey missions such as Kepler and TESS are a wealth of new systems awaiting characterisation. We aim to improve the scalability of efforts to process these data by developing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) machine learning model to assist in the automation of their analysis. From a phase-folded and binned dEB light curve the model predicts system parameters relating to stellar fractional radii, orbital inclination and eccentricity, and the stellar brightness ratio, for use as input values in subsequent formal analysis with the established JKTEBOP analytic code. We find the model able to predict these parameters for a previously unseen test dataset of 20000 synthetic dEB systems with a mean error of 14.1% when compared with the label values, improving to 8.6% against a subset representative of real systems. When tested with the TESS light curves of a set of real well-characterised systems, the model's predictions yield a mean error of $8.7\pm0.7\%$ when compared with label values derived from existing published analyses. Subsequent fitting of the TESS light curves with the JKTEBOP analytic code while using the model predictions as input values finds 27 of the 28 systems achieving a good fit. On the strength of these results, we plan to build a new characterisation pipeline based on the machine learning model and JKTEBOP code with the intention of producing a target catalogue of dEB systems for potential observation with the forthcoming PLATO mission.

- **Abstract**
 Gaia DR3 data have revealed new massive runaway stars, while spectroscopic surveys enable detailed characterization. The relative contributions of binary supernova (BSS) and dynamical ejection (DES) scenarios to explain their runaway origin remain poorly constrained, particularly in the Milky Way. We aim to characterize the largest sample of Galactic O-type runaway stars ever investigated through their kinematics, rotation, and binarity to shed light into their origins. We use the GOSC-Gaia DR3 catalog, and IACOB spectroscopic information to build a sample with 214 O-type stars with projected rotational velocities ($v \sin{i}$), and a subsample of 168 O-type stars with additional information about their likely single (LS) or single-lined (SB1) spectroscopic binary nature. We also consider an additional sample of 65 double-lined (SB2) spectroscopic binaries. We find that among our sample of Galactic O-type runaways, most (74%) have $v \sin{i}<200$ km/s, whereas for normal stars this fraction is slightly higher (82%). There are no fast-moving runaways being fast rotators, except for HD 124 979. Runaways show lower SB1 fractions than normal stars, with no runaway SB1 fast-rotating systems; on average, runaways rotate faster than normal stars; and their runaway fraction is higher among fast rotators (44%) vs. the slow rotators (34%). This is consistent with BSS dominance for fast rotators. We also found that SB2 systems hardly reach runaway velocities with a low runaway fraction (10%). Runaways with 2D velocities > 60 km/s are mostly single and interpreted as DES products, while runaways with 2D velocities > 85 km/s are also interpreted as two-step products. Three of 12 runaway SB1 systems are HMXBs. Our study reveals that most Galactic O-type runaways are slow rotators, suggests a dominance of BSS among fast-rotating runaways, and of DES and two-step among the high-velocity ones. (Abridged)

- **Abstract**
 Core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) are among the most energetic and complex astrophysical phenomena, requiring threedimensional (3D) simulations to capture their intricate explosion mechanisms. One of the key ingredients for such simulations is the 3D pre-collapse structure, which can impact the development and geometry of the subsequent explosion. While stellar convection simulations can provide such 3D initial conditions, these remain too expensive and demanding for widespread use. In this work, we present a method to generate synthetic 3D velocity fields for convective zones from 1D initial conditions, creating initial conditions for CCSN simulations using a vector spherical harmonics expansion without the need for expensive hydrodynamic progenitor simulations. The synthetic velocity field is designed to capture the typical scales and velocities of the convective flow as the most relevant parameters for the subsequent explosions. In addition, it respects relevant physical constraints such as the near-anelasticity of flow, vanishing radial vorticity, and zero net angular momentum in the convective zones. A Python implementation of this method is publicly available, offering the CCSN community a practical tool for generating synthetic velocity fields for multi-dimensional simulations to study the impact of 3D progenitor asymmetries on the CCSN mechanism.

- **Abstract**
 The pattern of individual mode frequencies in solar-like oscillators provides valuable insight into their properties and interior structures. The identification and characterisation of these modes requires high signal-to-noise and frequency resolution. The KEYSTONE project unlocks the asteroseismic potential of the K2 mission by providing individually reduced, high-quality time series data, global asteroseismic parameters, and spectroscopic analysis for 173 solar-like oscillators. In this work, we build on the KEYSTONE project and present the first analysis of the pattern of individual modes in the oscillation spectra for the K2 KEYSTONE stars. We perform a robust identification and characterisation of the modes through peakbagging methods in the open-source analysis tool PBjam. We present over 6000 mode frequencies, widths, and heights for 168 stars in the sample, covering the HR diagram from FGK dwarfs to sub-giants and the lower red giant branch, providing a significant increase in the number of individual mode frequency detections for main sequence and sub-giant oscillators. This study also presents sample-wide trends of oscillation patterns as a function of the fundamental stellar properties, and improves the precision of the global asteroseismic parameters. These measurements are part of the legacy of the K2 mission, and can be used to perform detailed modelling to improve the precision of fundamental properties of these stars. The results of this analysis provides evidence for the validity of using PBjam to identify and characterise the modes resulting from the observations of the future PLATO mission.

- **Abstract**
 Transmission spectroscopy allows us to detect molecules in planetary atmospheres, but is subject to contamination from inhomogeneities on the stellar surface. Quantifying the extent of this contamination is essential for accurate measurements of atmospheric composition, as stellar activity can manifest as false atmospheric signals in planetary transmission spectra. We present a study of hot Jupiter HD 189733b, which has over 50 hours of JWST observations scheduled or taken, to measure the activity level of the host star at the current epoch. We utilize high-resolution spectra of the H${\alpha}$ line from the MEGARA spectrograph on the 10-m GTC to examine the activity level of HD 189733 during a transit. We measure H${\alpha}$ becoming shallower mid-transit by an H${\alpha}$ index of ${\delta}$ = 0.00156 ${\pm}$ 0.00026, which suggests that HD 189733b crosses an active region as it transits. We posit this deviation is likely caused by a spot along the transit chord with an approximate radius of $R_{spot}$ = 3.47 ${\pm}$ 0.30R${\oplus}$ becoming occulted during transit. Including an approximation for unocculted spots, we estimate that this spot could result in transit depth variations of ${\sim}$17 ppm at the 4.3 micron CO2 feature. Since this is comparable to JWST NIRCam Grism mode's noise floor of ${\sim}$20 ppm, it could bias atmospheric studies by altering the inferred depths of the planet's features. Thus, we suggest ground-based high-resolution monitoring of activity indicator species concurrently taken with JWST data when feasible to disentangle stellar activity signals from planetary atmospheric signals during transit.

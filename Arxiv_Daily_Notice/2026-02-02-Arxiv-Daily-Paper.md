- **Abstract**
 Determinations of the Hubble constant based on the local distance ladder remain in significant tension with early-Universe inferences from the cosmic microwave background. While this tension is often discussed in terms of new physics or unmodeled systematics, the role of the assumed priors on the model parameters has received comparatively little attention. Recently, Desmond et al. (2025) pointed out that the commonly adopted flat prior on distance moduli upweights smaller distances and systematically favors high inferred values of the Hubble constant. Motivated by this observation, we perform a comprehensive Bayesian recalibration of the distance ladder, applying physically motivated priors uniformly to all distances, including the Milky Way Cepheids, which are incorporated directly into the joint fit. Together with a conservative treatment of the Gaia EDR3 residual parallax offset, the Hubble constant shifts from $H_0 = 73.0 \pm 1.0 \, \mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$ to $H_0 = 70.6 \pm 1.0 \, \mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$, reducing the Hubble tension from $5 \, \sigma$ to $2 \, \sigma$. Our results show that the assumed priors -- often treated as innocuous defaults -- may play a central role in the Hubble tension. Because all local distance ladders rely on the calibration of distances, similar prior-driven effects are expected to arise across distance-ladder methods.

          Drifters on the edge of town: $λ$ Boötis stars in clusters

- **Abstract**
 $\lambda$ Boötis stars are a subset of chemically peculiar A-stars that display Solar abundances in lighter elements (C, N, O, S, etc.) but a deficiency in Iron-peak elements. This difference has been attributed to the A-stars accreting pristine (metal deficient) gas from the Interstellar Medium. However, the recent discovery of $\lambda$ Boötis stars in clusters challenges this theory, due to the presence of ionising radiation from intermediate/massive ($>$5 M$_\odot$) stars, which could prevent accretion of pristine ISM gas. We use $N$-body simulations to track the dynamical histories of A-stars during the evolution of a star cluster. We find that some stars leave the confines of the cluster and travel beyond the tidal radius, where they may be able to accrete pristine ISM gas. These A-stars then sometimes move back into the inner regions of the cluster, but the photoionising radiation flux they receive is not high enough to prevent $\lambda$ Boötis abundances from occurring in these A-stars. We find that A-stars can develop $\lambda$ Boötis abundances and subsequently form a wide ($>100$ au) binary system, meaning that observations of binary systems that have different abundances between the component stars would not rule out the ISM accretion scenario. Whilst we have shown that $\lambda$ Boötis stars can reside in and around star clusters, further research is required to assess the validity of the accretion rates required to explain their abundance patterns.

          Warps survive beyond fly-by encounters in protoplanetary disks. RW Aur A as a case study

- **Abstract**
 Stellar fly-bys can have multiple dynamical effects on protoplanetary disks, including warping and the excitation of spiral arms. Since observations indicate that warps are common, we aim to investigate these effects for different fly-by trajectories. We further link our models to observations by applying them to the RW Aur system, which is a fly-by candidate with a relatively well constrained trajectory. We investigate the disk dynamics in grid-based hydrodynamical simulations, which allow for a lower disk viscosity than commonly used SPH models. We post-process our simulations of the RW Aur system with radiative transfer models to create synthetic images of the dust continuum and gas kinematics. Fly-bys inclined with respect to the original disk plane can excite warps of a few degrees: the exact outcome depends on the specific geometry of the encounter. Specifically, we find that the position of the periastron with respect to the initial disk plane plays a role for the resulting warp strength. Within our parameter set, the strongest warp is excited for a retrograde fly-by with a periastron that is not in the same plane as the disk. Our models show that the warp can persist even after the perturber can no longer be clearly linked to the system, implying that past fly-bys are a possible origin of observed warps. Excited spirals arms, on the other hand, are much more short-lived than the warp. The RW Aur system presents a perfect opportunity to apply these results: we find that a warp of about 5° can be excited, and that the strong spiral arms have already disappeared at the current time of observation 300 years after periastron). This compares well with existing continuum observations, and our synthetic kinematic evaluations hint at remnant structures in the gas density that may be detectable.

- **Abstract**
 This dedicated journal collection will present and discuss a variety of science cases that can be used to extend our knowledge of massive stars and the influence of their rapid rotation on their subsequent evolution. The aim is to build understanding of this pivotal class of stellar objects that provides the energy and processed material driving galactic evolution and setting the stage for subsequent star and planet formation. This collection of papers offers a unique discussion of physical factors that are driven by rapid rotation and whose influence directly impact the evolution and end-of-life state of massive stars. They are presented together to give the reader a perspective that only the ensemble can provide instead of a single paper. We hope that we are successful in our goal of shedding light on the scope and outcome of this important facet of massive star physics.

          Probing Star-Forming Properties via ALMA Observations of Massive Protocluster IRAS 15596-5301

- **Abstract**
 To deepen our understanding of star-forming properties, we studied a massive protocluster IRAS 15596-5301 using ALMA 870 um and 3 mm data. High-resolution 870 um data reveal 34 dense cores, including 3 hot molecular cores, with subsequent line surveys detecting 22 molecular species toward them. Two velocity components (I15596-red/I15596-blue) were found in the averaged H13CO+(1-0) spectrum, and two filaments were identified from velocity-resolved integrated intensity maps. A spatial overlap between the two filaments was observed, and this overlapping region exhibits a distinct bridge-shaped feature in the position-velocity diagram constructed along the entire filamentary structures. Combined with the reduced H13CO+/HCO+ ratio in the overlapping region and the three-dimensional position-position-velocity cube data, we conclude that a non-head-on collision occurs between the edges of the two filamentary structures in IRAS 15596-5301. Cluster analysis demonstrates that clusters located in the collision region host more evolved chemical rich dense cores than their counterparts in other regions. Our results thus indicate that star formation in I15596 is triggered or accelerated by a mild non-head-on collision between two filaments.

- **Abstract**
 The size-velocity dispersion ($\sigma$) relation, while well established for giant HII regions, remains uncertain for their smaller counterparts (physical radii R < 20 pc). Thanks to the LAMOST MRS-N dataset's large sky coverage and high spatial/spectral resolution, we examined this relationship using 10 isolated Galactic HII regions with R < 20 pc. Our results reveal two key findings: (1) these small-size HII regions remarkably follow the same size-$\sigma$ relation as giant HII regions, suggesting this correlation could serve as a novel distance indicator for Galactic HII regions; and (2) we find distinct dynamical behaviors between younger and older HII regions. Specifically, in younger (< 0.5 Myr), ionization-bounded HII regions, the velocity dispersion shows no correlation with expansion velocity, indicating that turbulence is driven primarily by stellar winds and ionization processes. In contrast, in older (> 0.5 Myr), matter-bounded HII regions, a clear correlation emerges, implying that expansion-driven processes begin to play a significant role in generating turbulence. We therefore propose an evolutionary transition in the primary turbulence mechanisms, from being dominated by stellar winds and radiation to being increasingly influenced by expansion-driven dynamics, during the evolution of HII regions. Considering the small sample size used in this work, particularly the inclusion of only two young HII regions, which also have large uncertainties in their expansion velocities, further confirmation of this interpretation will require higher-resolution 2D spectroscopy to resolve blended kinematic components along the line of sight for more accurate estimation of expansion velocities, along with an expanded sample that specifically includes more young HII regions.

- **Abstract**
 The study of apsidal motion rates in eccentric eclipsing binaries provides an important observational test of theoretical models of stellar structure and evolution. Precise physical parameters of the stellar components together with systematic measurements of the periastron advance are needed. We present new results of our long-term observational project to analyze the apsidal motion in early-type eccentric eclipsing binaries. New ground and space-based photometric data were obtained, and archival spectroscopic measurements were used in this study of two detached southern-hemisphere eclipsing binaries: V1647 Sgr (P=3.28 d, e=0.41), and V2283 Sgr (3.47, 0.49). Their TESS observations in four sectors have also been included and the corresponding light curves were solved using the Phoebe code. The newly completed O-C diagrams were analyzed using all reliable timings found in the literature and calculated using the TESS light curves. New or improved values were obtained for the elements of apsidal motion. Using archival spectroscopy for V1647 Sgr, the precise absolute parameters were improved: M1 = 2.184(0.035) M$_\odot$, M2 = 1.957(0.035) M$_\odot$, and R1 = 1.839(0.015) R$_\odot$, R2 = 1.716(0.015) R$_\odot$. For V2283 Sgr the absolute dimensions were newly estimated: M1 = 2.178(0.10) M$_\odot$, M2 = 1.547(0.10) M$_\odot$, and R1 = 1.796(0.01) R$_\odot$, R2 = 1.544(0.01) R$_\odot$. We improved relatively long periods of apsidal motion of about 580 and 530 years, together with the corresponding internal structure constants, log k2, -2.394, and -2.418, for V1647 Sgr and V2283 Sgr, respectively. The relativistic contribution to apsidal motion is not negligible, making about 12 resp. 14% of the total rate of apsidal motion. No signs of the presence of an additional body were revealed in the light curves or in the O-C diagrams of both eccentric systems.

- **Abstract**
 Context: The dynamical evolution of binary populations in embedded star clusters shapes the statistical properties of binaries observed in the Galactic field. Accurately modelling this process requires resolving both early cluster dynamics and binary interactions. Aims: We aim to characterize the early dynamical evolution of primordial binaries in embedded clusters and identify the key parameters that govern binary survival and disruption. Methods: We perform a set of direct $N$-body simulations starting from 100\% primordial binaries in a time-varying gas potential of a gas-embedded cluster. To describe the evolution of binary orbital properties, we define empirical dynamical operators for period, binding energy, and mass ratio, and calibrate them across the simulated ensemble. Results:The binding energy and orbital period evolve in a consistent, sigmoidal fashion. Their dynamical operators reveal that hard binaries heat the cluster and suppress wide binary formation, while a small residual population of soft binaries survives. The evolution of the mass-ratio distribution is less directly linked to dynamical processing and more shaped by internal processes such as stellar physics process in the pre-main-sequence phase. High-$q$ systems tend to be enhanced, while low-$q$ systems are prone to disruption. Conclusions: The binary evolution in clusters is primarily governed by binding energy and orbital period. Our model improves over previous parameterizations of the dynamical operator by allowing for the existence of wide binaries and incorporating the embedded cluster phase. For individual clusters, direct $N$-body modelling remains the only reliable approach. On Galactic scales, population synthesis methods based on the stellar dynamical operator approach developed here remain essential.

          Rotational Spectroscopy as a Tool to Study Vibration-Rotation Interaction: Investigations of $^{13}$CH$_3$CN and CH$_3$$^{13}$CN up to $v_8 = 2$ and a Search for $v_8 = 2$ Transitions toward Sagittarius B2(N)

- **Abstract**
 Methyl cyanide, CH$_3$CN, is present in diverse regions in space, in particular in the warm parts of star-forming regions where it is a common molecule. Rotational transitions of $^{13}$CH$_3$CN and CH$_3$$^{13}$CN in their $v_8 = 1$ lowest excited vibrational states ($E_{\rm vib} \approx 520$ K) are quite prominent in Sagittarius B2(N). In order to be able to search for transitions of the next higher vibrational state $v_8 = 2$, we recorded spectra of samples enriched in $^{13}$CH$_3$CN and CH$_3$$^{13}$CN up to $v_8 = 2$ in the 35 to 1091~GHz region and reinvestigated existing spectra of CH$_3$CN in its natural isotopic composition between 1085 and 1200 GHz. Perturbations caused by near-degeneracies in $K = 4$ of $v_8 = 2^0$ and $K = 2$ of $v_8 = 2^{-2}$ yielded accurate information on the energy spacing of 22.93 and 21.79 cm$^{-1}$ between the $l$-components of $^{13}$CH$_3$CN and CH$_3$$^{13}$CN, respectively. Fermi-type interaction between $K = 13$ and 14 of $v_8 = 1^{-1}$ and $v_8 = 2^{+2}$ probe the energy differences between the two states of both isotopomers. In addition, a $\Delta K \pm2$, $\Delta l \mp1$ interaction between the ground vibrational state of $^{13}$CH$_3$CN and $v_8 = 1^{+1}$ provides information on their energy spacing. Furthermore, we obtained improved or extended ground state rotational transition frequencies of $^{13}$CH$_3$$^{13}$CN and extensive data for $^{13}$CH$_3$C$^{15}$N and CH$_3$$^{13}$C$^{15}$N. Finally, we report the results of our search for transitions of $^{13}$CH$_3$CN and CH$_3$$^{13}$CN in their $v_8 = 2$ states toward Sagittarius B2(N).

- **Abstract**
 Small polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and somewhat larger cyano derivatives were detected in the cold dark cloud TMC-1 recently. Their formation from smaller hydrocarbons is not well understood, in part because abundances of many species are not known. Methylallene, CH$_3$CHCCH$_2$, may be one of the building blocks, but its rotational spectrum was characterized only to a very limited extent. We recorded rotational transitions in the 36$-$501 GHz region to extend the existing line list of methylallene and thus enable searches for the molecule in space. Quantum-chemical calculations were carried out to evaluate initial spectroscopic parameters. We obtained transition frequencies with $J \le 61$ and $K_a \le 21$ and resolved the internal rotation splitting of the CH$_3$ group at least partially. As a result, a full set of distortion parameters up to sixth order along with two octic ones were determined, as well as parameters describing the internal rotation of the methyl group. The spectroscopic parameters are accurate enough to identify methylallene up to 720 GHz, sufficient for searches even in the warm interstellar medium.

- **Abstract**
 We present long-slit near-infrared spectroscopic observations of six nearby (z$\sim$0.1) radio-quiet type-2 quasars (QSO2s) from the Quasar Feedback (QSOFEED) sample. They have bolometric luminosities of $10^{45-46}~erg~s^{-1}$ and stellar masses of $ 10^{10.6-11.3}~M_{\odot}$. The observations were obtained with the instrument Espectrógrafo Multiobjeto Infra-Rojo (EMIR) on the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias. The nuclear K-band spectra (central $\sim$1-3 kpc of the QSO2s) reveal signatures of high-velocity outflows in either the Pa$\alpha$ or Br$\gamma$ lines, depending on the redshift, and in the [Si VI] lines. The broadest kinematic components have full width at half maximum (FWHM) of $\sim$1200-2500 km $s^{-1}$. From the near-infrared hydrogen recombination lines we derived ionized outflow masses of $M_{Hion} \sim0.08-20\times 10^{6}~M_{\odot}$, mass outflow rates of $\dot{M}_{Hion}\sim0.03-6~M_{\odot}~yr^{-1}$, and kinetic powers of $\dot{E}_{Hion}\sim 10^{37.8-40.8}~erg~s^{-1}$. These ionized gas outflow masses and mass outflow rates have median values that are 5.9 and 5.8 times larger, respectively, than those derived from the [Si VI] line. Our study provides evidence, at least for these six QSO2s, that the near-infrared recombination lines and [Si VI] are tracing the same outflow (i.e., they have similar kinematics and radii), but they carry different amounts of mass. We detected warm molecular lines in the six QSO2s, from which we measured total (nuclear) gas masses from 1.1 (0.7) to 32 (13) $\times~10^3~M_{\odot}$, similar to other QSO2s with warm $H_2$ measurements reported in the literature, but we did not find any molecular outflow associated with them. Comparing with other five QSO2s with $H_2$ measurements reported in the literature, we find that the four QSO2s with detected $H_2$ outflows have total (nuclear) $H_2$ masses 2.2 (2.7) times larger, on average.

- **Abstract**
 We present the first detailed multi-tracer observation of a 5-pc long outer Galaxy filament, G183, and the massive young stellar object (YSO) IRAS 05480+2545 associated with it. Using the IRAM 30-m telescope at lambda = 1.4 and 3 mm, we probed the molecular gas distribution at angular resolutions of ~12"-28" (0.1-0.3 pc at d = 2.1 kpc). The velocity-resolved C18O(1-0) observations conclusively show a main filament with a skeleton of ridges. The main filament is a 5 pc long velocity-coherent structure with a continuous and quiescent velocity field along its length up to the star-forming hub that accretes mass from the filament. The internal gas kinematics of most of the G183 filament is dominated by thermal motions (sigma_NT/cs~1) and large-scale velocity gradients arising due to outflows and accretion of matter in the massive YSO. The dispersion-size relation almost up to 1 pc is consistent with Larson's law, suggesting that the origin of the filament is a turbulence cascade. The massive YSO, S1, with no corresponding radio continuum detection is characterized as a high-mass protostellar object with a mass of 156 Msun and an M/L ratio of 0.04. We identify a kinematic signature of the accretion of material from the filament onto the YSO, S1. The rates of molecular gas accretion and entrainment in S1 are estimated to be 8.6 and 2.6 (in units of 10^-4 Msun/yr), respectively. In comparison to the inner Galaxy high-mass star-forming filaments forming massive stars, G183 has a lower column density; however, the accretion and outflow rates in S1 are similar. The detection of hydrocarbons such as CH3CN and HC3N indicates the presence of hot-core chemistry in S1. These results highlight the universality of physical processes involved in massive star formation across a range of Galactic environments.

- **Abstract**
 The material in planet-forming disks determines the composition of planets; hence, it is crucial to understand the physical and chemical processes that set the abundance and distribution of key volatiles. James Webb Space Telescope observations of disks around very-low-mass ($\sim0.1~M\odot$) stars (VLMS) have revealed their hydrocarbon-rich inner regions (e.g., $\mathrm{C_2H_2}$), with column densities significantly higher than predicted. We employ chemical kinetics models using the physical structure of the inner disk around an M~Dwarf star with an X-ray luminosity of $L_X\sim10^{29}~\mathrm{erg~s^{-1}}$. We adopt initial abundances that mimic the effects of carbon enhancement and oxygen depletion (C/O from 0.44 to 87.47) and quantify how the abundances and distributions of key volatiles respond. The column density and number of molecules ($\mathcal{N}$) of hydrocarbons and oxygen-bearing species are highly sensitive to the C/O ratio, with the largest increases in hydrocarbons occurring when carbon increases by a factor of 2, and/or oxygen decreases by a factor of 10, relative to solar. In the IR-emitting region ($T_\mathrm{gas}>200$~K), a range of C/O ratios can reproduce the observed $\mathcal{N}$ and ratios relative to $\mathrm{CO_2}$. The disk-integrated molecular ratio with respect to $\mathrm{CO_2}$ is highly sensitive to the underlying C/O ratio. However, our results apply only to a source with a single X-ray luminosity value at the middle of that observed for VLMS; hence, a degeneracy between the stellar $L_X$ and the C/O ratio cannot be discarded. Nonetheless, our findings support that an enhanced C/O is required to drive the hydrocarbon-rich chemistry observed in the inner disks around VLMS.

- **Abstract**
 DV Boo is a detached eclipsing binary containing a metallic-lined A-star and a chemically normal late-F star, in an orbit with a period of 3.783 d and a possible slight eccentricity. We use a light curve from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) and published spectroscopic results to determine the physical properties of the system to high precision. We find masses of 1.617 +/- 0.003 Msun and 1.207 +/- 0.004 Msun, and radii of 1.948 +/- 0.008 Rsun and 1.195 +/- 0.022 Rsun. The precision of the radius measurements is limited by the shallow partial eclipses and the unavailability of a spectroscopic light ratio due to the chemical peculiarity of the primary star. We measure a distance to the system of 125.0 +/- 1.5 pc, in good agreement with the Gaia DR3 parallax, and an age of 1.3 Gyr. A comparison with theoretical models suggests the system has a modestly sub-solar metallicity, in conflict with the slightly super-solar photospheric abundances of the secondary star.

- **Abstract**
 We investigate the evolution of the PAH population's charge state and size across key physical zones in the Orion Bar, which include the HII region, the atomic PDR (APDR), and three HI/H2 dissociation fronts (DF1, DF2, and DF3). Utilising the NASA Ames PAH Infrared Spectroscopic Database (PAHdb) and the pyPAHdb spectral modelling tool, we analysed the MIRI-MRS observations of the Orion Bar from the "PDRs4All" ERS Program. pyPAHdb modelling reveals the fractional contribution of the different PAH charge states and sizes to the total PAH emission across the Orion Bar. Cationic PAH emission peaks in the APDR region, where neutral PAHs have minimal contribution. Emission from neutral PAHs peaks in the HII region that consists of emission from a face-on PDR associated to the background OMC-1 molecular cloud, and in the molecular cloud regions past DF2. PAH anions are observed deep within the DF2 and DF3 zones. The average PAH size ranges between ~$60-74$ Nc. The modelling reveals regions of top-down PAH formation at the ionisation front, and bottom-up PAH formation within the molecular cloud region. The PAH ionisation parameter $\gamma$ ranges between ~$2-9 x 10^4$. Intensity ratios tracing PAH ionisation scale well with $\gamma$ in regions encompassing edge-on or face-on PDR emission, but their correlation weakens within the molecular cloud zone. Modelling of the $5-15$ $\mu$m PAH spectrum with pyPAHdb achieves comprehensive characterization of the net contribution of neutral and cationic PAHs across different environments, whereas empirical PAH proxy intensity ratio tracers can be highly variable and unreliable outside regions dominated by PDR emission. The derived average PAH size in the different physical zones is consistent with a view of PAHs being more extensively subjected to ultraviolet processing closer to the ionisation front, and less affected within the molecular cloud.

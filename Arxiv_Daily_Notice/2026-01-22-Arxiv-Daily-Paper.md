#### Title:
          Most Hot Jupiters Were Cool Giant Planets for More Than 1 Gyr

- **Abstract**
 The origin of hot Jupiters is the oldest problem in exoplanet astrophysics. Hot Jupiters formed in situ or via disk migration should be in place just a few Myr after the formation of their host stars. On the other hand, hot Jupiters formed via eccentricity excitation and tidal damping as a result of planet--planet scattering or Kozai-Lidov oscillations may take 1 Gyr or more to arrive at their observed locations. We propose that the relative ages of hot Jupiters inside, near, and outside the bias-corrected peak of the observed hot Jupiter period distribution can be used to distinguish between these possibilities. Though the lack of precise and accurate age inferences for isolated hot Jupiter host stars makes this test difficult to implement, comparisons between the Galactic velocity dispersions of the hot Jupiter subpopulations enable this investigation. To transform relative age offsets into absolute age offsets, we calibrate the monotonically increasing solar neighborhood age--velocity dispersion relation using an all-sky sample of subgiants with precise ages and a metallicity distribution matched to that of hot Jupiter hosts. We find that the inside-peak and near-peak subpopulations are older than the outside-peak subpopulation, with the inside-peak subpopulation slightly older than the near-peak subpopulation. We conclude that at least 40\% but not more than 70\% of the hot Jupiter population must have formed via a late-time, peak-populating process like high-eccentricity migration that typically occurs more than 1.5 Gyr after system formation.

          The Distance to NGC 4258 from Individual Maser Component Tracking
 - **Authors:** Daniella van der Boom, Doron Kushnir
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:

- **Abstract**
 We present a reanalysis of the water maser system in NGC 4258 to reassess its geometric distance, commonly reported as approximately 7.6 Mpc with percent-level accuracy, a key anchor in extragalactic distance ladder calibrations and recent determinations of the Hubble constant. We introduce a method that relies exclusively on tracking individual maser components, rather than assuming a single averaged trajectory as in previous works, thereby avoiding arbitrary data averaging that can bias interpretations of the disk's geometry and dynamics. This approach requires spatially resolved individual maser components; consequently, the majority of observational epochs were excluded, as they lack sufficient spatial resolution to localize the maser position. We track individual maser components across multiple epochs and introduce an efficient marginalization method over nuisance parameters (angular radius and azimuth of each maser), reducing the number of free parameters from hundreds to 14. Our analysis reveals that the current observational cadence is insufficient to reliably track the individual masers, which our method relies on, given their intrinsic variability. Across a range of maser selections and model configurations, inferred distances span approximately between 6.7 to 8.1 Mpc, demonstrating significant sensitivity to how our method selects individual masers. Even visually and statistically robust fits can differ by several standard deviations, reflecting ambiguity in component identification across sparsely sampled epochs. We evaluate the impact of observational cadence on tracking fidelity and distance precision, and show that high-cadence monitoring is needed for our method to track individual masers and produce a robust anchor for cosmology.

          Erythrohenosis -- The crimson chronicles of two giants
 - **Authors:** Pau Amaro Seoane
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
- **Arxiv link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14408](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14408)
- **Pdf link:** [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.14408.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.14408.pdf)
- **Abstract**
 We investigate erythrohenosis -- the collision and merger of two red giants -- establishing an end-to-end model for this fundamental evolutionary channel in dense stellar environments. Combining three-dimensional SPH simulations of a binary with analytical modeling, we characterize the event from initial encounter to terminal explosion. We demonstrate that grazing encounters induce tidal capture and rapid orbital decay, accompanied by large-amplitude, nonlinear stellar oscillations. The subsequent inspiral spins up the common envelope into a stable, non-spherical equilibrium, powering a luminous precursor with quasi-periodic bursts. The terminal explosion, modeled with angular momentum conservation, produces an intrinsically flattened remnant that preserves a geometric memory, or morphomnesia, of its binary origin. The associated gravitational wave signal features a rapid, drag-dominated frequency evolution, identifiable by a unique time-varying apparent chirp mass. These results define a distinctive multi-stage observational fingerprint -- linking transient optical precursors, asymmetric nebulae, and anomalous gravitational wave chirps -- to guide identification in current and future multi-messenger surveys.

          Astrometric Radial Velocities from the Hipparcos-Gaia Catalog of Accelerations and Implications for Astrometric Acceleration Measurements

- **Abstract**
 Astrometry from the Gaia satellite and from the long-term combination of Hipparcos and Gaia are now sensitive to sky-plane accelerations as low as $\approx$1 m/s/yr. This paper quantifies and explores an important caveat: apparent nonlinear motion due to a star's nonzero radial velocity can be indistinguishable from real astrometric acceleration. This nonlinear motion is parallel to the proper motion, so it can be both quantified and avoided by projecting apparent astrometric accelerations into components parallel and perpendicular to the proper motion. We illustrate this distinction for a sample of very nearby, fast-moving stars from the Hipparcos-Gaia Catalog of Accelerations (HGCA). We then generalize the effect of stellar radial velocity and projections of the astrometric acceleration to binary stars in which we observe the acceleration of both components. Finally, we demonstrate that the proper motion differences in the HGCA are statistically well-behaved even for the nearest and fastest-moving stars, at least in the component perpendicular to the proper motion. This distinction -- between astrometric acceleration parallel and perpendicular to proper motion -- could have important consequences for future missions reaching extreme astrometric sensitivities around nearby stars.

          Extra modes in helium-core-burning stars probing an infra core cavity

- **Abstract**
 Dipole mixed modes observed in the oscillation pattern of red giant stars probe the radiative regions in the stellar core. Oscillation spectra of helium-core-burning stars sometimes show extra peaks that remain unexplained by the dipole mixed-mode pattern expected from the coupling of a radiative cavity in the stellar core and a pressure cavity in the stellar envelope. We use the asymptotic expansion developed for a multi-cavity star in order to characterize these extra peaks. The analytical resonance condition of the multi-cavity gravito-acoustic modes, with two inner gravity cavities and an outer pressure cavity, helps us explain that the apparent extra peaks are dipole mixed modes that follow the 3-cavity oscillation pattern. The derivation of the two asymptotic period spacings associated with the two distinct regions in the radiative core provides an estimate of the full radiative cavity. Our results provide new constraints for analysing the overshoot or mixing in the core of helium-core-burning stars. An important structure discontinuity inside the radiative core may explain the larger than expected observed period spacings.

          A New Framework for Multi-Line Analysis Combined Kernel PCA and Kernel SHAP: A Case of NGC 1068 ALMA Band 3 Data

- **Abstract**
 We present a new framework for multi-line analysis that combines kernel principal component analysis (Kernel PCA), an unsupervised machine-learning method, and Kernel SHapley Additive exPlanations (Kernel SHAP), an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) technique. To enable a comparison with PCA-based studies, which have been widely used in multi-line analyses, we apply our framework to integrated intensity maps of 13 molecular lines from Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Band 3 archival data of the nearby galaxy NGC 1068. Previous PCA-based studies of NGC 1068 reported that physically meaningful structures are mainly captured up to the second component. In contrast, our framework can interpret physically meaningful features up to the fourth component. Furthermore, by comparing the results obtained from our framework with molecular column densities derived from local thermodynamical equilibrium (LTE) analysis, we suggest that the abundance of HCO+ is relatively enhanced in the molecular outflow region extending to a radius of about 400 pc from the galactic center, likely due to the effects of ultraviolet radiation and highly dense gas. These results show that our framework can provide data-driven insights into physical and chemical features that have not been clearly identified in previous studies. It also provides an efficient tool for interpreting the rapidly increasing amount of multi-line observational data.

          Closed-Form Statistical Relations Between Projected Separation, Semimajor Axis, Companion Mass, and Host Acceleration

- **Abstract**
 I derive the statistical relationship between a radial velocity or astrometric acceleration (a trend), a companion's mass, and the projected separation of the companion. These relationships, expressed as probability density functions, are analytic and independent of all Keplerian orbital elements so long as orbits are randomly oriented in space. I also derive a closed-form expression for the probability distribution of the ratio of the projected separation to the semimajor axis at fixed eccentricity. This expression can be numerically integrated over eccentricity for an arbitrary distribution of eccentricities. I verify my results with empirical comparisons to equivalent but more complex expressions in the literature based on the equations of Keplerian orbits. The closed-formed expressions derived here would be especially useful for any calculation that requires derivatives, e.g., Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. I also provide a Jupyter notebook including all figures and calculations.

          Small scale turbulence alongside with large scale turbulence in a z~sim 2 star Forming Galaxy with outflowing wind, revealed by Multi-point structure functions

- **Abstract**
 Recently, Goldman (2024) obtained evidence for a large scale compressible, Burgers turbulence in the ism of a gravitationally lensed, star-forming galaxy at $z = 1.87$, with an outflowing wind. The turbulent timescale on the largest spatial scale has been found to be ~500 Myr . This together with the large spatial scale of~ 6.4 kpc suggest a large scale generating mechanism (such as tidal interaction or merger) that lasted for ~500 Myr. On the other hand, the outflowing wind is much younger and is probably the result of the intense star formation. Therefore, could it be that the star formation drives also turbulence on small scales? In the present work we utilize multi-point second order structure functions to find whether there exists also a small scale turbulence in this galaxy, and if so, try to identify its drivers. We obtained evidence for small scale turbulence whose largest spatial scale ~240 pc for the nebular gas velocity field and ~ 290 pc$ for the outflowing wind velocity field. These values suggest that stellar sub clumps or giant star clusters with an high concentration of young massive stars could be responsible for both the outflow and for the small scale turbulence.

- **Abstract**
 Aims. Massive stars impact their surrounding initiating star-formation along their photo-dissociation region. Once the HII region is formed it is unclear if and how the second generation of stars impacts its aspect and evolution. Methods. We performed high spectral resolution (R ~ 23400) Ha Fabry-Perot observations in five fields covering the Galactic HII region NGC 7538 and lead profiles multi-gaussian fitting to extract the parameters as peak intensity, width and velocity. We then analyse the kinematics of the ionised gas building kinematic diagrams and second order structure functions for every field. Results. The observations reveal a general blue-shifted ionised gas flow larger than 11 km s-1 in NGC 7538, consistent with previous studies. Profiles originating from features that are dark in Ha due to extinction or from outside the region show velocity dispersion larger than the one typically found for the Warm Interstellar Medium. The analysis of kinematic diagrams and second-order structure functions reveals non-thermal motions attributed to turbulence and large-scale velocity gradients. In the direction of the HII region itself the turbulence seems to be shock-dominated, with a characteristic scale length between ~ 0.72 and 1.46 pc. In this context, we propose that the kinematics of the central part of the region could be explained by the superposition of the outflow coming from IRS1 and a wind bow shock formed ahead IRS6.

          CO Diffusion on Interstellar Amorphous Solid Water: A Computational Study

- **Abstract**
 Surface chemistry on interstellar dust grains is recognized as a central component in astrochemical models, representing a plausible formation route for many of the observed complex molecular species. However, key parameters governing interstellar surface chemistry, such as diffusion energy barriers, remain poorly constrained. In particular, surface diffusion constitutes a fundamental step for the synthesis of complex organic molecules and plays a crucial role in understanding the desorption process. In this paper, the diffusion dynamics of carbon monoxide (CO) on amorphous solid water (ASW) surfaces, representative of interstellar ices, is modeled with quantum-chemical methods. Employing a representative ensemble of water clusters, each made by 22 molecules, diffusion energy barriers between the binding sites are computed using Density Functional Theory. Diffusion rate coefficients are then determined by applying the harmonic approximation of Transition State Theory. The results, in agreement with experimental studies, revealed a wide distribution of diffusion energies. This reflects the intrinsic topological heterogeneity of ASW surfaces, and highlights how surface mobility significantly influences CO's desorption dynamics and, as a consequence, surface-mediated reactivity in interstellar environments. We show that key parameters commonly employed in astrochemical models, like the ratio between binding and diffusion energy, should be carefully revised.

- **Abstract**
 We present the first high-resolution ($\sim$ 0.14") Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Band 6 dust continuum and CO molecular line emission observations of the quadruple system HD 34700. In particular, HD 34700AaAb is a spectroscopic binary ($M_{\rm{bin}}=4\,M_\odot$) surrounded by two low-mass companions at large separations. Its circumbinary disk is highly substructured, featuring numerous spiral arms and a large cavity observed in infrared (IR) scattered light. We analyzed the CO line channel and intensity moment maps. By fitting a Keplerian model to the line channel emission, we identified the residual motions and conducted a line spectra analysis. We resolved an asymmetric continuum crescent on top of a dust ring at 0.39" (138 au), colocated with the IR ring. The CO molecule line emissions trace a smaller cavity in gas, whose edge aligns with the inner rim of the ring detected in H$\alpha$ emission at 0.20" (65 au). The $^{12}$CO line emission and kinematics trace highly non-Keplerian motions ($\sim0.1\Delta\upsilon_{\rm kep}$), and these CO spiral features align well with the spiral structures in scattered light. The $^{12}$CO line spectra analysis reveals a streamer above the southeastern disk plane, likely falling onto the disk. The $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O kinematics largely follow the disk's underlying Keplerian rotation, while $^{13}$CO exhibits tentative signs of anticyclonic vortex flows at the continuum crescent location. Our multimolecular line study suggests that the circumbinary disk of HD 34700A is highly perturbed in its upper layers, possibly warped and influenced by infalling material. While late-stage infall may account for the IR spirals and the formation of the vortex through Rossby wave instability, an embedded massive companion within the cavity may also contribute to these features.

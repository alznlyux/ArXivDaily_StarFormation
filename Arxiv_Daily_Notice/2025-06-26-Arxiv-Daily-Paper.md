          A JWST study of CO$_2$ on the satellites of Saturn

 - **Abstract**
 Solid state CO$_2$ has been detected throughout the outer solar system, even at temperatures where crystalline CO$_2$ is unstable, requiring that the CO$_2$ be trapped in a separate host material. The Saturnian satellites provide an ideal laboratory for the study of this trapped CO$_2$, allowing us to examine objects with identical insolation, but with a range of environments, ice exposure, organic abundance, and formation locations. Here, we present JWST spectra of 8 mid-sized satellites of Saturn, including Mimas, Enceladus, Tethys, Dione, and Rhea interior to Titan, and Hyperion, Iapetus, and Phoebe exterior. The $\sim$4.26 $\mu$m CO$_2$ $\nu_3$ band is detected on each satellite, and the $\sim$2.7 $\mu$m $\nu_1+\nu_3$ band is detected on all but Phoebe and the leading hemisphere of Iapetus. Based on the wavelength shifts of these bands, we find four separate types of trapped CO$_2$ on the satellites. On the inner satellites, CO$_2$ appears trapped in amorphous ice sourced from Saturn's E-ring, and a second component of CO$_2$ is associated with the dark material most prominent on the trailing hemispheres of Dione and Rhea. On the outer satellites, CO$_2$ appears to be produced by irradiation of organics on Phoebe, which are then transported to the dark leading hemisphere of Iapetus and onto the dark regions of Hyperion. CO$_2$ is also trapped by water ice on the trailing hemisphere of Iapetus and on Hyperion. These observations point to the continued need for laboratory studies to better understand the sources and trapping mechanisms of CO$_2$ throughout the outer solar system.

          JWST Near Infrared Spectroscopy of High Albedo Jupiter Trojans: A New Surface Type in the Trojan Belt

 - **Abstract**
 We present 0.8 to 5 $\mu$m JWST spectra of four $\sim$20 km diameter Jupiter Trojans known to have albedos elevated above the values typical in the remaining Trojan population. The spectra of these four high albedo Jupiter Trojans are all similar, with red slopes in the optical-IR transition region, a break to lower slopes at 1.3 $\mu$m, and a broad absorptions from 2.8 to 4 $\mu$m. The 0.8 to 2.5 $\mu$m spectra of these objects match the spectra of neither the well-known "red" and "less-red" Jupiter Trojans nor of any known asteroid taxonomic class. The reflecticity of these objects does not rise redward of 4 $\mu$m, a property that is seen in the previous JWST observations of Jupiter Trojans only in Polymele. Indeed, the high albedo Jupiter Trojan spectra are a good match to that of Polymele, and Polymele is both the smallest Jupiter Trojan in the previous JWST sample and has the highest albedo of the objects in that sample. We conclude that Polymele and the other high albedo Jupiter Trojans represent a third class of Jupiter Trojans not represented in the more heavily-studied larger objects and are perhaps the products of recent disruptions. The Lucy flyby of Polymele in September 2027 will give a direct view of one of this new class of Jupiter Trojans.

          Direct reconstruction of the Reionization history from 21cm 2D Power Spectra

 - **Abstract**
 The 21cm line from the spin-flip transition of neutral hydrogen (HI) provides a unique window into the Epoch of Reionization (EoR), the final phase transition of our Universe. The Square Kilometre Array (SKA) enables precise measurements of 21cm fluctuations that trace ionization, temperature, and density fluctuations of the intergalactic medium (IGM). Nevertheless, a direct reconstruction of the timeline of the EoR in terms of the progress of ionization remains an ongoing challenge due to the highly non-Gaussian nature and thus intractable likelihood of the 21cm signal. Here, we present EoRFlow, a simulation-based inference (SBI) framework for reconstructing the global neutral hydrogen fraction $x_{\mathrm{HI}}(z)$ directly from 2D cylindrically averaged power spectra (2DPS) of the 21cm signal. We validate our method on realistic mock datasets for SKA-Low. Bypassing the need for explicit likelihood formulations, our approach enables fast, unbiased posterior estimation of the $x_{\mathrm{HI}}$ evolution in narrow redshift slices, allowing for piecewise reconstruction of the global reionization history. By directly inferring the reionization history from 21cm power spectra, our framework provides a scalable and robust path forward for 21cm cosmology in the SKA era.

 - **Abstract**
 The study of planetesimal debris accreted by white dwarfs offers unique insights into the composition of exoplanets. Using far-ultraviolet and optical spectroscopy, we have analysed the composition of planetesimals accreted by three metal enriched H-dominated white dwarfs with effective temperatures of T_eff = 20 000 K. WD 0059+257 is accreting an object composed of 71.8 +/- 7.9 per cent Fe and Ni by mass, indicating a large core mass fraction of 69 per cent, similar to that of Mercury. We model this planetesimal as having a differentiated Earth-like composition with 65 per cent of its mantle stripped, and we find this mass loss can be caused by vaporisation of the planetesimal's mantle during post-main sequence evolution. The tentative S detection in WD 0059+257 is a possible clue to the nature of the light element in planetary cores, including that of the Earth. The volatile-rich composition of WD 1943+163 is consistent with accretion of a carbonaceous chondrite-like object, but with an extreme Si depletion. WD 1953-715 accretes a planetesimal which contains 64 +/- 21 per cent of O in the form of ices, likely H2O. This body therefore requires an initial orbit at formation beyond a radial distance of > 100 au for ice survival into the white dwarf phase. These three planetary enriched white dwarfs provide evidence of differing core fractions, volatile budgets, and initial orbital separations of the accreted planetesimals, all of which help us understand their formation and evolutionary history.

 - **Abstract**
 The young M-star TWA 7 hosts a bright and near face-on debris disk, which has been imaged from the optical to the submillimeter. The disk displays multiple complex substructures such as three disk components, a large dust clump, and spiral arms, suggesting the presence of planets to actively sculpt these features. The evidence for planets in this disk was further strengthened with the recent detection of a point-source compatible with a Saturn-mass planet companion using JWST/MIRI at 11 $\mu$m, at the location a planet was predicted to reside based on the disk morphology. In this paper, we present new observations of the TWA 7 system with JWST/NIRCam in the F200W and F444W filters. The disk is detected at both wavelengths and presents many of the same substructures as previously imaged, although we do not robustly detect the southern spiral arm. Furthermore, we detect two faint potential companions in the F444W filter at the 2-3$\sigma$ level. While one of these companions needs further followup to determine its nature, the other one coincides with the location of the planet candidate imaged with MIRI, providing further evidence that this source is a sub-Jupiter mass planet companion rather than a background galaxy. Such discoveries make TWA 7 only the second system, after $\beta$ Pictoris, in which a planet predicted by the debris disk morphology has been detected.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first high-precision proper motion catalog, tied to the International Celestial Reference System (ICRS), of infrared astrometric reference stars within R $\leq$ 25" (1 pc) of the central supermassive black hole at the Galactic center (GC). This catalog contains $\sim$2,900 sources in a highly extinguished region that is inaccessible via Gaia. New astrometric measurements are extracted from HST observations (14 epochs, 2010 - 2023) and transformed into the ICRS using 40 stars in common with Gaia-DR3. We implement a new method for modeling proper motions via Gaussian Processes that accounts for systematic errors, greatly improving measurement accuracy. Proper motion and position measurements reach precisions of $\sim$0.03 mas/yr and $\sim$0.11 mas, respectively, representing a factor of $\sim$20x improvement over previous ICRS proper motion catalogs in the region. These measurements define a novel HST-Gaia reference frame that is consistent with Gaia-CRF3 to within 0.025 mas/yr in proper motion and 0.044 mas in position, making it the first ICRS-based reference frame precise enough to probe the distribution of extended mass within the orbits of stars near SgrA*. In addition, HST-Gaia provides an independent test of the radio measurements of stellar masers that form the basis of current GC reference frames. We find that the HST-Gaia and radio measurements are consistent to within 0.041 mas/yr in proper motion and 0.54 mas in position at 99.7% confidence. Gaia-DR4 is expected to reduce the HST-Gaia reference frame uncertainties by another factor of $\sim$2x, further improving the reference frame for dynamical studies.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a machine learning (ML) framework for the detection of wide binary star systems and the identification of deviations from standard gravity using Gaia DR3 data. By training supervised ML models on established wide binary catalogues, we efficiently classify wide binaries and employ clustering and nearest neighbour search to pair candidate systems. We recast the problem of identifying systematic deviations from standard gravity as a supervised anomaly detection. Our approach incorporates data preprocessing techniques such as SMOTE, correlation analysis, and PCA, and achieves high accuracy and recall in both binary classification and anomaly detection tasks. The resulting publicly available code enables rapid, scalable, and customizable analysis of wide binaries and gravitational anomalies, complementing conventional analyses and providing a valuable resource for future astrophysical studies.

 - **Abstract**
 Rotation plays an important role in stellar evolution. However, the mechanisms behind the transport of angular momentum in stars at various stages of their evolution are not well understood. To improve our understanding of these processes, it is necessary to measure and validate the internal rotation profiles of stars across different stages of evolution and mass regimes. Our aim is to constrain the internal rotation profile of the 12Msun $\beta$ Cep pulsator HD 192575 from the observed pulsational multiplets and the asymmetries of their component frequencies. We update the forward asteroseismic modelling of HD 192575 based on new TESS observations. We invert for the rotation profile from the symmetric part of the splittings, and compute the multiplet asymmetries due to the Coriolis force and stellar deformation treated perturbatively. We compare the computed asymmetries with the observed asymmetries. Our new forward asteroseismic modelling is in agreement with previous results, but with increased uncertainties, partially due to increased frequency precision, requiring us to relax certain constraints. Ambiguity in the mode identification is the main source of the uncertainty, which also affects the inferred rotation profiles. Almost all acceptable rotation profiles occur in the regime below 0.4/d and favour weak radial differential rotation, with a ratio of core and envelope rotation below two. We find that the quality of the match between the observed and theoretically predicted mode asymmetries is strongly dependent on the mode identification and the internal structure of the star. Our results offer the first detailed rotation inversion for a $\beta$ Cep pulsator. They show that the rotation profile and the mode asymmetries provide a valuable tool to further constrain the evolutionary properties of HD 192575, and in particular the details of angular momentum transport in massive stars.

          Shaping Galactic Habitability: the impact of stellar migration and gas giants

 - **Abstract**
 In exoplanet research, the focus is increasingly on identifying Earth analogs, planets similar in density and habitability potential. As the number of rocky exoplanets grows, parallel discussions have emerged on system architectures and Galactic environments that may support life, drawing comparisons to our own Earth. This has brought renewed attention to the concept of the Galactic Habitable Zone (GHZ) as a broader context for interpreting the diversity of planetary environments. This study is the first to use detailed chemical evolution models to investigate the impact of stellar migration, modeled through a parametric approach, on the GHZ. Our findings reveal that stellar migration significantly enhances the number of stars capable of hosting habitable planets in the outer Galactic regions, with an increase of up to a factor of five at 18 kpc relative to a baseline value of unity at 6 kpc. Furthermore, we explore a novel scenario where the presence of gas giant planets increases the probability for the formation of terrestrial ones. We find that this increased probability is higher in the inner Galactic disc, but is also mitigated by stellar migration. In particular, at the present time, the number of FGK stars hosting terrestrial planets with minimum habitability conditions in the ring centered at 4 kpc is approximately 1.4 times higher than in scenarios where gas giants are assumed to hinder the formation and evolution of Earth-like planets. Without stellar migration, this factor increases to 1.5. Even larger ratios are predicted for terrestrial planets orbiting retired A stars, reaching 2.8 in models with stellar migration and 3.3 in models without it.

          Hundreds of TESS exoplanets might be larger than we thought

 - **Abstract**
 The radius of a planet is a fundamental parameter that probes its composition and habitability. Precise radius measurements are typically derived from the fraction of starlight blocked when a planet transits its host star. The wide-field Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has discovered hundreds of new exoplanets, but its low angular resolution means that the light from a star hosting a transiting exoplanet can be blended with the light from background stars. If not fully corrected, this extra light can dilute the transit signal and result in a smaller measured planet radius. In a study of hundreds of TESS planet discoveries using deblended light curves from our validated methodology, we show that systematically incorrect planet radii are common in the literature: studies using various public TESS photometry pipelines have underestimated the planet radius by a weighted median of $6.1\% \pm 0.3\%$, leading to a $\sim20\%$ overestimation of planet density. The widespread presence of these biases in the literature has profoundly shaped-and potentially misrepresented-our understanding of the exoplanet population. Addressing these biases will refine the exoplanet mass-radius relation, reshape our understanding of exoplanet atmospheric and bulk composition, and potentially inform prevailing planet formation theories.

 - **Abstract**
 Aims. We investigate the gas reservoirs, star formation (SF) properties, and environment of the ultra-diffuse galaxy GAMA526784 to understand its formation history, the efficiency of molecular gas conversion into stars, and the possible role of an interacting companion in shaping its morphology. Methods. We analyse low and high-resolution CO observations to constrain the molecular gas content, compare with HI data, and examine the SF efficiency of GAMA526784. The potential influence of a newly identified nearby dwarf galaxy is assessed using photometric and spatial information. Results. GAMA526784 exhibits a regular HI reservoir (M_HI/M* = 2.88) but only upper limits on its molecular gas mass (M_H2(5sigma)/M* < 0.23). The HI reservoir and CO non-detection can be explained by several mechanisms: (1) predominance of CO-dark H2, invisible to CO observations but contributing to SF; (2) a time delay in HI-to-H2 conversion following a recent interaction; or (3) elevated turbulence inhibiting gas collapse. An identified companion, found at a projected distance of 48 kpc, shows similar colours and lies in the direction of young star clusters in GAMA526784, indicating a possible association. We hypothesise this companion may have triggered the formation of star clusters in GAMA526784 through a high-velocity encounter. Conclusions. Our findings suggest GAMA526784 may have undergone an interaction that influenced its gas reservoirs and SF activity. The presence of a nearby companion agrees with predictions of a high-speed encounter, potentially offering a rare example of such an interaction in progress. We suggest this encounter may have shaped the system's recent evolution. Future observations, particularly targeting molecular gas tracers beyond CO and resolved HI maps, will be crucial in determining the extent of GAMA526784's cold gas reservoir and the nature of its recent star formation.

 We report the discovery and confirmation of TOI-4465 b, a $1.25^{+0.08}_{-0.07}~R_{J}$, $5.89\pm0.26~M_{J}$ giant planet orbiting a G dwarf star at $d\simeq$ 122 pc. The planet was detected as a single-transit event in data from Sector 40 of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission. Radial velocity (RV) observations of TOI-4465 showed a planetary signal with an orbital period of $\sim$102 days, and an orbital eccentricity of $e=0.24\pm0.01$. TESS re-observed TOI-4465 in Sector 53 and Sector 80, but did not detect another transit of TOI-4465 b, as the planet was not expected to transit during these observations based on the RV period. A global ground-based photometry campaign was initiated to observe another transit of TOI-4465 b after the RV period determination. The $\sim$12 hour-long transit event was captured from multiple sites around the world, and included observations from 24 citizen scientists, confirming the orbital period as $\sim$102 days. TOI-4465 b is a relatively dense ($3.73\pm0.53~\rm{g/cm^3}$), temperate (375-478 K) giant planet. Based on giant planet structure models, TOI-4465 b appears to be enriched in heavy elements at a level consistent with late-stage accretion of icy planetesimals. Additionally, we explore TOI-4465 b's potential for atmospheric characterization, and obliquity measurement. Increasing the number of long-period planets by confirming single-transit events is crucial for understanding the frequency and demographics of planet populations in the outer regions of planetary systems.

 - **Abstract**
 The dusty interstellar medium (ISM) of the Milky Way is distributed in a complex, cloudy structure. It is fundamental to the radiation balance within the Milky Way, provides a reaction surface to form complex molecules, and is the feedstock for future generations of stars and planets. The life cycle of interstellar dust is not completely understood, and neither are its structure nor composition. The abundance, composition, and structure of dust in the diffuse ISM can be determined by combining infrared, optical and ultraviolet spectroscopy. JWST enables measurement of the faint absorption of ISM dust grains against bright stars at kiloparsec distances across the infrared spectrum. Here we present an overview of the project `Webb Investigation of Silicates, Carbons, and Ices' (WISCI) along with interpretation of two targets, GSC 08152-02121 and CPD-59 5831. Observations of 12 WISCI target stars were taken by JWST, the Hubble Space Telescope, Himalayan Chandra Telescope, and the Very Large Telescope. We use these to characterize the targets' spectral types and calculate their line-of-sight extinction parameters, $A_{\rm V}$ and $R_{\rm V}$. We find absorption in the JWST spectra of GSC 08152-02121, and CPD-59 5831 associated with carbonaceous dust around 3.4 and 6.2 micron and amorphous silicates at 9.7 micron. In GSC 08152-02121 we also find indications of absorption by trapped water around 3 micron. This first look from WISCI demonstrates the line-of-sight variability within the sample, and the program's potential to identify and correlate features across ultraviolet to mid-infrared wavelengths.

 - **Abstract**
 The reliable detection of the global 21-cm signal, a key tracer of Cosmic Dawn and the Epoch of Reionization, requires meticulous data modelling and robust statistical frameworks for model validation and comparison. In Paper I of this series, we presented the Beam-Factor-based Chromaticity Correction (BFCC) model for spectrometer data processed using BFCC to suppress instrumentally induced spectral structure. We demonstrated that the BFCC model, with complexity calibrated by Bayes factor-based model comparison (BFBMC), enables unbiased recovery of a 21-cm signal consistent with the one reported by EDGES from simulated data. Here, we extend the evaluation of the BFCC model to lower amplitude 21-cm signal scenarios where deriving reliable conclusions about a model's capacity to recover unbiased 21-cm signal estimates using BFBMC is more challenging. Using realistic simulations of chromaticity-corrected EDGES-low spectrometer data, we evaluate three signal amplitude regimes -- null, moderate, and high. We then conduct a Bayesian comparison between the BFCC model and three alternative models previously applied to 21-cm signal estimation from EDGES data. To mitigate biases introduced by systematics in the 21-cm signal model fit, we incorporate the Bayesian Null-Test-Evidence-Ratio (BaNTER) validation framework and implement a Bayesian inference workflow based on posterior odds of the validated models. We demonstrate that, unlike BFBMC alone, this approach consistently recovers 21-cm signal estimates that align with the true signal across all amplitude regimes, advancing robust global 21-cm signal detection methodologies.

 - **Abstract**
 The Zwicky Transient Facility Census of the Local Universe survey yielded a sample of 330 Type IIP supernovae (SNe) with well-constrained peak luminosities. In paper I (arXiv:2502.19493), we measured their luminosity function and volumetric rate. Here (paper II), we present the largest systematic study of lightcurve properties for Type IIP SNe from a volume-limited survey, analyzing a selected subset of 129 events, including 16 low-luminosity Type IIP (LLIIP) SNe with M${r,peak} \geq -16$ mag. We find that plateau slope correlates with peak brightness, with many LLIIP SNe showing positive slopes--suggesting smaller progenitor radii and distinct density profiles compared to brighter Type IIP SNe. The plateau duration shows only a weak dependence on peak brightness, likely suggesting binary interaction. One SN exhibits a plateau-to-tail drop of >3.5 mag, consistent with an electron-capture or failed SN with very low or zero nickel mass. We derive explosion and progenitor parameters of the entire Type IIP SN sample using semi-analytical and radiation-hydrodynamical models. Based on radiation-hydrodynamical model fitting, LLIIP SNe are characterized by low nickel masses (0.001-0.025 $\mathrm{M_\odot}$), low explosion energies (0.1-0.28 $\times 10^{51}$ erg), low ejecta masses ($8.1^{+0.8}_{-1.7}$ $\mathrm{M\odot}$), and ZAMS masses below 11 $\mathrm{M_\odot}$. In comparison, the full Type IIP SN sample spans a wider range with nickel masses (0.001-0.222 $\mathrm{M_\odot}$), explosion energies (0.10-4.43 $\times 10^{51}$ erg), ejecta masses (5.4-24.8 $\mathrm{M_\odot}$), and ZAMS masses (9.3-16.7 $\mathrm{M_\odot}$). We find strong correlations between peak brightness, explosion energy, and nickel mass that extend to the low-luminosity end. We conclude that LLIIP SNe represent the faint, low-energy end of the Type IIP population and originate from the lowest-mass core-collapse progenitors.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the most extensive high-time resolution multi-band campaign to date on the candidate transitional millisecond pulsar (tMSP) 3FGL J1544.6-1125 in the sub-luminous disk state, with coordinated observations from the radio to the X-ray band. While XMM-Newton and NuSTAR X-ray light curves exhibit the characteristic high- and low-mode bimodality, the source faintness prevents firm evidence for similar bimodality in the ultraviolet and near-infrared light curves, presented here for the first time. A re-analysis of archival XMM-Newton/OM data reveals an optical flare without an X-ray counterpart, likely originating from the outer accretion disk or the companion star. During our observations, no radio emission was detected, with a 3$\sigma$ flux density upper limit of 8 $\mu$Jy at 6 GHz. While past works have already reported radio variability in the source, this limit is a factor of 3.5 below the average value measured in 2019 in similar conditions, underscoring significant radio variability despite the relatively stable X-ray flux. Simultaneous optical light curves in five filters with GTC/HiPERCAM revealed flickering and dipping activities that resemble the observed X-ray variability, along with a reddening trend at lower fluxes. The latter is consistent with discrete mass ejections that disrupt the inner flow and reduce both X-ray and optical fluxes, thereby driving the high-to-low-mode switches. This suggests a common origin for most optical and X-ray emission at the boundary region between the pulsar wind and the inner disk, as also supported by our modelling of the spectral energy distribution in the high mode. Overall, our findings reinforce the mini-pulsar nebula picture for tMSPs in the sub-luminous state and demonstrate how coordinated, high-time resolution, multi-wavelength campaigns are essential to probe the processes governing rapid mode switches in these systems.

 - **Abstract**
 Using data from the MIRIS Pa{\alpha} Galactic Plane Survey (MIPAPS), we present a Pa{\alpha} 1.87 um line image of the entire Galactic plane within the latitude range of -3° < b < +3°, revealing numerous Pa{\alpha} features. Based on the MIPAPS Pa{\alpha} image and the WISE H II region catalog, we compile a catalog of 1489 Pa{\alpha} emission-line sources in the Galactic plane within 90° < l < 330°. By comparing our Pa{\alpha} images with H{\alpha} images constructed from the IPHAS and VPHAS+ survey data, we demonstrate the advantages of Pa{\alpha} line observations. We identify 902 Pa{\alpha} sources associated with H II regions, and newly confirm 619 H II region candidates as definitive H II regions through Pa{\alpha} or H{\alpha} detections. We also identify 261 extended and 326 point-like Pa{\alpha} sources not included in the WISE catalog, most of which have H{\alpha} counterparts in the IPHAS or VPHAS+ images. A search of the SIMBAD database indicates that these sources originate from diverse object types. By measuring Pa{\alpha} and H{\alpha} fluxes, we estimate the E(B-V) color excesses derived from extended emissions for 138 Pa{\alpha} sources, showing good agreement with values obtained from spectrophotometry of ionizing stars in previous studies. Futhermore, we calculate total Lyman continuum luminosities for 42 Pa{\alpha} sources, providing constraints on the distances to H II regions and the spectral types of their ionizing stars. These results highlight the scientific potential of Pa{\alpha} line observations and the benefits of combining multiple hydrogen recombination lines in exploring ionized regions.

          Can tidal evolution lead to close-in planetary bodies around white dwarfs I: Orbital period distribution

 - **Abstract**
 The evolution of planetary systems around white dwarfs is crucial to understanding the presence of planetary material in the atmospheres of white dwarfs. These systems uniquely probe exoplanetary compositions. Periodic signals in the photometry of a handful of white dwarfs suggest material blocking the star, potentially from disintegrating planetesimals. Tidal evolution followed by scattering can bring planetesimals onto close-in orbits that would have been within the envelope of the white dwarf progenitor. The orbital period distribution of planetesimals undergoing tidal evolution will peak at short-period (nearly) circularized orbits (~ 10 hour-1 day), with a rising tail towards long-period highly eccentric orbits (~ 100 day). This prediction is generally consistent with the observed white dwarf transiting systems. In order for the planetesimal on the 4.5 hour period around WD 1145+017 to be explained by the tidal evolution of a planetesimal, that planetesimal must have an ultimate tensile strength comparable to that of iron meteorites.

 - **Abstract**
 Planetary material accreted by white dwarfs provides unique insights regarding exoplanetary composition. The evolutionary pathways of planetary bodies around white dwarfs are crucial to understanding the presence of close-in planetary material, observed in the form of pollutants in the atmospheres of white dwarfs and planetary material transiting white dwarfs. Periodic transits around white dwarfs potentially reveal the existence of close-in planetary bodies undergoing dust production. Tidal interactions can bring planetesimals that have been gravitationally perturbed onto long-period highly eccentric orbits around white dwarfs towards shorter orbital periods and smaller eccentricities. Tidal interactions may also induce melting and volcanism in these planetesimals, potentially being a mechanism for dust and debris production, the result of which may be seen in transit. Tidally induced volcanism may be triggered in a wide parameter space: for a 100km-sized rocky planetesimals perturbed to a pericentre distance $\lesssim$ 0.01AU ($\gtrsim$ twice its Roche limit), both on long-period (~ 100day) highly eccentric orbits and short-period (~ 10hr) near circular orbits. We comment on the potential link between the resultant volcanic ejecta and observed optical transits.

 - **Abstract**
 The aim of this work is to obtain precise atmospheric parameters and chemical abundances automatically for solar twins and analogs to find signatures of exoplanets, as well as to assess how peculiar the Sun is compared to these stars and to analyze any possible fine structures in the Galactic thin disk. We developed a neural network (NN) algorithm using Python to obtain these parameters for a sample of 99 solar twins and solar analogs previously studied in the literature from normalized high-quality spectra from HARPS, with a resolving power of R $\sim$ 115000 and a signal-to-noise ratio S/N > 400. We obtained precise atmospheric parameters and abundance ratios [X/Fe] of 20 chemical elements (Li, C, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Y, and Ba). The results are in line with the literature, with average differences and standard deviations of $(2 \pm 27)$ K for T$_{\rm eff}$, $(0.00 \pm 0.06)$ dex for log g, $(0.00 \pm 0.02)$ dex for [Fe/H], $(-0.01 \pm 0.05)$ km s$^{-1}$ for microturbulence velocity, $(0.02 \pm 0.08)$ km s$^{-1}$ for the macro turbulence velocity, and $(-0.12 \pm 0.26)$ km s$^{-1}$ for the projected rotational velocity (vsin$i$). Regarding the chemical abundances, most of the elements agree with the literature within 0.01 - 0.02 dex. The abundances were corrected from the effects of the Galactic chemical evolution and analyzed with the condensation temperature (T$_{\rm cond}$) to verify whether the stars presented depletion of refractories compared to volatiles. We found that the Sun is more depleted in refractory elements compared to volatiles than 89% of the studied solar analogs, with a significance of 9.5$\sigma$ when compared to the stars without detected exoplanets. We also found the possible presence of three subpopulations in the solar analogs: one Cu-rich, one Cu-poor, and the last one slightly older and poor in Na.

 - **Abstract**
 Context: Intermediate-mass asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars influence Galactic lithium evolution by ejecting surface material (including Li) via stellar winds. Internal gravity waves (IGW), excited by convective motions, drive turbulent mixing in non-convective regions, altering stellar surface and wind chemistry. Aims: Investigate IGW-induced extra-mixing in the radiative zone between thermal pulses and convective envelopes of AGB stars and its impact on Li production. Derive the total Li contribution from intermediate-mass AGB stars using stellar models and initial mass functions. Methods: Construct stellar models (from zero-age main sequence to AGB end) with MESA, incorporating IGW-induced mixing and element diffusion. Calculate Li yields for stars of varying masses and metallicities using grids and population synthesis. Results: IGW triggers extra-mixing during He-shell flashes, transporting Be-7 from the radiative zone to the convective envelope, where it decays into Li-7. The positive effect of IGW on Li yield decreases with initial stellar mass but increases with metallicity. Most AGB stars (3.5-7.5 solar masses) produce positive Li yields. The total Li yield with IGW mixing (approximately 15 solar masses) is twice that without, contributing about 10 percent to Galactic Li. Conclusions: Through this extra-mixing mechanism induced by IGW, AGB stars can achieve a maximum A(Li) exceeding 5 and intermediate-mass AGB stars significantly contribute to Li in the Galactic ISM. These findings underscore the crucial role of IGW in stellar evolution, particularly in enhancing Li production.

          The peak flux of long gamma-ray bursts in the E$_{\rm p,i}$--L$_{\rm iso}$ diagram and in the classification

 - **Abstract**
 The E$_{\rm p,i}$--L$_{\rm iso}$ correlation of long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) is regarded as a fundamental correlation for standardizing LGRBs to probe cosmology and constrain LGRB physics. However, this correlation may be affected by potential selection effects which are likely overlooked in the current small LGRB redshift sample. In this work, we simulate a large LGRB sample that reflects the observed situation, aiming to study the impact of peak flux $P$ on the observed LGRB E$_{\rm p,i}$--L$_{\rm iso}$ correlation. We find that the overall (E$_{\rm p,i}$, L$_{\rm iso}$) distribution, which will directly affect the best-fit result of the correlation, is significantly dependent on the value of $P$. This indicates that the impact of peak flux selection should be carefully considered in the studies and applications of the E$_{\rm p,i}$--L$_{\rm iso}$ correlation. Notably, we show that our simulated data can reproduce the observed $P$ distribution only if some dependence of (E$_{\rm p,i}$, L$_{\rm iso}$) is included in the simulation. This is an indication that the (E$_{\rm p,i}$, L$_{\rm iso}$) connection is a crucial property of LGRBs. We also find that GRBs with high peak flux in the low-E$_{\rm p,i}$ & L$_{\rm iso}$ region are not the straightforward extrapolation of the GRB population in the higher-E$_{\rm p,i}$ & L$_{\rm iso}$ region. Selecting four bursts with $ L_{\rm iso}\le10^{50}$ erg s$^{-1}$, $E_{\rm p, i}\le10^{2.5}$ keV, and $P\ge10^{0.5}$ ph cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, we find two bursts, GRB 060614 and GRB 191019A, which may not be associated with the theoretical massive-star origin of LGRBs. This suggests that combining $P$ with the position in the E$_{\rm p,i}$--L$_{\rm iso}$ diagram may be used to indicate alternative LGRB origins.

 - **Abstract**
 PBjam is an open-source software package for measuring mode frequencies of solar-like oscillators. These frequencies help constrain stellar evolution models to precisely estimate masses, radii, and ages of stars. The overall aim of PBjam is to simplify this process to the point where it may be done by non-experts or performed on thousands of stars with minimal interaction. The initial release of PBjam was restricted to only identifying modes of $\ell=0$ and $\ell=2$, since these are the simplest to treat consistently across different stellar evolutionary stages. Here we introduce a new set of three separate models which lets PBjam automatically identify $\ell=1$ modes in stars that experience varying degrees of coupling between p- and g-modes. These include a simple asymptotic relation for p-modes which can be applied to main-sequence stars, a matrix formalism aimed at treating frequency dependent coupling in sub-giants, and a uniform coupling model which is suitable for red giants. These models follow the Bayesian methodology established in the first release of PBjam, where a large set of previous observations is used to construct a nonparametric prior probability density for the new set of model parameters. This extension allows PBjam to build a more complete description of the power due to oscillations across a wider range of evolutionary stages.

          Fine-Tuned Supernova or Failed Explosion? Decoding the Origins of the G3425 Binary

 - **Abstract**
 A binary system (G3425) consisting of a massive unseen component and a red giant star on a nearly circular orbit was recently discovered. The formation of such a system is puzzling because orbital stability generally breaks down due to the large mass loss from the system caused by the SN explosion while forming the unseen component. Analytical solutions of the variable-mass two-body problem suggest that the explosion should have occurred when the component was close to its apocenter to explain the near-circular remnant system. This provides a strong constraint on the total mass and orbital configuration of the progenitor system. The nearly circular orbit of G3425 rules out type II SN scenarios and allows only for a fine-tuned SN~Ib/c explosion to occur when the secondary was close to its apocenter. Such a scenario, although possible, is highly unlikely. However, the most likely scenario is a failed SN that produced a black hole, for which no additional constraints on the position of the secondary are needed. We propose that the unseen component of G3425 is a mass-gap black hole with a mass constrained between the theoretical minimum for failed supernova progenitors (4 MSun) and the observed upper limit (4.4 MSun). Our analysis can be applied to any wide binary system containing an unseen component on a nearly circular orbit.

 - **Abstract**
 The lightest Kaluza-Klein (KK) dark matter particles and primordial black holes (PBHs) emerge as plausible candidates for dark matter. In scenarios where dark matter is a mix of KK particles and PBHs, PBHs can attract surrounding KK dark matter particles post-formation, leading to the creation of ultracompact dark matter halos (UCMHs). The distribution of KK dark matter particles within UCMHs tends to be steeper than in classical dark matter halo structures, such as the Navarro-Frenk-White model. Consequently, the annihilation rate of KK dark matter particles in UCMHs is significant. The high-energy photons resulting from the annihilation of KK particles in UCMHs contribute to the extragalactic gamma-ray background (EGB). Leveraging data from the $\mathtt{Fermi\text{-}LAT}$ experiment, we have derived, for the first time, upper limits on the cosmological abundance of PBHs in the context of KK dark matter annihilation. For a KK dark matter mass range of $500\le m_{\rm B^{(1)}}\le 1500$ GeV, which aligns with the observed present abundance of dark matter, the conservative limits on the fraction of dark matter in PBHs, for massive PBHs with $M_{\rm PBH}\gtrsim 10^{-11}M_{\odot}$, are $f_{\rm PBH} \lesssim 2\times 10^{-5}$.

 This paper provides an overview of the spectroscopic data obtained by the JWST Guaranteed Time Observations (GTO) program 1192, "The Physics and Chemistry of PDR Fronts", including an inventory of the spatially resolved dust, gas, and molecular content in the Horsehead nebula and the NW filament of NGC~7023. We demonstrate the unique capability of this high spatial resolution data set to elucidate the evolution of gas and dust at the interface between stars and their natal clouds at the scale at which the physics and chemistry occur. The Disassociation Regions (PDRs) in the Horsehead nebula and the North West (NW) filament of NGC 7023 were mapped with a spectral resolution 1000-3000 and a spatial resolution of ~2e-4 pc between 0.97-28um. Spectra extracted from template regions yield a large number of atomic, ionized, and molecular lines. Full line lists and extracted spectra for all 10 regions are provided through CDS. Absorption from H$_2$O, CO$_2$, and CO ices are identified in 3 regions in NGC 7023. In this overview, we have focused on the spectral region between 3 and 5 um which is dominated by emission from aromatic and aliphatic carbon bonds to illustrate the power of the data set. We confirm the entrainment of aromatic carbonaceous species in the photo-evaporative flow from the PDR surface into the H\,{\sc{ii}} region in the Horsehead. No aliphatic emission is present in the outflow, indicating the complete removal of aliphatic bonds when exposed to strong UV fields. There is a clear detection of deuterium substitution in the carbon bonds. Aliphatic D-substitution is more efficient relative to aromatic D-substitution, ranging from N$_{D}$/N$_{H}$ ~ 0.1-0.3 for aliphatics compared to ~0.03 for the aromatics.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of some quiescent black hole X-ray binaries have revealed an excess of mid-infrared (MIR) emission above that expected from their donor stars. In one system, V404 Cygni, this excess has been variously suggested to arise from the accretion disk, circumbinary material, or a compact relativistic jet. Here we present simultaneous James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), and complementary multi-wavelength observations undertaken to resolve this uncertainty. We observed large-amplitude 21 $\mu$m variability on short timescales with JWST, particularly a dramatic flare which swiftly rose to $\approx 2.4$ mJy, over 10 times the lowest observed MIR flux density. Similar variability was simultaneously observed from radio to X-ray wavelengths with other facilities throughout the campaign. This variability and the flat radio/mm/MIR spectral index ($\alpha = 0.04 \pm 0.01$) suggest that the MIR excess in V404 Cyg does not arise from the accretion disk or circumbinary material but is instead dominated by synchrotron radiation from a jet which persists into quiescence. This result reinforces the ubiquity of the disk-jet connection in accreting black holes across a range of masses and accretion rates.

 - **Abstract**
 While JWST has provided us with the opportunity to probe the atmospheres of potentially-habitable planets, observations of the TRAPPIST-1 system have shown us that active stars severely complicate efforts at studying their planets. GJ 12b is a newly-discovered temperate (Teq ~ 300 K), Earth-sized (Rp = 0.96 +/- 0.05 Earth radii) planet orbiting an inactive M dwarf that might be a good alternate to the TRAPPIST-1 planets for atmospheric characterization. In this paper, we use MAROON-X radial velocities to measure a mass of 0.71 +/- 0.12 Earth masses for GJ 12b. We also find moderate evidence that the planet has an eccentric (e ~ 0.16) orbit. GJ 12b's mass results in a planetary density comparable to or less dense than Earth, possibly indicating the presence of water or a low bulk iron mass fraction. With its low mass, GJ 12b is likely within reach of JWST transmission spectroscopy observations, making it an excellent target for determining the location of the cosmic shoreline. Its low mass may mean that the planet could have trouble retaining its primary atmosphere during the star's active pre-main-sequence phase. However, if it has a heightened eccentricity, it may be able to sustain a secondary atmosphere through tidally-induced volcanism.

 - **Abstract**
 Small temperate planets are prime targets for exoplanet studies due to their possible similarities with the rocky planets in the Solar System. M dwarfs are promising hosts since the planetary signals are within our current detection capabilities. Gliese 12 b is a Venus-sized temperate planet orbiting a quiet M dwarf. We present here the first precise mass measurement of this small exoplanet. We performed a detailed analysis using HARPS-N, ESPRESSO, and CARMENES radial velocities, along with new and archival TESS, CHEOPS, and MuSCAT2/3 photometry data. From fitting the available data, we find that the planet has a radius of $R_\mathrm{p} = 0.904^{+0.037}_{-0.034} \,\mathrm{R_\oplus}$ and a mass of $M_\mathrm{p} = 0.95^{+0.26}_{-0.27} \,\mathrm{M_\oplus}$ (a $3.6\sigma$ measurement of the semi-amplitude $K=0.70^{+0.19}_{-0.20}\,\mathrm{m\,s^{-1}}$), and is on an orbit with a period of $12.761421 \pm 0.000047\,\mathrm{d}$. A variety of techniques were utilised to attenuate stellar activity signals. Gliese 12 b has an equilibrium temperature of $T_\mathrm{eq}=315 \pm 7\,\mathrm{K}$, assuming an albedo of zero, and a density consistent with that of Earth and Venus ($\rho_\mathrm{p}=7.0^{+2.3}_{-2.1}\,\mathrm{g\,cm^{-3}}$). We find that Gliese 12 b has a predominantly rocky interior and simulations indicate that it is unlikely to have retained any of its primordial gaseous envelope. The bulk properties of Gliese 12 b place it in an extremely sparsely-populated region of both mass--radius and density--$T_\mathrm{eq}$ parameter space, making it a prime target for follow-up observations, including Lyman-$\alpha$ studies.

 Analyzing filaments and cores in molecular clouds is key to understanding galactic star formation and its environmental dependence. This paper studies the properties and distribution of dense cores and filaments in the Ophiuchus molecular cloud, with a focus on the L1688 hub-filament system (HFS) and its star formation potential. We extracted sources and filaments from Herschel images and a 13.5 arcsec resolution surface density map using the getsf method, identified prestellar cores among the extracted sources, evaluated core mass segregation, and constructed the core mass function (CMF). We derived properties of the filaments from their radial surface density profiles, constructed the filament linear density function (FLDF), and assessed the mass distribution in the L1688 HFS to estimate the core and filament formation efficiencies (CFE, FFE). The results suggest that the filament-dominated core formation is a key mechanism in star formation within the system.

 - **Abstract**
 With the astrophysics community working towards the first observations and characterizations of Earth-like exoplanets, interest in space-based nulling interferometry has been renewed. This technique promises unique scientific and technical advantages by enabling direct mid-infrared observations. However, concept studies of nulling interferometers often overlook the impact of systematic noise caused by instrument perturbations. Earlier research introduced analytical and numerical models to address instrumental noise and, building on these results, we reproduce key simulations and report that the noise in the differential output of nulling interferometers follows a non-Gaussian distribution. The presence of non-Gaussian noise challenges the validity of classical hypothesis tests in detection performance estimates, as their reliance on Gaussian assumptions leads to overconfidence in detection thresholds. For the first time, we derive the true noise distribution of the differential output of a dual Bracewell nulling interferometer, demonstrating that it follows iterative convolutions of Bessel functions. Understanding this noise distribution enables a refined formulation of hypothesis testing in nulling interferometry, leading to a semi-analytical prediction of detection performance. This computationally efficient instrument model, implemented in a publicly available codebase, is designed for integration into science yield predictions for nulling interferometry mission concepts. It will play a key role in refining key mission parameters for the Large Interferometer For Exoplanets (LIFE).

 - **Abstract**
 Exoplanet surveys like Kepler, TESS, and K2 have shown that planetary systems are common in our galaxy. These surveys, along with several others, have identified thousands of planetary candidates, with more than five thousand having already been confirmed. Many of these planetary systems host multiple planets. As we discover more multiplanet systems, notable trends begin to appear in the data. We use kernel density estimation (KDE) to analyze the period ratios of adjacent planet pairs in multiplanet systems in the most recent Kepler, TESS and K2 data, paying particular attention to pairs in first order mean motion resonance (MMR). We compare a recent Kepler catalog with the DR25 data release. We also compare TESS and K2 against the latest Kepler catalog. To verify the significance of our findings against selection bias, we perform Monte Carlo simulations of multiplanet systems, finding an excess of planet pairs near the 2.2, 2 (2:1), and 1.5 (3:2) period ratios in the Kepler, K2, and TESS catalogs, all exceeding the 99% confidence interval when constrained to orbital periods less than 25 days. We identify two planet pairs orbiting M dwarf stars in a very tight ratio, as well as two likely misidentified planet pairs.

 - **Abstract**
 Noise maps from CMB experiments are generally statistically anisotropic, due to scanning strategies, atmospheric conditions, or instrumental effects. Any mis-modeling of this complex noise can bias the reconstruction of the lensing potential and the measurement of the lensing power spectrum from the observed CMB maps. We introduce a new CMB lensing estimator based on the maximum a posteriori (MAP) reconstruction that is minimally sensitive to these instrumental noise biases. By modifying the likelihood to rely exclusively on correlations between CMB map splits with independent noise realizations, we minimize auto-correlations that contribute to biases. In the regime of many independent splits, this maximum closely approximates the optimal MAP reconstruction of the lensing potential. In simulations, we demonstrate that this method is able to determine lensing observables that are immune to any noise mis-modeling with a negligible cost in signal-to-noise ratio. Our estimator enables unbiased and nearly optimal lensing reconstruction for next-generation CMB surveys.

- **Abstract**
 Searching for life elsewhere in the universe is one of the most highly prioritized pursuits in astronomy today. However, the ability to observe evidence of Earth-like life through biosignatures is limited by the number of planets in the solar neighborhood with conditions similar to Earth. The occurrence rate of Earth-like planets in the habitable zones of Sun-like stars, $\eta_{\oplus}$, is therefore crucial for addressing the apparent lack of consensus on its value in the literature. Here we present a review of the current understanding of $\eta_{\oplus}$. We first provide definitions for parameters that contribute to $\eta_{\oplus}$. Then, we discuss the previous and current estimated parameter values and the context of the limitations on the analyses that produced these estimates. We compile an extensive list of the factors that go into any calculation of $\eta_{\oplus}$, and how detection techniques and surveys differ in their sensitivity and ability to accurately constrain $\eta_{\oplus}$. Understanding and refining the value of $\eta_{\oplus}$ is crucial for upcoming missions and telescopes, such as the planned Habitable Worlds Observatory and the Large Interferometer for Exoplanets, which aim to search for biosignatures on exoplanets in the solar neighborhood.

          The Triple System V1371 Tau: An Eclipsing Binary with an Outer Be Star

- **Abstract**
 Although triple systems are common, their orbital dynamics and stellar evolution remain poorly understood. We investigated the V1371 Tau system using TESS photometry, multi-epoch spectroscopy, and recent interferometric data, confirming it as a rare triple system consisting of an eclipsing binary orbited by a classical Be star, with a spectral classification of (B1V + B0V) + B0Ve. The eclipsing binary exhibits an orbital period of approximately 34 days, and the Be star orbits the inner pair on a timescale of a few years. Weak H$\alpha$ emission lines suggest the presence of a Keplerian disk with variability on a timescale of months around the Be star, and a nearly constant V/R ratio with no detectable asymmetry variations. Besides the eclipses, frequencies at 0.24 and 0.26 c/d dominate the photometric variability. Higher-frequency signals are present which appear associated with non-radial pulsation. The eclipsing pair ($i \approx 90^\circ$) shows projected rotational velocities of 160 and 200 km s$^{-1}$. The Be star's measured $v \sin i \approx 250$ km s$^{-1}$ implies a critical rotation fraction between 0.44 and 0.76 for plausible inclinations, significantly faster than the eclipsing components. The shallower eclipses in the KELT data compared to TESS suggest a variation in orbital inclination, possibly induced by Kozai-Lidov cycles from the outer Be star. The evolution analysis suggests that all components are massive main-sequence stars, with the secondary star in the eclipsing binary being overluminous. This study emphasizes the complexity of triple systems with Be stars and provides a basis for future research on their formation, evolution, and dynamics.

- **Abstract**
 Protostellar jets provide valuable insight into the evolutionary stage and formation history of star-forming cores in their earliest phases. We investigated the inner envelope structures of three extremely young protostars, selected for having the shortest dynamical timescales in their outflows and jets. Our analysis is based on Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of the N2D+, DCO+, DCN, C18O, CH3OH, and H2CO lines, along with 1.3 mm continuum data, obtained at two spatial resolutions of ~500 AU and 150 AU. By examining molecular depletion and sublimation patterns, emission extents at core-scale and outflow rotational temperatures, we assessed the relative evolutionary stages of the three sources. In G208.68-19.20N1, the absence of N2D+ toward the core-despite a semi-ring-like distribution-and the presence of bright DCN and DCO+ emission cospatial with C18O indicate a warmer envelope, possibly suggesting a more advanced evolutionary state. In contrast, G208.68-19.20N3 shows no dense central structures in C18O, DCN, DCO+, or N2D+, with emission instead appearing scattered around the continuum and along large-scale filaments, consistent with a likely younger stage than G208.68-19.20N1. The third source, G215.87-17.62M, exhibits compact C18O emission at the continuum peak, but spatially extended N2D+, DCN, and DCO+ along the continuum, pointing to a cooler envelope and likely the youngest stage among the three. This comparative analysis across three protostars demonstrates the effectiveness of molecular tracers for evolutionary staging, though variations in luminosity or accretion may also shape chemical morphologies. These results highlight the promise of broader surveys for advancing our understanding of early protostellar evolution.

- **Abstract**
 It is well-known that some star clusters contain composite stellar populations (CSPs), in which the metallicities or (and) ages of stars are different. The formation and evolution of such clusters and their stellar populations remain unclear. Both single and binary cluster channels may lead to such CSPs. In order to simulate the formation and evolution of such CSPs in star clusters, this work develops a code of direct N-body simulation of CSPs, NbodyCP. It is applied to different clusters, in particular, to binary clusters. It shows that CSPs and different kinds of cluster pairs can be formed via dynamical processes. This will help to partially explain the formation of CSPs and various clusters. Some special cluster structures, e.g., two cores or bar-like shape, are shown to be the results of evolution of some binary clusters. The simulation also shows that the separation between the members of a binary cluster affects the time of two member clusters to combine or move away significantly.

- **Abstract**
 Aims. This paper introduces LRPayne, a novel algorithm designed for the efficient determination of stellar parameters and chemical abundances from low-resolution optical spectra, with a primary focus on data from large-scale galactic surveys such as WEAVE. Methods. LRPayne employs a model-driven approach, utilising a fully connected artificial neural network (ANN), trained on a library of 70,000 synthetic stellar spectra generated using iSpec with 1D MARCS model atmospheres and the Turbospectrum synthesis code. The network is trained to predict normalized flux given stellar labels (Teff, log(g), [Fe/H], vmic, vmax and v sin i, and 24 individual elemental abundances). Stellar parameters are subsequently derived from observed spectra by finding the best-fit synthetic spectrum from the ANN using a chi-squared minimisation technique. The method operates on spectra degraded to a resolution of R=5000 covering the wavelength range 4200-6900 Å. Results. Internal accuracy tests on synthetic spectra show a median interpolation error of less than 0.13 % for 90 % of the validation sample. The method accurately recovers most input labels from synthetic spectra, even at a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of 20, with some expected challenges for elements like Li, K, and N. Validation on observed spectra of 25 Gaia FGK benchmark stars and 42 metal-poor stars reveals good agreement with literature values. For stellar parameters, mean differences are 22+-87 K for Teff , 0.19+-0.23 dex for log(g), and 0.01+-0.17 dex for [Fe/H]. Abundances for elements like Na, Mg, Si, and most Fe-peak elements (Cr, Ni, V, Sc) are well-recovered. Challenges are noted for oxygen, manganese in metal-rich giants, aluminium in metal-poor stars and dwarfs, and for deriving log g in hot metal-poor dwarfs, partly due to non-local thermodynamic equilibrium effects and line characteristics.

- **Abstract**
 We have conducted a comprehensive comparison of interplanetary scintillation (IPS) observations taken by the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) with several heliospheric transient event catalogues, over a time period of 7 months during solar minimum. From this analysis we have found that of the 84% of catalogued events that have MWA IPS data available, 68% of them appear in MWA observations. Of the enhancements first identified in IPS observations, only 58% have a potential match with a catalogued event. The majority of enhancements that were identified in the IPS observations were situated greater than 10$^\circ$ from the ecliptic plane. Two such features were selected for detailed analysis, connecting their solar origins to their propagation through the heliosphere. The first of these features was created by a coronal mass ejection (CME), captured over two successive MWA observations and recorded in several catalogues. The second feature has the potential of being a stream interaction region (SIR) travelling out of the ecliptic plane. This particular SIR was not recorded in any catalogue. Thus the MWA shows promise in detecting heliospheric transients that other commonly-used techniques may overlook. These results show the strength of the MWA in having unbridled access to the heliosphere, able to make remote observations of events far out of the ecliptic as it is not restrained to the orbits of spacecraft. We demonstrate how the inclusion of MWA IPS data can potentially boost the number of CME and SIR events that are characterised.

          Redshift-Frame Systematics and Their Impact on the Hubble Constant from Pantheon+ Supernovae

- **Abstract**
 We present a full-sky covariance-weighted analysis of redshift-frame consistency in the Pantheon+ Type~Ia supernova sample. Using 1,543 unique objects with heliocentric ($z_{\rm HEL}$) and cosmic microwave background ($z_{\rm CMB}$) redshifts, we quantify residual differences between frames. A statistically significant but physically small mean offset $\langle z_{\rm CMB} - z_{\rm HEL} \rangle = (-3.8 \pm 0.1)\times10^{-4}$ is found, exhibiting a sign reversal between low- and high-redshift subsets ($p = 3.8\times10^{-15}$). A dipole fit to the residuals yields an amplitude $A = (1.5 \pm 0.1)\times10^{-3}$ directed toward $(\mathrm{RA},\mathrm{Dec}) = (167.1^\circ, -1.6^\circ)$, consistent within $1^\circ$ of the CMB dipole. When propagated through a covariance-weighted Hubble fit, these effects shift the inferred Hubble constant by only $\Delta H_0 = 0.07~\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$ (about $1.3\%$ of the current Hubble tension). The recovered dipole aligns with the known solar motion relative to the CMB, validating the kinematic frame corrections in Pantheon+ and establishing a systematic floor for future bulk-flow searches.

- **Abstract**
 The chemistry of planetary atmospheres containing molecular nitrogen as a major atmospheric component is strongly influenced by the reactions of atomic nitrogen. Although nitrogen atoms in their ground electronic state N(4S) are mostly unreactive towards stable molecules, electronically excited nitrogen atoms N(2D) are much more reactive and could play an important role in the formation of nitriles and other nitrogen bearing organic molecules in planetary atmospheres such as Titan. Despite this, few kinetic studies of N(2D) reactions have been performed over the appropriate low temperature range. Here, we report the results of an experimental study of the reactions N(2D) + methylacetylene, CH3CCH, and N(2D) + acetonitrile, CH3CN, using a supersonic flow reactor at selected temperatures between 50 K and 296 K. N(2D) atoms, which were generated indirectly as a product of the C(3P) + NO reaction, were subsequently detected by laser induced fluorescence in the vacuum ultraviolet wavelength region. The measured rate constants are significantly larger than the estimated values in current photochemical models and do not display large variations as a function of temperature. The new rate constants are included in a 1D coupled ion-neutral model of Titans atmosphere to test their influence on the simulated species abundances. In addition, the overall description of both reactions is improved by considering the results of recent experimental and theoretical work examining the product channels of these processes. These simulations indicate that while the N(2D) + CH3CCH reaction has only a limited overall influence on Titans atmospheric chemistry, the N(2D) + CH3CN reaction could lead to the formation of significant relative abundances of cyanomethamine, HNCHCN, in the upper atmosphere.

- **Abstract**
 The Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST) is a flagship space-based observatory. Its main survey camera is designed to conduct high spatial resolution near-ultraviolet to near-infrared imaging and low-resolution spectroscopic surveys. To maximize the scientific output of CSST, we have developed a comprehensive, high-fidelity simulation pipeline for reproducing both imaging and spectroscopic observations. This paper presents an overview of the simulation framework, detailing its implementation and components. Built upon the GalSim package and incorporating the latest CSST instrumental specifications, our pipeline generates pixel-level mock observations that closely replicate the expected instrumental and observational conditions. The simulation suite integrates realistic astrophysical object catalogs, instrumental effects, point spread function (PSF) modeling, and observational noises to produce accurate synthetic data. We describe the key processing stages of the simulation, from constructing the input object catalogs to modeling the telescope optics and detector responses. Furthermore, we introduce the most recent release of simulated datasets, which provide a crucial testbed for data processing pipeline developments, calibration strategies, and scientific analyses, ensuring that CSST will meet its stringent requirements. Our pipeline serves as a vital tool for optimizing CSST main survey strategies and ensuring robust cosmological measurements.

- **Abstract**
 Neutron captures produce the vast majority of abundances of elements heavier than iron in the Universe. Beyond the classical slow (s) and rapid (r) processes, there is observational evidence for neutron-capture processes that operate at neutron densities in between, at different distances from the valley of $\beta$ stability. Here, we review the main properties of the s process within the general context of neutron-capture processes and the nuclear physics input required to investigate it. We describe massive stars and asymptotic giant branch stars as the s-process astrophysical sites and discuss the related physical uncertainties. We also present current observational evidence for the s process and beyond, which ranges from stellar spectroscopic observations to laboratory analysis of meteorites.

- **Abstract**
 Flares and CMEs are known to be the dominating high-energy phenomena on cool stars. Superflares were thoroughly investigated using broadband photometry predominantly from Kepler, K2, and TESS. Here we present a spectroscopic investigation of superflares on the very active spectroscopic binary CC~Eri. We focus on spectroscopic signatures of (super)-flares and line asymmetries with the goal to characterize superflares spectroscopically. In 70 nights of spectroscopic observations obtained at the ESO~1.52m telescope with the Echelle spectrograph PUCHEROS+ hosted by the PLATOSpec consortium we identified 31 flares from which two are superflares already from the deduced g'-band energies. We also find a broad blue-wing asymmetry occurring in the impulsive phase of another superflare which shows great potential to be a prominence eruption. For the second most luminous flare we find the largest number of excess emissions during the impulsive and gradual flare. We identify the flare to be occurring close to the stellar limb which indicates that the flare was even more energetic than derived from its g'-band and spectral line energies. We identify more than sixty spectral lines in the spectral range of 4100 and 7200Å showing excess emission during this flare. We detect continuum enhancements as well as photospheric line fillings during the flare. Generally we find that depending on the flare energy the number of spectral lines revealing excess emission increases, especially for the more energetic superflares. We therefore conclude that superflares are likely scaled-up versions of less energetic normal flares.

- **Abstract**
 We present deep optical imaging of the extremely isolated dwarf galaxy NGC 6789, obtained with the new 2-meter Two-meter Twin Telescope (TTT3) at Teide Observatory. Despite its location in the Local Void, NGC 6789 exhibits surprising recent central star formation equivalent to approximately 4% of its total stellar mass. The origin of the gas necessary for this level of star formation remains unknown. Our data reach surface brightness limits of 29.8, 29.4, and 28.9 mag arcsec$^{-2}$ in the Sloan g, r, and i filters, respectively, and reveal no evidence of tidal features or merger remnants down to $\sim$30 mag arcsec$^{-2}$ (or equivalently, at a radial distance larger than 1.6 kpc). The galaxy's undisturbed outer elliptical morphology suggests that its recent central star formation was likely produced by either in-situ residual gas or by the accretion of external pristine gas not associated with a minor merging activity.

- **Abstract**
 The Fermi Bubbles are gamma-ray structures extending from the center of the Milky Way to +/-50 degree Galactic latitude that were discovered in data obtained by the Fermi/LAT instrument. Their origin and power source remain uncertain. To help address this uncertainty, here we use a template-free reconstruction of ten years of all-sky Fermi/LAT data provided by Platz et al. (2023) to carry out a pixel-by-pixel spectral analysis of the Bubbles. We recover the position-dependent spectral shape and normalization that would be required for parent proton or electron cosmic ray populations to produce the Bubbles' observed gamma-ray spectra. We find that models in which the gamma-ray emission is driven by either hadronic or leptonic processes can explain the data equally well. The cosmic ray population driving the emission must have either broken power-law or exponentially cut-off spectra, with break or cutoff energies that are almost constant with latitude but spectral indices below the break that harden towards the Bubbles' southern tip. For the leptonic channel, reproducing the observed position-dependent gamma-ray spectrum also requires a cosmic ray electron energy density that grows with distance from the Galactic plane and increases towards the edges of the Bubbles. This finding disfavors scenarios for the origin of the Bubbles where a population of cosmic ray electrons is accelerated near the Milky Way center and subsequently advected out to the extremities of the Bubbles.

          Rethinking mass transfer: a unified semi-analytical framework for circular and eccentric binaries.II. Orbital evolution due to non-conservative mass transfer

- **Abstract**
 Although mass transfer (MT) has been studied primarily in circular binaries, observations show that it also occurs in eccentric systems. We investigate orbital evolution during non-conservative MT in eccentric orbits, a process especially relevant for binaries containing compact objects (COs). We examine four angular momentum loss (AML) modes; Jeans, isotropic re-emission, orbital-AML and $L_2$ mass loss -- the latter is the most efficient AML mode. For fixed AML mode and accretion efficiency, orbital evolution is correlated: orbits either widen while becoming more eccentric, or shrink while circularizing. Jeans mode generally yields orbital widening and eccentricity pumping, whereas $L_2$ mass loss typically leads to orbital shrinkage and eccentricity damping. Isotropic re-emission and orbital-AML show intermediate behavior. Adopting isotropic re-emission, we demonstrate that eccentric MT produces compact binaries that merge via gravitational waves (GW) within a Hubble time, whereas the same systems would instead merge during MT under traditional modeling. We further show that, in eccentric orbits, the gravitational potential at $L_2$ becomes lower than at $L_1$ across large range of mass ratios and eccentricities, naturally linking eccentricity to $L_2$ mass loss. Since interacting binaries containing COs are frequently eccentric, $L_2$ mass loss offers a new robust pathway to orbital tightening during eccentric MT, contributing to the formation rate of GW sources. This model can treat orbital evolution due to conservative and non-conservative MT in arbitrary eccentricities with applications ranging from MT on the main sequence to GW progenitors.

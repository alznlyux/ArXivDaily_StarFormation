 - **Abstract**
 The thermal Sunyaev$-$Zel'dovich (SZ) effect offers a unique probe of the hot and diffuse universe that could help close the missing baryon problem. Traditional extractions of the SZ effect, however, exhibit systematic noise that may lead to unreliable results. In this work, we provide an alternative solution using a three-dimensional Attention Nested U-Net trained end-to-end with supervised learning. Our labeled data consists of simulated SZ signals injected into $\textit{Planck}$ frequency maps, allowing our model to learn how to extract SZ signals in the presence of realistic noise. We implement a curriculum learning scheme that gradually exposed the model to weaker SZ signals. The absence/presence of curriculum learning significantly impacted the amount of bias and variance present in the reconstructed SZ signal. The results from our method were comparable to those from the popular $\textit{needlet internal linear combination}$ (NILC) method when evaluated on simulated data as well as real-world SZ signals. We conclude by discussing future avenues for advancing machine learning extractions of SZ signals.

 - **Abstract**
 A crucial ingredient affecting fast neutrino flavor conversion in core-collapse supernovae (SNe) is the shape of the angular distribution of the electron-neutrino lepton number (ELN). The presence of an ELN crossing signals favorable conditions for flavor conversion. However, the dependence of ELN crossings on the SN properties is only partially understood. We investigate a suite of 12 spherically symmetric neutrino-hydrodynamics simulations of the core collapse of a SN with a mass of $18.6 M_\odot$; each model employs different microphysics (i.e., three different nuclear equations of state, with and without muon creation) and includes or not a mixing-length treatment for proto-neutron star convection. We solve the Boltzmann equations to compute the neutrino angular distributions relying on static fluid properties extracted from each of the SN simulations in our suite for six selected post-bounce times. We explore the dependence of the ELN distributions on the SN microphysics and proto-neutron star convection. We find that the latter shifts the proto-neutron star radius outwards, favoring the appearance of ELN crossings at larger radii. On the other hand, muon creation causes proto-neutron star contraction, facilitating the occurrence of ELN crossings at smaller radii. These effects mildly depend on the nuclear equation of state. Our findings highlight the subtle impact of the SN microphysics, proto-neutron star convection, and neutrino transport on the ELN angular distributions.

 - **Abstract**
 Sub-Neptune exoplanets are the most abundant type of planet known today. As they do not have a Solar System counterpart, many open questions exist about their composition and formation. Previous spectroscopic studies rule out aerosol-free hydrogen-helium-dominated atmospheres for many characterized sub-Neptunes but are inconclusive about their exact atmospheric compositions. Here we characterize the hot (Teq=1311K) sub-Neptune HD 86226 c, which orbits its G-type host star. Its high equilibrium temperature prohibits methane-based haze formation, increasing the chances for a clear atmosphere on this planet. We use HST data taken with WFC3 and STIS from the Sub-neptune Planetary Atmosphere Characterization Experiment (SPACE) Program to perform near-infrared 1.1-1.7micrometer transmission spectroscopy and UV characterization of the host star. We report a featureless transmission spectrum that is consistent within 0.4 sigma with a constant transit depth of 418+-14ppm. The amplitude of this spectrum is only 0.01 scale heights for a H/He-dominated atmosphere, excluding a cloud-free solar-metallicity atmosphere on HD 86226 c with a confidence of 6.5 sigma. Based on an atmospheric retrieval analysis and forward models of cloud and haze formation, we find that the featureless spectrum could be due to a metal enrichment [M/H] above 2.3 (3 sigma confidence lower limit) of a cloudless atmosphere, or silicate (MgSiO3), iron (Fe), or manganese sulfide (MnS) clouds. For these species, we perform an investigation of cloud formation in high-metallicity, high-temperature atmospheres. Our results highlight that HD 86226c does not follow the aerosol trend of sub-Neptunes found by previous studies. Follow-up observations with the JWST could determine whether this planet aligns with the recent detections of metal-enriched atmospheres or if it harbors a cloud species otherwise atypical for sub-Neptunes.

 - **Abstract**
 In modern-day astronomy, near-infrared, optical, and ultraviolet spectroscopy are indispensable for studying a wide range of phenomena, from measuring black hole masses to analyzing chemical abundances in stellar atmospheres. However, spectroscopic data reduction is often performed using instrument-specific pipelines or legacy software well-established and robust within the community that are often challenging to implement and script in modern astrophysical workflows. In this work, we introduce easyspec, a new Python package designed for long-slit spectroscopy, capable of reducing, extracting, and analyzing spectra from a wide range of instruments--provided they deliver raw FITS files, the standard format for most optical telescopes worldwide. This package is built upon the well-established long-slit spectroscopy routines of the Image Reduction and Analysis Facility (IRAF), integrating modern coding techniques and advanced fitting algorithms based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations. We present a user-friendly open-source Python package that can be easily incorporated into customized pipelines for more complex analyses. To validate its capabilities, we apply easyspec to the active galactic nucleus G4Jy 1709, observed with the DOLORES spectrograph at the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo, measuring its redshift and estimating its supermassive black hole mass. Finally, we compare our results with a previous IRAF-based study.

          Testing the Origin of Hot Jupiters with Ariel

 - **Abstract**
 In spite of their long detection history, the origin of hot Jupiters remains to be resolved. While multiple dynamical evidence suggests high-eccentricity migration is most likely, conflicts remain when considering hot Jupiters as a population in the context of warm and cold Jupiters. Here, we turn to atmospheric signatures as an alternative mean to test the origin theory of hot Jupiters, focusing on population level trends that arise from post-formation pollution, motivated by the upcoming Ariel space mission whose goal is to deliver a uniform sample of exoplanet atmospheric constraints. We experiment with post-formation pollution by planetesimal accretion, pebble accretion, and disk-induced migration and find that an observable signature of post-formation pollution is only possible under pebble accretion in metal-heavy disks. If most hot Jupiters arrive at their present orbit by high-eccentricity migration while warm Jupiters emerge largely in situ, we expect the atmospheric water abundance of hot Jupiters to be significantly elevated compared to warm Jupiters, at a level that is easily detectable by Ariel transit survey. We provide suggestions for future comparative atmospheric characterization between hot Jupiters and wide-orbit directly imaged planets to elucidate the properties of the dust substructures in protoplanetary disks.

          Lensing without mass: The matter density profile in cosmic voids from UNIONS

 - **Abstract**
 We measure the distribution of matter contained within the emptiest regions of the Universe: cosmic voids. We use the large overlap between the Ultraviolet Near-Infrared Optical Northern Survey (UNIONS) and voids identified in the LOWZ and CMASS catalogues of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) to constrain the excess surface mass density of voids using weak lensing. We present and validate a novel method for computing the Gaussian component of the conventional weak lensing covariance, adapted for use with void studies. We detect the stacked weak lensing void density profile at the $6.2\sigma$ level, the most significant detection of void lensing from spectroscopically-identified voids to date. We find that large and small voids have different matter density profiles, as expected from numerical studies of void profiles. This difference is significant at the $2.3\sigma$ level. Comparing the void profile to a measurement of the void-galaxy cross-correlation to test the linearity of the relationship between mass and light, we find good visual agreement between the two, and a galaxy bias factor of $2.45\pm0.36$, consistent with other works. This work represents a promising detection of the lensing effect from underdensities, with the goal of promoting its development into a competitive cosmological probe.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. A comprehensive study of comets over a wide heliocentric distance range helps us understand the physical processes driving their activity and reveals compositional differences across dynamical groups. C/2017 K2 (PANSTARRS) is a Dynamically New Oort Cloud comet (DNC) that showed activity as far as 23.75 au and displayed a CO-rich coma at 6.72 au, making it a key object to investigate pre- and post-perihelion behavior. Aims. We aim to study the long-term activity evolution and chemical composition of C/2017 K2 using photometry and spectroscopy, from October 2017 (r$_h$ = 15.18 au) pre-perihelion to April 2025 (r$_h$ = 8.46 au) post-perihelion. Methods. Broad-band and narrow-band imaging from both TRAPPIST telescopes enabled us to produce an 8-year light curve, color analysis, and derivation of activity slopes. Production rates of OH, NH, CN, C$_3$, and C$_2$ were computed using a Haser model, along with the dust proxy A(0)f$\rho$. High-resolution spectra from CRIRES$^+$ and UVES at three epochs (May - September 2022) provided simultaneous observations of parent and daughter species as the comet crossed the water sublimation zone. Results. The light curve of C/2017 K2 shows a complex evolution with varying slopes and a brightness plateau around perihelion, indicating multiple active species. Coma colors remained constant, suggesting uniform dust properties and similarity to other active long-period comets. Gas production rates indicate a typical C$_2$/CN composition with a high dust-to-gas ratio. Analysis of forbidden oxygen lines shows a transition from CO and CO$_2$-driven activity to water-driven sublimation inside 3 au. Infrared spectra reveal C/2017 K2 as a typical-to-enriched comet, with HCN identified as the main parent of CN, and C$_2$ likely originating from C$_2$H$_2$ rather than C$_2$H$_6$.

 - **Abstract**
 We present new time-series CCD \emph{VR} photometry of the globular cluster NGC 5634. We aim to use the known RR Lyrae stars, members of the cluster, as indicators of mean metallicity and distance. Accurate coordinates, periods and an identification chart of the variables in the field of our images are provided. A membership analysis was performed, based on $Gaia$-DR3 proper motions, for 3525 point sources within 15 arcmin from the cluster center. The membership status for each known variable was established and it was found that V10, V11 and V16 are most likely field stars. The variability of the RRab star V7, considered non-variable for a number of years, is demonstrated. Via the Fourier decomposition of the light curves of cluster member RR Lyrae, the mean metallicity and distance were calculated independently from RRab and RRc stars to find [Fe/H]$_{\rm ZW}= -1.67 \pm 0.11$ y $D=23.9 \pm 0.8$ kpc, and [Fe/H]$_{\rm ZW}= -1.69 \pm 0.22$ y $D=22.9 \pm 1.0$ kpc respectively.

 - **Abstract**
 Newtonian noise limits the low-frequency sensitivity of ground-based gravitational wave detectors. While seismometers and geophones are commonly employed to monitor ground motion for Newtonian noise cancellation, their limited spatial coverage and high deployment costs hinder scalability. In this study, we demonstrate that distributed acoustic sensing offers a viable and scalable alternative, providing performance comparable to that of conventional seismic instruments. Using data from acoustic sensing and colocated seismometers during both natural and controlled events, we observe a strong correlation, exceeding 0.8, between the two sensor types in the 3 to 20 Hz frequency band relevant for Newtonian noise. Moreover, when distributed acoustic sensing data are used to predict geophone signals, the correlation remains high, above 0.7, indicating that distributed acoustic sensing accurately captures both the spatial and spectral features of ground motion. As a case study, we apply distributed acoustic sensing data to cancel noise recorded by the vertical component of a seismometer and compare the results with those obtained using geophone data for the same task. Both distributed acoustic sensing and geophone-based cancellations yield a residual noise factor of 0.11 at 20 Hz. These findings confirm the feasibility of using distributed acoustic sensing for Newtonian noise mitigation and highlight its potential, in combination with traditional seismic sensors, to improve environmental monitoring and noise suppression in current and next-generation gravitational wave observatories.

 - **Abstract**
 We present `James Webb Space Telescope' observations of M4 -- the closest globular cluster -- that probe the lower Main Sequence down to the hydrogen-burning limit. The unveiled stellar sequence reaches much fainter luminosities than previously possible, revealing a few extremely red objects that are consistent with brown dwarfs as cool as T_eff~1000K. However, the lack of a second JWST epoch presently prevents us from verifying the cluster membership of these objects. By cross-matching our data with archival `Hubble Space Telescope' images, we are able to verify cluster membership for a subset of objects down to T_eff~3000K. The observed color distribution indicate that the lower Main Sequence of M4 is likely deficient in oxygen compared to its higher-mass post-Main Sequence members by ~0.5dex. This feature has now been observed in three different globular clusters (M4, NGC6397 and 47Tuc), suggesting a general trend. Finally, we derive the mass function of the Galactic bulge in the background of M4. The mass function was found to have the bottom-heavy slope of alpha=0.88+/-0.36 and appears to terminate at ~0.15 M_Sun, although the latter value may be overestimated due to the limited sample size.

 - **Abstract**
 V960~Mon is an FU Orionis object that shows strong evidence of a gravitationally unstable spiral arm that is fragmenting into several dust clumps. We report the discovery of a new substellar companion candidate around this young star, identified in high-contrast $L'$-band imaging with VLT/ERIS. The object is detected at a projected separation of $0.898 \pm 0.01$ arcseconds with a contrast of $(8.39 \pm 0.07) \times 10^{-3}$. The candidate lies close to the clumps previously detected in the sub-mm (at 1.3 mm) and is co-located with extended polarized IR signal from scattered stellar irradiation, suggesting it is deeply embedded. The object is undetected in the SPHERE $H$-band total intensity, placing an upper mass limit of $\sim38~M_\mathrm{Jup}$ from the contrast curve. Using evolutionary models at an assumed age of 1~Myr, we estimate a mass of $\sim660~M_\mathrm{Jup}$ from the L' brightness; however, this value likely includes a significant contribution from a disk around the companion. The discrepancy between near- and mid-infrared results again suggests the source is deeply embedded in dust. This candidate may represent an actively accreting, disk-bearing substellar object in a young, gravitationally unstable environment.

 - **Abstract**
 The eight-planet Kepler-90 system exhibits the greatest multiplicity of planets found to date. All eight planets are transiting and were discovered in photometry from the NASA Kepler primary mission. The two outermost planets, g ($P_g$ = 211 d) and h ($P_h$ = 332 d) exhibit significant transit-timing variations (TTVs), but were only observed 6 and 3 times respectively by Kepler. These TTVs allow for the determination of planetary masses through dynamical modeling of the pair's gravitational interactions, but the paucity of transits allows a broad range of solutions for the masses and orbital ephemerides. To determine accurate masses and orbital parameters for planets g and h, we combined 34 radial velocities (RVs) of Kepler-90, collected over a decade, with the Kepler transit data. We jointly modeled the transit times of the outer two planets and the RV time series, then used our two-planet model to predict their future times of transit. These predictions led us to recover a transit of Kepler-90 g with ground-based observatories in May 2024. We then combined the 2024 transit and several previously unpublished transit times of planets g and h with the Kepler photometry and RV data to update the masses and linear ephemerides of the planets, finding masses for g and h of $15.0 \pm 1.3\, M_\oplus$, and $203 \pm 16\, M_\oplus$ respectively from a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis. These results enable further insights into the architecturally rich Kepler-90 system and pave the way for atmospheric characterization with space-based facilities.

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are traditionally classified into long (lGRBs) and short (sGRBs) durations based on their $T_{90}$, with lGRBs widely used as tracers of the cosmic star formation rate (SFR) due to their observed association with core-collapse supernovae. However, recent detections of kilonovae accompanying some lGRBs challenge this assumption, suggesting potential contamination from compact binary mergers. Here, we move beyond the conventional $T_{90}$-based classification and focus exclusively on GRBs directly associated with supernovae - the most direct signatures of massive stellar collapse - to reassess their connection to the SFR. Using a sample of SN/GRBs, we construct the luminosity - redshift ($L$-$z$) plane and uncover a significant correlation between these variables. To account for observational biases, we apply the $\tau$ statistic and Lynden-Bell's $C^{-}$ method to derive the intrinsic luminosity function and formation rate. Our analysis reveals that even among this well-defined subsample, the SN/GRB formation rate still exceeds the SFR at low redshifts ($z < 1$). These findings suggest that GRBs at low redshift may not serve as reliable tracers of the SFR, and that larger samples are required to further investigate this discrepancy.

 - **Abstract**
 The Fermi and eROSITA bubbles are two pairs of large diffuse multi-band structures detected in our Milky Way galaxy, yet their origins remain uncertain. Using three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations, we investigate the model where these bubbles were produced by two successive active galactic nucleus jet activities from the Galactic center, with their edges delineated by the correspondingly driven forward shocks. Our simulations successfully reproduce the observed morphology, multi-band X-ray surface brightness distributions between 0.11 and 2.04 keV, and O viii/O vii line ratios, matching ROSAT and eROSITA observations. The results indicate that the first jet pair, launched 15 Myr ago, created the eROSITA bubbles, now extending to ~15 kpc with gas temperatures of ~0.25 keV. The second jet pair, launched 5 Myr ago, produced the Fermi bubbles, currently reaching ~10 kpc with temperatures of 0.3--0.4 keV. The sharp edges of the eROSITA and Fermi bubbles are naturally explained by the forward shocks in this double-episode jet scenario. Our findings support a Galactic-scale origin for these structures and suggest episodic jet activities from the Galactic center.

 - **Abstract**
 Compact binary mergers, detected in gravitational waves since 2015, are candidate sources for astrophysical neutrinos in the GeV regime from proton-proton and proton-neutron collisions. This contribution presents the results of the search for such a signal using mergers detected during the fourth observing run of the LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA interferometers. We use the dense infill array at the center of the IceCube detector, IceCube-DeepCore, to select neutrino candidates in the 0.5-5 GeV energy range. The search for a statistically significant excess associated with an astrophysical signal is performed in a $\pm$ 500 s window around the gravitational wave detection time. We do not observe any statistically significant excess in the neutrino data, and set upper limits on the neutrino emission from these objects. Additionally, we search for subpopulations of neutrino-emitting sources, including merger events detected in previous observing runs; no significant signal has been identified yet.

 The Pierre Auger Observatory, located in La Pampa Amarilla, Argentina, has been continuously acquiring data since 2004. It comprises a surface detector array covering 3,000 km$^2$ and 27 fluorescence telescopes, designed to detect extensive air showers initiated by ultra-high-energy cosmic rays. An upgrade to the Observatory was commissioned in 2024, enhancing the existing water-Cherenkov detectors with additional radio antennas, surface scintillator detectors, and a buried scintillator array. This compilation of contributions to the 39th International Cosmic Ray Conference, held in Geneva, Switzerland (July 15-24, 2025), presents recent results from the Pierre Auger Collaboration, addressing a wide range of fundamental questions in astroparticle physics. The included papers cover measurements of the energy spectrum, mass composition, and arrival directions of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays, investigations of hadronic interactions in extensive air showers, and searches for ultra-high-energy photons and neutrinos. Additional topics include radio detection techniques, solar-related phenomena, and atmospheric events such as ELVES and TGFs. The list also contains first results and performance evaluations of the upgraded detectors, AugerPrime, along with reports on outreach and social engagement initiatives conducted by the Collaboration.

 - **Abstract**
 Some previous studies have suggested that massive and intermediate-mass primordial black holes (PBHs) could comprise a substantial fraction of dark matter in the Universe. Such black holes, if they existed in the Milky Way halo, would give rise to long-duration microlensing events that may potentially last for years. However, earlier searches were not sufficiently sensitive to detect such events. Here, we present the results of searches for long-timescale gravitational microlensing events toward the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) using nearly 20 years of photometric observations collected by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) from 2001 to 2020. We found six events, three of which are new discoveries. We use a sample of five events to measure the microlensing optical depth toward the SMC $\tau = (0.32 \pm 0.18) \times 10^{-7}$ and the event rate $\Gamma = (1.18 \pm 0.57) \times 10^{-7}\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}\,\mathrm{star}^{-1}$. The properties of the detected events are consistent with lenses originating from known stellar populations within the SMC or in the Milky Way disk. No events with timescales longer than 1 yr were detected, which provides competitive limits on the fraction of massive compact objects, including PBHs, in the Milky Way dark matter halo. Together with the earlier OGLE studies of microlensing events in the direction of the Large Magellanic Cloud, these observations rule out PBHs and other compact objects with masses ranging from $10^{-8}$ to $10^3\,M_{\odot}$ as dominant components of dark matter.

 - **Abstract**
 The study of fast variability properties in X-ray binaries advances our understanding of the physical processes and geometric properties of the accretion flow around the compact object. In this work, we study the evolution of the timing properties of Cygnus X-1 with AstroSat/LAXPC, during the transition of the source from the hard to soft state in 2017. We use a novel frequency-segmented technique to fit simultaneously the cross spectra and part of the power spectra and coherence function with a multi-Lorentzian model and predict the phase-lags and the complementary parts of the power spectra and coherence function. We study the evolution of the frequency and power of the main variability components that are present throughout all the states. In particular, we identify previously undetected variability components, one of which manifests as a narrow dip in the coherence function and a broad drop in the phase-lag spectrum at the same frequency. This dip in coherence, which we detected for the first time in Cygnus X-1 at energies above 3 keV, appears in a state in which the source shows high-amplitude radio variability and significant hard X-ray polarization. While the contribution of the compact jet in X-rays is debated in the literature, this study provides a new avenue for investigating jet properties as well as the geometry of the Comptonizing medium.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we investigate the possibility of generating an inflationary mechanism within the framework of a metric-$f(R)$ modified gravity theory, formulated in the Jordan frame. We explore whether the scalar field, non-minimally coupled to gravity and emerging in the Jordan frame, can play the role of the primordial inflaton. Particular attention is devoted to constructing a dynamical scenario in the Jordan frame that exhibits a slow-rolling phase for the scalar field and admits a quasi-de Sitter solution for cosmic evolution. To ensure consistency with the standard cosmological model, we impose a matching condition with the $\Lambda$CDM model at the end of the inflationary phase. Furthermore, to address the problem of the absence of matter after inflation, we consider a radiation-type particle creation process that maintains an approximately constant energy density. We test our theoretical model against background observational data, specifically Pantheon+ calibrated with SH0ES and DESI calibrated with BBN. We asses its viability and discuss implications for alleviating the Hubble constant tension.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent JWST observations detected stellar clumps around the z=1.4 gravitationally lensed Sparkler galaxy (of stellar mass $M_*\sim 10^9\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$), with ages and metallicities compatible with globular clusters (GCs). However, most of their masses ($>10^6\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$) and sizes (>30 pc) are about 10 times those of GCs in the local Universe. To assess whether these clumps can evolve into GCs, we performed N-body simulations of their dynamical evolution from z=1.4 to z=0 (9.23 Gyr), under the effect of dynamical friction and tidal stripping. Dynamical friction is studied performing multiple runs of a clump system in a Sparkler-like spherical halo of mass $M_{200}\simeq 5\times 10^{11}\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ (from the stellar-to-halo mass relation). For the tidal stripping, we simulated resolved clumps, orbiting in an external, static gravitational potential including the same halo as in the dynamical friction simulations and also a Sparkler-like stellar disk. Dynamical friction causes the clumps with mass $>10^7\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ to sink into the galaxy central regions, possibly contributing to the bulge growth. In absence of tidal stripping, the mass distribution of the surviving clumps (40%) peaks at $5\times 10^6\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$, implying the presence of uncommonly over-massive clumps at z=0. Tidal shocks by the stellar disk strip considerable mass from low-mass clumps, even though their sizes remain larger than those of present-day GCs. When the surviving clumps are corrected for tidal stripping, their mass distribution peak shifts to $2\times 10^6\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$, compatible with massive GCs. Our simulations suggest that a fraction of the Sparkler clumps is expected to fall into the central regions, where they might become bulge fossil fragments or contribute to form a nuclear star cluster. The remaining clumps are too large in size to be progenitors of GCs.

 - **Abstract**
 We systematically extend the framework of galaxy bias renormalization to two-loop order. For the minimal complete basis of 29 deterministic bias operators up to fifth order in the density field and at leading order in gradient expansion we explicitly work out one- and two-loop renormalization. The latter is provided in terms of double-hard limits of bias kernels, which we find to depend on only one function of the ratio of the loop momenta. After including stochasticity in terms of composite operator renormalization, we apply the framework to the two-loop power spectrum of biased tracers and provide a simple result suitable for numerical evaluation. In addition, we work out one- and two-loop renormalization group equations (RGE) for deterministic bias coefficients related to bias operators constructed from a smoothed density field, generalizing previous works. We identify a linear combination of bias operators with enhanced UV sensitivity, related to a positive eigenvalue of the RGE. Finally, we present an analogy with the RGE as used in quantum field theory, suggesting that a resummation of large logarithms as employed in the latter may also yield useful applications in the study of large-scale galaxy bias.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) MIRI MRS gas molecular content of an externally irradiated Herbig disk, the F-type XUE 10 source, in the context of the eXtreme UV Environments (XUE) program. XUE 10 belongs to the massive star cluster NGC 6357 (1.69 kpc), where it is exposed to an external far-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation $\approx$ 10$^3$ times stronger than in the Solar neighborhood. We modeled the molecular features in the mid-infrared spectrum with Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) 0D slab models. We derived basic parameters of the stellar host from a VLT FORS2 optical spectrum using PHOENIX stellar templates. We detect bright CO2 gas with the first simultaneous detection (> 5$\sigma$) of four isotopologues (12CO2, 13CO2, 16O12C18O, 16O12C17O) in a protoplanetary disk. We also detect faint CO emission (2$\sigma$) and the HI Pf$\alpha$ line (8$\sigma$). We also place strict upper limits on the water content, finding a total column density $\lesssim$ 10$^{18}$ cm$^{-2}$. The CO2 species trace low gas temperatures (300-370 K) with a range of column densities of 7.4 $\times$ 10$^{17}$ cm$^{-2}$ (16O12C17O)-1.3 $\times$ 10$^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$ (12CO2) in an equivalent emitting radius of 1.15 au. The emission of 13CO2 is likely affected by line optical depth effects. 16O12C18O and 16O12C17O abundances may be isotopically anomalous compared to the 16O/18O and 16O/17O ratios measured in the interstellar medium and the Solar System. We propose that the mid-infrared spectrum of XUE 10 is explained by H2O removal either via advection or strong photo-dissociation by stellar UV irradiation, and enhanced local CO2 gas-phase production. Outer disk truncation supports the observed CO2-H2O dichotomy. A CO2 vapor enrichment in 18O and 17O can be explained by means of external UV irradiation and early on (10$^{4-5}$ yr) delivery of isotopically anomalous water ice to the inner disk.

 - **Abstract**
 Exotic dark matter (EDM) refers to a dark matter species whose equation of state deviates from zero at late times. This behavior enables it to model a variety of non-standard late-time cosmologies, offering alternatives to various dark energy (DE) models, especially when the DE sector violates the null energy condition. In this work, by fitting to CMB, BAO, and Supernovae (SNe) data and comparing models in a Bayesian approach, we show that simple models of exotic dark matter are statistically comparable to the $w_0w_a$CDM DE model in explaining the recent anomaly in the late-time cosmological evolution suggested by DESI and supernova observations, although in both classes of models the evidence against the $\Lambda$CDM model only appears when the DES-Y5 or Union3 SNe dataset is included. The value of $H_0$ remains similar to that in the DE model, except in the no-SNe case, where the DE model predicts lower values than $\Lambda$CDM, thereby worsening the Hubble tension, whereas the EDM models yield values closer to that of $\Lambda$CDM, albeit with larger uncertainty. In addition, the EDM models predict a drastically different energy budget for the present-day universe compared to the standard model, and provide an explanation for a coincident problem in the DE-model explanation of the DESI anomaly.

 - **Abstract**
 The fact that strange sea quarks are abundant in the nucleons, but without strangeness, is of great importance for understanding the nature of dense matter condensed by the strong interaction, particularly in the context of the ``gigantic nucleus'' formed by the gravitational collapse of an evolved massive star. We hypothesize that the basic unit of bulk strong matter with the light-flavor symmetry of valence quarks is ``strangeon'', which is the counterpart of the nucleon found in atomic nuclei. In addition to strangeon stars (SnSs) with large baryon number of $A\approx 10^{57}$, strange nuggets (SnNs) with $A\gtrsim 10^{10}$ could also exist in the Universe. Both the SnS and the SnN are explained, with attention to their observational evidence.

 - **Abstract**
 We present VLT/MUSE observations of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko during its 2021 perihelion passage, from which we generated simultaneous maps of dust, [OI], C$_2$, NH$_2$, and CN comae across 12 pre- and post-perihelion epochs. These maps reveal the evolutionary and compositional trends of 67P's coma and further enrich the context and findings of ESA's Rosetta mission. Dust and gas species displayed distinct structures, where NH$_2$ and CN signals were uniquely associated with known dust fans, raising the question of possible correlation to the dust and contributions of extended sources. Localised fitted NH$_2$ scale lengths were 1.5-1.9$\times$ larger than those fitted for the rest of the coma, which is consistent with an extended source component for northern pre-perihelion emissions. In the southern hemisphere, CN was correlated with a prominent and sharp dust structure, potentially revealing an extended source origin via larger dust particles that preserve the CN parent species, as evidenced by higher spectral slopes in the region. Gas maps depicted two distinct evolutionary regimes: (1) evolving H$_2$O ([OI]$^{1}$D) and C$_2$ emissions driven by nucleus sublimation and subsolar insolation, and (2) stable NH$_2$ and CN emissions associated with seasonal dynamics and possible distributed sources. Dust spectral slope maps revealed spectral slope trends consistent with Rosetta findings, while green/red [OI] ratios generally indicate a coma dominated by H$_2$O.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic voids have emerged as powerful probes for cosmology, providing complementary information on the large-scale structure of the universe. We present the first application of a hydrodynamical framework to model the evolution of cosmic voids. This approach offers a physically intuitive characterization of void dynamics and can naturally be applied to non-standard cosmologies. We derive the cosmology-dependent mapping that relates the linear (Lagrangian) and fully non-linear (Eulerian) evolution of the matter density contrast, a central component for accurate theoretical modeling of void statistics. Furthermore, we present a new method for determining the shell-crossing epoch across arbitrary cosmological backgrounds, thereby extending previous treatments restricted to the Einstein-de Sitter universe. Motivated by recent DESI results hinting at dynamical dark energy, we investigate void evolution in $ w_0w_a$CDM cosmologies by varying $ w_0$ and $w_a$. We also consider the impact of varying the matter density parameter, $ \Omega_{\mathrm{m},0}$. We find that the evolution of isolated, spherically symmetric cosmic voids is most sensitive to $ \Omega_{\mathrm{m},0} $ and $ w_0 $, which can alter the non-linear density contrast by up to 20-30%. Variations in $w_a$ have a smaller impact, but may still lead to measurable effects. We also show that the cosmology-dependent mapping between linear and non-linear density contrasts may provide a sensitive probe of dynamical dark energy in precision void analyses.

 - **Abstract**
 Massive young clusters with rich populations of high-mass stars are ideal laboratories to explore their evolutionary paths. Despite being the most prominent cluster in the Perseus-arm Cas OB8 association, NGC 663 remains comparatively little studied. We present a comprehensive investigation of its properties, integrating astrometric, photometric and spectroscopic data for the cluster and its surroundings, including accurate spectral classification for over 150 members. Gaia astrometry indicates over 300 B-type members, possibly rendering NGC 663 the most massive cluster in the Perseus arm, with initial mass likely exceeding 10000 M_\sun . This large population makes NGC 663 an excellent laboratory for studying massive star evolution. Spectral analysis of the earliest members reveals approximately solar metallicity and a turn-off mass of approximate 8.5 M_\sun, consistent with the photometric age of 23 Ma. We identify five spectroscopic blue stragglers, including the Be/X-ray binary RX J0146.9$+$6121. We outline its evolutionary history and compare its properties with other Be stars. Although the cluster contains many Be stars, their relative fraction is not particularly high. Intriguingly, four of the six blue supergiant members appear to have significantly higher masses than the brightest giants near the Hertzsprung gap. These observations suggest that most mid-B supergiants may form via mergers, unless stars of 10-12 M_\sun born as primaries in binaries rarely undergo supernova explosions. Similarly, if Be stars form through the binary channel, then either most are produced through case A evolution or supernovae are uncommon among primaries in this mass range.

 We present an updated atlas of spectra from the Low-Resolution Spectrometer (LRS) on the Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS), which took spectra from 7.67 to 22.73 um with a spectral resolving power (lambda / Delta lambda) of 20-60. The updated atlas includes 11,238 spectra, including 5425 spectra published in the original LRS Atlas, 5796 spectra published in three later papers, and 17 spectra previously available online but not published. The updated atlas has significantly more sources close to the Galactic plane than the original atlas. We have applied an improved spectral correction to remove an artifact at 8 um in the original database. While the IRAS mission flew over 40 yr ago, the extended LRS atlas remains the single most complete database of mid-infrared spectra of nearby and bright objects in the Galaxy.

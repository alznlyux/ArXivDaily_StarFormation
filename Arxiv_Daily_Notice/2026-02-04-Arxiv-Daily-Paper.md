- **Abstract**
 Measuring stellar motions at the Milky Way's Galactic center (GC) provides unique insight into the dynamical processes within galactic nuclei. We present proper motion measurements for 23 SiO-maser emitting stars within 45'' of SgrA*, including four previously reported to have velocities exceeding their local escape velocities (i.e., they are "locally unbound" from the GC). Derived from 14 epochs of HST WFC3-IR observations (2010 - 2023), our measurements have a median precision of 0.038 mas/yr - up to ~100x more precise then previous constraints for some sources. By combining these proper motions with published radial velocities, we derive updated 3D velocities for the masers and find that only one is locally unbound (IRS 9; v3d = 370 +/- 1.2 km/s). Orbit integrations place the first constraints on the orbit of IRS 9, which is bound to the GC at larger radii with r_peri >= 0.100 +/- 0.005 pc and r_apo >= 5.25 +/- 0.18 pc. IRS 9's high velocity relative to stars at similar radii in the Nuclear Star Cluster makes it a candidate to have experienced a strong dynamical interaction in order to place it on its orbit. We explore the Hills mechanism as a possible origin, but binary evaporation and ejection velocity limits indicate that IRS 9 is unlikely to have experienced such an event in the past 0.4 Myr (the timescale constrained by the orbit integrations). Alternative mechanisms that could produce IRS 9 include binary supernova disruption, two-body interactions, and stellar collisions. Identifying additional stars like IRS 9 will be essential for understanding these various dynamical processes.

- **Abstract**
 We present four newly validated transiting brown dwarfs identified through TESS photometry and confirmed with high-precision radial velocity measurements obtained from the FEROS and PLATOSpec spectrographs. Notably, three of these companions exhibit orbital periods exceeding 100 days, thereby expanding the sample of long-period transiting brown dwarfs from two to five systems. The host stars of long-period brown dwarfs show mild subsolar metallicity. These discoveries highlight the expansion of the metal-poor, long-period distribution and help us better understand the brown dwarf desert. In our comparative analysis of eccentricity and metallicity demographics, we utilize catalogues of long-period giant planets, brown dwarfs, and low-mass stellar companions. After accounting for tidal influences, the eccentricity distribution aligns with that of low-mass stellar binaries, presenting a different profile than that observed within the giant planet population. Additionally, the metallicity of the host stars reveals a noteworthy trend: short-period transiting brown dwarfs are predominantly associated with metal-rich stars, whereas long-period brown dwarfs are more often found around metal-poor stars, demonstrating statistical similarities to low-mass stellar hosts. This trend has also been previously observed in studies of hot and cold Jupiters and points to a period-coded mixture of channels. A natural explanation is that most brown dwarfs originate from fragmentation at wider separations, with long-period systems retaining this stellar-like imprint, while only those embedded in massive, long-lived, metal-rich protoplanetary discs are efficiently delivered and stabilised to short orbits.

- **Abstract**
 The Ca ii 854.2 nm line is widely used to study the chromosphere of the Sun. In the quiet Sun, the spatially averaged line profile shows a red asymmetry and a redshift of the line center. It is known that the effect of isotopic splitting must be taken into account in the forward modeling to reproduce the observed asymmetry. So far, no numerical model could match an average observed line profile in terms of the line width and asymmetry. Our goal is to investigate how well a simulation computed with the chromospheric extension of the MURaM code (MURaM-ChE) reproduces the spatially averaged Ca ii 854.2 nm line profile. We aim to determine the contributions from the isotopic splitting versus the dynamics in the atmosphere to the resulting line width and asymmetry. We solve the radiative transfer problem three times, once considering only the most abundant isotope of calcium in the atmosphere, once taking six calcium isotopes into account, and finally using a single composite atom model. We find the forward modeled spatially and temporally averaged spectra to be in good agreement with an average observation of the quiet Sun. In order to match the observed line width, the simulated atmosphere must be sufficiently dynamic. The typical red asymmetry can only be reproduced by taking the isotopic splitting effect into account, as suggested in the literature.

- **Abstract**
 The surface-brightness-color (SBC) relationship for Red Clump stars provides a critical foundation for precision distance ladder measurements, including the 1\% distance determination to the Large Magellanic Cloud. Current SBC calibrations rely on angular diameter measurements of nearby Red Clump stars obtained through long-baseline optical interferometry using the Very Large Telescope Interferometer. We explore the application of intensity interferometry to measure limb-darkened angular diameters of Red Clump stars, offering a complementary approach to traditional amplitude interferometry. We describe the framework for extracting angular diameters from squared visibility measurements in intensity interferometry, accounting for limb darkening through the stellar atmosphere models. For the Red Clump star HD~17652, we show that intensity interferometry in the $H$ band at baselines matching PIONIER ($\sim$100~m) could achieve $<1$\% angular size uncertainties in 2-hour exposures by measuring the primary peak of the visibility function, enabling direct comparison with existing measurements. Critically, observations at shorter wavelengths probe the secondary visibility maximum, providing independent checks of both measurement and systematic errors that are largely insensitive to limb-darkening assumptions. Exploiting the multiplex advantage of simultaneous multi-bandpass observations and the large number of baselines available with telescope arrays such as the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory can reduce observing times to practical levels, making intensity interferometry a viable tool for validating the angular sizes for a subset of the Red Clump star calibration sample.

- **Abstract**
 We combine Gaia Data Release 3 and artificial intelligence to enhance the current statistics of substellar companions, particularly within regions of the orbital period vs. mass parameter space that remain poorly constrained by the radial velocity and transit detection methods. Using supervised learning, we train a deep neural network to recognise the characteristic distribution of the fit quality statistics corresponding to a Gaia DR3 astrometric solution for a non single star. We generate a deep learning model, ExoDNN, which predicts the probability of a DR3 source to host unresolved companions based on those fit quality statistics. Applying the predictive capability of ExoDNN to a volume limited sample of F,G,K and M stars from Gaia DR3, we have produced a list of 7414 candidate stars hosting companions. The stellar properties of these candidates, such as their mass and metallicity, are similar to those of the Gaia DR3 non single star sample. We also identify synergies with future observatories, such as PLATO, and we propose a follow up strategy with the intention of investigating the most promising candidates among those samples.

- **Abstract**
 The outer Galaxy (galactocentric distance $\gtrsim$13.5 kpc) serves as an excellent laboratory for investigating the chemical complexity in low-metallicity environments. Here, we present the chemical analyses for the outer Galactic hot core Sh 2-283-1a SMM1 ($D_\mathrm{GC}$ = 15.7 kpc and $Z$ $\sim$0.3 $Z_\odot$), recently detected by Ikeda et al. (2025) using ALMA. Toward this source, a variety of molecular species, including complex organic molecules (COMs: CH$_3$OH, $^{13}$CH$_3$OH, CH$_2$DOH, and CH$_3$OCH$_3$) are detected. The molecular abundances relative to CH$_3$OH are similar to those of another outer Galactic hot core, demonstrating that chemically rich hot cores exist in different regions of the outer Galaxy. We also compared molecular abundances among hot cores in the inner Galaxy, outer Galaxy, and Magellanic Clouds. This comparison revealed that the metallicity-corrected $N$(SO$_2$)/$N$(H$_2$) ratios of outer Galactic hot cores are significantly lower than those of the inner Galactic ones, while their $N$(CH$_3$OH)/$N$(H$_2$) ratios are similar. The Magellanic hot cores show different trends despite having metallicities similar to those of the outer Galaxy, indicating that the chemical complexity of hot cores is governed by environmental conditions (e.g., cosmic ray intensity and dust temperature) rather than simple metallicity scaling. These environmental differences would also affect the production efficiency of COMs derived from CH$_3$OH, as the $N$(CH$_3$OCH$_3$)/$N$(CH$_3$OH) and $N$(C$_2$H$_5$OH)/$N$(CH$_3$OH) ratios in the outer Galactic sources are moderately lower than those of inner Galactic sources. The $N$(CH$_2$DOH)/$N$(CH$_3$OH) ratio of Sh 2-283-1a SMM1 is 1.5$^{+3.9}_{-1.2}$$\%$, comparable to that of inner Galactic high-mass sources.

          Periodic 6.7 GHz $\mathrm{CH_3OH}$ maser emission in G353.273+0.641: First candidate for a pulsating high-mass protostar

- **Abstract**
 We report on the periodic flux variations in the 6.7 GHz $\mathrm{CH_3OH}$ maser associated with the high-mass protostar G353.273+0.641, based on 13 yr of monitoring mainly by the Hitachi 32 m telescope. We identified a periodicity of 309 days based on a nearly complete light curve, with 833 epochs every few days. A strong correlation is found between the maser and the mid-infrared fluxes at 3.4 and 4.6 $\mu$m observed by NEOWISE during these periods, suggesting that the maser emission responds to variations in the protostellar luminosity. The average profile of the maser light curve is asymmetric and shows a steep drop in intensity just before the brightening, resembling that of some pulsating variable stars. Assuming a protostellar pulsation as the origin of maser periodicity, the observed period implies a cool and highly bloated, red supergiant-like structure. Such a bloated structure is consistent with a theoretical model of protostellar evolution under high accretion rates. The inferred protostellar parameters are broadly consistent with the theoretical model of pulsational instability during the early phase of high-mass star formation. However, a periodic accretion scenario caused by an unresolved compact protobinary cannot be completely ruled out. Several irregular peaks that deviate from the periodicity may result from episodic accretion phenomena or jet-launching events independent of the protostellar pulsation. Extremely high-resolution imaging with next-generation interferometers such as the ngVLA will provide a conclusive test for both the protostellar pulsation and the binary accretion scenarios.

- **Abstract**
 Circumstellar discs, and especially their inner regions, covering ranges from <1 au to a few astronomical units, are the birthplaces of terrestrial planets. The inner regions are thought to be similarly diverse in structure as the well-observed outer regions probed by ALMA. Combining data and results from previous studies of the VLTI/PIONIER and VLTI/GRAVITY instruments with new, multi-epoch VLTI/MATISSE observations, we aim to provide a comprehensive picture of the structure of the inner regions of the circumstellar disc around the F-type Herbig Ae/Be star HD 142527 A, the primary of a binary star system. We model the multi-wavelength interferometric data using a parametrised, geometrically thin disc model, allowing for azimuthal asymmetry, exploring a first-order disc modulation and an off-centre Gaussian component. We find time-variable structures in the N-band observables, which we reproduce with time-dependent models. This variability manifests as azimuthally asymmetric emission, evidenced by strong, non-zero closure phases in the N-band data. Fits to individual epochs of the N-band observations yield better $\chi^2_\text{r}$ values than fits to all epochs simultaneously. This suggests substantial changes in the geometry of the inner disc emission from ~1 au up to a few astronomical-unit scales from one year to the next. Moreover, our models produce a very close-in inner disc rim $R_\text{rim}\approx0.1$ au. All together, we find a very complex, substantially non-point symmetric and temporally-variable disc ($r_\text{out}\lesssim6$ au) around the primary. The very close-in inner rim indicates the presence of material inside the typical wall-like sublimation radius $R_\text{rim,literature}\approx0.3$ au. The complex, temporally variable inner-disc geometry is likely affected or even caused by the close passing (~5 au) and short orbit ($P\approx24$ yr) of the companion HD 142527 B.

- **Abstract**
 Recent theoretical and observational analysis of the interaction between the Milky Way (MW) and LMC suggest that it has a significant dynamical impact on the MW's stellar halo. We investigate this effect using simulations from the Latte project, a simulation suite from the Feedback In Realistic Environments 2 (FIRE-2) Project. By comparing simulations with and without an LMC-analog interaction, we show that fully cosmological LMC interactions create prominent velocity asymmetry in the stellar halo of the MW, resulting from both barycentric displacement (the "reflex motion") and the dynamical wake of the LMC. The strength and direction of this asymmetry depend on the mass ratio at pericenter and orbit of the LMC analog. We perform a spherical-harmonic decomposition of the velocities of halo star particles to confirm that the identified signatures are LMC-induced and persist even when LMC star particles are removed. We also show that this strategy separates and individually detects the dipole (l=1) of the global reflex motion and the quadrupole (l=2) of the local wake. These asymmetries are consistent with those identified in previous work using non-cosmological simulations; the dipole is easily distinguishable from other complex halo substructure using spherical harmonics while the quadrupole is sometimes confused. These findings support the detectability of MW--LMC interaction signatures in upcoming observational surveys of the MW stellar halo.

- **Abstract**
 The present work aims at analyzing the nature of millimeter (mm) emission observed during the post-impulsive phase of the solar flare SOL2022-05-04T08:45 (M5.7), detected by the RT-7.5 radio telescope of the Bauman Moscow State Technical University at 93 GHz. We investigate the relationship of mm and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) emission with variations in the temperature and coronal plasma emission measure obtained from SDO/AIA and GOES data. The results show that the enhanced mm emission at the post-impulsive phase of the flare coincides with the increase of EUV emission, indicating a connection with moderately hot (~1 MK) plasma. Based on the calculation of the differential emission measure, we determine the parameters of the post-impulsive flare plasma and conclude that the optically thin coronal plasma may contribute of about 20% to the mm emission.

- **Abstract**
 Deuterium fractionation is highly efficient during the early stages of star formation, particularly in starless and prestellar cores where temperatures are low (<10 K) and molecular freeze-out onto dust grains is significant. Methanol forms early in these environments following CO freeze-out via successive hydrogenation reactions on grain surfaces, while the production of deuterated methanol requires elevated gas-phase D/H ratios generated through dissociative recombination of deuterated H3+. Consequently, large abundances of deuterated methanol are observed toward young stellar objects where prestellar ices have recently sublimated. Here, we present laboratory infrared spectra of methanol and its deuterated isotopologues in astrophysical ice analogues, complemented by anharmonic vibrational calculations used to guide band assignments. Experiments were performed at the CASICE laboratory using a Bruker Vertex 70v spectrometer coupled to a closed-cycle helium cryostat, with isotopologue ices deposited at 10 K under high-vacuum conditions. Infrared transmission spectra were recorded over 6000-30 cm-1 (1.67-333 um) and compared with spectra of pure isotopologue ices. Distinctive mid-infrared band patterns are identified for each deuterated species. In particular, CH2DOH exhibits a characteristic doublet at 1293 and 1326 cm-1 (7.73 and 7.54 um), while CHD2OH shows a similar doublet at 1301 and 1329 cm-1 (7.69 and 7.52 um), both remaining largely invariant across all studied ice mixtures. These robust spectral signatures provide reliable tracers for identifying deuterated methanol in JWST observations and for constraining astrochemical gas-grain models of deuterium enrichment prior to star and planet formation.

- **Abstract**
 The most productive tracer of exoplanetary atmospheric escape is the measurement of excess absorption in the near-infrared metastable helium triplet during transits. Atmospheric escape of a close-in planet's atmosphere plays a role in its evolutionary pathway, but to which extent remains unknown. It could explain demographic features like the radius valley and Neptunian desert. We will describe the development of instrumental, reduction, and modelling techniques to study exoplanetary atmospheric escape, focusing on the helium triplet. One such development is the NIGHT spectrograph, intended to provide the first survey of escaping atmospheres. NIGHT spectra will be processed with ANTARESS, a state-of-the-art workflow for reducing high-resolution spectral time-series of exoplanet transits and computing transmission spectra in a robust and reproducible way. Transmission spectra contain the potential signature of the planetary atmosphere as well as distortions induced by the occultation of local regions of the stellar surface along the transit chord. Transmission spectra cannot be corrected for those stellar distortions without biasing the planetary signal. They must instead be directly interpreted using a numerical model like the EvE code, which generates realistic stellar spectra that account for the system's 3D architecture, the planet's atmospheric structure, and its local occultation of the stellar disc. This global approach, from the measurement and computation of transmission spectra to their interpretation, will be a legacy of the NCCR PlanetS, becoming the standard procedure to study high-resolution spectroscopy of planetary transits.

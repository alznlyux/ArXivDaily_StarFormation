 - **Abstract**
 Massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) are a natural outcome of galaxy mergers, and they are expected to be among the loudest gravitational wave sources at low frequencies. SDSS J2320+0024 has been recently proposed as a promising MBHB candidate due to a possible periodicity in its light-curve and variability in the MgII emission line. In this work, we re-analyse the optical (g and r bands) light-curves of J2320+0024 within the framework of Bayesian model selection. When a periodicity is searched for together with red noise, the analysis of the g-band light-curve finds a peak in the posterior of the period at ~290 days. The posterior profile is too broad to result in a preference for the periodic models with respect to models including only red-noise. Furthermore, the same peak is not present in the analysis of the r-band light-curve. A periodic model without red-noise identifies a different (~1100 days) periodicity, and it is significantly statistically disfavoured with respect to the other tested models. In summary, no significant evidence in favour of a true periodic signal over red noise variability is found. Our analysis questions the robustness of the previously claimed periodicity and emphasizes the importance of rigorous statistical treatment. While our findings challenge the binary interpretation for J2320+0024, they do not rule it out. A statistically robust joint analysis of the photometric light-curves and of the evolving broad line profiles can shed further light on the real nature of this object.

 - **Abstract**
 Extensive ground and space based surveys have now characterized the properties of thousands of exoplanets; their radii, masses, orbits around their host stars, and the beginnings of accurate measurements of the chemical compositions of their atmospheres and cores. How are these properties linked to their formation in physically and chemically evolving protoplanetary disks wherein they accrete pebbles, planetesimals, and gas as they undergo migration? To address this challenge, our review assembles a large and varied body of exoplanet observations as well as recent Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) and James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations of disk structure, chemistry, kinematics, and winds. The latest advances in theory and MHD simulations that bear on these issues are also reviewed and compared with the observations. Taken together, this review argues that a new dynamic paradigm for planet formation is emerging wherein MHD disk winds and not disk turbulence play a central role in disk evolution and planet formation including: angular momentum transport, gap and ring formation. disk astrochemistry, and planet formation and migration. These processes leave their mark on the resulting atmospheric composition, radii, and orbital characteristics of exoplanet populations, offering the possibility of future observational tests.

 - **Abstract**
 Circumbinary gas disks that are misaligned to the binary orbital plane evolve toward either a coplanar or a polar-aligned configuration with respect to the binary host. The preferred alignment depends on the dynamics of the disk: whether it undergoes librating or circulating nodal precession, with librating disks evolving to polar inclinations and circulating disks evolving to coplanar. We quantify the fraction of binary star systems whose disks are expected to have polar orbits $f_\text{polar}$, extending previous work to include disks with non-zero mass. Our results suggest that, for low mass disks, the polar fraction is highly sensitive to the distribution of binary eccentricity with a higher fraction expected for higher binary eccentricities, $f_{\rm polar}\sim e_{\rm b}$. However, for massive discs, the fraction is independent of the binary eccentricity and $f_{\rm polar}\approx 0.37$. The value of $f_\text{polar}$ is always reduced in a population with a greater preference for low initial mutual inclination. We also explore the consequences of the finite lifetime and non-zero radial extent of a real disk, both of which affect a disk's ability to complete its evolution to a stationary configuration. Our findings can be used to make predictions given populations with well-understood distributions of binary eccentricity, initial mutual inclination, and disk angular momentum.

          The Co-Evolution of Stellar Wind-blown Bubbles and Photoionized Gas I: Physical Principles and a Semi-Analytic Model

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a new framework for the simultaneous feedback of stellar winds and photo-ionizing radiation from massive stars, distinguishing the locations where forces are applied, and consequences for internal spatio-temporal evolution of the whole feedback bubble (FB). We quantify the relative dynamical importance of wind-blown bubbles (WBB) versus the photoionized region (PIR) by the ratio of the radius at which the WBB is in pressure equilibrium with the PIR, $R_{\rm eq}$, to the Strömgren radius, $R_{\rm St}$. $\zeta \equiv R_{\rm eq}/R_{\rm St}$ quantifies the dynamical dominance of WBBs ($\zeta > 1$) or the PIR ($\zeta < 1$). We calculate $\zeta$ and find that, for momentum-driven winds, $0.1 \lesssim \zeta \lesssim 1$ for the star-forming regions in (i) typical Milky Way-like giant molecular clouds (GMCs), (ii) the most massive of individual OB stars, and (iii) dense, low-metallicity environments, relevant in the early universe. In this regime, both WBBs and the PIR are dynamically important to the expansion of the FB. We develop a semi-analytic Co-Evolution Model (CEM) that takes into account the spatial distribution of forces and the back reactions of both the WBB and PIR. In the $\zeta <1$ regime where the CEM is most relevant, the model differs in the total FB momentum by up to 25% compared to naive predictions. In the weak-wind limit of $\zeta \ll 1$, applicable to individual OB stars or low-mass clusters, the CEM has factors $\gtrsim 2$ differences in WBB properties. In a companion paper we compare these models to three-dimensional, turbulent hydro-dynamical simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 We explore a theoretical framework in which Lorentz symmetry is explicitly broken by incorporating derivative terms of the extrinsic curvature into the gravitational action. These modifications introduce a scale-dependent damping effect in the propagation of gravitational waves (GWs), governed by a characteristic energy scale denoted as $M_{LV}$ . We derive the modified spectral energy density of GWs within this model and confront it with recent observational data from the NANOGrav 15-year dataset and the second data release of the International Pulsar Timing Array (IPTA). Our analysis yields a lower bound on the Lorentz-violating energy scale, finding $M_{LV} > 10^{-19}$ GeV at 68\% confidence level. This result significantly improves upon previous constraints derived from LIGO/VIRGO binary merger observations. Our findings demonstrate the potential of pulsar timing arrays to probe fundamental symmetries of spacetime and offer new insights into possible extensions of general relativity.

 - **Abstract**
 Even when used to describe the same phenomenon, equations, graphics and words each give different perspectives and lead to complementary insights. The basic elements of strong gravitational lensing are introduced here favoring words and graphics over equations whenever possible. Fermat's principle is the fundamental driver of strong lensing. Three "D's'' encapsulate the essential effects of lensing: Delay, Deflection and Distortion. Gravity and geometry both contribute to the delay of photons from a lensed source. Their interplay determines how the images of a source are deflected and how they are stretched or compressed. Caustics and critical curves are explained. Images of doubly, triply, quadruply and quintuply lensed sources are displayed. A table of symbols, their definitions and distinctions provides a summary of the basic elements of strong lensing.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational wave (GW) observations have significantly advanced our understanding of binary compact object (BCO) formation, yet directly linking these observations to specific formation scenarios remains challenging. The BCO phase space provides a robust and data-driven approach to discover the likely formation scenarios of these binaries. In this study, we expand the previously introduced binary black hole phase-space technique to encompass low-mass compact objects (LMCOs), establishing a novel framework to investigate their diverse formation mechanisms. Applying this approach to selected low-mass events $(\lesssim 5 M_\odot)$ from the GWTC-3 catalog and the recently observed GW230529 event, we show for the first time the phase-space demonstration of the LMCOs and find the associated probabilities for different formation scenarios including neutron stars, astrophysical black holes, or primordial black holes. Our analysis includes the astrophysical modelling uncertainties in and how it causes degeneracy between different formation scenarios. In future, with improvements in GW detector sensitivity and with detection of more GW events, the LMCO phase-space framework will significantly strengthen our capacity to associate more likely formation scenarios over the other, thereby refining our understanding of compact object formation for both astrophysical and primordial scenarios, and its evolution across the cosmic redshift.

 - **Abstract**
 The stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) in the nanohertz (nHz) regime, detectable by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs), offers a promising avenue to probe the cosmic population of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs). These SMBHBs are expected to retain substantial eccentricity throughout their evolution due to their formation history. In this study, we propose a new modeling scenario of the nHz SGWB by incorporating the eccentricity of SMBHBs into a multi-scale adaptive simulation-based framework. We employ a time-domain eccentric waveform model, \esigmahm{}, to generate realistic gravitational wave (GW) signals from an astrophysical population of SMBHB, including physical effects from sub-parsec scales to Gpc scales. The eccentric inspiraling binary, unlike circular binaries, emits GW signal in multiple frequencies. As a consequence, the SGWB energy density in each frequency bin is not independent; instead, the presence of eccentricity introduces a spectral correlation between different frequencies. We show that these spectral correlations are absent for circular binaries but become increasingly significant for populations with higher eccentricities. Our novel approach can capture this effect and opens up the window towards measuring this with a high signal-to-noise ratio with future observations. This work develops the frontier of nHz signal modeling using eccentricity at small scales and can model realistic nHz signal, which will be essential for robust inference from future observations to shed light on the astrophysical properties of SMBHBs.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we present Fisher forecasts on non-thermal LiMR models for the upcoming CMB Stage IV experiment -- particularly focusing on a model of inflaton/moduli decay giving rise to non-thermally distributed dark sector particles, and also comparing our results with those for sterile particles following the Dodelson-Widrow distribution. Two independent parameters, the effective number of extra relativistic species $\Delta N_\mathrm{eff}$ and the effective mass $M_\mathrm{sp}^\mathrm{eff}$ of the relic, influence linear cosmological observables. We find $\Delta N_\mathrm{eff}$ to be more tightly constrained with $\sigma(\Delta N_\mathrm{eff})\sim10^{-3}$, for a less abundant, heavier LiMR which becomes fully non-relativistic around matter-radiation equality than a more abundant, lighter LiMR which becomes fully non-relativistic just after recombination, for which $\sigma(\Delta N_\mathrm{eff})\sim10^{-2}$. The uncertainties on $M_\mathrm{sp}^\mathrm{eff}$ differ by a factor of $\sim3$ between the two cases. Our analysis also reveals distinct parameter correlations: the phenomenological parameters $\{\Delta N_\mathrm{eff}, M_\mathrm{sp}^\mathrm{eff}\}$ are found to be negatively correlated for the former case and positively correlated for the latter. We obtain similar constraints on the cosmological parameters (in either case) for both the inflaton/moduli decay and the Dodelson-Widrow models when the first two moments of the LiMR distribution function, related to the phenomenological parameters, are matched. Finally, by constructing a modified distribution that matches the first two moments of the Dodelson-Widrow but deviates maximally in the third moment, we demonstrate that CMB Stage IV data is not expected to be sensitive to higher moments of the distribution.

          Origin of compact exoplanetary systems during disk infall

 - **Abstract**
 Exoplanetary systems that contain multiple planets on short-period orbits appear to be prevalent in the current observed exoplanetary population, yet the processes that give rise to such configurations remain poorly understood. A common prior assumption is that planetary accretion commences after the infall of gas and solids to the circumstellar disk ended. However, observational evidence indicates that accretion may begin earlier. We propose that compact systems are surviving remnants of planet accretion that occurred during the final phases of infall. In regions of the disk experiencing ongoing infall, the planetary mass is set by the balance between accretion of infalling solids and the increasingly rapid inward migration driven by the surrounding gas as the planet grows. This balance selects for similarly-sized planets whose mass is a function of infall and disk conditions. We show that infall-produced planets can survive until the gas disk disperses and migration ends, and that across a broad range of conditions, the mass of surviving systems is regulated to a few 10^{-5} to 10^{-4} times the host star's mass. This provides an explanation for the similar mass ratios of known compact systems.

 - **Abstract**
 The search for extraterrestrial life in the Solar System and beyond is a key science driver in astrobiology, planetary science, and astrophysics. A critical step is the identification and characterization of potential habitats, both to guide the search and to interpret its results. However, a well-accepted, self-consistent, flexible, and quantitative terminology and method of assessment of habitability are lacking. Our paper fills this gap based on a three year-long study by the NExSS Quantitative Habitability Science Working Group. We reviewed past studies of habitability, but find that the lack of a universally valid definition of life prohibits a universally applicable definition of habitability. A more nuanced approach is needed. We introduce a quantitative habitability assessment framework (QHF) that enables self-consistent, probabilistic assessment of the compatibility of two models: First, a habitat model, which describes the probability distributions of key conditions in the habitat. Second, a viability model, which describes the probability that a metabolism is viable given a set of environmental conditions. We provide an open-source implementation of this framework and four examples as a proof of concept: (a) Comparison of two exoplanets for observational target prioritization; (b) Interpretation of atmospheric O2 detection in two exoplanets; (c) Subsurface habitability of Mars; and (d) Ocean habitability in Europa. These examples demonstrate that our framework can self-consistently inform astrobiology research over a broad range of questions. The proposed framework is modular so that future work can expand the range and complexity of models available, both for habitats and for metabolisms.

          Effect of positronium on the $γ$-ray spectra and energy deposition in Type Ia supernovae

 - **Abstract**
 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are powered by the radioactive decay of isotopes such as $^{56}$Ni and $^{56}$Co, making their $\gamma$-ray spectra useful probes of the explosion mechanism and ejecta structure. Accurate interpretation of $\gamma$-ray observables, including line ratios and continuum fluxes, requires a detailed understanding of the microphysical processes that shape the spectra. One such process is positronium formation during electron-positron annihilation, which can redistribute flux from the 511 keV line into the surrounding continuum. To assess the impact of positronium on the emergent spectra, we developed a new open-source module TARDIS-HE, for time-dependent three-dimensional $\gamma$-ray transport, integrated into the radiative transfer code TARDIS. The code simulates $\gamma$-ray spectra and light curves from one-dimensional supernova ejecta models and allows for flexible incorporation of decay chains and opacity treatments. Using TARDIS-HE, we explore the effect of positronium formation by varying the positronium fraction from 0 % to 100 %, and assuming an extreme case where 75 % of positronium decays result in three-photon emission. We find that full positronium formation can reduce the 511 keV line flux by approximately 70 % and modestly enhance energy deposition by up to 2 % at around 100 days post-explosion, compared to models without positronium. These results demonstrate that while the effect is not dominant, positronium formation introduces measurable changes to $\gamma$-ray observables. Future observations with missions such as the Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI) may offer constraints on positronium formation in SNe Ia and help refine models of their radioactive energy transport.

          The Narrow Formation Pathway of Hot Saturns: Constraints on Initial Planetary Properties

 - **Abstract**
 The observed exoplanet population exhibits a scarcity of short-period Saturn-mass planets, a phenomenon referred to as the ``hot Saturn desert". This observational scarcity can be utilized to validate the theories regarding the formation and evolution of gas planets. In this study, we conduct large-scale numerical simulations to explore how the initial conditions of gas planets orbiting solar-type and M-dwarf stars influence their evolutionary trajectories in the semi-major axis versus planetary radius ($a$-$R$) parameter space. We generate a synthetic population of 10,000 short-period gaseous planets by systematically varying their initial planetary masses ($M_{\rm p}$), initial planetary luminosities ($L_{\rm p}$), initial core mass fractions ($f_{\rm core}$), and semi-major axis ($a$). Furthermore, we assume these gaseous planets have ceased orbital migration and model their long-term thermal evolution, taking into account the impacts of atmospheric evaporation. Our results show that the initial mass, $L_{\rm p}$, and $f_{\rm core}$ are the dominant factors controlling radius evolution for short-period gas planets. The key to survival as a hot Saturn analogue appears to be having just the right combination of properties after gas disk dissipation: an $M_{\rm p}$ below 0.5 Jupiter Mass ($M_{\rm Jup}$), a substantial $f_{\rm core}$ of $\geq$ 30%, and relatively low $L_{\rm p}$ on the order of $10^{-6}$ solar luminosity ($L_{\odot}$) or less. The survival criteria for hot Saturn analogs align with theoretically unfavorable initial conditions of gas planets formed via core accretion scenario, naturally explaining the observed boundaries of the hot Saturn desert.

 - **Abstract**
 Binary systems consisting of an early type star and a black hole (BH) are crucial for understanding various astrophysical phenomena, particularly the origins of detected gravitational wave sources. Be binary systems are expected to represent a key evolutionary stage in hosting BHs. However, while hundreds of Be X-ray binaries are known, the only confirmed BH candidate in a Be binary remains highly controversial. We report the discovery of ALS 8814, a Be star-BH binary with a moderately eccentric ($e = 0.23$) and wide orbit ($P = 176.6$ days), revealed by the radial velocity (RV) measurement of the visible Be star. Our analysis, combining flux-calibrated spectra in the Balmer discontinuity region and spectral template matching, yields a mass of $11.2^{+1.4}_{-1.2}$ $M_\odot$ for the Be star. The minimum mass of the unseen companion, assuming an edge-on inclination ($i = 90^{\circ}$), is $9.8\pm 0.7\,M_\odot$. We rule out the presence of non-degenerate companions in ALS 8814, indicating that it can only be a BH. This discovery represents a robust case of a Be-BH binary, identified purely through precise RV measurements from a single set of lines. The extremely low peculiar velocity of ALS 8814 suggests that the BH is formed via a direct core-collapse with a negligible natal kick, implying an almost perfect alignment between the Be star's spin and the orbital plane. In this context, the binary's inclination angle is estimated to be 22$^{\circ}$-49$^{\circ}$ by analyzing the shallow double-peaked profile of the H$\alpha$ emission line. This inclination range corresponds to a BH mass estimate between $15\,M_\odot$ and $58\,M_\odot$. As the only unambiguous Be-BH binary system known to date, ALS 8814 provides valuable constraints on the BH formation in a binary system with a high-mass companion.

 - **Abstract**
 Using the IRAM 30 m telescope, we presented observations of N2H+ J = 1-0, CCS JN = 87-76 and 77-66 lines toward a large sample of ultracompact HII regions (UC HIIs). Among our 88 UC HIIs, 87 and 33 sources were detected in the N2H+ J = 1-0 and CCS JN = 87-76 lines, respectively. For the CCS 77-66 transition, we detected emission in 10 out of 82 targeted sources, all of which also exhibited emission in the CCS JN = 87-76 line. Physical parameters are derived for our detections, including the optical depth and excitation temperature of N2H+, the rotational temperature of CCS and the column density. Combining our results and previous observation results in different stages of high-mass star-forming regions (HMSFRs), we found that the column density ratio N(N2H+)/N(CCS) increases from high-mass starless cores (HMSCs) through high-mass protostellar cores (HMPOs) to UC HIIs. This implies that N(N2H+)/N(CCS) can trace the evolution process of HMSFRs. It was supported by our gas-grain chemical model, which shows that N(N2H+)/N(CCS) increases with the evolution age of HMSFRs. The temperature, density and chemical age were also constrained from our best-fit model at each stage. Thus, we propose N(N2H+)/N(CCS) as a reliable chemical clock of HMSFRs.

 Identifying key observables is essential for enhancing our knowledge of exoplanet habitability and biospheres, as well as improving future mission capabilities. While currently challenging, future observatories such as the Large Interferometer for Exoplanets (LIFE) will enable atmospheric observations of a diverse sample of temperate terrestrial worlds. Using thermal emission spectra that represent conventional predictions of atmospheric CO2 variability across the Habitable Zone (HZ), we assess the ability of the LIFE mission - as a specific concept for a future space-based interferometer - to detect CO2 trends indicative of the carbonate-silicate (Cb-Si) weathering feedback, a well-known habitability marker and potential biological tracer. Therefore, we explore the feasibility of differentiating between CO2 trends in biotic and abiotic planet populations. We create synthetic exoplanet populations based on geochemistry-climate predictions and perform retrievals on simulated thermal emission observations. The results demonstrate the robust detection of population-level CO2 trends in both biotic and abiotic scenarios for population sizes as small as 30 Exo-Earth Candidates (EECs) and the lowest assessed spectrum quality in terms of signal-to-noise ratio, S/N = 10, and spectral resolution, R = 50. However, biased CO2 partial pressure constraints hinder accurate differentiation between biotic and abiotic trends. If these biases were corrected, accurate differentiation could be achieved for populations with $\geq$ 100 EECs. We conclude that LIFE can effectively enable population-level characterization of temperate terrestrial atmospheres and detect Cb-Si cycle driven CO2 trends as habitability indicators. Nevertheless, the identified biases underscore the importance of testing atmospheric characterization performance against the broad diversity expected for planetary populations.

          Is Ozone a Reliable Proxy for Molecular Oxygen? II. The impact of N$_2$O on the O$_2$-O$_3$ relationship for Earth-like atmospheres

 - **Abstract**
 Molecular oxygen (O2) will be an important molecule in the search for biosignatures in terrestrial planetary atmospheres in the coming decades. In particular, O2 combined with a reducing gas is thought to be strong evidence for disequilibrium caused by surface life. However, there are circumstances where it would be very difficult or impossible to detect O2, in which cases it has been suggested that ozone (O3), the photochemical product of O2, could be used instead. Unfortunately, the O2-O3 relationship is highly nonlinear and dependent on the host star, as shown in detail in the first paper in this series. We explore the O2-O3 relationship around G0V-M5V host stars, using climate/photochemistry modeling to simulate atmospheres while varying abundances of O2 and nitrous oxide (N2O). N2O is of particular importance to the O2-O3 relationship not just because it is produced biologically, but because it is the primary source of nitrogen oxides (NOx), which fuel the NOx catalytic cycle which destroys O3, and the smog mechanism that produces O3. We vary the O2 mixing ratio from 0.01-150% present atmospheric level (PAL), and N2O abundances of 10% and 1000% PAL. We find that varying N2O impacts the O2-O3 relationship differently depending strongly on both the host star and the amount of atmospheric O2. Planets orbiting hotter hosts with strong UV fluxes efficiently convert N2O into NOx, often depleting a significant amount of O3 via faster NOx catalytic cycles. However, for cooler hosts and low O2 levels we find that increasing N2O can lead to an increase of overall O3 due to the smog mechanism producing O3 in the lower atmosphere. Variations in O3 result in significant changes in the amount of harmful UV reaching the surfaces of the model planets as well as the strength of the 9.6 $\mu$m O3 emission spectral feature, demonstrating potential impacts on habitability and future observations.

 - **Abstract**
 We consider a non-linear interaction between the dark matter and dark energy components of the universe. In particular, within the FLRW geometry, where dark matter is described by a dust fluid and dark energy by an ideal gas with a constant equation of state parameter, we introduce energy transfer between the two fluids. The effective cosmological fluid leads to a unified dynamical dark energy model with the feature that the Hubble function admits an analytic expression. We study this model using the DESI DR2 Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations data and the Supernova data from Pantheon+. The interacting model fits the data better than the $\Lambda$CDM model, with $\chi_{\text{model}}^{2}-\chi_{\Lambda\text{CDM}}^{2}=-5$. Using the Akaike Information Criterion to compare the two models, we derive $\text{AIC}_{\operatorname{model}}-\text{AIC}_{\Lambda\text{CDM}}=-1$, from which we conclude that the interacting model is marginally better supported by the data than the $\Lambda$CDM, but the difference is not statistically significant.

 - **Abstract**
 This study examines the flux and photon index distributions of 11 Very High Energy (VHE) Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars (FSRQs) using over 16 years of Fermi-LAT $\gamma$-ray data. The distributions reveal double lognormal profiles in both flux and index, primarily in the 3-day and 7-day binnings, supporting the ``two-flux-state hypothesis" for blazars. These profiles, which become insignificant at 30-day binning, suggest that shorter timescales are better at capturing distinct states, while longer timescales smooth out shorter variations. Most VHE FSRQs exhibit a ``harder-when-brighter" trend, where the photon index decreases during high-flux states, suggesting efficient particle acceleration and possibly reduced radiative cooling. In contrast, two sources display a ``softer-when-brighter" behavior, likely due to enhanced radiative cooling in high photon density environments. Additionally, we observe that the Spearman rank correlation between flux and photon index strengthens with increasing time bin sizes, indicating more pronounced correlations over longer timescales. This possibly indicates that, on shorter timescales, flux variations are driven by a combination of photon index changes and normalization effects. Averaging flux over longer durations minimizes the effect of normalization variation, thereby enhancing the observed correlation. We also compare the flux and index distributions of VHE and non-VHE FSRQs, emphasizing the differences in their variability and emission patterns.

          Toward a simultaneous resolution of the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions: early dark energy and an interacting dark sector model

 - **Abstract**
 The tension between the Hubble constant ($H_0$) inferred from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and that measured from late-time observations, such as the local distance ladder, is a major challenge in modern cosmology. Early dark energy (EDE) has been proposed as a possible resolution to the $H_0$ tension, but it typically worsens the $S_8$ tension by enhancing the small-scale matter power spectrum due to an increased cold dark matter density. To address this issue, we propose a model that combines EDE with an interacting dark energy-dark matter (iDEDM) scenario, and investigate whether this mixed model can simultaneously resolve both tensions. We find that the DE-DM interaction suppress the growth of structure and reduce $S_8$, while EDE contributes to increase $H_0$, although less effectively than in the EDE-only case. Our MCMC analysis using Planck 2018, DESI BAO, DES, Pantheon+, and SH0ES data shows that the mixed model provides modest improvements in both tensions, although it does not fully resolve either. This limitation appears to stem from the fact that both EDE and iDEDM independently favor a higher present-day matter density, which reduces the angular diameter distance and limits the degree to which EDE can lower the sound horizon.

 - **Abstract**
 Universal Design (UD), an approach to accessibility that was first conceptualized in architecture to make buildings physically accessible, has since been applied to curriculum design to make classrooms accessible for a larger range of learning needs. In this paper, we illustrate how the concepts of UD are relevant outside of architecture and the creation of curricula by highlighting examples of norms that exist in the field of astronomy that create barriers for disabled folks. we discuss ways the foundations of UD can be applied more generally to department culture, conferences, outreach events, and academia as a whole to make STEM fields more inclusive. In order to implement UD in these sectors, one must create multiple pathways or options for folks to engage with and show their success in astronomy. While UD is critical for disabled folks, it can easily be expanded to include the promotion of people whose backgrounds and/or identities are currently underrepresented or under-supported in STEM. Lastly, we introduce guiding questions and tools for departments and institutions to evaluate the accessibility of their activities and traditions to disabled individuals. In summary, we aim to show the importance of increased accessibility and provide some strategies to make STEM more inclusive to disabled people by using the mindset and principles of UD.

 We present new angular diameter measurements for 33 stars from the Navy Precision Optical Interferometer, reaching uncertainties on the limb-darkened diameter of 2% or less for 21 targets. We also determined the physical radius, bolometric flux, luminosity, and effective temperature for each star. Our sample is a mix of giant, subgiant, and dwarf stars, and span spectral classes from mid-A to to mid-K. We combined these 33 stars with samples from previous publications to analyze how the NPOI diameters compare to those obtained using other means, namely (V-K) color, the JMMC Stellar Diameters Catalog, and Gaia predictions.

 - **Abstract**
 Primordial scalar curvature perturbations ($\zeta$), typically probed on large cosmological scales via CMB and LSS observations, can be significantly enhanced on smaller scales by various early Universe mechanisms, for instance, non-minimal inflationary models. While decoupled at linear order, scalar and tensor perturbations, i.e., Gravitational Waves (GWs), interact at second order. As a consequence, an enhanced primordial scalar power spectrum $P_\zeta(k)$ can source a sizable stochastic GW background (SGWB). In these proceedings, we briefly review the generation mechanism of such signals, typically referred to as scalar-induced GWs (SIGWs), and discuss the prospects of measuring them with present and future Pulsar Timing Arrays datasets and future GW observatories like the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna LISA.

 In developing a deeper understanding of the Circumgalactic Medium, one feature that is poorly understood is the nature of the ultraviolet background (UVB) and its impact on observed column densities. A wide array of UVB models have been created over the years by many different authors, each based on the latest observational data available at the time. In addition to having a large variance between model properties, the formatting between released models is also inconsistent. This data release provides reformatted versions of several widely-used ultraviolet background models-Faucher-Giguère et al. 2009, Haardt and Madau 2012, Puchwein et al. 2019, and Faucher-Giguère 2020-such that each model is in the same units and thus can be utilized to directly compare these models over a wide redshift range. This release also includes code to run a 'cloudy_cooling_tools' pipeline to generate ionization tables for different UVB models.

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we conducted a systematic analysis of long-term Fermi-LAT \gamma-ray data for a sample of blazars, including FSRQs, BL\,Lacs, and BCUs, to investigate their $\gamma$-ray variability. We focused on light curves binned in 3-, 7-, and 30-day intervals to assess the impact of binning, using data with TS >4 as a detection threshold. We calculated fractional variability ($F_{\rm var}$) for each category and found that FSRQs exhibit higher mean variability compared to BL\,Lacs and BCUs, with BCUs displaying intermediate variability closer to BL\,Lacs. The KS test on the variability distributions indicates that FSRQs differ from both BL Lacs and BCUs, whereas BCUs are more similar to BL Lacs. The higher variability in FSRQs is likely linked to more powerful jets and accretion. The correlation between \gamma-ray flux and spectral index suggests a moderate positive correlation for BL Lacs and BCUs, indicating a "softer when brighter" behavior. FSRQs displayed a mild anticorrelation, suggesting these sources tend to become harder as their flux increases. Analysis of flux distributions revealed log-normal behavior in many sources, consistent with multiplicative variability in blazar jets. Some sources show bimodal distributions, implying transitions between emission states. Binning affects the observed variability, with longer bins smoothing short-term fluctuations. Power spectral density analysis suggests FSRQs exhibit steeper slopes, reflecting structured variability, while BL Lacs display shallower slopes, dominated by stochastic processes. The absence of PSD breaks suggests no dominant timescale within the Fermi window. Spectral index distributions further highlight complexity, often requiring multi-component models.

          Perturbative Likelihoods for Large-Scale Structure of the Universe

 - **Abstract**
 This work presents a formalism for deriving likelihoods of the cosmological density field directly from first principles within Perturbation Theory (PT). By assuming a perturbative expansion around the Gaussian initial density field and additional stochastic components, we analytically compute two forms of the likelihood. Full marginalization over all underlying fields yields the likelihood of the observed density field, expressed in terms of its summary statistics (such as the power spectrum and bispectrum), which are naturally given by the formalism, and conditioned on model parameters. Marginalizing only over the stochastic fields results in the field-level likelihood. A key strength of this method is its ability to automatically specify the precise combinations of initial field covariances and PT expansion kernels required at each perturbative order (e.g., tree-level power spectrum and bispectrum, and the 1-loop power spectrum). This guarantees that the resulting likelihoods are fully consistent with PT at the chosen order of accuracy, avoiding ad-hoc choices in constructing the statistical model.

          Turbulence in Primordial Dark Matter Halos and Its Impact on the First Star Formation

 - **Abstract**
 We present high-resolution simulations of the first star-forming clouds in 15 minihalos with masses ranging from $\sim 10^5$ to $10^7\ \text{M}_{\odot}$ at redshifts $z \sim 17 - 20$, using the \texttt{GIZMO} code. Our simulations incorporate detailed primordial gas physics and adopt initial conditions from the state-of-the-art TNG cosmological simulations. To achieve the required resolution, we apply a particle-splitting technique that increases the resolution of the original TNG data by a factor of $\sim 10^5$, reaching gas and dark matter particle masses of $0.2\ \text{M}_{\odot}$ and $80\ \text{M}_{\odot}$, respectively. This enables us to resolve gas accretion during the early assembly of minihalos and to capture the emergence of strong turbulent flows. We find that turbulence, driven by gas infall into the dark matter potential wells, is predominantly supersonic, with characteristic Mach numbers ranging from $1.8$ to $4.2$, increasing with halo mass. The supersonic turbulence effectively fragments the central gas cloud into multiple dense clumps, some of which form gravitationally bound cores and begin to collapse into the first stars. Our results suggest that supersonic turbulence is a common feature in minihalos and plays a key role in generating clumpy star-forming clouds, with important implications for the initial mass function of the first stars.

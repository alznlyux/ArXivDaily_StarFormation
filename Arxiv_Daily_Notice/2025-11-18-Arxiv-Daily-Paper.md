#### Title:

- **Abstract**
 It is shown how the violation of the invariance of the $Z$-component of the orbital angular momentum $L_z$ in the axially symmetric potential of the Galaxy with a bar can serve as an indicator of the degree of orbital chaos of globular clusters in the central region of the Galaxy. In this case, the higher the variations of $L_z$ of the orbit over a certain period of time, the higher the chaos of the orbit. In essence, a new method for analyzing orbital dynamics -- regular or chaotic -- is proposed. A high level of correlation between the results of orbit classification by the proposed method and the results of classification by other methods is shown. As a result, a sample of 45 globular clusters in the central region of the Galaxy with a radius of 3.5 kpc is divided into regular, chaotic, and weakly chaotic.

- **Abstract**
 X-ray observations of Type II supernovae (SNe II) probe the physics of supernova (SN) shocks and the mass-loss histories of their progenitor stars. We present multi-epoch, X-ray observations of SN II 2024ggi ($D \approx 7.2 \ \rm Mpc$) from ${\it Swift}$-XRT, ${\it Chandra}$ and ${\it XMM}$, which cover $\sim 1 - 344$ days since first light. We analyze these observations using a new open-source Python package called $\texttt{XSNAP}$, which standardizes a unified command-line interface for instrument-specific reduction and spectral extraction. $\texttt{XSNAP}$ introduces application programming interfaces for per-epoch spectral modeling through $\texttt{PyXspec}$ and $\texttt{emcee}$ Markov chain Monte Carlo fitting. We employ ${\tt XSNAP}$ to model the multi-epoch X-ray spectra of SN 2024ggi with an absorbed thermal bremsstrahlung model and calculate a steady progenitor mass-loss rate of $(6.2\pm0.2)\times10^{-5}\,M_{\odot}\,\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$ $(v_{\rm wind} = 20 \ \rm km \ s^{-1})$, for which the detected X-ray emission traces the final 117 years before explosion. The software is publicly available on GitHub, with a released package on the Python Package Index (PyPI).

- **Abstract**
 Astronomical objects that change rapidly give us insight into extreme environments, allowing us to identify new phenomena, test fundamental physics, and probe the Universe on all scales. Transient and variable radio sources range from the cosmological, such as gamma-ray bursts, to much more local events, such as massive flares from stars in our Galactic neighbourhood. The capability to observe the sky repeatedly, over many frequencies and timescales, has allowed us to explore and understand dynamic phenomena in a way that has not been previously possible. In the past decade, there have been great strides forward as we prepared for the revolution in time domain radio astronomy that is being enabled by the SKA Observatory telescopes, the SKAO pathfinders and precursors, and other `next generation' radio telescopes. Hence it is timely to review the current status of the field, and summarise the developments that have happened to get to our current point. This review focuses on image domain (or `slow') transients, on timescales of seconds to years. We discuss the physical mechanisms that cause radio variability, and the classes of radio transients that result. We then outline what an ideal image domain radio transients survey would look like, and summarise the history of the field, from targeted observations to surveys with existing radio telescopes. We discuss methods and approaches for transient discovery and classification, and identify some of the challenges in scaling up current methods for future telescopes. Finally, we present our current understanding of the dynamic radio sky, in terms of source populations and transient rates, and look at what we can expect from surveys on future radio telescopes.

- **Abstract**
 The physical and chemical conditions within a protoplanetary disk play a crucial role in determining its chemical composition, which is subsequently inherited by any forming planets. To probe these conditions, high-resolution molecular line observations, coupled with modelling, are essential. In this study, we investigate the chemistry of the nearby, massive, and relatively line-rich protoplanetary disk around HD 163296 using high-resolution observations from ALMA across Bands 3, 4, 6, and 7. We constrain the disk-averaged and radial distributions of column density and excitation temperature for the detected molecules using the new retrieval code DRive. The disk chemistry is modelled using the astrochemical code PEGASIS, with variations in the initial elemental C/O ratio. Our modelling, informed by molecular observations of HCO+, DCO+, HCN, DCN, CS, HC3N, H2CO, CH3OH, HNCO, and NH2CHO, allows us to place strong constraints on the C/O ratio, with a best-fit value of 1.1 that is broadly consistent with previous estimates. We present the highest-resolution DCO+ emission map of this disk to date, revealing triple-ringed chemical substructures that closely align with the dust continuum rings. Additionally, our results provide the first and most stringent upper limits on the column densities of NH2CHO and HNCO in this protoplanetary disk, measured at < 7e11 cm-2 and < 1e11 cm-2, respectively. Our chemical models suggest that NH2CHO and HNCO predominantly form on grain surfaces within the disk. However, physico-chemical desorption mechanisms are inefficient at releasing these species into detectable gas-phase abundances, yet they remain promising targets for future ALMA observations.

- **Abstract**
 This PRobe far-Infrared Mission for Astrophysics (PRIMA) mission concept is a proposed mission to NASA's Astrophysics Probe Explorer (APEX) call. The concept features a cryogenically cooled 1.8 m diameter telescope, and is designed to carry two science instruments covering the 24 to 264 $\mu$m wavelength range: an imaging polarimeter (PRIMAger) and a spectrometer (FIRESS). The majority of PRIMA's time (75%) will be open to observations proposed by the community (General Observer science / GO), and all of data will be publicly available for archival research (Guest Investigator science / GI). Following up on the successful community engagement created by the first volume of the GO PRIMA Science Book (arXiv:2310.20572), Volume 2 gathers 120 new and updated contributed science cases which could be performed within the context of the PRIMA GO/GI program. This volume reflects the strong development of the community interest, awareness and involvement in PRIMA, and further develops how PRIMA's unprecedented capabilities can be leveraged for an impactful and innovative GO/GI program covering most areas of astrophysics and over 90% of the scientific questions and discovery areas in the Astro2020 decadal survey.

- **Abstract**
 In the era of large time-domain spectro-photometric surveys, surface variations such as starspots, chemical inhomogeneities, pulsations, rotational distortions, and binary interactions can now be directly detected and modelled. Accurately interpreting these phenomena requires stellar spectral synthesis frameworks that go beyond the assumption of homogeneous surface properties. Yet most existing tools remain limited by this simplification, hindering their applicability to stars with complex surface structures. To address this need, we present SPICE (SPectral Integration Compiled Engine), an open-source Python package for generating high-resolution spectra and photometry from non-homogeneous stellar surface models. SPICE integrates angle-dependent specific intensities from each surface element, enabling forward modelling of both photometric and spectroscopic variability. Case studies demonstrate applications to spotted stars, Cepheid pulsations, and eclipsing binaries, making SPICE well-suited for analysing current and upcoming survey data. In addition, SPICE can directly import meshes from PHOEBE, enabling the modelling of complex binary configurations beyond these case studies.

- **Abstract**
 We examine the spatial distribution of star clusters in NGC 628 using the statistical tool INDICATE to quantify clustering tendencies. Our sample, based on HST and JWST observations, is the most complete to date, spanning ages from 1 Myr to >100 Myr. We find cluster spatial behaviour varies with galactic position, age, and mass. Most emerging young clusters are tightly spatially associated with each other, while fully emerged clusters are in \sim1.5 times looser spatial associations, irrespective of age. Young Massive Clusters (YMCs \ge 10^4 M_{\odot}) tend to associate with lower-mass clusters but not strongly with other YMCs, implying that intense star formation regions produce a few YMCs alongside many lower-mass clusters rather than multiple YMCs together. Young concentrated clusters show a wide radial distribution in the galactic disk, which narrows with age; with concentrated clusters >100 Myr mostly residing between 2-6 kpc. This pattern may reflect either faster dispersal of isolated tight cluster spatial "structure" in a lower gas density outer disk or gradual inside-out growth, with the formation of this structure shifting outward over time. We also detect distinct spatial behaviours for clusters within 2 kpc, linked to the inner Lindblad resonance (\le1 kpc), nuclear ring (\sim0.5-1 kpc), and the start of spiral arms (\sim1.25-2 kpc), suggesting these regions exhibit strong radial motions that could hinder clusters from forming and remaining in tight concentrations. Our results highlight how spatially-resolved studies of clusters can reveal the influence of galactic dynamics on star formation and cluster evolution.

- **Abstract**
 High-energy emission spectra from the outer atmospheres of late-type stars represent an important feature of the stellar activity in several contexts, such as the photoevaporation and photochemistry of planetary atmospheres or the modeling of irradiated circumstellar disks in young objects. An accurate determination of these spectra in the EUV and soft X-ray (XUV) band requires high-resolution spectroscopy, that is rarely feasible with current instrumentation. We employed a relatively large set of plasma emission measure distributions (EMDs) as a function of temperature, derived from FUV and X-ray emission line spectra acquired with the Hubble Space Telescope and Chandra or XMM-Newton, in order to devise a relatively simple recipe for predicting EMDs and XUV spectra of stars of different spectral types, activity levels, and plasma metallicity. We show that the EMDs in the range of temperatures between 10^4 K and 10^7.5 K can be described using the stellar surface X-ray flux as a control parameter, but this parameterization also depends on the spectral type. In particular, we find that M-type stars show slightly lower emission measure at temperatures below ~10^5 K and higher emission measures for T > ~10^6.5 K with respect to FGK stars with similar surface X-ray fluxes. We evaluated the uncertainties in the broad-band EUV and X-ray fluxes derived from synthetic EMDs and spectra, considering in the error budget also the limited knowledge of the chemical abundances in stellar outer atmospheres.

- **Abstract**
 Shadows are commonly observed in protoplanetary disks in near-infrared and (sub)millimeter images, often cast by misaligned inner disks or other obscuring material. While recent studies show that shadows can alter disk dynamics, only the case symmetric across the midplane (e.g., from a polar-aligned inner disk) has been studied. Here we study shadows cast by an inner disk with a $30^\circ$ mutual inclination using 3D radiation-hydrodynamical simulations. Given the same shadow shape and amplitude, the $30^\circ$ inclined shadow leads to a much stronger accretion compared with the polar case, reaching $\alpha \sim$ 1, because the disk is squeezed twice in one azimuth, leading to shocks and strong radial flows near the midplane. The outer disk develops a warp: the inner disk region tilts toward alignment with the shadow, while the outer, exponentially tapered disk tilts and twists in a different direction, inclined $\sim$ 32$^\circ$ relative to the inner region. Locally isothermal simulations with a prescribed temperature structure reproduce the effect, confirming that it is thermally driven. Fourier-Hermite analysis shows that it is the m=1, n=1 temperature perturbation that drives the warp by launching bending waves, with the tilting response of the disk approximately proportional to the modal amplitude. This mode always exists unless the shadow is coplanar or polar. Given a fixed temperature contrast, the m=1,n=1 mode peaks at $\sim$15$^\circ$ mutual inclination, but still contributes substantially across 3$^\circ$ to 30$^\circ$. Shadows cause disk warps--they are not only a consequence of them. We discuss testable predictions for current and future ALMA and NIR observations.

- **Abstract**
 Massive Star Clusters (SCs) have been proposed as additional contributors to Galactic Cosmic rays (CRs), to overcome the limitations of supernova remnants (SNRs) to reach the highest energy end of the CR spectrum. Thanks to fast mass losses due to the collective stellar winds, the environment around SCs is potentially suitable for particle acceleration up to PeV energies, and their energetics is enough to account for a non-negligible fraction of the Galactic CRs. Anyhow, the theoretical expectations need to be corroborated by clear observations. Despite the increasing number of detections at different energies, the contamination of other sources often makes it difficult to constrain the contribution arising from stellar winds only, unless one selects objects younger than a few million years, namely before stars start to explode inside clusters. I will review the results obtained with gamma-ray data towards a few massive young star clusters and discuss what implications these result have, especially concerning their contribution to the bulk of Galactic CRs.

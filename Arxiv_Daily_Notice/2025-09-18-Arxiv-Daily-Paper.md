 - **Abstract**
 We use artificial intelligence (AI) and supervisory adaptive control systems to plan and optimize the mission of precise spacecraft formation. Machine learning and robust control enhance the efficiency of spacecraft precision formation of the Virtual Telescope for X-ray Observation (VTXO) space mission. VTXO is a precise formation of two separate spacecraft making a virtual telescope with a one-kilometer focal length. One spacecraft carries the lens and the other spacecraft holds the camera to observe high-energy space objects in the X-ray domain with 55 milli-arcsecond angular resolution accuracy. Timed automata for supervisory control, Monte Carlo simulations for stability and robustness evaluation, and integration of deep neural networks for optimal estimation of mission parameters, satisfy the high precision mission criteria. We integrate deep neural networks with a constrained, non-convex dynamic optimization pipeline to predict optimal mission parameters, ensuring precision mission criteria are met. AI framework provides explainability by predicting the resulting energy consumption and mission error for a given set of mission parameters. It allows for transparent, justifiable, and real-time trade-offs, a capability not present in traditional adaptive controllers. The results show reductions in energy consumption and improved mission accuracy, demonstrating the capability of the system to address dynamic uncertainties and disturbances.

 - **Abstract**
 In the hierarchical assembly framework, the accretion history of the Milky Way is crucial to understand its evolution. However, in massive mergers, integrals of motion are not strictly conserved, redistributing accreted stars across dynamical spaces, such as energy-angular momentum ($E-L_z$). Additionally, the in situ disc becomes kinematically heated, acquiring halo-like orbits. Consequently, even for minor mergers, which should preserve dynamical coherence, we expect their kinematic-defined samples to be contaminated by both the massive merger(s) and the disc stars. This study aims at quantifying this contamination in known accreted halo substructures. As they are defined by kinematics, we aim at cleaning their samples analysing only chemical properties. We applied the kinematic selection criteria for the halo substructures to the Gaia EDR3 and APOGEE DR17 data. Then we adopted a Gaussian Mixture Model approach to chemically compare different substructures on a star-by-star basis, taking into account several abundances (Fe, Mg, Si, Ca, Mn, Al, and C). We argue that the chemical properties of Sequoia point towards a shared origin with GSE. Heracles, Thamnos and the Helmi Stream all likely comprise GSE and heated disc stars in a significant amount. Besides these two populations, we identified stars with chemical and orbital properties compatible with Sagittarius in the Helmi Stream and with $\omega$ Cen in Thamnos. Finally, GSE itself is contaminated by Sagittarius. Halo stars chemically compatible with GSE are spread throughout the $E-L_z$ space and considerably contaminate every halo substructure studied in this work. None of these substructures appears to be a unique population of stars with its own origin. In addition to GSE, they all appear to be mixtures of stars chemically compatible either with the metal-poor disc, Sagittarius, $\omega$ Cen, or with a combination of them.

          Primordial black holes in Randall-Sundrum: Cosmological signatures

 - **Abstract**
 We reconsider primordial black hole physics in Randall-Sundrum Type-II universes, focusing on constraints from cosmological and astrophysical observables. We pay particular attention to scenarios that allow the entirety of dark matter to be in the form of higher-dimensional primordial black holes. This is possible for a range of AdS radii and black hole masses. Observable constraints are generally modified due to the changes in the higher-dimensional gravitational sector, and come from low-energy $e^{\pm}$ emission, microlensing, and possibly from contributions to unresolved radiation backgrounds. We discuss constraints from the cosmic microwave background due to injection of Hawking quanta into the intergalactic medium. Finally, we comment on recent discussions on the compatibility of higher-dimensional black holes and the KM3-230213A event.

          Red giant asteroseismic binaries in the Kepler field

 - **Abstract**
 Systems in which two oscillating stars are observed in the same light curve, so-called asteroseismic binaries (ABs), arise from either chance alignments or gravitationally bound stars. In the latter case, ABs offer a novel way to find binary systems and combine asteroseismology and orbital dynamics to determine precise stellar parameters for both stars. Such systems provide valuable tests to stellar models and scaling relations. While population synthesis studies predict approximately 200 ABs in the Kepler long-cadence data, only a few have been detected to date. In this work, we aim to (1) expand the sample of ABs in Kepler data, (2) estimate global asteroseismic parameters for both stars in each AB, and (3) assess whether these pairs are gravitationally bound. We analysed 40 well-resolved ABs identified in Kepler long-cadence data, and matched these solar-like oscillators with Gaia DR3 sources using spectroscopic estimates of $\nu_{\rm max}$. To assess whether each pair is gravitationally bound, we checked their projected separation and parallax consistency, and compared observed total orbital velocity differences from astrometry with theoretical predictions from Keplerian orbits. We find that most ABs appear to be chance alignments. However, two systems, KIC 6501237 and KIC 10094545, show orbital velocities, seismic masses, and evolutionary stages consistent with a wide binary configuration, with probabilities of ~50% and ~25%, respectively. Furthermore, eleven ABs are likely spatially unresolved binaries based on Gaia multiplicity indicators. Our findings suggest that most seismically resolved ABs in the Kepler field are not gravitationally bound, in contrast to earlier population synthesis predictions. Remarkably, the two wide binary candidates identified here are promising benchmarks for asteroseismic calibration. Spectroscopic follow-up is necessary to confirm their binary nature.

 - **Abstract**
 The recently identified Gaia population of main-sequence--white dwarf (MS+WD) binaries at separations of ${\sim}\,1~{\rm AU}$, often with moderate eccentricities, is not readily reproduced by binary population synthesis models. Barium stars represent a closely related population whose enrichment in $s$-process elements both confirms the presence of a WD companion and attests to past binary interaction. It also indicates that mass transfer occurred at least during the late- and post-AGB phases of the WD progenitor, when $s$-process elements are dredged up. In this work, we further explore the connection between the astrometrically identified Gaia MS+WD binaries and the classical barium star population. To achieve this, we used high-resolution FEROS spectroscopy to measure abundances for 30 Gaia DR3 non-single-star binaries, identifying 10 as Ba-enriched. Together with our recent analysis of archival GALAH data, this yields a sample of 38 barium dwarfs with dynamically measured WD masses, compared to only 6 previously known systems with known WD masses at these separations. We find that, in cases where metallicity is sufficiently low to facilitate efficient $s$-process production, barium and yttrium enrichment is often detected. This enrichment is also identified in eccentric systems, suggesting that post-AGB mass transfer mechanisms are capable of pumping eccentricity into the orbit or occur without erasing it. Our results indicate that the Gaia MS+WD binaries trace the population from which barium stars emerge. Treating the large Gaia-discovered population as an extension of known $s$-process enriched dwarfs opens an avenue to empirically constrain their formation and evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 The dust emission polarization spectrum -- how the polarization percentage changes with wavelength -- serves as a probe of dust grain properties in star-forming regions. In this paper, we present 89 $\mu$m - 214 $\mu$m polarization spectrum measurements obtained from SOFIA/HAWC+ for three star-forming clouds -- OMC1, M17, and W3. We find that all three clouds have an overall decreasing polarization percentage with increasing wavelength (i.e., a ``falling polarization spectrum''). We use SOFIA and Herschel data to create column density and temperature maps for each cloud. We fit for the slope of the polarization spectrum at each sky position in each cloud, and using the Pearson $r$ coefficient we probe each cloud for possible correlations of slope with column density and slope with temperature. We also create plots of slope vs. column density and slope vs. temperature for each cloud. For the case of OMC1, our results are consistent with those presented by J. Michail et al., who carried out a similar analysis for that cloud. Our plots of polarization spectrum slope vs. column density reveal that for each cloud there exists a critical column density below which a falling polarization spectrum is not observed. For these more diffuse sightlines, the polarization spectrum is instead flat or slightly rising. This finding is consistent with a hypothesis presented 25 years ago in a paper led by R. Hildebrand based on Kuiper Airborne Observatory data. This hypothesis is that regions shielded from near-IR radiation are required to produce a sharply falling polarization spectrum.

 - **Abstract**
 These lecture notes delve into field-level inference, a framework offering a robust way to extract more information and avoid biases compared to traditional methods for cosmological data analysis. The core idea is to analyse uncompressed maps to infer underlying physical fields and cosmological parameters. We introduce Bayesian hierarchical field-level models and discuss sampling techniques for exploring complex, high-dimensional posterior distributions. We review the framework that underpins field-level inference. Finally, we highlight some state-of-the-art applications across various cosmological probes, and the growing role of machine learning in enhancing field-level inference capabilities.

 - **Abstract**
 The source of high redshift dust has long been debated. One possible source are the ejecta of pair-instability and core collapse supernovae, but it is uncertain how much newly formed dust can survive the supernova reverse shock and be injected into the interstellar medium. We anticipate the structure of the pre-shocked dust to affect how much of it survives. Yet, the structure of dust formed in supernova is not well understood. We present three-dimensional soft-sphere, dust coagulation simulations aimed at studying the impact of temperature and particle size distribution on the structure of growing dust aggregates. Due to the qualitative nature of the concept of structure, there are many ways to define and quantify it, especially for an irregular aggregate. Thus, we test four metrics commonly used in the literature in order to compare the aggregate properties as well as the strengths and weaknesses of the metrics themselves. Our findings show that higher temperatures result in denser, more compact structures for all metrics tested. Additionally, we find that structures that coagulate from a distribution of particle sizes are denser and more compact than structures formed from identical particles under similar conditions. The latter finding, however, is true for three of the metrics except for the average number of contact points, which has proven to be the least reliable of the four considered metrics.

 - **Abstract**
 The Lyman-alpha (Ly$\alpha$) forest at $z \sim 5$ offers a primary probe to constrain the history of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR), retaining thermal and ionization signatures imprinted by the reionization process. In this work, we present a new inference framework based on JAX that combines forward-modeled Ly$\alpha$ forest observables with differentiable neural emulators and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC). We construct a dataset of 501 low-resolution simulations generated with user-defined reionization histories and compute a set of 1D Ly$\alpha$ power spectra and model-dependent covariance matrices. We then train two independent neural emulators that achieve sub-percent errors across relevant scales and combine them with HMC to efficiently perform parameter estimation. We validate this framework by applying it to a suite of mock observations, demonstrating that the true parameters are reliably recovered. While this work is limited by the low resolution of the simulations used, our results highlight the potential of this method for inferring the reionization history from high-redshift Ly$\alpha$ forest measurements. Future improvements in our reionization models will further enhance its ability to extract constraints from observational datasets.

 - **Abstract**
 Nearby giant exoplanets offer an opportunity to search for moons (exomoons) orbiting them. Here, we present a simulation framework for investigating the possibilities of detecting exomoons via their astrometric signal in planet-to-star relative astrometry. We focus our simulations on $\alpha$ Centauri A, orbited by a hypothetical giant planet consistent with candidate detections in Very Large Telescope and James Webb Space Telescope observations. We consider a variety of observatory architectures capable of searching for exomoons, including upcoming facilities and also a hypothetical dedicated facility $-$ e.g., a purpose-built space telescope with diameter = 3m, central observing wavelength of 500 nm, and contrast-limited performance of $\sim$10$^{-9}$ in 1 hr observations. We find that such a facility would be capable of detecting $\sim$Earth-mass moons in a five year campaign, assuming a Saturn-mass planet. More generally, we simulate expected detection limits for a variety of levels of astrometric precision. We find that moons as small as $\sim$0.2 M$_\oplus$ on orbital periods of 4$-$30 days can be detected with astrometric precision of 0.1 mas and observing cadence of 1 hr over a five year campaign. Additionally, we find that a 39m ground-based telescope can detect Earth-sized exomoons orbiting the same hypothetical planet with a more modest observing cadence of one day. We discuss these results as motivation for a dedicated space observatory as well as a more detailed study of the physical parameters of a greater variety of star-planet-moon systems.

 - **Abstract**
 The architecture of planetary systems is a key piece of information to our understanding of their formation and evolution. This information also allows us to place the Solar System in the exoplanet context. An important example is the impact of outer giant planets on the formation of inner super-Earths and sub-Neptunes. Radial velocity (RV) surveys aim at drawing statistical insights into the (anti-)correlations between giants and inner small planets, which remain unclear. These surveys are limited by the completeness of the systems, namely, the sensitivity of the data to planet detections. Here, we show that we can improve the completeness by accounting for orbital stability. We introduce the Algorithm for the Refinement of DEtection limits via N-body stability Threshold (ARDENT), an open-source Python package for detection limits that include the stability constraint. The code computes the classic data-driven detection limits, along with the dynamical limits via both analytical and numerical stability criteria. We present the code strategy and illustrate its performance on TOI-1736 using published SOPHIE RVs. This system contains an eccentric cold giant on a 570-day orbit and an inner sub-Neptune on a 7-day orbit. We demonstrate that no additional planet can exist in this system beyond 150 days due to the gravitational influence of the giant. This outcome allows us to significantly refine the system completeness and also carries implications for RV follow-ups. ARDENT is user-friendly and can be employed across a wide variety of systems to refine our understanding of their architecture.

          Characterizing the Time Variability of 2M1207 A+b with JWST NIRSpec/PRISM

 - **Abstract**
 We present JWST NIRSpec/PRISM IFU time-resolved observations of 2M1207 A and b (TWA 27), a $\sim 10$ Myr binary system consisting of a $\sim 2500$ K sub-stellar primary hosting a $\sim 1300$ K companion. Our data provide 20 time-resolved spectra over an observation spanning 12.56 hours. We provide an empirical characterization for the spectra of both objects across time. For 2M1207 A, non-linear trend models are statistically favored within the ranges 0.6-2.3 $\mu$m and 3.8-5.3 $\mu$m. However, most of the periods constrained from sinusoidal models exceed the observing window, setting a lower limit of 12.56 hours. We find the data at H$\alpha$ and beyond 4.35 $\mu$m show a moderate time correlation, as well as a pair of light curves at 0.73-0.80 $\mu$m and 3.36-3.38 $\mu$m. For 2M1207 b, light curves integrated across 0.86-1.77 $\mu$m and 3.29-4.34 $\mu$m support linear trend models. Following the interpretation of Zhang et. al. (2025), we model the 2M1207 b data with two 1D atmospheric components, both with silicate and iron condensates. The model of time variability as changes to the cloud filling factor shows broad consistency with the variability amplitudes derived from our data. Our amplitudes, however, disagree with the models at $\approx$0.86-1 $\mu$m. While an additional model component such as rainout chemistry may be considered here, our analysis is limited by a low signal-to-noise ratio. Our results demonstrate the capability of JWST to simultaneously monitor the spectral variability of a planetary-mass companion and host at low contrast.

          New theoretical predictions on Type II Cepheids: towards a self consistent Pop. II distance scale

 - **Abstract**
 Type II Cepheids are pulsating stars that can be used as standard candles for old stellar populations due to their characteristic Period-Luminosity and Period-Luminosity-Colour relations. They are traditionally divided in 3 sub-classes, namely BL Her, W Vir and RV Tauri. In this paper we focus on the first two sub-classes, to provide a new theoretical scenario and develop tools and relations to be adopted in distance scale and old stellar populations studies. We have built new nonlinear convective pulsation models of Type II Cepheids, computed along selected stellar evolution tracks and spanning a wide range of pulsation period and stellar parameters. Three chemical compositions have been taken into account. For each assumed Z and Y, models have been computed following stellar evolution predictions for off Zero Age Horizontal Branch evolution of stellar masses lower than typical RR Lyrae stars, crossing the classical instability strip as BL Her or W Vir pulsating stars. A new theoretical prediction for the instability strip boundaries of these classes of variable stars has been obtained together with their dependence on metal abundance. The predicted light and radial velocity curves have been computed along the evolution inside the strip, showing how the amplitude and the morphology are affected by the position relative to the edges and by the luminosity and mass values. The transformation of bolometric light curves into various photometric systems allowed us to provide new theoretical Period-Luminosity and Period-Wesenheit relations for BL Her and W Vir. These relations are consistent with previously published RR Lyrae model results but with a smaller metallicity dependence. Moreover, the application of the inferred theoretical relations to Magellanic and Galactic Type II Cepheid data provides results in good agreement with some independent distance estimates in the literature.

 - **Abstract**
 Coronagraphic observations enable direct monitoring of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) through scattered light from free electrons, but determining the 3D plasma distribution from 2D imaging data is challenging due to the optically-thin plasma and the complex image formation processes. We introduce SuNeRF-CME, a framework for 3D tomographic reconstructions of the heliosphere using multi-viewpoint coronagraphic observations. The method leverages Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) to estimate the electron density in the heliosphere through a ray-tracing approach, while accounting for the underlying Thomson scattering of image formation. The model is optimized by iteratively fitting the time-dependent observational data. In addition, we apply physical constraints in terms of continuity, propagation direction, and speed of the heliospheric plasma to overcome limitations imposed by the sparse number of viewpoints. We utilize synthetic observations of a CME simulation to fully quantify the model's performance for different viewpoint configurations. The results demonstrate that our method can reliably estimate the CME parameters from only two viewpoints, with a mean velocity error of $3.01\pm1.94\%$ and propagation direction errors of $3.39\pm1.94^\circ$ in latitude and $1.76\pm0.79^\circ$ in longitude. We further show that our approach can achieve a full 3D reconstruction of the simulated CME from two viewpoints, where we correctly model the three-part structure, deformed CME front, and internal plasma variations. Additional viewpoints can be seamlessly integrated, directly enhancing the reconstruction of the plasma distribution in the heliosphere. This study underscores the value of physics-informed methods for reconstructing the heliospheric plasma distribution, paving the way for unraveling the dynamic 3D structure of CMEs and enabling advanced space weather monitoring.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar surface abundances are records of the state of the gas from which stars formed, and thus trace how individual elements have mixed into the surrounding medium following their ejection from stars. In this work, we test the common assumption of instantaneous and homogeneous metal mixing during the formation of the first Population II stars by characterizing the chemical homogeneity of the gas in simulated star-forming environments enriched by Population III stellar feedback. Testing the homogeneity of metal mixing in this time period is necessary for understanding the spread of abundances in the most metal-poor stars, and the (in)homogeneity of individual sites of star formation. Using Aeos, a suite of star-by-star cosmological simulations, we quantify how gas abundances change over space and time relative to Population II stellar abundances using Mahalanobis distances, a measure of covariance-normalized dissimilarity. We find that the homogeneous mixing assumption holds only within $\sim100$ pc of a star-forming region and $\sim 7$ Myr following the star formation event. Beyond this regime, deviations between stellar and gas abundances increase until they become indistinguishable from assuming a homogeneous mix of metals averaged over the initial mass function. This highlights the limited applicability of assuming instantaneous and homogeneous mixing in realistic halo environments at high redshift. We identify critical mixing scales that are necessary to explore chemical evolution in the early Universe. These scales can be applied to determine the precision needed for accurate chemical tagging of observed data and to explore parameter space with analytical models.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of a new directly-imaged brown dwarf companion with Keck/NIRC2+pyWFS around a nearby mid-type M~dwarf LSPM~J1446+4633 (hereafter J1446). The $L'$-band contrast ($4.5\times10^{-3}$) is consistent with a $\sim20-60\ M_{\rm Jup}$ object at 1--10~Gyr and our two-epoch NIRC2 data suggest a $\sim30\%$ ($\sim3.1\sigma)$ variability in its $L'$-band flux. We incorporated Gaia DR3 non-single-star catalog into the orbital fitting by combining the Subaru/IRD RV monitoring results, NIRC2 direct imaging results, and Gaia proper motion acceleration. As a result, we derive ${59.8}_{-1.4}^{+1.5}\ M_{\rm Jup}$ and $\approx4.3~{\rm au}$ for the dynamical mass and the semi-major axis of the companion J1446B, respectively. J1446B is one of the intriguing late-T~dwarfs showing variability at $L'$-band for future atmospheric studies with the constrained dynamical mass. Because the J1446 system is accessible with various observation techniques such as astrometry, direct imaging, and high-resolution spectroscopy including radial velocity measurement, it has a potential as a great benchmark system to improve our understanding for cool dwarfs.

 The Data Release 1 (DR1) of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) is the largest sample to date for small-scale Ly$\alpha$ forest cosmology, accessed through its one-dimensional power spectrum ($P_{\mathrm{1D}}$). The Ly$\alpha$ forest $P_{\mathrm{1D}}$ is extracted from quasar spectra that are highly inhomogeneous (both in wavelength and between quasars) in noise properties due to intrinsic properties of the quasar, atmospheric and astrophysical contamination, and also sensitive to low-level details of the spectral extraction pipeline. We employ two estimators in DR1 analysis to measure $P_{\mathrm{1D}}$: the optimal estimator and the fast Fourier transform (FFT) estimator. To ensure robustness of our DR1 measurements, we validate these two power spectrum and covariance matrix estimation methodologies against the challenging aspects of the data. First, using a set of 20 synthetic 1D realizations of DR1, we derive the masking bias corrections needed for the FFT estimator and the continuum fitting bias needed for both estimators. We demonstrate that both estimators, including their covariances, are unbiased with these corrections using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Second, we substantially extend our previous suite of CCD image simulations to include 675,000 quasars, allowing us to accurately quantify the pipeline's performance. This set of simulations reveals biases at the highest $k$ values, corresponding to a resolution error of a few percent. We base the resolution systematics error budget of DR1 $P_{\mathrm{1D}}$ on these values, but do not derive corrections from them since the simulation fidelity is insufficient for precise corrections.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a non-parametric reconstruction of the three-dimensional velocity field of the Scorpius-Centaurus OB association (Sco- Cen). Using Gaia DR3 astrometry and radial velocities, we infer the velocity field using information field theory on a 70 x 70 x 50 grid at 3 pc resolution. Our model suggests the existence of a primary stellar velocity field with a secondary field that accounts for an additional young kinematic component in Upper Scorpius and Lupus. We find clear tracers of a feedback-driven expansion of the association, while Galactic rotation appears to play a subordinate role. The results confirm the existence of cluster chains and reveal coherent large-scale expansion with characteristic speeds of 1-2 km s$^{-1}$ and local maxima of about 10 km s$^{-1}$. Power spectra indicate an excess of small-scale structure and slopes shallower than Kolmogorov, consistent with energy injection from stellar feedback. Maps of the divergence reveal net positive values, implying an approximate dispersal timescale of 10-15 Myr. A comparison with molecular gas in Lupus and Ophiuchus shows broadly consistent patterns but systematic velocity offsets of several km s$^{-1}$, suggesting partial decoupling for optically visible young stars and gas. The framework presented provides a physically motivated description of the Sco-Cen velocity field and a basis for quantifying the dynamical state and feedback history of OB associations in the local Galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 Predicting the statistical properties of the neutral hydrogen (HI) density field during reionization is an important step in using upcoming 21 cm observations to constrain models of reionization. Semi-numerical models of reionization are often coupled with the collapse fraction field $f_{\text{coll}}(\mathbf{x})$, which determines the fraction of dark matter within halos. In this work, we improve upon earlier prescriptions that compute $f_{\text{coll}}$ based on the dark matter overdensity $\delta(\mathbf{x})$ alone, to include more information about the environment in the form of eigenvalues of the tidal tensor. We compute the mean of the $f_{\text{coll}}$ conditioned on these eigenvalues from a set of high-resolution, small-volume simulations and use them to sample the $f_{\text{coll}}$ field of a low-resolution, large-volume simulation. We subsequently use a semi-numerical code for reionization to compute the HI density field and its power spectrum, and benchmark our results against a reference high-resolution, large-volume simulation. Across variations in redshift, ionized fraction, grid resolution, and minimum halo mass, our method recovers the large-scale HI power spectrum with errors at the $\lesssim 2\%-5\%$ level for $k \lesssim 0.5~ h~ \text{Mpc}^{-1}$, providing a substantial improvement over the $\sim 10\%$ results previously obtained using density-only conditioning. Overall, this makes our method a simple yet efficient tool for forward modeling HI maps during reionization.

 - **Abstract**
 Carbon-oxygen (C-O) shell mergers in massive stars play a crucial role in both nucleosynthesis and the final stages of stellar evolution. These convective-reactive events significantly alter the internal structure of the star shortly before core collapse. We investigate how the enhanced production of light particles (especially protons) during a C-O shell merger, relative to classical oxygen shell burning, affects the energy balance and evolution of the convective shell. We derive the budget for direct and reverse nucleosynthesis flows across all relevant nuclear reactions from stellar evolution models, and we assess the relative energy produced. We find that proton capture reactions on 32,34S, 31P, and 38Ar (SPAr) dominate the nuclear energy production in typical C-O shell mergers as predicted by 1D stellar models. Their combined energy output is approximately 400 times greater than that of C and O fusion under the same conditions. Our results highlight the critical importance of including these proton-capture reactions in simulations of convective-reactive burning. Excluding their contribution can lead to inaccurate modeling of the dynamics and nucleosynthesis in advanced stellar evolutionary phases. Such results will need to be confirmed by 3D hydrodynamics models.

 - **Abstract**
 The Effective Field Theory of Dark Energy (EFTofDE) provides a systematic and model-independent framework to study dark energy (DE) and modified gravity (MG) with one additional scalar degree of freedom. It can describe the known models such as Quintessence, k-essence, DGP, $f(R)$, and Horndeski theories. In this work, we update constraints on EFTofDE by utilizing the most up-to-date public data including the BAO (DESI DR2), CMB (Planck 2018 \& ACT DR6), SNIa (DESY5), weak lensing (DESY3) and full-shape galaxy power (BOSS DR12). We find with the $\Lambda$CDM background, general relativity (GR) is favored by the data, while with the $w0wa$CDM background, slight modification to GR is favored, but still consistent with GR within $1.5\sigma$. We also find the significance level for dynamical DE is greatly reduced within EFTofDE compared to within GR, indicating the degeneracy between dynamical DE and MG.

 - **Abstract**
 Space missions offer unique opportunities for studying ultra-high-energy (UHE) cosmic rays and neutrinos by leveraging secondary emissions generated by extensive air showers (EAS) resulting from their interactions with the atmosphere or Earth's crust. Detecting UHE neutrinos associated with transient sources holds great potential for unraveling the origins of UHE cosmic rays and the physical processes driving their production. Stratospheric balloon missions, illustrated recently by the Extreme Universe Space Observatory on a Super Pressure Balloon II Mission, serve as crucial precursors to space missions. Due to slewing abilities of their telescopes, they can perform follow-up observations of transient sources foreseen as potential candidates for detectable UHE neutrino emissions. Strategies tailored to stratospheric and space missions are essential for optimizing follow-up observations aimed at detecting these elusive neutrinos for the first time. To address this challenge, we have developed a flexible software dedicated to scheduling transient source observations. The software comprises three main modules: a listener module that aggregates alerts from existing alert systems to construct a comprehensive source database, an observability module that factors in the detection system's properties and trajectory to determine a list of observable sources during a specific timeframe, and a scheduler module that prioritizes observations and proposes an optimized observation schedule. The initial release of the neutrino target scheduler software is tailored to the requirements of stratospheric balloon missions, with mock observation examples provided for various flight scenarios. This version will be employed for the upcoming PBR flight in 2027. Future developments will extend its capabilities, and ensure its relevance for various types of missions.

 - **Abstract**
 The timing (cross-)calibration of astronomical instruments is often done by comparing pulsar times-of-arrival (TOAs) to a reference timing model. In high-energy astronomy, the choice of solar system ephemerides and source positions used to barycenter the photon arrival times has a significant impact on the procedure, requiring a full reprocessing the data each time a new convention is used. Our method, developed as part of the activities of the International Astronomical Consortium for High Energy Calibration (IACHEC), adapts an existing pulsar solution to arbitrary JPL ephemerides and source positions by simulating geocentric TOAs and refitting timing models (implemented with PINT). We validate the procedure and apply it to thousands of observations of the Crab pulsar from 14 missions spanning 2002--2025, demonstrating inter-ephemeris TOA consistency at the $\lesssim5\,\mu$s level, using the DE200/FK5-based Jodrell Bank Monthly Ephemeris as a reference. We release open-source tools (TOAextractor) and a TOA database to support future calibration and scientific studies. Instrument timing performance is broadly consistent with mission specifications; the X-ray-to-radio phase offset varies with energy and time at a level that is marginally compatible with the uncertainties of the radio ephemeris, motivating coordinated multiwavelength follow-up.

 - **Abstract**
 The gravitational wave equation of motion includes direct coupling to the Riemann tensor. The curvature terms are usually neglected, but they can be large at the location of matter particles and impact the angular diameter distance. We apply the recently introduced post-geometrical optics approximation that includes curvature to gravitational wave propagation. Assuming that particles are localised within their Compton wavelength, the curvature due to electrons leads to a large effect on the angular diameter distance, but caustic formation invalidates the post-geometrical optics approximation. We conclude that the interesting regime of validity of the approximation is limited, as it ceases to apply when the curvature effects become large. Other methods are needed to evaluate the effect of curvature spikes, and the localisation of particles due to decoherence also needs further work.

 - **Abstract**
 The 21 cm brightness temperature during the Epoch of Reionisation is widely modelled using semi-numeric simulations, used for their computational speed and flexibility in testing astrophysical and cosmological parameters. However, it is common practice to simulate coeval brightness temperature boxes, and then apply post-processing algorithms that treat the lightcone effect and redshift-space distortions separately, assuming they can be added in sequence. We instead model them together, allowing for partial coeval cell contributions, and ensuring that velocity-induced frequency shifts are computed at the correct cosmic time for every position along the line of sight. We show that considering these effects simultaneously creates a difference in the shape of the power spectrum over all Fourier scales, and remains recoverable after semi-blind foreground removal. We show that our lightcones consist of an average of 8% and maximum of 120% of a coeval cell length. These contributions to a 21cm brightness temperature lightcone voxel are shifted from within a +/- 0.5 MHz range of the emitted frequency. The boost in the power spectrum seen over small scales (k>1.5 Mpc) of our robust 21 cm lightcone method compared to basic methods is recoverable after the addition and removal of diffuse radio foregrounds. The largest differences during the Epoch of Reionisation lie in the k-space, where the noise sensitivity for a 1000-hour SKAO-low observation is greater than the signal. However, in the cosmic dawn, we have shown that the major differences lie outside of this noise-dominated region.

 - **Abstract**
 Improved low-frequency sensitivity of gravitational wave observatories would unlock study of intermediate-mass black hole mergers, binary black hole eccentricity, and provide early warnings for multi-messenger observations of binary neutron star mergers. Today's mirror stabilization control injects harmful noise, constituting a major obstacle to sensitivity improvements. We eliminated this noise through Deep Loop Shaping, a reinforcement learning method using frequency domain rewards. We proved our methodology on the LIGO Livingston Observatory (LLO). Our controller reduced control noise in the 10--30Hz band by over 30x, and up to 100x in sub-bands surpassing the design goal motivated by the quantum limit. These results highlight the potential of Deep Loop Shaping to improve current and future GW observatories, and more broadly instrumentation and control systems.

 - **Abstract**
 In multiple-planet systems, gravitational interactions of exoplanets could lead to transit timing variations (TTVs), whose amplitude becomes significantly enhanced when planets are in or near mean-motion resonances (MMRs). In cases where both TTVs and radial velocity (RV) measurements are available, combined analysis can break degeneracies and provide robust planetary and system characterization, even detecting non-transiting planets. In this context, HIP 41378 hosts five confirmed transiting planets with periods ranging from 15 to over 542 days, providing a unique dynamical laboratory for investigating wide multi-planet systems analogous to the Solar System. In this study, we present an intensive space-based photometric follow-up of HIP 41378, combining 15 new CHEOPS observations with eight TESS sectors, alongside data from K2, Spitzer, HST, and HARPS. We dynamically modeled the TTVs and RV signals of the two inner sub-Neptunes via N-body integration. These planets, HIP 41378 b ($P_{b}$ = 15.57 days) and HIP 41378 c ($P_{c}$ = 31.71 days), are close to ($\Delta\sim1.8$ %) a 2:1 period commensurability. We report a clear detection of TTVs with amplitudes of 20 mins for planet b and greater than 3 hrs for planet c. We dynamically confirm the planetary nature of HIP 41378 g, a non-transiting planet with a period of about 64 days and a mass of about 7 $M_{\oplus}$, close to a 2:1 commensurability with planet c, suggesting a possible MMR chain in the inner system. Our precise determination of the masses, eccentricities, and radii of HIP 41378 b and c enabled us to investigate their possible volatile-rich compositions. Finally, by leveraging on the last TESS sectors we constrained the period of HIP 41378 d to three possible aliases ($P_{d} =$ 278, 371, and 1113 days) suggesting that the system could be placed in a double quasi resonant chain, highlighting its complex dynamical architecture.

 - **Abstract**
 The search for atmospheres on rocky exoplanets is a crucial step in understanding the processes driving atmosphere formation, retention, and loss. Past studies have revealed the existence of planets interior to the radius valley with densities lower than would be expected for pure-rock compositions, indicative of the presence of large volatile inventories which could facilitate atmosphere retention. Here we present an analysis of the JWST NIRSpec/G395H transmission spectrum of the warm ($T_\mathrm{eq,{A_B}=0}$ = 569 K) super-Earth TOI-270 b ($R_\mathrm{p}$ = 1.306 $R_\oplus$), captured alongside the transit of TOI-270 d. The JWST white light-curve transit depth updates TOI-270 b's density to $\rho_\mathrm{p}$ = 3.7 $\pm$ 0.5 g/cm$^3$, inconsistent at 4.4$\sigma$ with an Earth-like composition. Instead, the planet is best explained by a non-zero, percent-level water mass fraction, possibly residing on the surface or stored within the interior. The JWST transmission spectrum shows possible spectroscopic evidence for the presence of this water as part of an atmosphere on TOI-270 b, favoring a H$_2$O-rich steam atmosphere model over a flat spectrum ($\ln\mathcal{B}$ = $0.3-3.2$, inconclusive to moderate), with the exact significance depending on whether an offset parameter between the NIRSpec detectors is included. We leverage the transit of the twice-larger TOI-270 d crossing the stellar disk almost simultaneously to rule out the alternative hypothesis that the transit-light-source effect could have caused the water feature in TOI-270 b's observed transmission spectrum. Planetary evolution modeling furthermore shows that TOI-270 b could sustain a significant atmosphere on Gyr timescales, despite its high stellar irradiation, if it formed with a large initial volatile inventory.

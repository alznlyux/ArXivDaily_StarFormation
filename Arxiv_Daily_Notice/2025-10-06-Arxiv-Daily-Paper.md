          A New Recipe for Caustic Pancakes: On the Reality of Walls in the Cosmic Web

 - **Abstract**
 The caustic skeleton model is a mathematically rigorous framework for studying the formation history of the emerging cosmic web from the caustics in the underlying dark matter flow. In a series of two papers, we use constrained N-body simulations to investigate the different cosmic web environments. For the current study, we focus on the cosmic walls. We derive the conditions of the centres of proto-walls and analyse their evolution with N-body simulations. Next, we investigate the statistical properties of Zel'dovich pancakes by studying the number density of the cosmic wall centres in scale space and, for the first time, we calculate the Lagrangian-space volume of cosmic walls. Finally, we infer the mean density and velocity fields and the distribution of haloes around cosmic walls with a suite of physically realistic dark-matter-only simulations. We compare the cosmic walls obtained with the caustic skeleton framework with previously proposed saddle point conditions on the primordial potential and density perturbation.

          No Observational Evidence for Dark Matter Nor a Large Metallicity Spread in the Extreme Milky Way Satellite Ursa Major III / UNIONS 1

 - **Abstract**
 The extremely-low-luminosity, compact Milky Way satellite Ursa Major III / UNIONS 1 (UMaIII/U1; $L_V = 11 \ L_{\odot}$; $a_{1/2} = 3$ pc) was found to have a substantial velocity dispersion at the time of its discovery ($\sigma_v = 3.7^{+1.4}_{-1.0} \rm \ km \ s^{-1}$), suggesting that it might be an exceptional, highly dark-matter-dominated dwarf galaxy with very few stars. However, significant questions remained about the system's dark matter content and nature as a dwarf galaxy due to the small member sample ($N=11$), possible spectroscopic binaries, and the lack of any metallicity information. Here, we present new spectroscopic observations covering $N=16$ members that both dynamically and chemically test UMaIII/U1's true nature. From higher-precision Keck/DEIMOS spectra, we find a 95% confidence level velocity dispersion limit of $\sigma_v< 2.3 \rm \ km \ s^{-1}$, with a $\sim$120:1 likelihood ratio now favoring the expected stellar-only dispersion of $\sigma_* \approx 0.1 \rm \ km \ s^{-1}$ over the original $3.7 \rm \ km \ s^{-1}$ dispersion. There is now no observational evidence for dark matter in the system. From Keck/LRIS spectra targeting the Calcium II K line, we also measure the first metallicities for 12 member stars, finding a mean metallicity of $\rm [Fe/H] = -2.65 \; \pm \, 0.1$ (stat.) $\pm \,0.3$ (zeropoint) with a metallicity dispersion limit of $\sigma_{\rm [Fe/H]} < 0.35$ dex (at the 95% credible level). Together, these properties are more consistent with UMaIII/U1 being a star cluster, though the dwarf galaxy scenario is not fully ruled out. Under this interpretation, UMaIII/U1 ranks among the most metal-poor star clusters yet discovered and is potentially the first known example of a cluster stabilized by a substantial population of unseen stellar remnants.

          DIPSY: A new Disc Instability Population SYnthesis, I. Modeling, evolution of individual systems, and tests

 - **Abstract**
 Disc instability (DI) is a model aimed at explaining the formation of companions through the fragmentation of the circumstellar gas disc. Furthermore, DI could explain the formation of part of the observed exoplanetary population. We aim to provide a new comprehensive global model for the formation of companions via DI. The latter leads for the companions to orbital migration and damping of the eccentricities and inclinations. As it evolves, the disc is continuously monitored for self-gravity and fragmentation. When the conditions are satisfied, one (or several) clumps are inserted. The evolution of the clumps is then followed in detail. We showcased the model by performing a number of simulations for various initial conditions, from simple non-fragmenting systems to complex systems with many fragments. We confirm that the DIPSY model is a comprehensive and versatile global model of companion formation via DI. It enables studies of the formation of companions with planetary to low stellar masses around primaries with final masses that range from the brown dwarf to the B-star regime. We conclude that it is necessary to consider the many interconnected processes such as gas accretion, orbital migration, and N-body interactions, as they strongly influence the inferred population of forming objects. It is also clear that model assumptions play a key role in the determination of the systems undergoing formation.

          Mapping the Stellar Kinematics in the Central 240 Parsecs of M87 with the James Webb Space Telescope

 - **Abstract**
 The supermassive black hole (SMBH) in the giant elliptical galaxy M87 is one of the most well-studied in the local universe, but the stellar- and gas-dynamical SMBH mass measurements disagree. As this galaxy is a key anchor for the upper end of the SMBH mass$-$host galaxy relations, we revisit the central $3''\times 3''$ ($\sim 240\times240$ pc) region of M87 with the Near Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) integral field unit (IFU) on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). We implement several improvements to the reduction pipeline and obtain high signal-to-noise spectra ($S/N \sim 150$) in single $0.''05 $ spaxels across much of the NIRSpec field of view. We measure the detailed shape of the stellar line-of-sight velocity distribution, parameterized by Gauss-Hermite moments up to $h_8$, in $\sim 2800$ spatial bins, substantially improving upon the prior high angular resolution studies of the M87 stellar kinematics. The NIRSpec data reveal velocities with $V \sim \pm 45$ km s$^{-1}$, velocity dispersions that rise sharply to $\sim$$420$ km s$^{-1}$ at a projected radius of 0.$''$45 (36 pc), and a slight elevation in $h_4$ toward the nucleus. We comprehensively test the robustness of the kinematics, including using multiple velocity template libraries and adopting different polynomials to adjust the template spectra. We find that the NIRSpec stellar kinematics seamlessly transition to recently measured large-scale stellar kinematics from optical Keck Cosmic Web Imager (KCWI) IFU data. These combined NIRSpec and KCWI kinematics provide continuous coverage from parsec to kiloparsec scales and will critically constrain future stellar-dynamical models of M87.

          Modeling Emission-Line Surface Brightness in a Multiphase Galactic Wind: An O VI Case Study

 - **Abstract**
 We present a fast and robust analytic framework for predicting surface brightness (SB) of emission lines in galactic winds as a function of radius up to $\sim 100$ kpc out in the circum-galactic medium. We model multi-phase structure in galactic winds by capturing emission from both the volume-filling hot phase (T $\sim 10^{6-7}$ K) and turbulent radiative mixing layers that host intermediate temperature gas at the boundaries of cold clouds (T $\sim 10^4$ K). Our multi-phase framework makes significantly different predictions of emission signatures compared to traditional single-phase models. We emphasize how ram pressure equilibrium between the cold clouds and hot wind in supersonic outflows, non-equilibrium ionization effects, and energy budgets other than mechanical energy from core-collapse supernovae affect our SB predictions and allow us to better match OVI observations in the literature. Our framework reveals that the optimal galactic wind properties that facilitate OVI emission observations above a detection limit of $\sim 10^{-18} \ \rm{erg \ s^{-1} \ cm^{-2} \ arcsec^{-2}}$ are star formation rate surface density $1 \lesssim \dot{\Sigma}_{\ast} \lesssim 20 \ M_{\odot}\ \rm{yr^{-1}\ kpc^{-2}}$, hot phase mass loading factor $\eta_{\rm M,hot} \sim 0.2 - 0.4$, and thermalization efficiency factor $\eta_{\rm E} \gtrsim 0.8$. These findings are consistent with existing observations and can help inform future target selections.

 - **Abstract**
 Transition Edge Sensor (TES) bolometers are a well-established technology with a strong track record in experimental cosmology, making them ideal for current and future radio astronomy instruments. The Tomographic Ionized-carbon Mapping Experiment (TIME), in collaboration with JPL, has developed advanced silicon nitride leg isolated superconducting titanium detectors for 200 to 300 GHz observations of the Epoch of Reionization. Compared to their MHz counterparts, bolometers operating in this frequency range are less common because of their large absorber size and fragility. TIME aims to fabricate a total of 1920 high frequency (HF) and low frequency (LF) detectors to fully populate the focal plane. TIME has successfully developed HF (230 to 325 GHz) and LF (183 to 230 GHz) wafers that are physically robust and perform well at cryogenic temperatures (300 mK). Recent laboratory tests have shown high optical efficiencies for the LF wafers (30 to 40%), but low device yield for the HFs. To address this, new HF modules have been designed with improved cabling and a reduced backshort distance, and are expected to perform similarly to LFs in a similar lab setting. We report on the development of these detectors as well as recent laboratory and on sky tests conducted at the Arizona Radio Observatory's (ARO) 12 meter prototype antenna at Kitt Peak National Observatory.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a kinematic and dynamical analysis of six Galactic open clusters NGC~2204, NGC~2660, NGC~2262, Czernik~32, Pismis~18, and NGC~2437, using \textit{Gaia}~DR3. We used Bayesian and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) methods to identify cluster members, but chose GMM because it's more appropriate for low-mass stars. Estimated distances range from 1.76 to 4.20~kpc and ages from 0.199 to 1.95~Gyr, confirming their intermediate-age nature. King model fits indicate compact morphologies, with core radii of 1--10~arcmin and cluster radii of 5--24~arcmin. We identify 13 BSS and 3 YSS members, whose central concentrations suggest origins via mass transfer or stellar collisions. The mass function slopes (0.96--1.19) are flatter than the Salpeter value, which indicates that these clusters have undergone dynamical mass segregation. Orbit integration within a Galactic potential indicates nearly circular orbits (eccentricities 0.02--0.10), vertical excursions within $\pm$132~pc, and guiding radii near the solar circle, suggesting disk confinement. These clusters likely formed in the thin disk and are shaped by Galactic tidal perturbations, facilitating the rapid loss of low-mass members. Additionally, twelve variable stars were found across four clusters using \textit{TESS} light curves, including $\gamma$~Doradus and SPB pulsators, eclipsing binaries, and a yellow straggler candidate. Periods were derived via Lomb-Scargle analysis. Two eclipsing binaries (TIC~94229743 and TIC~318170024) were modeled using PHOEBE, yielding mass ratios of 1.37 and 2.16, respectively. Our findings demonstrate that integrating orbital dynamics and variable star studies presents valuable insights into the evolutionary pathways of open clusters.

 - **Abstract**
 $\textbf{Fluidic Telescopes}$ | We present a conceptual framework for optically designing space-assembled telescopes whose primary mirror is formed $\textit{in situ}$ via the enabling, scale-invariant technology of fluidic shaping. In-space assembly of optical reflectors can solve light-gathering aperture scaling, which currently limits space-borne optical telescopes. Our compass reduces the top-level optical design trade to three types of avenues -- a fluidic pathway, a legacy one building upon the James Webb Space Telescope, and hybrid solutions -- with a focus on exo-Earths. A primarily fluidic pathway leads, in the first place, to a post-prime-focus architecture. We apply this configuration to propose the tentative optical design for a ~1-m technology demonstrator and pathfinder for fluidic-telescope apertures scaling up to many tens of meters in diameter. $\textbf{Dual-Configuration Spectrographs}$ | The Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) will be the first mission equipped for the high-contrast direct imaging and remote spectral characterization, in reflected starlight, of exo-Earths in our galactic neighborhood. We present a novel concept for a compact, dual-configuration HWO spectrograph tailored for a broad wavelength range covering at least 600--1000 nm. Our design can interchange dispersive elements via a slider mechanism while preserving the rest of the optical path, enabling both a spectral resolving power $R$~140 integral-field spectrograph and a single- or multi-object spectrograph with $R$ on the order of 10$^3$. Although $R$~140 is near-optimal for the $O_2$ absorption $A$-band around 760 nm, higher values of $R$ can be utilized with spectral cross-correlation matched-filter techniques to enhance, e.g., HWO's atmospheric characterization capabilities.

 - **Abstract**
 In order for an inflationary universe to evolve into a hot universe, a process known as reheating is required. However, the precise mechanism of reheating remains unknown. We show that if the reheating is triggered by thermal dissipation effects, distinctive features appear in the spectrum of primordial gravitational waves. This suggests a possible way to observationally probe the physics of reheating.

          Detection of an NH$_3$ absorption band at 2.2 $μ$m on Europa

 - **Abstract**
 The presence of NH$_3$-bearing components on icy planetary bodies has important implications for their geology and potential habitability. Here, I report the detection of a characteristic NH$_3$ absorption feature at 2.20 $\pm$ 0.02 $\mu$m on Europa, identified in an observation from the Galileo Near Infrared Mapping Spectrometer. Spectral modeling and band position indicate that NH$_3$-hydrate and NH$_4$-chloride are the most plausible candidates. Spatial correlation between detected ammonia signatures and Europa's microchaos, linear, and band geologic units suggests emplacement from the underground or shallow subsurface. I posit that NH$_3$-bearing materials were transported to the surface via effusive cryovolcanism or similar mechanisms during Europa's recent geological past. The presence of ammoniated compounds implies a thinner ice shell (Spohn & Schubert, 2003) and a thicker, chemically reduced, high-pH subsurface ocean on Europa (Hand et al. 2009). With the detection of NH$_3$-bearing components, this study presents the first evidence of a nitrogen-bearing species on Europa- an observation of astrobiological significance given nitrogen's essential role in the chemistry of life.

 - **Abstract**
 Beta Pictoris is an A-type star hosting a complex planetary system with two massive gas giants and a prominent debris disk. Variable absorption lines in its stellar spectrum have been interpreted as signatures of exocomets (comet-like bodies transiting the star). Stellar flybys can gravitationally perturb objects in the outer comet reservoir, altering their orbits and potentially injecting them into the inner system, thereby triggering exocomet showers. We aim to assess the contribution of stellar flybys to the observed exocomet activity by reconstructing the stellar encounter history of beta Pictoris in the past and future. We used Gaia DR3 data, supplemented with radial velocities from complementary spectroscopic surveys, to compile a catalogue of stars currently within 80 pc of beta Pictoris. Their orbits were integrated backward and forward in time in an axisymmetric Galactic potential (Gala package) to identify encounters within 2 pc of the system. We identified 99 416 stars within 80 pc of beta Pictoris at present with resolved kinematics. Among these, 49 stars (including the eight components of five binaries) encounter beta Pictoris within 2 pc between -1.5 Myr and +2 Myr. For four of the binaries, the centre-of-mass trajectories also pass within 2 pc. We estimate the sample to be more than 60 % complete within 0.5 Myr of the present. Despite beta Pictoris being the eponym of its famous moving group, none of the identified encounters involved its moving group members; all are unrelated field stars. We find no encounter capable of shaping observed disc structures, although stellar flybys may contribute to the long-term evolution of a potential Oort Cloud. Our catalogue constitutes the most complete reconstruction of the beta Pictoris encounter history to date and provides a robust foundation for future dynamical simulations.

          The anisotropic expansion rate of the local Universe and its covariant cosmographic interpretation

 - **Abstract**
 Without making any assumption on the underlying geometry and metric of the local Universe, we provide a measurement of the expansion rate fluctuation field using the Cosmicflows-4 and Pantheon+ samples in the redshift range $0.01 < z < 0.1$ ($30 \,h^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc} < R < 300\,h^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}$). The amplitude of the anisotropic fluctuations is found to be of order a few percent relative to the monopole of the expansion rate. We further decompose the expansion rate fluctuation field into spherical harmonic components and analyze their evolution with redshift across the studied redshift range. At low redshift, the dipole is clearly dominant, with an amplitude of $\sim (2.2 \pm 0.15)\times 10^{-2}$, significantly larger than the higher--order modes. As redshift increases, the dipole amplitude steadily decreases, reaching roughly half its value in the highest redshift bin investigated. The quadrupole is also significant, at about half the dipole amplitude, and persists across all redshift bins, with no clear decreasing trend, although uncertainties grow at higher redshift. A nonzero octupole is also detected at low redshift. The dipole, quadrupole, and octupole components are found to be aligned, exhibiting axial symmetry around a common axis ($l = 295^\circ,\, b = 5^\circ$). We interpret the observed fluctuations in the expansion rate within the framework of covariant cosmography. Our results indicate that the multipoles of the expansion rate fluctuation field are primarily driven by a strong quadrupole in the covariant Hubble parameter, together with dipole and octupole contributions from the covariant deceleration parameter. These few parameters suffice to reconstruct the luminosity distance with high precision out to $z \sim 0.1$, in a manner that is model--independent, non--perturbative, and free from assumptions about peculiar velocities.

          Self-supervised diffusion model fine-tuning for costate initialization using Markov chain Monte Carlo

 - **Abstract**
 Global search and optimization of long-duration, low-thrust spacecraft trajectories with the indirect method is challenging due to a complex solution space and the difficulty of generating good initial guesses for the costate variables. This is particularly true in multibody environments. Given data that reveals a partial Pareto optimal front, it is desirable to find a flexible manner in which the Pareto front can be completed and fronts for related trajectory problems can be found. In this work we use conditional diffusion models to represent the distribution of candidate optimal trajectory solutions. We then introduce into this framework the novel approach of using Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms with self-supervised fine-tuning to achieve the aforementioned goals. Specifically, a random walk Metropolis algorithm is employed to propose new data that can be used to fine-tune the diffusion model using a reward-weighted training based on efficient evaluations of constraint violations and missions objective functions. The framework removes the need for separate focused and often tedious data generation phases. Numerical experiments are presented for two problems demonstrating the ability to improve sample quality and explicitly target Pareto optimality based on the theory of Markov chains. The first problem does so for a transfer in the Jupiter-Europa circular restricted three-body problem, where the MCMC approach completes a partial Pareto front. The second problem demonstrates how a dense and superior Pareto front can be generated by the MCMC self-supervised fine-tuning method for a Saturn-Titan transfer starting from the Jupiter-Europa case versus a separate dedicated global search.

 - **Abstract**
 The discovery and characterization of habitable worlds was the top scientific recommendation of the Astro2020 decadal survey and is a key objective of the Habitable Worlds Observatory. Biosignature identification drives exceedingly challenging observations, which require raw contrasts of roughly 10$^{-10}$ contrast and ultimately, 1$\sigma$ photometric precision of roughly 3$\times 10^{-12}$ contrast. Despite significant advances for the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope's Coronagraph Instrument, technological gaps still exist in a wide range of technologies such as starlight suppression, deformable mirrors, wavefront control, low noise detectors, and high-contrast spectroscopy. Even with these new technologies matured, the Habitable Worlds Observatory must carefully obtain the observations and rely on post-processing of the data to achieve its science objectives. During the START and TAG efforts, a working group was convened to explore the Coronagraph Concept of Operations and Post Processing (COPP) in the context of the Habitable Worlds Observatory. This COPP working group evaluated coronagraphic concept of operations to enable different post processing approaches, such as reference differential imaging and angular differential imaging, polarization differential imaging, orbital differential imaging, coherent differential imaging, spectral processing, and point-spread function subtraction algorithms that incorporate ancillary telemetry and data. Future integrated modeling simulations and testbed demonstrations are needed to determine the achievable post processing gains for each approach. We report a summary of this working group's activities and findings, as well as an outlook for maturation of these techniques and infusion into the Habitable Worlds Observatory technology portfolio.

          Exploring Warm Jupiter Migration Pathways with Eccentricities. I. Catalog of Uniform Keplerian Fits to Radial Velocities of 200 Warm Jupiters

 - **Abstract**
 Giant planets are expected to predominantly form beyond the water ice line and occasionally undergo inward migration. Unlike hot Jupiters, which can result from high-eccentricity tidal migration, warm Jupiters between 0.1-1 AU ($\approx$10--365 d) are in many ways more challenging to explain because they reside outside the tidal influence of their host stars. Warm Jupiters should therefore preserve traces of their origins as their eccentricities are directly related to their past interactions. We analyze the eccentricities of 200 warm Jupiters orbiting 194 Sun-like host stars (with FGKM spectral types) using 18,587 RV measurements across 40 high-resolution spectrographs. RVs are compiled from the literature and are supplemented with 540 new observations from MINERVA-Australis at Mt. Kent Observatory and the Habitable-zone Planet Finder spectrograph at McDonald Observatory's Hobby-Eberly Telescope, which are timed to improve eccentricity constraints by sampling orbits near periastron passage. The overarching goal of this program is to establish the relative importance of giant planet migration channels through the largest homogeneous analysis of warm Jupiter orbital properties to date. In particular, we evaluate and compare the impact of different system architectures and host star characteristics on the population-level eccentricity distributions of warm Jupiters. Here, we present the target sample, observations, orbit fitting procedure, and parameter summary statistics of our survey. All orbit fit solutions, parameter posterior chains, and merged RV tables for each system are made publicly available.

          Exploring Warm Jupiter Migration Pathways with Eccentricities II. Correlations with Host Star Properties and Orbital Separation

 - **Abstract**
 Warm Jupiters with orbital periods of $\approx$10-365 d represent a population of giant planets located well within the water ice line but beyond the region of tidal influence of their host star relevant for high-eccentricity tidal migration. Orbital eccentricities offer important clues about the formation and dynamical history of warm Jupiters because in situ formation and disk migration should imprint near-circular orbits whereas planet scattering should excite eccentricities. Based on uniform Keplerian fits of 18,587 RVs targeting 200 warm Jupiters, we use hierarchical Bayesian modeling to evaluate the impact of host star metallicity, stellar mass, and orbital separation on the reconstructed population-level eccentricity distributions. Warm Jupiters take on a broad range of eccentricities, and their population-level eccentricities are well modeled using a Beta distribution with $\alpha$ = 1.00$^{+0.09}_{-0.08}$ and $\beta$ = 2.79$^{+0.28}_{-0.26}$. We find that 27$^{+3}_{-4}\%$ of warm Jupiters have eccentricities consistent with near-circular orbits ($e$ $<$ 0.1), suggesting that most warm Jupiters (73$^{+3}_{-3}\%$) detected are dynamically hot. Warm Jupiters orbiting metal-rich stars are more eccentric than those orbiting metal-poor stars -- in agreement with earlier findings -- but no differences are observed as a function of stellar host mass or orbital separation, at least within the characteristic ranges probed by our sample ($\approx$0.5--2.0 $M_{\odot}$ and 0.1--1 AU, respectively). In this sense, metallicity plays a larger role in shaping the underlying eccentricity distribution of warm Jupiters than stellar mass or final orbital distance. These results are broadly consistent with planet scattering playing a major role in shaping the orbital architectures of close-in giant planets.

 - **Abstract**
 We present mid-infrared spectroscopic observations of intermediate- to high-mass young stellar objects (YSOs) in the low-metallicity star-forming region NGC 346 located within the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). We conduct these integral-field-unit observations with the Mid-Infrared Instrument Medium Resolution Spectroscopy instrument on board JWST. The brightest and most active star-forming region in the SMC, NGC 346 has a metallicity of $\sim$1/5 $Z_{\odot}$, analogous to the era when star formation in the early Universe ($z$$\simeq$2) peaked. We discuss the emission and absorption features present in the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of five YSOs with coverage from 4.9-27.9$\mu$m and three other sources with partial spectral coverage. Via SED model-fitting, we estimate their parameters, finding masses ranging from 2.9-18.0 M$_{\odot}$. These targets show dusty silicates, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and ices of CO$_2$, CO, H$_2$O and CH$_3$OH in their protostellar envelopes. We measure emission from H$_2$ and atomic fine-structure lines, suggesting the presence of protostellar jets and outflows. We detect H I lines indicating ongoing accretion and estimate accretion rates for each source which range from 2.50x10$^{-6}$-2.23x10$^{-4}$ M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$ based on H I (7-6) line emission. We present evidence for a $\sim$30,000AU protostellar jet traced by fine-structure, H I and H$_2$ emission about the YSO Y535, the first detection of a resolved protostellar outflow in the SMC, and the most distant yet detected.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a radio-continuum detection of the well-known Wolf-Rayet star WR40 at 943.5 MHz using observations from the EMU survey. We find that the shell surrounding WR40, known as RCW 58, has a flux density of 158.9+/-15.8 mJy and the star itself is 0.41+/-0.04 mJy. The shell size is found to be 9' x 6', which matches well with the shell in Halpha and is similarly matched to the shell at 22 um in infrared. Using Gaia data, we derive a linear size of 7.32(+/-0.34) x 4.89(+/-0.23) pc at a distance of 2.79+/-0.13 kpc. We use previous ATCA observations at 8.64, 4.80, and 2.4 GHz to determine a spectral index of WR40, which is estimated to be alpha = 0.80+/-0.11, indicating that the emission from the star is thermal.

 The Telescope Array (TA) experiment, the largest observatory for ultra-high energy cosmic rays in the Northern Hemisphere, has identified two medium-scale anisotropies: the TA Hotspot near the constellation Ursa Major and an excess in the direction of the Perseus-Pisces supercluster. Studying these medium-scale anisotropies may provide insights into the origins of ultra-high energy cosmic rays. This presentation will explore an oversampling analysis of TA surface detector data to evaluate these medium-scale event excesses and will present the latest findings on the TA Hotspot and the Perseus-Pisces supercluster excess.

 - **Abstract**
 Ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) are extremely energetic charged particles that originate from outer space. The Telescope Array (TA) experiment, the largest UHECR observatory in the Northern Hemisphere, has provided high-precision measurements of the cosmic ray energy spectrum due to its stable operation and efficient data collection. These measurements have revealed three significant spectral features: the ankle, shoulder, and cutoff. Analyzing these features is crucial for understanding the origin and propagation of UHECRs. In this talk, we will present the latest energy spectrum measured by the TA surface detectors and discuss the observed differences in the UHECR energy spectrum between the northern and southern skies.

 - **Abstract**
 Supernova (SN) explosions interacting with dense circumstellar medium are considered to be very promising sites for efficient cosmic-ray (CR) acceleration and subsequent emission of neutral-pion-decay gamma rays. These environments share similarities with already detected gamma-ray novae, but with much greater available energy content, so it is important to characterize their emission in the very-high-energy range. We present the results of H.E.S.S. observations of one such candidate source - SN 2024ggi, located in NGC 3621 at a distance of 7.24 Mpc. A total of 30 hours of data, gathered throughout a month of post-explosion observations, provide flux upper limits that are used to constrain source parameters, offering meaningful insights for theoretical predictions. We exclude bright gamma-ray emission in the first day after explosion, and later upper limits are consistent with wind densities derived from optical observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Pulsar halos are a recently identified class of TeV $\gamma$-ray sources, offering valuable insights into the evolution of pulsar systems at the highest energies. However, only a handful of such sources have been detected so far, making each new identification critical for understanding the properties of the population as a whole. We report the first detection of extended very-high-energy (VHE) $\gamma$-ray emission around PSR~B1055$-$52 using observations from the H.E.S.S. array. This middle-aged pulsar, previously grouped together with Geminga and PSR~B0656$+$14 as part of the ``Three Musketeers'', has now been confirmed to host a TeV pulsar halo, making it the third detected system of its kind, and the first TeV pulsar halo discovered in the southern hemisphere. Our analysis performed in an energy range of $0.3-60\,$TeV, reveals gamma-ray emission with a one sigma extension of $(2.05 \pm 0.32)^\circ$. The analysis indicates that the emission extends beyond the region which was observed with H.E.S.S.. No significant spectral variation is detected across the emission. The diffusion coefficient derived for this halo is significantly lower than the standard ISM value, aligning with findings in the Geminga halo and indicating that slow diffusion may be a common property of pulsar halos. The detection of this new TeV pulsar halo provides a crucial data point for studying the population-wide properties of pulsar halos, their impact on cosmic-ray propagation, and their role as a source of Galactic electrons and positrons.

 - **Abstract**
 We analysed the flickering of selected nova-like cataclysmic variables observed by the TESS satellite and XMM-Newton. We searched for break frequencies ($f_{\rm b}$) in the corresponding power density spectra (PDS), and for any long-term evolution. We found a new optical $f_{\rm b}$ in three nova-like systems and confirmed that the value of this frequency is clustered around 1 mHz. V504 Cen and V751 Cyg show possible X-ray counterparts of $f_{\rm b}$ that had previously only been seen in MV Lyr. This points towards the very central disc for source localisation. We investigated a previously proposed correlation between white dwarf mass and $f_{\rm b}$, but thanks to the new measurements we do not conclude its existence. V3885 Sgr and V1193 Ori show flaring activity in the long-term light curve during which TESS observations were made. The corresponding PDSs show changes in shape and disappearance of $f_{\rm b}$. TT Ari and SGRt 062340.2-265715 exhibit smooth changes in the long-term optical light curve, and the corresponding TESS observations show variable $f_{\rm b}$ during these changes. $f_{\rm b}$ is higher for lower brightness, which was seen only in MV Lyr so far.

 - **Abstract**
 IC 443 is a well-known supernova remnant that stands out due to its interaction with a dense molecular cloud, creating a complex environment where shocks can efficiently accelerate particles to high energies. This makes it a key target for investigating the mechanisms of cosmic-ray acceleration and gamma-ray production, particularly in the context of supernova remnants as potential sources of PeV cosmic rays. This work presents a first analysis of the region as observed by H.E.S.S.. We detect extended very-high-energy gamma-ray emission from IC 443, consistent with previous observations by VERITAS and MAGIC. A multi-wavelength comparison incorporating data from Fermi-LAT, MAGIC, and VERITAS strongly supports a hadronic origin of the observed emission, and highlights the presence of relativistic protons interacting with the surrounding molecular cloud. These findings reinforce the role of IC 443 as a key laboratory for studying supernova remnants as cosmic-ray accelerators and their interaction with their surrounding mediums.

 - **Abstract**
 The Terzina telescope is designed to detect ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) and Earth-skimming neutrinos from a 550 km low-Earth orbit (LEO) by observing Cherenkov light emitted by Extensive Air Showers (EAS) in the Earth's atmosphere pointing towards the telescope and in the field of view. In this contribution, a simulation chain for the Terzina telescope on board the NUSES mission will be presented. The chain encompasses all stages of the detection process, from event generation and EAS modelling with CORSIKA and EASCherSim to Geant4-based simulations of the telescope's geometry and optics, followed by modelling of the trigger system and silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) response. The Geant4 module includes the real CAD model of the telescope structure and optical components, with aspherical lenses manually implemented to ensure accurate representation of the optical efficiency and point spread function in Geant4. This comprehensive pipeline, developed using modular C++ code and Python tools for event analysis and reconstruction, produces detailed performance assessments of a telescope operating in a LEO mission but can be adapted for any high altitude Cherenkov telescope, making it a versatile tool for future observatory designs. The possibility of modelling balloons in the atmosphere has also been developed.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work we derived [K/Fe] and [Mg/Fe] abundance ratios for six stars of the old globular cluster NGC 1786 in the Large Magellanic Cloud. We employed high-resolution spectra acquired with the MIKE spectrograph mounted at the Magellan/Clay telescope. We found a clear Mg-K anticorrelation among the analyzed stars. In particular, the Mg-poor stars ([Mg/Fe] < 0.0 dex) are enriched by ~ 0.25 dex in [K/Fe] compared to the Mg-rich stars ([Mg/Fe] > 0.0 dex). This finding makes NGC 1786 the first globular cluster residing in an external galaxy in which such extreme chemical anomaly has been detected. The observed trend nicely agrees with those observed in Galactic globular clusters hosting Mg-poor stars, such as NGC 2808, and Omega Centauri suggesting that such chemical anomaly is an ubiquitous feature of old, massive, and metal-poor stellar systems and it does not depend on the properties of the parent galaxy in which the cluster formed. Also, Na-O and Mg-Al anticorrelations were detected among the stars of NGC 1786. The newly discovered Mg-K anticorrelation reinforces the idea that stars capable of activating the complete MgAl cycle are responsible for the observed chemical anomalies in these clusters. In this context, asymptotic giant branch stars seem to be a valuable model since they are able to produce K while depleting Mg. However, the precise and complete physics of this model remains a subject of debate.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work we present the porting to Graphics Processing Units (GPUs, using OpenMP target directives) and optimization of a key module within the cosmological {\pinocchio} code, a Lagrangian Perturbation Theory (LPT)-based framework widely used for generating dark matter (DM) halo catalogs. Our optimization focuses on a specific segment of the code responsible for calculating the collapse time of each particle involved in the simulation. Due to the embarrassingly parallel nature of this computation, it represents an ideal candidate for GPU offloading. As part of the porting process, we developed fully GPU-native implementations of both cubic spline and bilinear interpolation routines, required for evaluating collapse times. Since GNU Scientific Library (GSL) does not support GPU offloading, these custom implementations run entirely on the GPU and achieve residuals of only $\sim0.003\%$ when compared to the CPU-based implementation of GSL. Comparative benchmarking on the LEONARDO (NVIDIA-based) and SETONIX (AMD-based) supercomputers reveals notable portability and performance, with speedups of~\textit{4x} and up to~\textit{8x}, respectively. While collapse time calculation is not a primary bottleneck in the overall workflow, the acceleration reduces full production runs by $\sim 100$ seconds each leading to a cumulative saving of $\sim 160000$ Standard-h ($\sim28$ hours wall time) across thousands of simulations. Roofline analysis confirms that our GPU porting achieves over 80\% of the theoretical FP64 peak performance, confirming efficient compute-bound execution. This work demonstrates that OpenMP directives offer a portable, effective strategy for accelerating large-scale cosmological simulations on heterogeneous hardware.

 - **Abstract**
 We re-investigated the distance to the black hole X-ray binary 4U 1630-47 by analyzing its dust scattering halo (DSH) using high-resolution X-ray (Chandra) and millimeter (APEX) observations. Dust scattering halos form when X-rays from a compact source are scattered by interstellar dust, creating diffuse ring-like structures that can provide clues about the source's distance. Our previous work suggested two possible distances: 4.9 kpc and 11.5 kpc, but uncertainties remained due to low-resolution CO maps. We developed a new methodology to refine these estimates, starting with a machine learning approach to determine a 3D representation of molecular clouds from the APEX dataset. The 3D maps are combined with X-ray flux measurements to generate synthetic DSH images. By comparing synthetic images with the observed Chandra data through radial and azimuthal profile fitting, we not only measure the source distance but also distinguish whether the molecular clouds are at their near or far distances. The current analysis again supported a distance of 11.5 kpc over alternative estimates. While the method produced a lower reduced chi-squared for both the azimuthal and radial fits for a distance of 13.6 kpc, we ruled it out as it would have produced a bright ring beyond the APEX field of view, which is not seen in the Chandra image. The 4.85 kpc estimate was also excluded due to poor fit quality and cloud distance conflicts. The systematic error of 1 kpc, arising from uncertainties in determining molecular cloud distances, dominates the total error.

 - **Abstract**
 We report here on observations of a tidal disruption event, XMMSL2 J1404-2511, discovered in an XMM-Newton slew, in a quiescent galaxy at z=0.043. X-ray monitoring covered the epoch when the accretion disc transitioned from a thermal state, with kT~80 eV, to a harder state dominated by a warm, optically-thick corona. The bulk of the coronal formation took place within 7 days and was coincident with a temporary drop in the emitted radiation by a factor 4. After a plateau phase of ~100 days, the X-ray flux of XMMSL2 J1404-2511 decayed by a factor 500 within 230 days. We estimate the black hole mass in the galaxy to be $M_{BH}=4\pm{2}\times10^{6}$ solar masses and the peak X-ray luminosity $L_{X}\sim6\times10^{43}$ ergs/s. The optical/UV light curve is flat over the timescale of the observations with $L_{opt}\sim 2\times10^{41}$ ergs/s. We find that TDEs with coronae are more often found in an X-ray sample than in an optically-selected sample. Late-time monitoring of the optical sample is needed to test whether this is an intrinsic property of TDEs or is due to a selection effect. From the fast decay of the X-ray emission we consider that the event was likely due to the partial stripping of an evolved star rather than a full stellar disruption, an idea supported by the detection of two further re-brightening episodes, two and four years after the first event, in the SRG/eROSITA all-sky survey.

 - **Abstract**
 Scorpius X-1 is the brightest and first discovered X-ray source in the sky. Studying this source in the low-energy band has been challenging in the past due to its high brightness. However, with the X-ray SPECtroscopy and Timing (XSPECT) payload on-board Indias first X-ray Polarimetry Satellite (XPoSat), we have the capability to study the source despite its very high brightness, thanks to the fast (1 ms) readout of the instrument. We investigate the evolution of the spectral and timing properties of Sco X-1 across the horizontal, normal, and flaring branch, as observed with XSPECT. We examine changes in the spectral parameters as a function of position on the color-color diagram (CCD). Spectral studies indicate that the soft X-ray emission can be modeled using a multicolor disk component, with the inner disk temperature ranging from 0.6 to 0.8 keV. The hard component is described by a Comptonized continuum using either the nthComp or Comptb model with electron temperatures from 2.4 to 4.7 keV and optical depth between 5 and 14. Additionally, we observe the presence of an iron K-alpha line at 6.6 keV and an iron K-beta line at 7.6 keV. Both spectral models suggest a steep rise in Comptonization flux as well as disk flux in the flaring branch. An increase in neutron star blackbody temperature and inner disk temperature are also observed during flaring. The Z-track is driven by changes in the optical depth of the corona, the Comptonization flux and the disk flux and the inner disk temperature. No quasi-periodic oscillations are detected in any branch, suggesting their association with the high-energy spectrum.

 - **Abstract**
 Inorganic scintillators continue to be widely used within astrophysical X-ray and gamma-ray detectors. This is in part thanks to the development of new scintillators, such as GAGG:Ce, as well as the availability of new scintillator readout sensors such as Silicon Photomultipliers and Silicon Drift Detectors. In order to use such scintillator materials for spectrometry or polarimetry, a detailed understanding of their response is important. One parameter that can affect the scintillator performance, particularly at lower photon energies, is their Birks' coefficienct, which correlates the relative light yield to the ionization energy. While for many high-Z inorganic scintillators this effect can be ignored, for GAGG:Ce this appears to not be the case. Here we provide a measurement of the Birks' coefficient for GAGG:Ce using data from two different detectors irradiated in the 20-80 keV energy range at the LARIX-A X-ray beam in Ferrara, Italy. While the effects due to Birks' law are visible below 30 keV, they also significantly influence the performance of GAGG:Ce performance near one of the K-edges, affecting both the measured gain and the energy resolution. Here, we use beam test data to derive the Birks' coefficient from GAGG:Ce. The results indicate that for usage in hard X-ray and soft gamma-ray missions, this coefficient has a significant effect on the measurements.

          Is there a unique asteroseismic interior model for the solar-like oscillating KIC 7747078?

 - **Abstract**
 Asteroseismology provides a direct observational window into the structure and evolution of stars. While spectroscopic and photometric methods only provide information about the surface properties of stars, asteroseismology, through the analysis of oscillation frequencies, offers comprehensive information about the deep stellar interior as well as the surface. The scattering of effective temperature (Teff) determined from the spectrum and degeneracy in the Hertzsprung Russell diagram poses challenges in developing a unique interior model for a single star. Although observational asteroseismic data partially lift this degeneracy, the best model that meets all asteroseismic constraints is not obtained. Most models reported in the literature typically address the large separation Dnu constraint between oscillation frequencies, which is a critical issue, especially in post main sequence stars. Reference frequencies, influenced by helium ionisation zone induced glitches in oscillation frequencies, are instrumental in refining models. Using the high metallicity derived from the colors of the Kepler Legacy star KIC 7747078, we obtain the masses of models M as 1.208 Msun and 1.275 Msun using the reference frequencies and individual frequencies as constraints, respectively. By applying the chi2 method using these reference frequencies, Dnu, and surface metallicity determined from the spectrum, we develop a unique star model with a mass of 1.171 pm 0.019 Msun, a radius of 1.961 pm 0.011 Rsun, an effective temperature of 5993 K, an initial metallicity of 0.0121, and an age of 5.15 pm 0.29 Gyr. A significant advantage of this method is that Teff emerges as an output, not a constraint. The mixed mode oscillation frequencies of this model align well with the observations.

          The Role of Asteroseismology in Understanding Mass Loss in Red Giants

 - **Abstract**
 Red giant stars play a key role in advancing our understanding of stellar mass loss. However, its initial mass and the amount of mass lost during this phase remain uncertain. In this study, we investigate the asteroseismic signatures of mass loss and the parameters that influence it. We examine six stars identified as red giant branch (RGB) stars in the APOKASC-2 catalog. Assuming these stars are on their first ascent of the RGB, we construct interior models. The resulting model ages are significantly older than the age of the Galaxy, indicating that these stars are likely experiencing mass loss and evolving toward the red clump (RC) phase. The minimum possible initial masses are estimated using the mass-metallicity diagram, from which we infer that the minimum mass lost by these stars ranges from $0.1$-$0.3{\rm M}_{\odot}$. Models constructed with an initial minimum mass yield the maximum possible age of the star. The ages of these models fall within the range of 9-9.5Gyr. For two stars, asteroseismic parameters confirm RC classification. Due to degeneracies in the HR diagram, distinguishing between internal structure models is challenging; however, asteroseismic constraints provide clear differentiation. Although mass-loss and mass-conservation models have similar $M$, $R$, and $T_{\rm eff}$ values, $\Delta\nu$s determined from the $l$=0 modes in the mass-loss models are 5-10$\%$ higher than observed. This discrepancy may arise from differences in internal structure. Finally, evolutionary model grids are used to examine how initial mass and $Z$ affect mass loss. Mass loss increases with increasing metallicity and decreases with increasing initial mass, regardless of the adopted value of $\eta$.

 This work presents Ti/Al bi-layer Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors (MKIDs) based on lens-coupled spiral absorbers as the quasi-optical coupling mechanism for millimeter-wavelength radiation detection. From simulations, the lens-coupled absorbers provide a 70% lens aperture efficiency in both polarizations over an octave band with a spiral array absorber and over 10% relative bandwidth with a single spiral. We have fabricated and measured two devices with bare Ti/Al MKIDs: a 3x3 cm chip with 9 pixels to characterize the optical response at 85 GHz of the two variations of the absorber; and a large format demonstrator with 253 spiral-array pixels showing potential towards a large format millimeter-wavelength camera. We find a sensitivity of 1 mK/sqrt{Hz} and a detector yield of 95%.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. A dual active galactic nucleus candidate with a separation of only 500 pc was recently found in NGC 7727. According to the hierarchical merging scenario, such objects would be expected to merge on a timescale of a few hundred Myr. However, estimating the accurate merging timescales for the two nuclei is still a complex challenge. Aims. Using our numerical N-body code, we can trace the full evolution of central black holes during all phases: dynamical friction of unbound black holes, binary black hole formation, hardening of the system due to two-body scattering, and emission of gravitational waves leading to the final merger. Methods. Our model has next components: the bulge contains two dense stellar nuclei, each of which hosts a black hole. The most massive black hole in the center of the galaxy has a mass of 1.54x10^8 Msol and the least massive black hole in the offset second stripped nucleus has a mass of 6.33x10^6 Msol. We followed the dynamical evolution of the system up to a final separation of four Schwarzschild radii. The black holes were added as special relativistic particles and their equation of motion contains a full post-Newtonian approximation - 2.5 term. Results. Initially, the black holes are not gravitationally bound and, thus, the system spends more than 60 Myr in the phase of dynamical friction while tightening the orbit. The two-body scattering phase takes place from 60 Myr up to 120 Myr. In the last 10 Myr, the black hole's separation is seen to be rapidly shrinking due to the gravitational wave emission. Starting from the physical separation observed today, the total merging time in our model is 130 (10) Myr. Conclusions. These results have implications for the statistics of strong sources of gravitational waves at low frequencies, namely, systems engaged in an advanced state of are expected to be prime sources for the LISA mission to observe.

 - **Abstract**
 Artificial Light At Night (ALAN) has been increasing steadily over the past century, particularly during the last decade. This leads to rising light pollution, which is known to have adverse effects on living organisms, including humans. We present a new software package to model light pollution from ground radiance measurements. The software is called Otus 3 and incorporates innovative ALAN diffusion models with different atmospheric profiles, cloud covers and urban emission functions. To date, light pollution modelling typically focused on calculating the zenith luminance of the skyglow produced by city lights. In Otus 3 we extend this and additionally model the horizontal illuminance on the ground, including the contributions from skyglow and the direct illumination. We applied Otus 3 to France using ground radiance data from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS). We calibrated our models using precise sky brightness measurements we obtained over 6 years at 139 different locations and make this dataset publicly available. We produced the first artificial illuminance map for France for the periods of 2013-2018 and 2019-2024. We found that the artificial ground illuminance in the middle of the night decreased by 23 % between these two periods, in stark contrast to the global trend.

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays, with energies $E \geq 10^{18}$ eV, remains unknown. Among the key observables used to investigate their nature are the energy spectrum, the arrival direction distribution, and the composition as a function of energy. The composition of the primary cosmic ray is inferred from properties of the extensive air showers they initiate, particularly from parameters sensitive to the primary mass. The most sensitive parameters to the primary mass are the atmospheric depth of the shower maximum, typically measured with fluorescence telescopes, and the muon content of the shower, measured using dedicated muon detectors. A commonly used observable in composition studies is the muon density at a fixed distance from the shower axis, derived by evaluating the reconstructed muon lateral distribution function (MLDF) at a reference distance. A specific type of muon detector features two acquisition modes: binary and integrator (commonly referred to as ADC mode, for Analog-to-Digital Converter). The binary mode allows for direct muon counting, while the ADC mode infers the muon number from the integrated signal of the detector response. Existing methods reconstruct the MLDF using data from either acquisition mode individually, or by combining both, but usually assigning a single mode per detector station in a given event. This work presents a novel method to reconstruct the MLDF based on a likelihood approach that simultaneously incorporates data from both acquisition modes at each detector station. We apply our method to the underground muon detectors of the Pierre Auger Observatory as a case study. However, this general approach can be applied to future detectors with dual acquisition capabilities. Our results demonstrate that the combined method outperforms traditional techniques that rely solely on either binary or ADC mode data.

 - **Abstract**
 M31, as the largest galaxy in the Local Group, is of significant importance for the study of stellar formation and evolution. Based on the data of 5,859 targets observed in M31 by Gu et al (\citeyear{2024ApJS..273....9G}), we selected 30 contact binaries by visual inspection for further study. Using the PHOEBE software and employing Bayesian optimization and Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling, we determined the physical parameters of these 30 systems. The results show that 10 systems exhibit the O'Connell effect, which is well explained by introducing a dark spot on the primary star. 11 systems have mass ratios below 0.15, classifying them as extremely low mass ratio contact binaries, making them promising candidates for binary mergers. Six systems have primary star temperatures exceeding 10,000 K, classifying them as early-type contact binaries. The absolute physical parameters reveal that two contact binary systems contain massive stellar components, which may eventually evolve into compact binary star systems. To compare the effects of different galactic environments on the evolution of contact binaries, we constructed evolutionary diagrams for these 30 targets and for contact binaries in the Milky Way. The results show that, at the same mass, our targets have larger radii, higher luminosities, and lower orbital angular momenta than contact binaries in the Milky Way, indicating that they are at more advanced evolutionary stages. This may be attributed to the higher metallicity in M31 compared to the Milky Way.

 - **Abstract**
 We study solar differential rotation (DR) for solar cycle No. 19 (1954-1964) by tracing sunspot groups on the sunspot drawings of Kanzelhoehe Observatory for Solar and Environmental Research (KSO). Our aim is to extend previous DR analysis from the KSO data (1964-2016) to the years prior to 1964 to create a catalog of sunspot group positions and DR parameters from KSO sunspot drawings and white light images. Synodic angular rotation velocities were first determined using the daily shift (DS) and robust linear least-squares fit (rLSQ) methods, then converted to sidereal velocities, and used to derive solar DR parameters. We compare the DR parameters obtained from different sources and analyse the north-south asymmetry of rotation for solar cycle No. 19. It has been shown that our results for the equatorial rotation velocity (parameter A) and the gradient of DR (parameter B) coincide with earlier results from the KSO data (performed with a different method), as well as with results from the Kodaikanal Solar Observatory (KoSO) and the Yunnan Observatories (YNAO). In contrast, the values of parameter A from three different earlier studies based on the Greenwich Photoheliographic Results (GPR) exhibit statistically significant differences when compared to the values of parameter A derived from KSO, KoSO and YNAO. These findings suggest that the GPR data have the largest inconsistency compared to the other three data sources, highlighting the need for further analysis to identify the causes of these discrepancies. The analysis of the north-south asymmetry in the solar rotation profile using two different methods shows that the DR parameters of the hemispheres coincide, indicating a rotational symmetry around the equator. This is consistent with previous results from KSO and YNAO data. However, all sources indicate slightly higher equatorial rotation velocities in the southern hemisphere.

          Self-consistent model of cosmic ray penetration into molecular clouds: Effect of energy losses

 - **Abstract**
 The theory of cosmic-ray (CR) penetration into dense molecular clouds developed recently for relativistic particles by Chernyshov et al. (2024) is extended to non-relativistic CRs. Interstellar CRs streaming into the clouds are able to resonantly excite MHD waves in diffuse cloud envelopes. This leads to the self-modulation, such that streaming particles are scattered at the self-generated waves. In contrast to relativistic CRs, transport of lower-energy particles in the envelopes is generally heavily affected by ionization losses; furthermore, both CR protons and electrons contribute to wave excitation. We show that these effects have profound impact on the self-modulation, and can dramatically reduce CR spectra even for clouds with moderate column densities of a few times $10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$.

 - **Abstract**
 We show that the recently released B-mode polarisation data from the South Pole Telescope (SPT) favour a non-vanishing contribution of primordial gravitational waves of inflationary origin which is in tension with the previous BICEP-Keck (BK) measurements. Our analysis uses the third-order slow-roll primordial power spectra, with theoretically motivated priors, on the multifrequency SPT likelihoods complemented by the latest Planck satellite data products. The SPT measurements provide 1.0 bit of information gain on the first slow-roll parameter, which is higher than the 0.9 bit provided by BK even though the SPT sensitivity is five times lower. Moreover, the Bayesian dimensionality on the same parameter exceeds 1.5 for SPT versus 0.3 for BK showing that it is overconstrained by the SPT data. Even if this BB-tension could be the result of a yet to be understood foreground, our findings should motivate for a closer analysis of this unexpected B-modes excess.

 - **Abstract**
 Propagating nuclear uncertainties to nucleosynthesis simulations is key to understand the impact of theoretical uncertainties on the predictions, especially for processes far from the stability region, where nuclear properties are scarcely known. While systematic (model) uncertainties have been thoroughly studied, the statistical (parameter) ones have been more rarely explored, as constraining them is more challenging. We present here a methodology to determine coherently parameter uncertainties by anchoring the theoretical uncertainties to the experimentally known nuclear properties through the use of the Backward Forward Monte Carlo method. We use this methodology for two nucleosynthesis processes: the intermediate neutron capture process (i-process) and the rapid neutron capture process (r-process). We determine coherently for the i-process the uncertainties from the (n,$\gamma$) rates while we explore the impact of nuclear mass uncertainties for the r-process. The effect of parameter uncertainties on the final nucleosynthesis is in the same order as model uncertainties, suggesting the crucial need for more experimental constraints on key nuclei of interest. We show how key nuclear properties, such as relevant (n,$\gamma$) rates impacting the i-process tracers, could enhance tremendously the prediction of stellar evolution models by experimentally constraining them.

 - **Abstract**
 Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) are Galactic-scale nanohertz-frequency gravitational wave (GW) detectors. Recently, several PTAs have found evidence for the presence of GWs in their datasets, but none of them have achieved a community-defined definitive (> 5$\sigma$) detection. Here, we identify limiting noise sources for PTAs and quantify their impact on sensitivity to GWs under different observing and noise modelling strategies. First, we search for intrinsic pulse jitter in a sample of 89 MSPs observed by the MeerKAT Pulsar Timing Array and obtain new jitter measurements for 20 MSPs. We then forecast jitter noise in pulsars for the future SKA-Mid telescope, finding that the timing precision of many of the best-timed MSPs would be dominated by jitter noise. We then consider dispersion measure variations from the interstellar medium and find that their effects are best mitigated by modelling them as a stationary Gaussian process with a power-law spectrum. Improving upon the established hasasia code for PTA sensitivity analysis, we assess the timing potential of the lower frequency UHF-band (544$-$1088\,MHz) of MeerKAT and find a potential increase in GW background sensitivity by $\approx 8$\%, relative to observing at L-band. We show that this improvement relies on assumptions on the propagation through the interstellar medium, and highlight that if observing frequency-dependent propagation effects, such as scattering noise, are present, where noise is not completely correlated across observing frequency, then the improvement is significantly diminished. Using the multi-frequency receivers and sub-arraying flexibility of MeerKAT, we find that focussed, high-cadence observations of the best MSPs can enhance the sensitivity of the array for both the continuous GWs and stochastic GWB. These results highlight the role of MeerKAT and the MPTA in the context of international GW search efforts.

 - **Abstract**
 Observing giant HII regions at fine spatial scales uncovers detailed structures and reveals variations in ionization, abundance, and dynamical properties of ionized gas and the effect of stellar feedback. Using emission line data of M33 observed with SITELLE as part of the Star-formation, Ionized Gas, and Nebular Abundances Legacy Survey (SIGNALS), we present maps of the principal optical emission line ratios for NGC 604, the most luminous HII region in M33. The excitation maps align well with the H$\alpha$ morphology and are clearly related to the location of the central stellar cluster and secondary stellar groups. The maps of ionization-sensitive line ratios show substantial variations across the face of NGC 604. We demonstrate that these variations are unlikely to be due to chemical inhomogeneities but are primarily caused by changes in ionization, which in turn affect the observed line ratios. We present the H$\alpha$ kinematics of the region and connect it to the excitation structure, showing how the dynamic motions influence the spatial distribution of ionized gas. We note two distinct sources identified in these excitation maps: a known supernova remnant and a previously unknown planetary nebula. Such parsec-scale features contribute only a small percentage to the overall light and would remain undetected without the use of high-resolution spatial data. Throughout the paper, we make comparisons to and raise concerns about single-aperture and long-slit spectroscopic measurements of giant HII regions, highlighting the limitations and potential inaccuracies of such methods.

 - **Abstract**
 Eclipse mapping is a powerful tool for measuring 3D profiles of exoplanet atmospheres. To date, only JWST has been capable of widely applying this technique, but as a general observatory, it is too time-limited to conduct population-level mapping studies. Ariel, on the other hand, is a dedicated exoplanet mission set to observe 1000 transiting exoplanets, making it a natural candidate for this. To assess Ariel's mapping potential, we quantitatively benchmark its abilities against those of JWST using a simulation-and-retrieval framework with existing JWST eclipse maps as test cases. We find that for high-ranking targets, Ariel will be able to derive qualitatively similar maps to JWST using the same amount of observations; for mid-ranking targets, Ariel will be able to compete using as few as 3x as many observations; and for lower-ranking targets, the use of phase curves overcomes the need for an impractical number of repeated eclipse observations. We find that while Ariel is unlikely to have extensive latitudinal mapping abilities, it will have wide-ranging longitudinal abilities, from which the first-order atmospheric dynamics can be constrained. Using an analytically-derived metric, we determine the best eclipse mapping targets for Ariel, finding that it will be able to map nearly 100 targets using full phase curves in only quarter of its lifetime. This would be the largest mapping survey to date, and have enormous ramifications for our understanding of exoplanet atmospheric dynamics. Finally, we rank all the best mapping targets for both JWST and Ariel in order to encourage future eclipse mapping studies.

 - **Abstract**
 Pulsar halos are a class of extended very-high-energy (VHE) sources highlighted by the HAWC observatory towards the Geminga pulsar and PSR B0656$+$14. These VHE sources are interpreted as the inverse Compton emission from electrons and positrons diffusing in the interstellar medium at an inhibited rate, having escaped the pulsar wind nebula. Our aim is to search for new pulsar halos using H.E.S.S. data and to constrain their physical properties. Using a physically-motivated model of pulsar halos, we created template-based models of the spatial and energetic distributions of the expected gamma-ray emission using the Gammapy library. A promising candidate source to which this model can be effectively applied is HESS J1831$-$098, an extended VHE source spatially coincident with two energetic pulsars, which also exhibits spectral continuity and morphological compatibility with the ultra-high-energy source 1LHAASO J1831$-$1007u*. It could be powered by the radio pulsar PSR J1831$-$0952 with a characteristic age of 128 kyr. We present a spectro-morphological analysis of this source with H.E.S.S. data, revealing that the emission is well described with a pulsar halo model, although we cannot reject a simple 2D Gaussian morphology. We discuss the implication of the derived physical parameters of the model.

 We present a web-based application designed to simulate rotational light curves of small airless Solar System bodies under user-defined geometrical and physical conditions. The tool integrates both physical and empirical photometric models and enables users to input custom shape models, surface properties, and viewing geometries. A dedicated module also computes projected silhouettes at the epoch of stellar occultations, allowing direct comparison with observed chords. The application, developed in Python and Django, has been validated using well-characterized targets such as (136108) Haumea, (101955) Bennu, and (433) Eros, showing excellent agreement between synthetic and observed light curves and silhouettes. Beyond standard light curve simulations, the tool supports scenarios including surface heterogeneity, non-principal axis rotation (tumbling), and phase-angle effects. This flexible and accessible platform provides a powerful resource for interpreting photometric data, supporting ongoing observation campaigns, and aiding future mission planning.

 This paper advances the concept maturity level (CML) of the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) servicing architecture. Since servicing has occurred on other missions, this paper argues that the current CML is 2. To advance to CML 3, option spaces must be established for trade studies. We introduce the three space ages and the argument that we are on the cusp of a new revolutionary era. Servicing is only part of that coming change and the other elements of the future space age are introduced. The challenge of designing a flagship mission such as HWO is discussed. The value proposition for the adoption of a new technology, such as servicing HWO, is established. In the latter portion of the paper it is shown that these elements have promise of being beneficial to HWO and should be included in any trade space.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the formation and evolutionary history of the Milky Way requires detailed mapping of its stellar components, which preserve fossil records of the Galaxy's assembly through cosmic time. RR Lyrae stars are particularly well-suited for this endeavor, as they are old, standard candle variables that probe the Galaxy's earliest formation epochs. In this work, we employ a hierarchical Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to characterize the three-dimensional density distribution of RR Lyrae stars in the Milky Way. This approach provides a flexible framework for modeling complex stellar distributions, particularly in the inner Galaxy where the bulge, disk, and halo components overlap. Our analysis reveals that the inner Galaxy is dominated by a distinct prolate stellar population with axis ratio $q$=1.30. Consistent with previous work, we find the halo follows a $r^{-4}$ power-law profile that flattens within 12 kpc of the Galactic center. We also confirm the halo is oblate ($q$=0.62) with a tilt angle of $12.22^{\circ}$. We report for the first time that this tilt aligns the halo major axis in the direction of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy. These results establish GMMs as an effective and flexible tool for modeling Galactic structure and provide new constraints on the distribution of old stars in the inner Galaxy.

#### Title:
          The resummation model in FLAMINGO: precisely predicting matter power suppression from observed halo baryon fractions

 - **Abstract**
 In order to derive unbiased cosmological parameters from Stage-IV surveys, we need models that can predict the matter power spectrum for at least $k\,\lesssim\,10\,h\mathrm{\,Mpc^{-1}}$ with percent-level precision. The main challenge in this endeavour is that baryonic feedback significantly redistributes matter on large scales, but to an unknown degree. Here, we present an improved version of the "resummation" model, which maps observed halo baryon fractions of massive haloes ($M_{\mathrm{500c}}\gtrsim 10^{12.5}\, \mathrm{M_\odot}$) to a flexible suppression signal - i.e. the ratio of baryonic to dark-matter-only (DMO) matter power spectra - using zero free parameters. We apply this model to the FLAMINGO hydrodynamical simulations, obtaining a typical precision of $\lesssim 1\%$ for $k\,\leq\,10\,h\mathrm{\,Mpc^{-1}}$ given mean halo baryon fractions within the spherical overdensity radii $R_{\mathrm{500c}}$ and $R_{\mathrm{200m}}$. When only those within $R_{\mathrm{500c}}$ are available, we still obtain $\lesssim 2\%$ precision. We show that given small-scale stellar mass fractions, the model can be extended to yield $\lesssim 3\%$ precise suppression signals for all scales measured ($k\,\leq\,25\,h\mathrm{\,Mpc^{-1}}$). We also extend the model to redshifts $z>0$. Central to the model is a seemingly mass-independent and feedback-independent relation that allows observed halo masses to be mapped to equivalent DMO halo masses using only observed mean halo baryon fractions, to $\lesssim 1\%$ precision. We demonstrate that this relation can also be used to retrieve the DMO halo mass function from observed halo masses and baryon fractions with percent-level precision, without any assumptions on the strength of feedback. A Python package implementing the resummation model is made publicly available.

          The orbital anisotropy profile of the Gaia-Sausage/Enceladus accretion remnant

 - **Abstract**
 The Gaia-Sausage/Enceladus (GS/E) accretion remnant is one of the most important stellar populations in the Milky Way halo. Recent simulation-based work has suggested that the anisotropy profiles of remnants like GS/E decline towards the center and may be well-fit by an Osipkov-Merritt-type distribution function (DF). We study the anisotropy profile of GS/E using a chemically-selected sample of stars from APOGEE DR17 and Gaia. We find that the anisotropy profile of GS/E is high and constant with $\beta \sim 0.9$ beyond 8 kpc, dropping to $\beta \sim 0.4$ at 2 kpc. We fit a two-component Osipkov-Merritt anisotropy profile to the GS/E data, finding that a combination of profiles with scale radii $r_{\mathrm{a}}=2$ kpc and 547 kpc, with a mixture fraction $k_\mathrm{om} = 0.88$ provide a better fit to the data than a constant anisotropy profile. Using this new DF, we re-assess the density profile and mass of the GS/E remnant from a previous work that assumed a contant-anisotropy DF, finding an increase in the derived mass from $1.5\times 10^{8}~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ to $2.29 ^{+0.95}_{-0.63}\times 10^{8}~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. In general, the combination Osipkov-Merritt DF more satisfactorily matches the kinematics of the GS/E remnant than the constant anisotropy DF, and in the future will form a more reliable basis for modelling the remnant. Additionally, these new constraints on the kinematics of GS/E near the Galactic center are an important measurement for any future theoretical or simulation-based investigation into its nature and origin.

 - **Abstract**
 A handful of enigmatic Jupiter-mass objects have been discovered orbiting pulsars. One such object, PSR J2322-2650b, uniquely resembles a hot Jupiter exoplanet due to its minimum density of 1.8 g/cm^3 and its ~1900 K equilibrium temperature. We use JWST to observe its emission spectrum across an entire orbit. In stark contrast to every known exoplanet orbiting a main-sequence star, we find an atmosphere rich in molecular carbon (C3, C2) with strong westward winds. Our observations open up a new exoplanetary chemical regime (ultra-high C/O and C/N ratios of >100 and >10,000 respectively) and dynamical regime (ultra-fast rotation with external irradiation) to observational study. The extreme carbon enrichment poses a severe challenge to the current understanding of "black widow" companions, which were expected to consist of a wider range of elements due to their origins as stripped stellar cores.

          X-ray investigation of possible super-Eddington accretion in a radio-loud quasar at $z=6.13$

 - **Abstract**
 We present radio and X-ray observations of the recently discovered $z=6.13$ radio-powerful quasar RACS J032021.44$-$352104.1 using uGMRT, ATCA, LBA, and Chandra. The observed radio properties are in line with what is typically observed in high-$z$ radio quasars ($\alpha_{\rm r}=0.72\pm 0.02$ and L$_{\rm 1.4GHz}=5.8 \pm 0.9 \times 10^{26}$ W Hz$^{-1}$). Despite the relatively low X-ray flux observed $F_{\rm 0.5-7.0 keV}=2.3\pm0.5 \times 10^{-14}$ erg sec$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$, the intrinsic luminosity in the 2-10 keV rest frame is markedly high, $L_{\rm 2-10 keV}=1.8^{+1.1}_{-0.7} \times 10^{46}$ erg sec$^{-1}$, making RACS J032021.44$-$352104.1 one of the most luminous quasars currently known at $z>5.5$. The high X-ray luminosity is largely driven by an extrapolation to energies below the observable X-ray window with Chandra and the slope derived in the 0.5-7 keV band (or 3.5--50 keV in the rest-frame; $\Gamma_{\rm X}=3.3\pm0.4$). By analysing the overall spectral energy distribution of the quasar we found that the remarkably soft X-ray emission: (1) cannot be produced by relativistic jets, even when relativistic boosting is considered; and (2) is consistent with expectations for a super-Eddington accreting SMBH. If such a high accretion rate was confirmed, this source would be a unique laboratory to study high accretion in the early Universe and could help resolve some challenges inherent in early black hole growth paradigms.

 - **Abstract**
 We report Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) \hii\ imaging of NGC\,4141, the host galaxy of FRB\,20250316A at $z=0.0063$. Our GMRT \hii\ images have spatial resolutions, at $z\approx0.0063$, of $\approx0.48-8.0$~kpc, and find evidence for (i)~a companion galaxy, LEDA\,2582852, to the south-west, (ii)~a nearby (27-kpc distant) H{\sc{i}} cloud to the south-west, (iii)~disturbances in the H{\sc{i}} distributions of both NGC\,4141 and LEDA\,2582852, and (iv)~high H{\sc{i}} column densities in the south-western outskirts of NGC\,4141. A Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectrum shows evidence for a low metallicity and a high star-formation rate (SFR) surface density activity in the south-western disk of NGC\,4141, while H$\alpha$-based SFR estimates over the last 10~Myr are higher than radio-based SFRs over the last 100~Myr. The above evidence indicates that NGC\,4141 has recently acquired metal-poor gas, via either a merger or accretion, that resulted in the south-western starburst and that may have also triggered large-scale star-formation activity in NGC\,4141, resulting in the formation of the stellar progenitor of FRB\,20250316A and the other transients. Our highest-resolution (480~pc) GMRT H{\sc{i}} 21\,cm image finds no H{\sc{i}} 21\,cm emission from the location of FRB\,20250316A or the nearby star-forming region, suggesting that most of the H{\sc{i}} here has been either ionized or converted into the molecular phase. Our non-detection of continuum emission at the location of FRB\,20250316A yields the $3\sigma$ upper limit $<3.2\times10^{25}$~erg~s$^{-1}$~Hz$^{-1}$, on the 1.4~GHz specific luminosity of a putative persistent radio source associated with FRB\,20250316A, one of the strongest constraints on the radio luminosity of such an associated persistent radio source.

          The Evolution and Internal Structure of Neptunes and Sub-Neptunes: The importance of thermal conductivity in non-convective regions

 - **Abstract**
 Neptunes and sub-Neptunes are typically modeled under the assumption that the interior is adiabatic and consists of distinct layers. However, formation models indicate that composition gradients can exist. Such composition gradients can significantly affect the planetary thermal evolution. In non-convective layers, the heat transport is governed by multiple processes. We investigate how the evolution and internal structure of Neptunes and sub-Neptunes is affected when considering non-convective layers and the sensitivity of the results on the assumed thermal conductivity. Methods. We simulate the planetary evolution by considering thermal transport via radiation, electrons, and vibrational conductivity. We consider planetary masses of 5, 10 and 15 ME, three different initial energy budgets, and two different primordial composition profiles. We find that the assumed conductivity significantly affects the planetary thermal evolution. We show that the commonly used conductivity assumption is inappropriate for modeling this planetary type. Furthermore, we find that the inferred radii deviate by ~20% depending on the assumed conductivity. The uncertainty on the primordial entropy in planets with non-convective layers leads to a difference of ~25% in the radii. This shows that the theoretical uncertainties are significantly larger than the observed ones, and emphasizes the importance of these parameters. We conclude that the characterization and modeling of intermediate-mass gaseous planets strongly depend on the modeling approach and the model assumptions. We demonstrate that the existence of composition gradients significantly affects the inferred radius. We suggest that more data on thermal conductivities, particularly for partially ionized material and mixtures, as well as better constraints on the primordial thermal state of such planets are necessary.

          Can "premature collapse" form black holes in the upper and lower mass gaps?

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of gravitational waves from binary black hole mergers, including the recent signals GW231123 and GW230529, have revealed multiple progenitor black holes in the so-called upper and lower mass gaps, respectively. It is generally assumed that massive stars cannot form black holes in the upper mass gap because pair instabilities in the late stage of stellar evolution disrupt the stars, whereas the lower mass gap refers to the gap between the maximum allowed neutron star mass and the smallest black hole mass expected to form in supernova explosions. Here we explore a "premature collapse" scenario in which upper mass gap stars collapse and form black holes before they reach the late stage of stellar evolution. The mechanism for triggering a premature collapse is the capture of a smaller black hole, possibly primordial in nature. A similar capture scenario can occur to produce black holes in the lower mass gap. At least for massive stars, typical stellar rotation rates would likely result in rapidly rotating black holes in such a scenario, naturally explaining the rapid spins inferred from GW231123. Even though our estimates hinge on several parameters with rather large uncertainties, they suggest that, at least in galactic disks, the likelihood of such a capture is small for stars in the upper mass gap, but may lead to a significant population of black holes in the lower mass gap and, in fact, even below the lower mass gap.

 - **Abstract**
 The extreme variability of blazars, in both timescale and amplitude, is generally explained as the effect of a relativistic jet closely aligned to the observer's line-of-sight. Due to causality arguments, variability characteristics translate into spatial information about the emitting region of blazars. Since radiation at different wavelengths is emitted in different parts of the jet, multi-frequency observations provide us with a virtual view of the structure of the jet on different scales. Radio--gamma-ray correlations, moreover, are essential to reveal where and how the high-energy radiation is produced. We present here the observations collected within the blazar radio monitoring program that we are running at the Medicina and Noto telescopes. It aims at investigating how the variability characteristics and spectral energy distribution of blazars evolve in time. Since 2004, observation have been performed at 5, 8, 24, and 43 GHz on 47 targets, with monthly cadence; the monitoring program is still active at frequencies of 8 and 24 GHz. The database we built in more than twenty years of activity comprises to date about 21000 flux density measurements. Some basic analysis tools have been applied to the data to characterise the detected variability and offer a first glance at the wealth of information that such a program can provide about blazars.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar evolution theory predicts that electron--positron pair production in the cores of massive stars triggers unstable thermonuclear explosions that prevent the direct formation of black holes above about $50\,M_\odot$, creating a ``pair-instability gap''. Yet black holes have been detected above this mass with gravitational waves; such objects might be explained with uncertainties in the physics of massive stars and stellar collapse or with hierarchical mergers of black holes in stellar clusters. Hierarchical mergers are associated with large spins as predicted by general relativity, and isotropic spin orientations. Here we present strong evidence for the pair-instability mass gap in the LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA fourth transient catalog, with a lower edge at $45.3^{+6.5}_{-4.8}\,M_\odot$. We also obtain a measurement of the ${}^{12}\mathrm{C}(\alpha,\gamma){}^{16}\mathrm{O}$ reaction rate, yielding an $S$-factor of $242.5^{+310.4}_{-101.5}\,\mathrm{keV\,b}$, a parameter critical for modeling helium burning and stellar evolution. The new data reveal two populations: a low-spin group with no black holes above the gap, consistent with direct stellar collapse, and a high-spin, isotropic group that extends across the full mass range and occupies the gap, consistent with hierarchical mergers. These findings confirm the role of pair-instability in shaping the black hole spectrum, establish a new link between gravitational-wave astronomy and nuclear astrophysics, and highlight hierarchical mergers and star cluster dynamics as key channels in the growth of black holes.

          SN 2022acko and the Properties of its Red Supergiant Progenitor: Direct Detection, Light Curves, and Nebular Spectroscopy

 - **Abstract**
 We present ultraviolet, optical, and infrared observations of the Type II-P supernova SN 2022acko in NGC 1300, located at a distance of 19.0 +/- 2.9 Mpc. Our dataset spans 1-350 days post-explosion in photometry, complemented by late-time optical spectroscopy covering 200-600 days, and includes deep pre-explosion imaging. We use this extensive multiwavelength dataset for both direct and indirect constraints on the progenitor system. Using the early-time photometry and shock-cooling models, we infer that SN 2022acko likely originated from a red supergiant with a radius of R ~ 580 solar radii and an initial mass of M ~ 9-10 solar masses. From the radioactive decay tail, we infer a synthesized Ni56 mass of 0.014 +/- 0.004 solar masses. We further model nebular-phase spectra using radiative transfer models and nucleosynthesis yields for core-collapse supernovae, which suggest a progenitor initial mass in the range of 10-15 solar masses. Meanwhile, blackbody fitting of the detected pre-explosion counterpart in the F814W and F160W bands indicates a red supergiant with a lower initial mass of approximately 7.5 solar masses. The light curve exhibits a 116 days plateau, indicative of a massive hydrogen-rich envelope, inconsistent with the pre-explosion analysis. We investigated the discrepancy between direct and indirect progenitor mass estimates, focusing on the roles of binary interaction, early-time modeling limitations, and systematic uncertainties in spectral calibration. Our results indicate that the tension among mass estimates likely arises from modeling limitations and flux calibration uncertainties rather than from insufficient data, highlighting the need for more physically realistic models and a deeper understanding of systematic effects.

          Attributing the supernova remnant RCW 89 to the jittering jets explosion mechanism

 - **Abstract**
 I examine recent radio observations of the supernova remnant (SNR) RCW 89 and identify a point-symmetric morphology composed of two main symmetry axes. I attribute this morphology to a jet-driven explosion in the framework of the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM). To reach this conclusion, I argue that the MSH 15-52 nebula associated with the pulsar PSR B1509-58, the X-ray hand-like-shaped nebula, and RCW 89 are two separate core-collapse supernova (CCSN) remnants that interact with each other. Namely, the nebula SNR G320.4-1.2 contains two CCSN remnants. In essence, I utilize the recent successes of the JJEM to account for the morphologies of point-symmetric CCSN remnants, thereby explaining the morphology of RCW 89 and identifying it as a separate CCSN remnant. I suggest a process by which somewhat more energetic pairs of jets in the JJEM have a positive feedback on the accreted gas onto the newly born neutron star, thereby prolonging the life of the jets and explaining the occurrence of two or three energetic pairs of jets in some CCSNe. This study adds RCW 89 to the growing list of point-symmetric CCSN remnants. The JJEM naturally explains these morphologies as shaped by misaligned pairs of jets that exploded these CCSNe.

 - **Abstract**
 The rapid expansion of exoplanet survey missions such as Kepler, TESS, and the upcoming PLATO mission has generated massive light-curve datasets that challenge traditional vetting pipelines. We introduce a hybrid deep-learning framework that integrates convolutional networks, bidirectional LSTMs, and an attention mechanism to identify planetary transit signals with improved accuracy and interpretability. Trained on Kepler DR25 data, the model achieves F1 = $0.910 \pm 0.008$ (AUC--ROC = $0.984 \pm 0.004$), significantly outperforming CNN-only baselines. Attention-based visualizations highlight ingress and egress phases consistent with astrophysical expectations. Applied to 1,360 DR25 candidate dispositions, our pipeline identified 190 high-confidence signals (P(model) $<$ 0.70) that passed initial validation. Following comprehensive false positive probability (FPP) analysis and contamination tests, 13 candidates achieved statistical validation, of which three were fully confirmed as robust exoplanets: KOI-901.01 (warm mini-Neptune), KOI-1066.01 (hot Jupiter), and KOI-212.01 (warm Neptune). With an inference time of $\sim 80$ ms per candidate, this framework enables scalable real-time triage for TESS and future PLATO operations, while the validated candidates provide a prioritized list for radial velocity, timing, and atmospheric follow-up. This interpretable, efficient pipeline addresses the bottleneck in exoplanet confirmation, advancing scalable discovery in the era of large-scale surveys.

          Turbulence from CO observations

 - **Abstract**
 Turbulence influences the structure and dynamics of molecular clouds, and plays a key role in regulating star formation. We therefore need methods to accurately infer turbulence properties of molecular clouds from position-position-velocity (PPV) spectral observations. A previous method calibrated with simulation data exists to recover the 3D turbulent velocity dispersion from PPV data. However, that method relies on optically-thin conditions, ignoring any radiative transfer (RT) and chemical effects. In the present study we determine how opacity, RT, and chemical effects influence turbulence measurements with CO lines. We post-process a chemo-dynamical simulation of a turbulent collapsing cloud with a non-local thermodynamic equilibrium line RT code to generate PPV spectral cubes of the CO (1-0) and CO (2-1) lines, and obtain moment maps. We isolate the turbulence in the first-moment maps by using a Gaussian smoothing approach. We compare the CO results with the optically-thin scenario to explore how line excitation and RT impact the turbulence measurements. We find that the turbulent velocity dispersion (sigma_v) measured via CO requires a correction by a factor R_CO, with R_CO,1-0 = 0.88 (+0.09, -0.08) for the CO (1-0) line and R_CO,2-1 = 0.88 (+0.10, -0.08) for the CO (2-1) line. As a consequence, previous measurements of sigma_v were overestimated by about 10-15% on average, with potential overestimates as high as 40%, taking the 1-sigma uncertainty into account.

          Influence of Dark Matter on Hybrid and Twin Stars

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the impact of dark matter (DM) on both hybrid and twin stars within a two-fluid framework, where DM and normal matter interact only through gravity. A self-interacting fermionic DM model is considered, while for nucleonic and quark matter we employ the relativistic mean-field model and the constant sound-speed parametrization, respectively. Our results show that DM significantly influences the formation of hybrid and twin stars, depending on the transition pressure and the discontinuity in energy density at a fixed sound speed. The presence of DM reduces the number of twin or hybrid stars compared to the case without DM, and this effect directly depends on the DM mass and fraction. We further find that the formation of DM-core or DM-halo configurations is mainly governed by DM parameters, whereas the realization of twin or hybrid star scenarios is primarily controlled by quark parameters. Using the $2M_\odot$ constraint, we demonstrate that the parameter space for twin stars can be further restricted in both DM-core and DM-halo scenarios.

 - **Abstract**
 To date, quantification of the on-sky motion for interstellar clouds have relied on proxies such as young stellar objects (YSO) and masers. We present the first direct measurement of an interstellar cloud proper motion using the VISTA Star Formation Atlas (VISIONS) multi-epoch infrared images of the Corona Australis star-forming region. Proper motions are extracted by tracking the morphology of extended structures in the cloud complex based on image registration techniques implemented in SimpleITK. Our determined values ($\mu_{\alpha^*} \sim +15$ mas/yr, $\mu_{\delta} \sim -30$ mas/yr) are in good agreement with those obtained for YSOs and young stellar clusters in the region. This study demonstrates the potential of image registration for directly mapping the kinematics of nearby molecular clouds, opening a new window into the study of cloud dynamics.

 - **Abstract**
 Infrared Dark Clouds (IRDCs) are cold, dense structures representative of the initial conditions of star formation. Many studies of IRDCs employ CO to investigate cloud dynamics. However, CO can be highly depleted from the gas phase in IRDCs, impacting its fidelity as tracer. CO depletion is also of great interest in astrochemistry, since CO ice in dust grain mantles provides the raw material for forming complex organic molecules. We study CO depletion toward four IRDCs to investigate how it correlates with volume density and dust temperature, calculated from Herschel images. We use 13CO(1-0) and (2-1) maps to measure CO depletion factor, $f_D$, across IRDCs G23.46-00.53, G24.49-00.70, G24.94-00.15, and G25.16-00.28. We also consider a normalized CO depletion factor, f_D', which takes a value of unity, i.e., no depletion, in the outer, lower density, warmer regions. We then investigate the dependence of f_D and f_D' on gas density, $n_H$ and dust temperature, $T_{dust}$. We find CO depletion rises as density increases, reaching maximum values of f_D'$\sim$10 in regions with $n_H>3\times10^5\:{cm}^{-3}$, although with significant scatter at a given density. We find a tighter, less scattered relation of f_D' with temperature, rising rapidly for temperatures <18 K. We propose a functional form $f_D^\prime = \:{exp}(T_0/[T_{dust}-T_1])$ with $T_0\simeq4\:$K and $T_1\simeq12\:$K to reproduce this behaviour. We conclude that CO is heavily depleted from the gas phase in cold, dense regions of IRDCs. Thus CO depletion can lead to underestimation of total cloud masses based on CO line fluxes by factors up to 5. These results indicate a dominant role for thermal desorption in setting near equilibrium abundances of gas phase CO in IRDCs, providing important constraints for both astrochemical models and the chemodynamical history of gas during the early stages of star formation.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we present an off-lattice Monte Carlo model of accretion and migration of hydrogen atoms on a rough surface of carbon dust grain. The migration of physisorbed atoms by means of thermal diffusion and quantum tunnelling through barriers between the surface potential minima is considered. The model is applied to simulations of molecular hydrogen formation in a cold interstellar medium for a temperature range 5-35 K. Eley-Rideal and Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanisms for the formation of the H$_2$ molecule were taken into account. We found that the surface potential energy minima that hold the accreted hydrogen atoms (binding energy) has wide dispersion of its values. The minimum energy is three times smaller than the maximum energy for the uneven surface of the model grain. The large dispersion of the binding energies results in an extended range of temperatures where H$_2$ formation is efficient: 5-25 K. The dispersion of binding energies also reduces efficiency of diffusion due to tunnelling in comparison to that assumed in kinetic equation codes in which constant values of binding energies are employed. Thus, thermal hopping is the main source for the mobility of the hydrogen atoms in the presented off-lattice model. Finally, the model naturally provides the mean values for the ratio of binding-to-desorption energy. This ratio demonstrates weak dependence on temperature and is in the range of 0.5-0.6.

          Survey of Profile Parameters of the $6196 Å$ Diffuse Interstellar Band. From Uniform Profiles to Doppler Splitting and Blueshifts

 - **Abstract**
 The diffuse interstellar band (DIB) at 6196 A exhibits notable profile variations across the Milky Way. This study addresses three open issues: the unusual broadening of the DIB profile towards Upper Sco (USco), the lack of profile variations towards stars near $\eta$ Car, and the origin of the blueshift observed in Sco OB1. Using archival spectra of 453 early-type stars across the Galactic disk and in its proximity, we created a catalogue of the DIB's profile parameters. Our analysis identified Doppler-split components within the DIB profiles across most regions with no evidence for these splits being able to account for the observed broadening (23 km/s) in USco or other regions such as Orion, Vela OB2, and Melotte 20 ($\alpha$ Per cluster). We propose that neither the ages of the studied stellar populations nor the distances between clusters and nearby clouds significantly contribute to the broadening. However, we detect a gradient in the full width at half maximum within the Sco-Cen and Orion regions, where broadening decreases with distance from the star-forming centres. This result points to a possible connection between the DIB broadening and star formation (likely via the impact of recent supernovae). Regarding the Carina Nebula, we confirm the lack of DIB profile variations in a small region near $\eta$ Car, although an adjacent southern area exhibits significant variations, comparable to those in USco. In addition to the Carina Nebula, we find that the Rosette Nebula and NGC 6405 also show consistently narrow profiles (<20 km/s) with minimal deviations from the median over spatial scales of a few parsecs. Finally, regarding the origin of the blueshift observed in Sco OB1, we used a comparison with the Lagoon Nebula and argue that the most natural explanation is the presence of an unresolved kinematic component in the profile of the DIB, shifting the measured centre of the band.

 - **Abstract**
 The CarbON [CII] line in post-rEionisation and ReionisaTiOn epoch (CONCERTO) instrument is a low-resolution mapping Fourier-transform spectrometer, based on lumped-element kinetic inductance detector (LEKID) technology, operating at 130- 310 GHz. It was installed on the 12-meter APEX telescope in Chile in April 2021 and operated until December 2022. CONCERTO's main science goal is to constrain the [CII] line fluctuations at high redshift. To reach that goal CONCERTO observed 1.4 deg2 in the COSMOS field. To ensure accurate calibration of the data, we have developed a forward model capable of simulating both the spectral response and the corresponding interferograms for each scan of observation in the COSMOS field. We present the modeling approach that enables us to reproduce the expected instrument outputs under controlled input conditions and provides a framework for the different calibration steps, including the absolute brightness calibration of the spectra. We constructed a dedicated analysis pipeline to characterize the raw interferometric data (interferograms) obtained under a broad range of atmospheric conditions at APEX. Using the forward model, we measured the interferogram alignment with the optical path difference (zero path difference, ZPD) and the relative response of each KID (flatfield). Together, these elements enable a robust characterization of the instrument's spectral brightness calibration.

 - **Abstract**
 Young ($\lesssim 10$ Myr) planetary-mass companions (PMCs) provide valuable insights into the formation and early evolution of planetary systems. To date, only a dozen such objects have been identified through direct imaging. Using JWST/NIRCam observations towards the Orion Nebula, obtained as part of the \textit{PDRs4All} Early Release Science program, we have identified a faint point source near the M-type star V2376 Ori. Follow-up spectroscopic observations with the MUSE instrument on the VLT confirm that the source, V2376 Ori b, is indeed a young planetary-mass companion. It is a member of Orion D, around 80\,pc in the foreground of the Trapezium cluster of Orion and with an age of approximately $7 \pm 3$ Myr. We fit the SED of V2376 Ori b to infer a mass of $ \sim 20~M_{\rm Jup}$. The MUSE spectrum reveals several accretion tracers. Based on the H$\alpha$ line intensity, we estimate an accretion rate of $\sim$10$^{-6.5 \pm 0.7}~\rm M_{Jup}\,yr^{-1}$, which is comparable to that of young PMCs such as PDS~70b. In addition, the MUSE data cube reveals extended emission in the [O\,\textsc{ii}] doublet at 7320 and 7330~Å, which is interpreted as evidence of a dynamical interaction between the two sources that, potentially, involves mass transfer between their individual accretion disks. These results demonstrate that JWST/NIRCam imaging surveys of young stellar associations can uncover new PMCs, which can then be confirmed and characterized through ground-based spectroscopic follow-up.

 - **Abstract**
 By analysing the radio emissions from air showers using interferometry, we can estimate their properties. In this contribution, we apply interferometry to reconstruct air-shower parameters based on measurements taken with the Auger Engineering Radio Array (AERA) at the Pierre Auger Observatory. This reconstruction method is achievable at AERA through precise clock synchronisation with a beacon and an accurate survey of the station locations. Interferometry has been applied to several thousand inclined air-shower observations for the first time, which allows for tests on the performance of air-shower geometry reconstruction, recovery of the radio signal from low-energy air showers, and methods to study the polarisation of the radio-emission mechanisms. Additionally, in this contribution, we will also provide an overview of efforts to enable interferometry for the recently installed radio detectors that are part of the AugerPrime upgrade.

 - **Abstract**
 Post-asymptotic giant branch (post-AGB) stars are exquisite tracers of s-process nucleosynthesis via their surface abundances. We present a comprehensive analysis of J003643.94$-$723722.1 (J003643), a single SMC post-AGB star, using high-resolution UVES/VLT spectra analysed with E-iSpec. We find C/O = 16.21 and $[\mathrm{s}/\mathrm{Fe}]=2.09\pm0.20 \mathrm{dex}$. We also report the first direct Pb detection in a post-AGB star from the Pb II 5608.853 A line, with $[\mathrm{Pb}/\mathrm{Fe}]=3.18\,\mathrm{dex}$. Comparison with post-AGB samples in the Galaxy and Magellanic Clouds reveals that J003643 has an unusually high C/O ratio. J003643's $[\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{Fe}]=1.33\pm0.14 \mathrm{dex}$ and $[\mathrm{s}/\mathrm{Fe}]=2.09\pm0.20\,\mathrm{dex}$ are consistent with third dredge-up enrichment, but its $[\mathrm{O}/\mathrm{Fe}]=-0.08\pm0.20\,\mathrm{dex}$ is low relative to objects of similar $[\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{Fe}]$ and $[\mathrm{Fe}/\mathrm{H}]$. Together with $[\alpha/\mathrm{Fe}]\approx0\,\mathrm{dex}$ at $[\mathrm{Fe}/\mathrm{H}]\approx-1\,\mathrm{dex}$, consistent with SMC chemical evolution, this indicates the high C/O chiefly reflects oxygen deficiency rather than exceptional carbon enrichment. Additionally, we compare the full abundance pattern with yields from ATON, MONASH and FRUITY (the latter two with post-processing nucleosynthesis). Most elements are reproduced, but Pb is strongly underpredicted, highlighting a persistent gap in models of heavy-element production in AGB stars. The photospheric chemistry of J003643 adds to the growing diversity among post-AGB stars and underscores the complexity of AGB nucleosynthesis.

 We present the discovery by the TESS mission of one transiting Neptune-sized planet, TOI-6223 b and two transiting super-Earths, TOI-1743 b and TOI-5799 b. We validate these planets using a statistical validation method, multi-color light curves and other ancillary observations. We combined TESS and ground-based photometric data to constrain the physical properties of the planets. TOI-6223-b is slightly larger than Neptune ($R_p=5.12^{+0.24}_{-0.25}$ $R_\oplus$) orbiting an early M dwarf in 3.86 days, and it has an equilibrium temperature of $T_{\rm eq}=714\pm14$ K. TOI-1743 b orbits its M4V star every 4.27 days. It has a radius of $R_p=1.83^{+0.11}_{-0.10}$ $R_\oplus$ and an equilibrium temperature of $T_{\rm eq}=485^{+14}_{-13}$ K. TOI-5799 b has a radius of $R_p=1.733^{+0.096}_{-0.090}$ $R_\oplus$, and an equilibrium temperature of $T_{\rm eq}=505\pm16$ K orbits an M2 dwarf in 4.17 days. We also present the discovery of an additional transiting planet, TOI-5799 c, that we identified in the TESS data and validated using the SHERLOCK pipeline. TOI-5799 c is a super-Earth with a radius of $R_p=1.76^{+0.11}_{-0.10}$ $R_\oplus$. Its orbital period and its equilibrium temperature are 14.01 days and $T_{\rm eq}=337\pm11$ K, which place it near the inner edge of the habitable zone of its this http URL show that these planets are suitable for both radial velocity follow-up and atmospheric characterization. They orbit bright (< 11 $K_{mag}$) early M dwarfs, making them accessible for precise mass measurements. The combination of the planet sizes and stellar brightness of their host stars also make them suitable targets for atmospheric exploration with the JWST. Such studies may provide insights into planet formation and evolution, as TOI-1743-b, TOI-5799-b, and TOI-5799-c lie within the so-called radius valley, while TOI-6223-b is located on the Neptunian ridge in the period-radius plane.

 - **Abstract**
 From 2002 to 2025, the Hubble Space Telescope's Advanced Camera for Surveys has suffered in the harsh radiation environment above the protection of the Earth's atmosphere. We track the degradation of its image quality, as Solar protons and galactic cosmic rays have damaged its photosensitive charge-coupled device (CCD) imaging sensors. The damage is consistent with defects in the silicon lattice that have all annealed into one of three configurations. The rate of damage in low Earth orbit is modulated by $18.5^{+4.5}_{-0.5}$ per cent during an 11 year Solar cycle, peaking $430^{+11}_{-5}$ days after Solar minimum as recorded in the number of sunspots. We also present the open-source Algorithm for Charge Transfer Inefficiency correction (ArCTIc) v7. This models the (instantaneous or gradual) capture of photoelectrons into lattice defects, and their release after (a discrete set or continuum of) characteristic time delays, which creates spurious trailing in an image. Calibrated using the trailing of hot pixels, and applied during post-processing of astronomical images, ArCTIc can correct 99.5% of Charge Transfer Inefficiency trailing averaged over the camera's lifetime, and 99.9% of trailing in the worst-affected recent data.

          An emulator-based forecasting on astrophysics and cosmology with 21 cm and density cross-correlations during EoR

 - **Abstract**
 The 21 cm signal arising from fluctuations in the neutral hydrogen field, and its cross-correlation with other tracers of cosmic density, are promising probes of the high-redshift Universe. In this study, we assess the potential of the 21 cm power spectrum, along with its cross power spectrum with dark matter density and associated bias, to constrain both astrophysics during the reionization era and the underlying cosmology. Our methodology involves emulating these estimators using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), enabling efficient exploration of the parameter space. Utilizing a photon-conserving semi-numerical reionization model, we construct emulators at a fixed redshift ($z = 7.0$) for $k$-modes relevant to upcoming telescopes such as SKA-Low. We generate $\sim7000$ training samples by varying both cosmological and astrophysical parameters along with initial conditions, achieving high accuracy when compared to true simulation outputs. While forecasting, the model involves five free parameters: three cosmological ($\Omega_m$, $h$, $\sigma_8$) and two astrophysical (ionizing efficiency, $\zeta$, and minimum halo mass, $M_{\mathrm{min}}$). Using a fiducial model at the mid-reionization stage, we create a mock dataset and perform forecasting with the trained emulators. Assuming a 5% observational uncertainty combined with emulator error, we find that the 21 cm and 21 cm-density cross power spectra can constrain the Hubble parameter ($h$) to better than 6% at a confidence interval of 95%, with tight constraints on the global neutral fraction ($Q_{\mathrm{HI}}$). The inclusion of bias information further improves constraints on $\sigma_8$ (< 10% at 95% confidence). Finally, robustness tests with two alternate ionization states and a variant with higher observational uncertainty show that the ionization fractions are still reliably recovered, even when cosmological constraints weaken.

 T CrB is a nearby symbiotic binary and a recurrent nova with a period of ca. 80 years. The next eruption is expected to take place in 2025 or 2026. We present our pre-eruption observations made in ALMA frequency Bands 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8 in August to November 2024 and constrain the properties of the environment into which the imminent next nova will erupt. We find that in the second half of 2024, the quiescent T CrB was a faint mm source with a spectral energy distribution well described by a powerlaw with index $\alpha=$0.56$\pm$0.11 and a flux density of ca. 0.1 mJy at 44 GHz and 0.4 mJy at 400 GHz. There is no significant line emission. This is in agreement with expectations for free-free emission from the partially ionized wind of the red giant donor star and, in extrapolation to 35 GHz, a factor 5 fainter than the emission observed in 2016/17 during the latest high state. Comparing the spectra from that high-state between 13.5 GHz and 35 GHz with our spectrum from 2024, our spectrum is softer. The spectral index is on average lower by 0.34$\pm$0.11 . Our per-band and aggregate bandwidth images of T CrB show an unresolved point source with no evidence for extended structure. A simple model of a free-free emitting, fully-ionized stellar wind seems to describe well the 2016/17 high state of T CrB but not our 2024 ALMA measurements with their low flux and high turnover frequency suggesting that in 2024, the wind was far from fully ionized.

 - **Abstract**
 The Pierre Auger Observatory is the largest air-shower detector in the world, offering unparalleled exposure to photons with energies above $5 \times 10^{16}$ eV. Since the start of data collection almost two decades ago, numerous searches for photons have been conducted using the detection systems of the Observatory. These searches have led to the most stringent upper limits on the diffuse photon flux. These limits place severe constraints on current models regarding the origin of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays and emphasize the significant capabilities of the Pierre Auger Observatory in the context of multimessenger astronomy at the highest energies. This contribution provides an overview of the ongoing efforts to search for high-energy photons in the data from the Pierre Auger Observatory. The latest results from searches for the diffuse photon flux will be presented, along with follow-up investigations for photons associated with transient events, such as gravitational wave detections. Furthermore, future prospects will be discussed in light of the ongoing AugerPrime detector upgrade, which will enhance the sensitivity of the Observatory to photons up to the highest energies.

 - **Abstract**
 Stochastic inflation rests on the separate-universe approximation, i.e. the ability to describe long-wavelength fluctuations in an inflating universe as homogeneous perturbations of its background dynamics. Although this approximation is valid in most cases, it has been recently pointed out that it breaks down during transition periods between attractor and non-attractor phases. Such transitions are ubiquitous in single-field models giving rise to enhanced perturbations at small scales, that are required to form primordial black holes. The current inability to apply the stochastic-inflation program in such models is therefore one of the main obstacles to investigating the role of backreaction in primordial-black-hole scenarios. In this work, we show how gradient interactions can be incorporated in stochastic inflation, via a set of Langevin equations of higher dimension. We apply our formalism to a few cases of interest, including one with a sharp transition. In all cases, in the classical limit we show that gradient corrections as predicted from cosmological perturbation theory are properly recovered. We uncover the existence of a "pullback" effect by which the tails of the first-passage-time distributions are dampened by gradient interactions. We finally discuss the role of backreaction in the presence of gradient interactions.

          Identification of recurrent novae from parametric modeling of the optical light curve

 - **Abstract**
 Novae, characterized by sudden brightening in binary star systems, are categorized into classical novae (CNe) and recurrent novae (RNe) based on their recurrence timescales. However, identifying RNe, which occur within 100 years, presents observational challenges. A reasonable signature of RNe has been theorized and statistically validated to address this -- the presence of a plateau in the optical light curve. Among the known RNe, except T CrB and V3890 Sgr displaying S-class light curve, the rest 9 out of 11 have a P-class light curve. But classical novae can also present plateaus, which further complicates the problem of distinguishing CNe from RNe just based on plateau. Hence, in this study, we aim to conduct a phenomenological analysis of P-class light curves to comment on the recurrence nature of novae. We utilize data primarily from the AAVSO database and identify a parameter space to represent all P-class light curves, anticipating distinct parameter distributions for CNe and RNe. Analysis of parameter distributions successfully distinguishes RNe from CNe and reveals potential connections with white dwarf mass and mass accretion rate, which are the key factors. Our method indicates KT Eri to be a recurrent nova, consistent with a recent study, despite only one observed outburst. The analysis also indicates the possibility of recurrence for V2860 Ori, a prediction that may be tested by deep search for nova super-remnant for this source. Our method demonstrates the feasibility of distinguishing P-class classical and recurrent novae based solely on the optical light curve. As observations of new novae increase, this method holds promise for more precise predictions of nova recurrence nature in the future.

 The Extreme Universe Space Observatory on a Super Pressure Balloon 2 (EUSO-SPB2) flew in May of 2023, marking an important step towards the observation of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECR) and neutrino-induced showers from space. The ultimate goal of this endeavor is to complement ground-based detectors and achieve unprecedented exposure and nearly uniform full-sky coverage at the highest energies, thereby enabling charged particle astronomy and enriching the multi-messenger approach to high-energy astrophysics and astroparticle physics. As a pathfinder to the POEMMA mission (Probe Of Extreme Multi-Messenger Astrophysics), EUSO-SPB2 flew two distinct cameras at the focus of two Schmidt telescopes, one made of multi-anode photomultiplier tubes (MAPMTs), looking towards the nadir for fluorescence light detection, the other made of Silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs), looking towards the limb of the Earth for direct Cherenkov light detection. The flight was terminated prematurely due to a failure in the balloon, and thus no showers were detected in the fluorescence mode. However, several lower-energy (PeV scale) cosmic-ray events were observed in the Cherenkov channel. The data collected by both telescopes also confirmed the pertinence and maturity of the technology. We will report on the mission's cosmic ray results, and lessons learned for future balloon and satellite missions, notably the POEMMA Balloon with Radio (PBR), currently under development.

 - **Abstract**
 If nonrelativistic dark matter and radiation are allowed to interact, reaching an approximate thermal equilibrium, this interaction induces a bulk viscous pressure changing the effective one-fluid description of the universe dynamics. By modeling such components as perfect fluids, a cosmologically relevant bulk viscous pressure emerges for dark matter particle masses in the range of $1\,\text{eV} - 10\,\text{eV}$ keeping thermal equilibrium with the radiation. Such a transient bulk viscosity introduces significant effects in the expansion rate near the matter-radiation equality (redshift $z_{\text{eq}} \sim 3400$) and at late times (leading to a higher inferred value of the Hubble constant $H_0$). We use the recent DESI DR2 BAO data to place an upper bound on the free parameter of the model $\tau_\text{eq}$ which represents the time scale in which each component follows its own internal perfect fluid dynamics until thermalization occurs. Our main result is encoded in the bound $\tau_\text{eq} < 1.84 \times 10^{-10} $ s (2$\sigma$), with the corresponding dimensionless bulk coefficient $\tilde{\xi} H_0/H_{eq}<5.94\times10^{-4}$ (2$\sigma$). In practice, this rules out any possible interaction between radiation and dark matter prior to the recombination epoch.

 The next generation of imaging surveys, including the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), Euclid, and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, will place unprecedented constraints on cosmology using weak gravitational lensing. To fully exploit their statistical power, shear measurement methods must achieve sub-percent accuracy while mitigating systematic biases from noise, the point-spread function (PSF), blending, and shear-dependent detection. The analytical calibration framework (\texttt{AnaCal}) has demonstrated such accuracy but requires adding noise to images, reducing their effective depth. We introduce Deep-Field Analytical Calibration (\textsc{deep-field~}\texttt{AnaCal}), an extension of \texttt{AnaCal} that leverages deep-field images to compute shear responses while preserving wide-field statistical power. We validate the method on isolated and blended galaxy simulations with LSST-like seeing and noise, showing it meets the stringent requirement of multiplicative bias $|m| < 3\times10^{-3}$ at 99.7% confidence. Relative to standard \texttt{AnaCal} on wide-field images, this method improves effective galaxy number density from $17$ to $30$ arcmin$^{-2}$ for simulated 10-year LSST data. Assuming deep fields with $10\times$ the exposure of wide fields, we find the pixel noise variance in shear estimation is reduced by $30%$ and the overall shear uncertainty by $\sim 25%$. Finally, we assess sample variance impacts using the LSST Deep Drilling Fields strategy, finding an equivalent calibration uncertainty of $\lesssim 0.3%$. These results establish \textsc{deep-field~}\texttt{AnaCal} as a promising approach for shear calibration in upcoming weak lensing surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 In recent years, the number of white dwarfs (WDs) showing infrared (IR) excesses, attributed to circumstellar dust disks, has grown significantly. Gaseous disks have also been detected in some WDs with dust. We obtained optical spectra with Gemini/GMOS for thirteen WDs exhibiting IR excesses to search for gaseous components. No Ca II emission was detected, suggesting the gas phase may be short-lived compared to the dusty stage. Combining our data with literature, we compiled the largest sample of WDs with and without gas disks. We find no significant differences in stellar properties between the two groups, although disks with gas may be, on average, brighter. The detection rate of Ca II emission supports the idea that the gas phase persists for only a fraction of the total disk lifetime. A more definitive assessment will likely require dedicated searches for both gas and dust across large WD samples.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first polarimetric observations of the third discovered interstellar object, 3I/ATLAS (C/2025 N1), obtained pre-perihelion with FORS2/VLT, ALFOSC/NOT, and FoReRo2/RCC, over a phase angle range of 7.7-22.4°. This marks the second ever polarimetric study of an interstellar object, the first distinguishing 2I/Borisov from most Solar System comets by its higher positive polarisation. Our polarimetric measurements as a function of phase angle reveal that 3I is characterised by an deep and narrow negative polarisation branch, reaching a minimum value of -2.7% at phase angle 7°, and an inversion angle of 17° -- a combination unprecedented among asteroids and comets, including 2I/Borisov. At very small phase angles, the extrapolated slope of the polarisation phase curve is consistent with that of certain small trans-Neptunian objects and Centaur Pholus, consistent with independent spectroscopic evidence for a red, possibly water-ice-bearing object. Imaging confirms a diffuse coma present from our earliest observations, though no strong polarimetric features are spatial resolved. These findings may demonstrate that 3I represents a distinct type of comet, expanding the diversity of known interstellar bodies.

 - **Abstract**
 Rapid progress in cosmological Large Scale Structure (LSS) surveys motivates precise theoretical predictions. The Effective Field Theory of Large-Scale Structure (EFTofLSS) is routinely applied to data, and requires fast computation of its predictions when sampling the large space of cosmological parameters. Going beyond existing one-loop techniques, we present a method to rapidly evaluate the two-loop power spectrum. Our method decomposes the typically small difference between a given linear power spectrum and a reference power spectrum into a cosmology-independent basis of functions resembling massive scalar propagators in Quantum Field Theory. By taking the leading terms in such a small difference, we numerically evaluate the cosmology-independent loop integrals where in the integrand only the relevant combinations of basis functions appear. We achieve an efficient numerical evaluation via physically motivated local ultraviolet subtractions and by arranging the cancellation of infrared singularities locally in the integrands. Final predictions are obtained by contracting these precomputed integrals with the cosmology-dependent coordinates of the expansion in the fixed basis. We present and publicly release the precomputed integrals for the renormalized two-loop dark-matter power spectrum in the EFTofLSS. These require eight EFT counterterms, which include the effect of generated vorticity, and are sufficient to analyze the lensing galaxy signal in LSS surveys at this order.

          Rethinking mass transfer: a unified semi-analytical framework for circular and eccentric binaries. I. Orbital evolution due to conservative mass transfer

 - **Abstract**
 Mass transfer (MT) is a fundamental process in stellar evolution. While MT in circular orbits is well studied, observations indicate that it also occurs in eccentric ones. To date, no framework simultaneously accounts for both conservative and non-conservative MT across arbitrary eccentricities while also incorporating the donor star`s spin. We present a new semi-analytic framework for the secular orbital evolution of mass-transferring binaries, treating stars as extended bodies and accounting for the donor star`s spin. The model is applicable to both circular and eccentric orbits and accommodates conservative and non-conservative MT across a broad range of mass ratios and stellar spins. We derive secular, orbit-averaged equations describing the orbital evolution by treating MT, mass loss, and angular momentum loss as perturbations to the general two-body problem. Assuming conservative MT, we compare our results to previous models and validate them against numerical integrations. Our model predicts stronger orbital widening at a given mass ratio than previous models. For circular orbits, we find that the transitional mass ratio $q_{trans,a}$, which separates orbital widening from shrinkage, increases from $q_{trans,a} = 1$ up to $q_{trans,a} \sim 1.5$ when accounting for extended bodies. For eccentric orbits, the model predicts a broader parameter space for both orbital widening and eccentricity pumping. We find that stable MT naturally explains the observed correlation between longer orbital periods and higher eccentricities, providing a robust mechanism for the formation of wide and eccentric post-interaction binaries. Our model can be integrated into binary evolution and population synthesis codes to consistently treat conservative and non-conservative MT in arbitrarily eccentric orbits with applications ranging from MT on the main sequence to gravitational-wave progenitors.

 - **Abstract**
 Advances in machine learning over the past decade have resulted in a proliferation of algorithmic applications for encoding, characterizing, and acting on complex data that may contain many high dimensional features. Recently, the emergence of deep-learning models trained across very large datasets has created a new paradigm for machine learning in the form of Foundation Models. Foundation Models are programs trained on very large and broad datasets with an extensive number of parameters. Once built, these powerful, and flexible, models can be utilized in less resource-intensive ways to build many different, downstream applications that can integrate previously disparate, multimodal data. The development of these applications can be done rapidly and with a much lower demand for machine learning expertise. And the necessary infrastructure and models themselves are already being established within agencies such as NASA and ESA. At NASA this work is across several divisions of the Science Mission Directorate including the NASA Goddard and INDUS Large Language Models and the Prithvi Geospatial Foundation Model. And ESA initiatives to bring Foundation Models to Earth observations has led to the development of TerraMind. A workshop was held by the NASA Ames Research Center and the SETI Institute, in February 2025, to investigate the potential of Foundation Models for astrobiological research and to determine what steps would be needed to build and utilize such a model or models. This paper shares the findings and recommendations of that workshop, and describes clear near-term, and future opportunities in the development of a Foundation Model (or Models) for astrobiology applications. These applications would include a biosignature, or life characterization, task, a mission development and operations task, and a natural language task for integrating and supporting astrobiology research needs.

 - **Abstract**
 The Large Area Telescope (LAT) on board the \emph{Fermi} Gamma-ray Space Telescope has been continuously providing good quality survey data of the entire sky in the high energy range from 30 MeV to 500 GeV and above since August 2008. A succession of gamma-ray source catalogs is published after a comprehensive analysis of the \emph{Fermi}--LAT data. The most recent release of data in the fourth \emph{Fermi}--LAT catalog of gamma-ray sources (4FGL-DR4), based on the first 14 years of observations in the energy band 50 MeV-1 TeV, contains 7195 sources. A large fraction ($\sim$ 33\%) of this population has no known counterparts in the lower wave bands. Such high energy gamma-ray sources are referred to as unassociated or unidentified. An appropriate classification of these objects into known type of gamma-ray sources such as the active galactic nuclei or pulsars is essential for population studies and pointed multi-wavelength observations to probe the radiative processes. In this work, we perform a detailed classification of the unassociated sources reported in the 4FGL-DR4 catalog using two supervised machine learning techniques-Random Forest and Extreme Gradient Boosting. We mainly focus on the identification of new gamma-ray pulsar candidates by making use of different observational features derived from the long-term observations with the \emph{Fermi}--LAT and reported in the incremental 4FGL-DR4 catalog. We also explore the effects of data balancing approach on the classification of the \emph{Fermi}--LAT unassociated sources.

 - **Abstract**
 Precise stellar ages are fundamental to Galactic archaeology. However, obtaining reliable age estimates and uncertainties for field stars has been a long-standing challenge. We test the fidelity of ages from recent catalogs of giants and subgiants using wide binaries, whose components formed at the same time and thus should have consistent inferred ages. We find that subgiant ages based on spectroscopic metallicities from Xiang & Rix (2022) are generally consistent within their reported uncertainties, implying that fractional uncertainties of 5-10% are realistically achievable. In contrast, we find that published photometric subgiant ages and red giant ages underestimate true uncertainties by factors of 2-5. These results demonstrate that accurate metallicity and $\alpha$-element abundances are essential for precise isochrone ages and establish wide binaries as a powerful, model-independent benchmark for calibrating stellar age measurements in the era of large spectroscopic surveys.

          Tracing Planetary Accretion in a 3 Gyr-old Hydrogen-Rich White Dwarf: The Extremely Polluted Atmosphere of LSPM J0207+3331

 - **Abstract**
 We report the detection of 13 heavy elements (Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Sr) in the photosphere of LSPM J0207+3331, a ~3 Gyr old hydrogen-rich white dwarf with an effective temperature comparable to that of the Sun. Upper limits on carbon, obtained through the absence of molecular CH, suggest accretion from a carbon-volatile-depleted source. The accreted parent body exhibits slight deficits of Mg and Si relative to Fe but otherwise bulk Earth-like abundance patterns; a reasonable interpretation is that LSPM J0207+3331 is accreting a massive differentiated rocky body that had a core mass fraction higher than the Earth's. The high level of pollution indicates that substantial accretion events can still occur even after 3 Gyr of cooling. We also detect weak Ca II H & K line-core emission, making this only the second known isolated polluted white dwarf to exhibit this phenomenon and suggesting the presence of additional physical processes in or above the upper atmosphere. Our analysis also highlights the critical importance of including heavy elements in the model atmosphere structure calculations for highly polluted hydrogen-rich white dwarfs. Neglecting their contribution significantly impacts the inferred thermodynamic structure, leading to inaccuracies in derived stellar parameters. Finally, we show that the observed 11.3 microns infrared excess can be explained by a single silicate dust disk rather than a two-ring disk model.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive comparison between legacy and modern evolutionary models for giant exoplanets, using our planetary evolution code, APPLE, to emulate and extend previous studies. Our analysis isolates and quantifies the impact of recent physical advances motivated by detailed modeling of Jupiter and Saturn, including updated hydrogen-helium and heavy-element equations of state, helium rain, "fuzzy" cores, and non-adiabatic, inhomogeneous envelopes, alongside improved atmospheric boundary conditions that incorporate ammonia cloud physics. We first examine the influence of each new physical ingredient individually, then construct combined baseline models for masses between 0.3 to 4 Jupiter masses to assess their collective effect on planetary structure and observable properties. We find that the adoption of modern equations of state and realistic heavy-element distributions leads to systematic, but sometimes subtle, differences (~5 to 10%) in radius evolution, while helium rain and the treatment of convection can significantly alter thermal histories and atmospheric compositions (by ~5 to 20%). These updated physical processes must be incorporated into the next-generation exoplanet evolutionary models to achieve physically consistent interpretations of planetary observations.

          A Vertically Orientated Dark Matter Halo Marks a Flip of the Galactic Disk

 - **Abstract**
 Unveiling the 3D shape of the Milky Way's dark-matter halo is critical to understanding its formation history. We created an innovative dynamical model with minimal assumptions on the internal dynamical structures and accommodates a highly flexible triaxial DM halo. By applying the method to 6D phase-space data of K-giant stars from LAMOST + Gaia, we robustly determine the 3D dark-matter distribution of the Milky Way out to approximately 50 kpc. We discover a triaxial, nearly oblate dark-matter halo with $q_{\rm DM} = Z/X= 0.92\pm0.08$, $p_{\rm DM} = Y/X= 0.8\pm0.2$ averagely within 50 kpc, where $Z$ axis is defined perpendicular to the stellar disk. The axes ratio $q_{\rm DM} > p_{\rm DM}$ is strongly preferred; the long-intermediate axis plane of the dark-matter halo is unexpectedly vertical to the Galactic disk, yet aligned with the `plane of satellites'. This striking configuration suggests that the Galactic disk has flipped, likely torqued by minor mergers, from an original alignment with the dark-matter halo and satellite plane, as supported by Milky Way analogues from Auriga and TNG 50. By allowing $q_{\rm DM}(r)$ and $p_{\rm DM}(r)$ vary with radii, we find tentative evidence that the dark-matter halo is twisted, being more oblate in the inner regions, and only become vertically aligned at $r\gtrsim 20$ kpc, also consistent with the prediction of the disk flip scenario. Such disk reorientation is non-trivial yet its physical mechanism is straightforward to comprehend and naturally originates a vertical satellite plane. Our findings offer a unified framework that links dark-matter halo orientation, satellite alignment, and disk evolution, reinforcing the internal consistency of the Milky Way in $\Lambda$CDM model.

          That's so Retro: The Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus Merger Trajectory as the Origin of the Chemical Abundance Bimodality in the Milky Way Disk

 - **Abstract**
 The Milky Way (MW) is thought to have experienced a $\sim$3:1 mass-ratio merger event near redshift $z\sim2$ with a significantly retrograde trajectory. This now-disrupted dwarf galaxy is commonly known as the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE). In this paper, we investigate the impact of the GSE merger trajectory on metal abundances in the MW disk. We construct numerical models of Galactic chemical evolution (GCE) incorporating radial gas flows to account for angular momentum transport during the merger event. Unlike prograde trajectories, radial and retrograde mergers are generally accompanied by a major sinking event in which much of the interstellar medium falls toward the Galactic center. This effect leads to a net decrease in surface density across much of the disk. Ongoing Type Ia supernova explosions then drive a rapid decline in [$\alpha$/Fe] due to the lowered gas supply. Consequently, radial and retrograde trajectories increase (decrease) the number of low (high) [$\alpha$/Fe] stellar populations relative to prograde trajectories. If high [$\alpha$/Fe] stars form in sufficient numbers through other mechanisms, the effect of the retrograde trajectory can produce a bimodal [$\alpha$/Fe] distribution at fixed [Fe/H], as observed in the MW. In models dominated by low [$\alpha$/Fe] stellar populations, a bimodality does not arise because the retrograde trajectory cannot increase the number of high [$\alpha$/Fe] stars. More broadly, our results highlight the importance of gas dynamics in GCE models featuring major merger events.

 - **Abstract**
 Direct observations of exoplanet and brown dwarf companions with near-infrared interferometry, first enabled by the dual-field mode of VLTI/GRAVITY, provide unique measurements of the objects' orbital motion and atmospheric composition. Here, we compile a homogeneous library of all exoplanet and brown dwarf K-band spectra observed by GRAVITY thus far. We re-reduce all available GRAVITY dual-field high-contrast data and, where companions are detected, extract their ~2.0-2.4 $\mu$m K-band contrast spectra. We then derive stellar model atmospheres for all employed flux references that we use to convert the companion contrast into companion flux spectra. Solely from the resulting GRAVITY spectra, we extract spectral types, spectral indices, and bulk physical properties for all companions. Finally, and with the help of age constraints from the literature, we also derive isochronal masses for most companions using evolutionary models. The resulting library contains R ~ 500 GRAVITY spectra of 39 substellar companions from late M to late T spectral type, including the entire L-T transition. Throughout this transition, a shift from CO-dominated late M- and L-type dwarfs to CH4-dominated T-type dwarfs can be observed in the K-band. The GRAVITY spectra alone constrain the objects' bolometric luminosity to typically within $\pm$0.15 dex. The derived isochronal masses agree with dynamical masses from the literature where available, except for HD 4113 c for which we confirm its previously reported potential underluminosity. Medium resolution spectroscopy of substellar companions with GRAVITY provides insight into the carbon chemistry and the cloudiness of these objects' atmospheres. It also constrains these objects' bolometric luminosity which can yield measurements of their formation entropy if combined with dynamical masses, for instance from Gaia and GRAVITY astrometry.

 - **Abstract**
 We extend the Sonora Diamondback brown dwarf evolution models to higher effective temperatures to treat the evolution of younger, higher mass objects. Due to an upper temperature limit of $T_\mathrm{eff}=$2400 K in the original Sonora Diamondback model grid, high mass objects ($M\geq$ 0.05 $M_\mathrm{\odot}=$ 52.4 $M_\mathrm{J}$) were limited to ages of $\gtrsim$ 100 Myr. To include the early evolution of brown dwarfs at $T_\mathrm{eff}>$ 2400 K, we use existing and new SPHINX cloud-free model atmosphere calculations of temperature structures of M-type atmospheres. These atmospheres range from $T_\mathrm{eff}$ 2000--4000 K, log($g$) 3.0--5.5, and metallicity [M/H] $-$0.5 to $+$0.5. This combination of Diamondback and SPHINX atmospheres, with a transition across $T_\mathrm{eff}$ 2000--2400 K, allows us to calculate evolution tracks, and infrared photometry and colors, for ages $>$ 1 Myr and masses from above the hydrogen burning minimum mass down to planetary masses. The Hayashi phase of massive brown dwarf evolution (ages $<$ 10--100 Myr) at low surface gravity leads to nearly constant $T_\mathrm{eff}$ values, at effective temperatures much lower than would be obtained from simply extrapolating backwards from evolution tracks at older ages.

          The polar debris disc around 99 Herculis: A potential signpost for polar circumbinary planets

 - **Abstract**
 The nearby binary star system 99 Herculis (99 Her) is host to the only known polar-aligned circumbinary debris disc. We investigate the hypothesis that the narrow structure of this circumbinary disc is sculpted by the gravitational influence of one or more unseen polar circumbinary planets. We first establish the theoretically viable parameter space for a sculpting planet by considering dynamical stability and clearing mechanisms, including the chaotic zone, Hill radius, diffusion, and polar alignment timescales. We then use $N$-body simulations to test three specific architectures: a single planet interior to the disc, a single planet exterior, and a two-planet system bracketing the disc. Our simulations demonstrate that single-planet models are insufficient to reproduce the observed morphology, as they can only truncate one edge of the disc while leaving the other dynamically extended. In contrast, the two-planet shepherding model successfully carves both the inner and outer edges, confining the debris into a narrow, stable polar ring consistent with observations. We conclude that the structure of the 99 Her debris disc is most plausibly explained by the presence of two shepherding, polar circumbinary planets. We present a specific, testable model for this unique system, which elucidates the pivotal role of planetary bodies in sculpting the architecture of debris discs.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a detailed analysis of the white dwarf cooling sequence (WD CS) in omega Centauri based on combined Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and JWST observations. Our analysis confirms the previously reported split - based on HST observations in ultraviolet filters - in the upper part of the WD CS, consistent with the presence of two distinct WD populations, and extends it to a significantly fainter and cooler limit (down to ~8000 K), corresponding to cooling ages of about 1 Gyr. We used artificial star (AS) tests and cooling models to confirm that the split is evidence of two WD populations with different masses and progenitors: one sequence of canonical WDs produced by the He-normal progenitors, and one sequence of low-mass WDs originated from the cluster He-rich component. We show that the fraction of WDs from the He-rich component in the outer regions is smaller than that found in the innermost regions. We also studied the kinematics of WDs and showed that in the outer regions, the velocity distribution of WDs from He-rich progenitors is slightly radially anisotropic, while that of canonical WDs is slightly tangentially anisotropic. Both the radial variation of the fraction of WDs from the He-rich population and the difference between their velocity distribution and that of canonical WDs are consistent with spatial and kinematic differences previously found for He-rich and He-normal main-sequence (MS) stars and in general agreement with models predicting that He-rich stars form more centrally concentrated than He-normal stars.

We provide a detailed derivation of the gravitational wave signal sourced from the anisotropic emission of neutrinos and provide the total (fluid sourced and neutrino sourced) gravitational waves signal generated in our models. We discuss the templatablity of this low-frequency signal, which is useful for future work involving matched filtering for signal detection and parameter estimation.

 - **Abstract**
 The evolution of space technology in recent years, fueled by advancements in computing such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), has profoundly transformed our capacity to explore the cosmos. Missions like the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have made information about distant objects more easily accessible, resulting in extensive amounts of valuable data. As part of this work-in-progress study, we are working to create an atmospheric absorption spectrum prediction model for exoplanets. The eventual model will be based on both collected observational spectra and synthetic spectral data generated by the ROCKE-3D general circulation model (GCM) developed by the climate modeling program at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS). In this initial study, spline curves are used to describe the bin heights of simulated atmospheric absorption spectra as a function of one of the values of the planetary parameters. Bayesian Adaptive Exploration is then employed to identify areas of the planetary parameter space for which more data are needed to improve the model. The resulting system will be used as a forward model so that planetary parameters can be inferred given a planet's atmospheric absorption spectrum. This work is expected to contribute to a better understanding of exoplanetary properties and general exoplanet climates and habitability.

 Astronomical surveys have identified numerous exoplanets with bulk compositions that are unlike the planets of the Solar System, including rocky super-Earths and gas-enveloped sub-Neptunes. Observing the atmospheres of these objects provides information on the geological processes that influence their climates and surfaces. In this Review, we summarize the current understanding of these planets, including insights into the interaction between the atmosphere and interior based on observations made with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). We describe the expected climatic and interior planetary regimes for planets with different density and stellar flux and how those regimes might be observationally distinguished. We also identify the observational, experimental, and theoretical innovations that will be required to characterize Earth-like exoplanets.

          Constraints on the interacting holographic dark energy models: implications from background and perturbations data

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we employ a two-step method to analyze models of holographic dark energy (HDE) and interacting holographic dark energy (IHDE), incorporating three distinct dark energy (DE)-dark matter (DM) interaction terms. First, using the latest background dataset, we conduct a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis to constrain the free parameters of the models. Then, we assess the models against each other using the key background parameters and compare them to the $\Lambda$CDM standard model. Our results show that at high redshifts, the equation of state (EoS) parameter related to the models for both homogeneous and clustered DE cases falls within the quintessence region. However, as we approach the present time, all models except HDE transition into the phantom region, and two models cross the phantom line earlier than others. In the next step, we focus on the evolution of perturbations in DE and DM. Using background and growth rate data, we constrain parameters including $\sigma_8$. We then investigate the evolution of the growth rate of matter perturbations, $f\sigma_8(z)$, and its deviation, $\Delta f \sigma_8$, from the $\Lambda$CDM model. The HDE model shows the best agreement with observational data, while other models predict varying growth rates compared to $\Lambda$CDM. Finally, we demonstrate through Akaike and Bayesian information criteria (AIC and BIC) analysis that the compatibility of models with observational data depends on the type of data used, the DE-DM interaction term, and the assumptions regarding DE homogeneity and clustering. Our results suggest that homogeneous DE models yield more agreement with observational data than clustered DE models.

          Tides from the cloud can induce the fast disruption of star clusters and offer an explanation for Gaia strings

 - **Abstract**
 Young stars form in clusters within molecular clouds, but older stars are evenly distributed across the galactic disk, necessitating an explanation for cluster dissolution. We analytically study tidal forces from cold molecular clouds as a key mechanism for accelerated cluster disruption. Cloud tides, caused by the gravitational pull of the parent cloud along the radial direction, arise from the spatial gradient of gravitational acceleration and drive cluster disruption. This mechanism activates after gas expulsion and remains effective until the cloud is disrupted by stellar feedback or the cluster moves away. Cloud tides act on gas-deprived clusters, causing exponential expansion on a tidal timescale of $t_{\rm tidal,ext} = \sqrt{3/(8\pi G\rho_{\rm mean})}$, where $\rho_{\rm mean}$ is the cloud's density at the cluster's location. With a duration of a few Myr, cloud tides can lead to a 10 times increase of the cluster size, producing bar-like elongated stellar aggregations resembling Gaia strings. These results establish cloud tides as a potentially important mechanism for star cluster disruption.

 We report multi-fiber, medium-resolution spectroscopy of the Rosette Nebula with full spatial coverages, and present a table of the nebular parameters based on the spatially-resolved measurements of emission lines. These new observations were conducted through the Medium-Resolution Spectroscopic Survey of Nebulae (MRS-N) on the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST). Comprehensive analyses were performed on a total of 3854 high-quality nebular spectra, so far the most extensive spectral dataset available for this nebula that encompasses an area of 4.52 square degrees. Various physical parameters, including relative line intensities, radial velocities (RVs), and full widths at half maximum (FWHMs), were derived through measurements of the H-alpha, [N II] 6548,6584 and [S II] 6716,6731 emission lines detected in the LAMOST MRS-N spectra. For the first time, we found a bow-shaped feature in the spatial distribution of RVs of the Rosette Nebula. Moreover, the spatial distributions of RVs and FWHMs, as well as additional parameters such as gas temperature and turbulent velocity in the vicinity of the nebula, indicate possible interaction between Rosette and the nearby supernova remnant (SNR), Monoceros Loop. Our new observations provide indispensable measurements of the Rosette Nebula. The parameter table in particular can be used as valuable constraint on the chemo-dynamical modeling of the nebula, which will enable deeper understanding of the characteristics of this H II region.

 - **Abstract**
 A systematic study of 80 known pulsars observed at 185 MHz has been conducted using archival incoherent-sum data from the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA). The dataset comprises 48 drift-scan observations from the MWA Voltage Capture System, covering approximately 30,000 square degrees of sky with sensitivities reaching about 8 mJy in the deepest regions. An optimized PRESTO-based search pipeline was deployed on the China SKA Regional Centre infrastructure. This enabled the detection of 80 known pulsars, representing a 60 percent increase over the previous census. Notably, this includes 30 pulsars with first-time detections at this frequency, of which pulse profiles and flux densities are presented. Spectral, scattering, and pulse-width properties were examined for the sample, providing observational constraints on low-frequency turnover, propagation effects, and width-period relations. This study highlights the value of wide-field, low-frequency time-domain surveys for constraining pulsar emission and propagation, offering empirical insights that may inform future observations with instruments such as SKA-Low.

 - **Abstract**
 We perform 3 dimensional moving-mesh hydrodynamical simulations of bubble nebulae around ultraluminous X-ray sources, using state-of-the-art software AREPO. We use a Monte-Carlo method to inject outflows with uniform mass outflow rate and momentum, in a conical funnel with a specific half opening angle. Simulation results show that the morphology of the bubble is determined by the initial momentum of the outflows, while the mechanical power of the outflows only influences the size of the bubble without changing its shape. Low mechanical power also results in a short cooling timescale of the system, leading to an early collapse of the bubble shell. The half opening angle of the outflows and the viewing angle of the system determine the observed bubble eccentricity together. Compared with the observational morphology of the ULX bubble sources NGC 55 ULX-1 and NGC 1313 X-2, our simulation favors the fact that the high velocity outflows of the accretion disks in these two systems are confined in a narrow funnel region.

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we explore the impact of various combinations of CMB-independent datasets, including the recent DESI BAO measurements, on the equation of state (EoS) of dark energy and other cosmological parameters within the framework of the dynamical dark energy model ($w$CDM). Assuming a constant EoS parameter for dark energy, we derive constraints on the free parameters of the model using observational datasets such as DESI BAO, BBN, Observational Hubble Data (OHD), and Pantheon Plus (SN$^+$) $\&$ SH0ES. Our analysis examines the deviations of the $w$CDM model from the standard $\Lambda$CDM scenario and assesses its implications for cosmological tensions, particularly the $H_0$ tension [$\text{km} \text{s}^{-1} \text{Mpc}^{-1}$]. We find that the combination of DESI BAO + BBN + OHD + SN$^+$ (DESI BAO + BBN + OHD + SN$^+$ \&SH0ES) datasets provides constraints on $w_{\mathrm{de}0}$, suggesting a possible deviation from the cosmological constant scenario at a significance level of $1.6\sigma$ ($1.4\sigma$), respectively. Furthermore, we observe an inverse correlation between $w_{\text{de0}}$ and $H_0$, which highlights the role of dark energy dynamics in resolving the tension $H_0$ by approximately $2.1\sigma(0.8\sigma)$ from DESI BAO + BBN + OHD (DESI BAO + BBN + OHD + SN$^+$ \&SH0ES) datasets, respectively. Our findings offer valuable insights into the nature of dark energy and its influence on the cosmic expansion history, with implications for future observational efforts. We utilize the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) to evaluate our model's performance. The results indicate that the $w$CDM model demonstrates superior effectiveness.

 - **Abstract**
 Complex organic molecules (COMs) are observed to be abundant in various astrophysical environments, in particular toward star forming regions they are observed both toward protostellar envelopes as well as shocked regions. Emission spectrum especially of heavier COMs may consists of up to hundreds of lines, where line blending hinders the analysis. However, identifying the molecular composition of the gas leading to the observed millimeter spectra is the first step toward a quantitative analysis. We develop a new method based on supervised machine learning to recognize spectroscopic features of the rotational spectrum of molecules in the 3mm atmospheric transmission band for a list of species including COMs with the aim to obtain a detection probability. We used local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) modeling to build a large set of synthetic spectra of 20 molecular species including COMs with a range of physical conditions typical for star forming regions. We successfully designed and trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that provides detection probabilities of individual species in the spectra. We demonstrate that the produced CNN-model has a robust performance to detect spectroscopic signatures from these species in synthetic spectra. We evaluate its ability to detect molecules according to the noise level, frequency coverage, and line-richness, and also test its performance for incomplete frequency coverage with high detection probabilities for the tested parameter space, and no false predictions. Ultimately, we apply the CNN-model to obtain predictions on observational data from the literature toward line-rich hot-core like sources, where detection probabilities remain reasonable with no false detection. We prove the use of CNNs facilitating the analysis of complex millimeter spectra both on synthetic spectra as well as first tests on observational data.

 - **Abstract**
 The extremely rapid evolution of kilonovae results in spectra that change on an hourly basis. These spectra are key to understanding the processes occurring within the event, but this rapid evolution is an unfamiliar domain compared to other explosive transient events, such as supernovae. In particular, the most obvious P Cygni feature in the spectra of AT2017gfo -- commonly attributed to strontium -- possesses an emission component that emerges after, and ultimately outlives, its associated absorption dip. This delay is theorised to arise from reverberation effects, wherein photons emitted earlier in the kilonova's evolution are scattered before reaching the observer, causing them to be detected at later times. We aim to examine how the finite speed of light -- and therefore the light travel time to an observer -- contributes to the shape and evolution of spectral features in kilonovae. Using a simple model, and tracking the length of the journey photons undertake to an observer, we are able to test the necessity of accounting for this time delay effect when modelling kilonovae. In periods where the photospheric temperature is rapidly evolving, we show spectra synthesised using a time independent approach are visually distinct from those where these time delay effects are accounted for. Therefore, in rapidly evolving events such as kilonovae, time dependence must be taken into account.

 - **Abstract**
 One of the frontier research fields of exoplanetary science is the study of the composition and variability of exoplanetary atmospheres. This field is now moving from the gas giant planets towards the smaller and colder telluric planets, and future instruments like ANDES will focus on the observations of the atmosphere of telluric planets in the habitable zone in reflected light. These future observations will possibly find variable signals due to the view of different hemispheres of the planet. Particularly, the strength of the signal may be linked to the thickness of the atmospheric layer probed, and therefore to the average altitude variations of the planetary surface, that are related to the global geodynamic evolution of the planet. To better prepare for the interpretation and exploitation of these future data, we used Mars as a Solar System analog of a spatially resolved telluric exoplanet. We observed the reflected light of Mars with the high-resolution near-infrared (NIR) spectrograph GIANO-B (widely used in exoplanetary atmospheric studies) during a 3 month period: we studied the spatial and temporal variations of the Martian CO2 signal using the least-squared deconvolution technique (LSD), to mimic as closely as possible the standard exoplanetary atmospheric analysis. We linked the variations found to the well-known Martian geological surface characteristics: we found a clear dependence of the strength of the CO2 signal with the thickness of the Martian atmospheric layer by comparing the retrieved CO2 signal with the altitudes of our pointings. The proposed strategy is promising: it proved to be effective on Mars and may shed light on the variations in the strength of atmospheric signal of telluric exoplanets.

 - **Abstract**
 In the era of exploding survey volumes, traditional methods of spectroscopic analysis are being pushed to their limits. In response, we develop deep-REMAP, a novel deep learning framework that utilizes a regularized, multi-task approach to predict stellar atmospheric parameters from observed spectra. We train a deep convolutional neural network on the PHOENIX synthetic spectral library and use transfer learning to fine-tune the model on a small subset of observed FGK dwarf spectra from the MARVELS survey. We then apply the model to 732 uncharacterized FGK giant candidates from the same survey. When validated on 30 MARVELS calibration stars, deep-REMAP accurately recovers the effective temperature ($T_{\rm{eff}}$), surface gravity ($\log \rm{g}$), and metallicity ([Fe/H]), achieving a precision of, for instance, approximately 75 K in $T_{\rm{eff}}$. By combining an asymmetric loss function with an embedding loss, our regression-as-classification framework is interpretable, robust to parameter imbalances, and capable of capturing non-Gaussian uncertainties. While developed for MARVELS, the deep-REMAP framework is extensible to other surveys and synthetic libraries, demonstrating a powerful and automated pathway for stellar characterization.

          Safely simplifying redshift drift computations in inhomogeneous cosmologies: Insights from LTB Swiss-cheese models

 - **Abstract**
 One of the most important discoveries in cosmology is the accelerated expansion of the Universe. Yet, the accelerated expansion has only ever been measured {\em in}directly. Redshift drift offers a direct observational probe of the Universe's expansion history, with its sign revealing whether there has been acceleration or deceleration between source and observer. Its detection will mark a major milestone in cosmology, offering the first direct measurement of an evolving expansion rate. Given its epistemic importance, it is essential to understand how its measurements can be biased. One possibility of bias comes from cosmological structures. However, theoretical estimates of such effects are difficult to obtain because computing redshift drift in general inhomogeneous cosmologies is computationally demanding, requiring the solution of 24 coupled ordinary differential equations. In this work, we use Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi Swiss-cheese models to show that only the two dominant contributions are needed to achieve percent-level accuracy up to $z = 1$. This allows the reduction of the full system of 24 ODEs to the standard null geodesic equations, significantly simplifying the calculation. \newline\indent Although our analysis is based on idealized Swiss-cheese models with spherical structures, we expect that similar simplifications apply to more complex scenarios, including cosmological N-body simulations. Our analysis thus underpins a practical and robust framework for efficient redshift drift computations applicable to a wider range of inhomogeneous cosmologies.

          The choice of Planck CMB likelihood in cosmological analyses

 - **Abstract**
 We compare cosmological parameters from different Planck sky maps and likelihood pipelines, assessing robustness of cosmological results with respect to the choice of the latest Planck maps-likelihood combination. We show that, for the Planck multipole range retained in combination with ground-based observations, different products give very similar cosmological solutions; small remaining differences are reduced by the addition of other CMB datasets to Planck. In particular, constraints on extended cosmological models benefit from the addition of small-scale power from ground-based experiments and are completely insensitive to the choice of Planck maps and likelihood. For this work we derive and release a nuisance-marginalized dataset and CamSpec-NPIPE-lite likelihood for the Planck NPIPE data injected into the CamSpec likelihood - which are usually used to obtain the reference Planck PR4 cosmology. Using the extracted CMB spectra we show that the additional constraining power for cosmology is coming from polarization at all scales and from temperature at multipoles above 1500 when going from PR3 to PR4. We also show that full marginalization over the CamSpec foreground nuisance parameters can impact parameter inference and model selections when truncating some scales; our new likelihood enables correct combinations with other CMB datasets.

 - **Abstract**
 As is well known, Hubble tension is one of the most serious challenges in cosmology to date. So, it is of interest to measure the Hubble constant by using some new probes independent of cosmic microwave background (CMB) and type Ia supernovae (SNIa). One of the promising probes is the fast radio bursts (FRBs), which could be useful in cosmology. In the literature, the methodology proposed by Macquart {\it et al.} has been widely used, in which both $\rm DM_{IGM}$ and $\rm DM_{host}$ are described by probability distribution functions. Recently, it was found that in order to obtain a Hubble constant $H_0$ consistent with the ones of Planck 2018 and SH0ES by using the current ${\cal O}(100)$ localized FRBs, an unusually large $f_{\rm IGM}$ fairly close to its upper bound $1$ is required, if the narrow prior bounded by $0.5$ for the parameter $F$ in the distribution of $\rm DM_{IGM}$ was used. In fact, a small $F$ is the key to make $H_0$ larger. In the present work, we consider a loose prior for the parameter $F$, and find an unusually low $H_0$ by using 125 localized FRBs. We show that the model with loose $F$ prior is strongly preferred over the one with narrow $F$ prior in all terms of the Bayesian evidence and the information criteria AIC, BIC. So, the great Hubble tension between FRBs, Planck 2018 and SH0ES should be taken seriously. Instead of modifying $\sigma_\Delta=Fz^{-0.5}$ in the distribution of $\rm DM_{IGM}$, here we try to find a new way out by generalizing the distribution of $\rm DM_{host}$ with varying location and scale parameters $\ell$ and $e^\mu$, respectively. We find that $H_0$ can be consistent with the ones of Planck 2018 and SH0ES in all cases. All the Bayesian evidence and the information criteria AIC, BIC for the generalized distributions of $\rm DM_{host}$ are overwhelmingly strong.

 - **Abstract**
 The recent DESI BAO measurements have revealed a potential deviation from a cosmological constant, suggesting a dynamic nature of dark energy. To rigorously test this result, complementary probes such as weak gravitational lensing are crucial, demanding highly accurate and efficient predictions of the nonlinear matter power spectrum within the $w_0w_a$CDM framework. However, most existing emulators fail to cover the full parameter posterior from DESI DR2+CMB constraints in the $w_0\mbox{-}w_a$ plane. In this work, we extend the spectral equivalence method outlined in Casarini et al. 2016 to use auxiliary $w_0w_a$CDM models for approximating the power spectrum of a target $w_0w_a$CDM cosmology, moving beyond the previous use of $w$CDM auxiliaries. Incorporating this enhanced module, the extended CSST Emulator achieves a prediction accuracy of $\leq1\%$ over the $1\sigma$ confidence region from DESI DR2+CMB constraints for $z\leq3$, validated by additional dynamic dark energy simulations. The emulator's applicable parameter space has been generalized to fully encompass the $2\sigma$ region, greatly enhancing its utility for cosmological analysis in the post-DESI era.

 - **Abstract**
 Radio-interferometric arrays require very precise calibration to detect the Epoch of Reionization 21-cm signal. A remarkably complete and accurate sky model is therefore needed in the patches of the sky used to perform the calibration. Instruments such as HERA, which use a redundant calibration strategy, also require a reference sky model to fix degenerate gain solutions. We have carried out a deep (20 hours) observation using the upgraded GMRT to make a high-fidelity sky model of one of the HERA calibration fields GLEAM 02H (J0200$-$3053). Here, we present the results from a $16.7\,\rm{MHz}$ bandwidth data centred at $147.4\,\rm{MHz}$. Using multiple GMRT pointings, we have made a $6.9^\circ\times6.9^\circ$ mosaic, which yields a median rms of $3.9^{+3.7}_{-1.4}\,{\rm mJy/beam}$ that reduces to $\sim2\,{\rm mJy/beam}$ at source-free regions. In the overlapping patch, this rms is deeper than the GLEAM catalogue, which is used for HERA calibration. We produce a catalogue of $640$ sources ($26\%$ extended) in the flux range $0.01-19.08\,{\rm Jy}$. The catalogue has a sub-arcsec positional accuracy, and the estimated fluxes are consistent with existing catalogues. The differential source counts are found to be deeper than GLEAM and consistent with LoTSS. Preliminary simulations of the sky models from GLEAM and our catalogue show $\sim 10-25\%$ difference in the visibility amplitude, with relatively small phase difference ($\approx 2^\circ$). Future work is planned for larger survey areas and wider bandwidth to reduce the rms and measure the in-band source spectral indices, which are expected to enhance the fidelity of the HERA calibration model.

 We present James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) NIRSpec 1.7--5.5 micron observations of SN~2024ggi at +285.51 and +385.27 days post-explosion. The late-time nebular spectra are dominated by emission lines from various ionization states of H, Ca, Ar, C, Mg, Ni, Co, and Fe. We also detect strong CO emission in both the first overtone and fundamental vibrational bands. Most atomic features exhibit asymmetric line profiles, indicating an aspherical explosion. Using observed fluxes combined with non-LTE radiative-transfer simulations, we develop a data-driven method that resolves the complex molecular-emission region, constrains its 3D structure, and reproduces high-fidelity spectral profiles. We find that, CO is mostly formed prior to +285d past explosion. The subsequent evolution is dominated by the evaporation of CO with CO mass varying from M(CO) of 8.7E-3 to 1.3E-3 Mo, and with instabilities growing from almost homogeneous to highly clumped (density contrast f_c of 1.2 to 2). The minimum velocity of CO only slightly decreases between epochs (v_1 of 1200 and 1100 km/sec), with the reference temperature dropping from T_1 of 2400 and 1900K.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the robustness and physical implications of a set of characteristic redshifts that capture key features of the late-time Universe. Using both model-independent reconstructions as well as different dark energy (DE) parameterizations, we show that these redshifts remain stable across cosmological models and reconstruction algorithm, making them reliable geometric anchors of the expansion history. Moreover, the Alcock-Paczyński corrections at these redshift anchors are found to be unity with high statistical significance, making them natural isotropy points in the comoving distance-redshift relation. We also find that certain redshifts anchors $(z < 1)$ coincide with epochs where strong deviations from the Planck $\Lambda$CDM baseline are apparent irrespective of DE parametrisation like CPL or reconstruction algorithm, indicating their potential as probes of new physics in cosmological evolution. Finally, we demonstrate, for the first time, that a Raychaudhuri Equation Informed Reconstruction Algorithm, substantially enhances the precision of the inferred distance measures and the Hubble expansion rate as well as results tighter constraints in the DE parameter space. These results demonstrate that combining geometric reconstruction with physics-informed kinematic information offers a powerful and consistent algorithm to probe new physics in the late-time dynamics of our Universe.

- **Abstract**
 Giant planets and brown dwarfs are thought to form via a combination of pathways, including bottom-up mechanisms in which gas is accreted onto a solid core and top-down mechanisms in which gas collapses directly into a gravitationally-bound object. One can distinguish the prevalence of these mechanisms using host star metallicities. Bottom-up formation thrives in metal-rich environments, whereas top-down formation is weakly dependent on ambient metal content. Using a hierarchical Bayesian model and the results of the California Legacy Survey (CLS), a low-bias and homogeneously analyzed radial velocity survey, we find evidence for a transition in the stellar metallicity distribution at a companion mass of $\gamma = 27_{-8}^{+12} \, M_{\rm Jup}$ for companions with orbital separations between $1-50$ au. Companions below and above this threshold tend to orbit stars with higher ($\rm{[Fe/H]} = 0.17 \pm 0.12$ dex) and lower ($\rm{[Fe/H]} = -0.03 \pm 0.10$ dex) metallicities, respectively. Previous studies of relatively close-in companions reported evidence of a lower transition mass of $\leq 10 \, {\rm M_{\rm Jup}}$. When applied to the CLS sample, our model predicts the probability of a transition in the stellar metallicity distribution at or below $10 \, { M_{\rm Jup}}$ to be $< 1 \%$. We compare our results to estimates of $\gamma$ gleaned from other observational metrics and discuss implications for planet formation theory.

- **Abstract**
 We present a detailed study of the 3D morphology of two extended associations of multiple protoclusters at $z=3.1$. These protocluster `complexes', designated COSMOS-z3.1-A and COSMOS-z3.1-C, are the most prominent overdensities of $z=3.1$ Ly$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) identified in the COSMOS field by the One-hundred-deg$^2$ DECam Imaging in Narrowbands (ODIN) survey. These protocluster complexes have been followed up with extensive spectroscopy from Keck, Gemini, and DESI. Using a probabilistic method that combines photometrically selected and spectroscopically confirmed LAEs, we reconstruct the 3D structure of these complexes on scales of $\approx$50 cMpc. We validate our reconstruction method using the IllustrisTNG300-1 cosmological hydrodynamical simulation and show that it consistently outperforms approaches relying solely on spectroscopic data. The resulting 3D maps reveal that both complexes are irregular and elongated along a single axis, emphasizing the impact of sightline on our perception of structure morphology. The complexes consist of multiple density peaks, ten in COSMOS-z3.1-A and four in COSMOS-z3.1-C. The former is confirmed to be a proto-supercluster, similar to {\it Hyperion} at $z=2.4$ but observed at an even earlier epoch. Multiple `tails' connected to the cores of the density peaks are seen, likely representing cosmic filaments feeding into these extremely overdense regions. The 3D reconstructions further provide strong evidence that Ly$\alpha$ blobs preferentially reside in the outskirts of the highest density regions. Descendant mass estimates of the density peaks suggest that COSMOS-z3.1-A and COSMOS-z3.1-C will evolve to become ultra-massive structures by $z=0$, with total masses $\log(M/M_\odot) \gtrsim 15.3$, exceeding that of Coma.

- **Abstract**
 The most complete sample of radio stars and masers with trigonometric parallaxes measured by the VLBI method, common with the Gaia EDR3 and Gaia DR3 catalogs, has been compiled using literature data. The sample contains 151 stars. An analysis of the differences in parallaxes and proper motions of Gaia-VLBI stars has been performed. A new estimate of the systematic shift of the Gaia parallax zero point relative to the inertial coordinate system has been obtained: $\Delta\pi=-0.038\pm0.011$ mas. The obtained estimates of the relative rotation rates confirm the absence of a significant rotation of the Gaia\,DR3 system relative to the extragalactic coordinate system, which in this case is represented by VLBI measurements.

          The Atmospheric Response to Large Electron Beam Fluxes in Solar Flares III: Comprehensive Modeling of the Brightest Observed Near-Ultraviolet Continuum Source in an X9 Solar Flare

- **Abstract**
 I report on the high resolution spectra of the remarkable X9 solar flare of 2024 Oct 03 (SOL2024-10-03T12:08) and evaluate the extent to which nonthermal electron beams that generate dense chromospheric condensations can power very bright kernels in solar flares. 1D Radiative-hydrodynamic models predict extreme H$\alpha$ near-wing broadening, bright continuum intensities, and a rapid Fe II red wing asymmetry evolution at the brightest NUV continuum source in the flare. Detailed comparisons to the spectral observations reveal that the H$\alpha$ line is too broad, the Fe II red wing is too bright, and the NUV continuum decays too slowly in a fiducial high-flux beam model. However, chromospheric condensations with maximum electron densities of $n_e \approx 5 \times 10^{14}$ cm$^{-3}$ and optical depths $\tau \approx 1$ in the near wing of H$\alpha$ are consistent with the observed intensity of a broad spectrum in the Southern ribbon. Model similarities demonstrate that Fe I emission lines and the FUV continuum intensity can form at chromospheric heights during flares, but I find that the ratios of the NUV to FUV continuum intensities are generally too large in the models. This suggests that radiative-hydrodynamic models of chromospheric condensations cool through $T \approx 30,000$ K too rapidly. The larger than expected FUV continuum intensities are not nearly bright enough to explain recent stellar megaflare spectra from the Hubble Space Telescope.

- **Abstract**
 3D maps of interstellar dust are crucial for understanding the structure of the Milky Way interstellar medium to apply correction to astrophysical observations affected by dust. We aim at providing new extinction estimates in the Gaia BP/RP bands to study the dust distribution in the disc, to provide new views of the spatial distribution of extinction and to compare it with tracers of the Galactic spiral arms. We use a highly homogeneous method based on the spectral chemo-physical parametrisation of stars from Gaia General Stellar Parametriser-Spectroscopy (GSP-Spec). This catalogue of 5.6 million stars in DR3, presents the advantage of estimating the stellar atmospheric parameters independently of extinction. The extinction is calculated by comparing the observed stellar (BP-RP) colours in the Gaia bands with the theoretical ones assuming a theoretical Teff-log(g)-[M/H] relation, from the GSP-Spec parameters. Publicly available, 3D high-resolution maps around the Sun are produced through the computation of differential extinction by discretising the dataset into spherical coordinates. Our large scale map covers a region of 4x4x0.8 kpc centred on the Sun with a discretisation of (dr,d{\theta},d{\phi})=(40pc,1°,1°). To exploit the higher number of stars in the Sun proximity, we created a smaller scale map focused on the Local Bubble area, with a volume of 1x1x0.8 kpc and a finer discretisation of (dr,d{\theta},d{\phi})=(30pc,1°,1°). The produced extinction maps exhibit a strong spatial correlation with molecular clouds and the spiral arms. Interestingly, several regions of the map are consistently present in different tracers as density of gas, of young stars and the chemical pattern of the spiral arms. Our study unveils the link between the distribution of dust, gas, and stars governing the chemical and dynamical evolution of the spiral arms in the Galactic framework.

- **Abstract**
 We present a detailed kinematic and stellar population analysis of the inner disk of Malin 1, a giant low surface brightness (GLSB) galaxy with a prominent SB0-type central morphology. AstroSat far-UV imaging reveals clumpy emission features indicating recent star formation. Using MUSE integral field spectroscopy, we identify four star-forming complexes (SFCs) within the inner 10 kpc, each associated with localized ionized gas emission in distinct H$\alpha$ velocity channels. Two of the SFCs, including a far-UV clump, appear on the blue-shifted side ($V_{H\alpha}=-230~\mathrm{kms^{-1}}$), while the other two are redshifted. The far-UV clump shows a strong velocity offset ($\sim150~\mathrm{kms^{-1}}$) and high gas dispersion ($\sim250~\mathrm{kms^{-1}}$), indicating that it is kinematically decoupled from the rotating disk. The spatial and velocity isolation of these features in the channel map confirms they do not follow regular disk rotation. The far-UV clump hosts young (250-500 Myr), extremely metal-poor ([M/H]$\simeq$ -1.69) and $\alpha$-enriched ($[\alpha/Fe] \sim 0.5$) stellar populations, sharply contrasting with the surrounding super-solar gas-phase metallicity. The young stellar populations in each SFC are chemically distinct (similar to the far-UV clump) from the enriched central ISM, indicating rapid, local star formation from primitive gas before efficient mixing with the enriched ISM. Their spatial and velocity segregation, age synchronicity, and chemical homogeneity suggest an origin of gas delivered by a disrupted, gas-rich dwarf on a high-inclination (off-plane) orbit. These results suggest that the central HSB within $\rm \sim 9^{\prime\prime} (14\ kpc)$ radius component of Malin 1 has grown through discrete, externally driven accretion, contributing to its complex, hybrid disk morphology.

          Pre-Supernova Multiple Giant Eruptions in Massive Stars

- **Abstract**
 Massive stars can exhibit giant eruptions with high mass loss shortly before their explosion as a core-collapse Supernova. These multiple giant eruptions (MGEs) may have a commutative effect that brings the star to a different state, possible one that favors the explosion. To address this problem, we evolve a 100 solar mass star and initiate a series of three giant eruptions lasting one year each, testing different mass loss rates and different metallicities. Following each eruption, we track the recovery phase to examine the post-eruption behavior of the star and its recovery timescale. The MGEs lead to a decrease in luminosity, accompanied by a slight increase in temperature. Later, during the recovery phases as the star starts to retain its equilibrium state, its luminosity increases. The recovery time-scale varies significantly after each eruption for independent on the mass loss rate, but it is shorter for lower metallicities. For the higher mass-loss rates during the recovery phase, the outer layers of the star exhibit oscillations and undergo compression at higher metallicity. These oscillations are most likely a consequence of thermal imbalance in the outer envelope. This behavior at higher mass-loss rates also suggests that the thermal readjustments during recovery may create favorable conditions for a subsequent eruption of the star.

- **Abstract**
 We use $^{12}$CO (J=1-0) MWISP data to study turbulence in a segment of the Local Arm. Velocity slices at different kinematic distances show similar spatial power spectra (SPSs) and structure functions (SFs), demonstrating that the entire region forms a single turbulent field with a cascade extending from $\sim 400$ pc to sub-parsec scales. The SPS slopes of both the intensity and velocity fields exhibit a systematic scale dependence that approaches the values expected from turbulence models. Cloud-to-cloud VSFs follow similar trends to the pixel-by-pixel VSFs in the extended self-similarity (ESS) scaling, indicating that velocity differences among clouds arise from large-scale turbulent motions. Velocity- and intensity-increment maps reveal filamentary, intermittent structures. The PDFs of the velocity increments display strong non-Gaussianity and are well fitted by the normal inverse gaussian (NIG) distribution, whereas the intensity increments show much weaker tails. A simple energetic estimate suggests that Galactic differential rotation is able to supply the large-scale shear required to maintain the observed turbulence.

- **Abstract**
 Syer and Tremaine's made-to-measure method and Schwarzschild's orbit superposition method are well-known within the field of stellar dynamical modeling. This research is concerned with assessing and comparing the operational capabilities of the two methods and, in particular, the impact on observable reproduction, orbit classifications and computer elapsed times when using low orbit numbers (8000 orbits) with different observational data sets and initial conditions. Both methods are able to reproduce observed data with mean $\chi^2 \approx 1$ or less. However, the made-to-measure process does so three to five times faster than the orbit superposition method, and this starts to make the made-to-measure process attractive for analyzing galaxy surveys. For a given set of initial conditions, both methods produce similar orbit classifications but the orbits behind the classifications are not the same. Orbits which are common do not have the same weights. Different initial conditions result in different classifications.

- **Abstract**
 The Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST), a two-meter aperture astronomical space telescope under China's manned space program, is equipped with multiple back-end scientific instruments. As an astronomical precision measurement module of the CSST, the Multi-Channel Imager (MCI) can cover a wide wavelength range from ultraviolet to near-infrared with three-color simultaneous high-precision photometry and imaging, which meets the scientific requirements for various fields. The diverse scientific objectives of MCI require not only a robust airborne platform, advanced optical systems, and observing facilities but also comprehensive software support for scientific operations and research. To this end, it is essential to develop realistic observational simulation software to thoroughly evaluate the MCI data stream and provide calibration tools for future scientific investigations. The MCI instrument simulation software will serve as a foundation for the development of the MCI data processing pipeline and will facilitate improvements in both hardware and software, as well as in the observational operation strategy, in alignment with the mission's scientific goals. In conclusion, we present a comprehensive overview of the MCI instrument simulation and some corresponding performances of the MCI data processing pipeline.

          Unraveling eMSTO in NGC 2355: Stellar Rotation and Binaries

- **Abstract**
 The extended Main Sequence Turn-off (eMSTO) in the open cluster NGC 2355 is investigated using precise astrometry and photometry from Gaia DR3 and spectroscopic data from the Gaia-ESO Survey. We find a clear positive correlation between the rotational velocity (v sin i) and color of eMSTO stars, supporting the role of stellar rotation and gravity darkening in causing the observed color spread. Contrary to predictions from binary tidal-locking scenarios, spatial distribution analysis reveals that fast-rotating stars are preferentially concentrated in the cluster's central regions. This finding provides the observational evidence favoring star-disk interactions during the pre-main-sequence phase, rather than tidal locking in binaries, as the primary mechanism responsible for the origin of rotational spread in eMSTO stars.

- **Abstract**
 Research on young stellar populations is essential to understand the properties of embedded clusters and advance theories of their formation. This has driven advancements in methodologies for star detection, leading to the development of valuable databases and software. We present the scientific justification and operating principles of the IdentYS tool, which is designed to identify young stellar objects (YSOs) in star-forming regions. The tool facilitates the identification of young stars with infrared (IR) excess in remote and embedded star-forming regions, focusing primarily on Class I and II YSOs. For this purpose, near- and mid-IR photometric data and five colour-colour diagrams (J - H) vs. (H - K), K - [3.6] vs. [3.6] - [4.5], [3.6] - [4.5] vs. [5.8] - [8.0], [3.6] - [4.5] vs. [8.0] - [24], and [3.4] - [4.6] vs. [4.6] - [12] are used. The purity of the YSOs sample is enhanced by excluding field contamination from stellar and extragalactic objects. As a result, we compile a list of YSO candidates displaying the source designation, astrometric, and photometric parameters, as well as information on the evolutionary stage determined by the presence of IR excess, as indicated by certain diagrams. The application of this program can greatly streamline the statistical analysis of young stellar populations across diverse star-forming regions, including distant and deeply embedded ones, which typically require processing large volumes of initial data.

          Orbital Eccentricities Suggest a Gradual Transition from Giant Planets to Brown Dwarfs

- **Abstract**
 To date, hundreds of sub-stellar objects with masses between $1-80\ M_{\rm Jup}$ have been detected orbiting main-sequence stars. The current convention uses the deuterium-burning limit, $M_c \approx 13 M_{\rm Jup}$ to divide this population between giant planets and brown dwarfs. However, this classification heuristic is largely divorced from any formation physics and may not accurately reflect the astrophysical nature of these objects. Previous work has suggested that a transition from ``planet-like'' to ``brown-dwarf-like'' characteristics occurs somewhere in the range $1-10 M_{\rm Jup}$, but precise the crossover mass and whether the transition is gradual or abrupt remains unknown. Here, we explore how the occurrence rate, host star metallicity, and orbital eccentricities vary as a function of mass in a sample of 70 Doppler-detected sub-stellar objects ($0.8 < M_c/M_{\rm Jup} < 80$) from the California Legacy Survey. Our population consists of objects near and beyond the water ice line ($1 < a / \text{AU} < 10$), providing valuable clues to the details of giant planet formation physics at a location in the proto-stellar disk where planet formation efficiency is thought to be enhanced. We find that occurrence rate, host star metallicity, and orbital eccentricity all change gradually across the mass range under consideration, suggesting that ``bottom-up'' core accretion mechanisms and ``top-down'' gravitational instability mechanisms produce objects that overlap in mass. The observed eccentricity distributions could arise either from different formation channels or from post-formation dynamical interactions between massive sub-stellar objects.

          The B[e] Phenomenon in Supergiants. A Result of Mass Transfer in Binaries, Mergers, or What?

- **Abstract**
 The B[e] phenomenon discovered nearly 50 years ago features the presence of forbidden emission lines due to extended and dense circumstellar gas and large IR excesses due to the radiation from circumstellar dust in a wide variety of objects from pre-main-sequence stars to Planetary Nebulae. It also shows up in a small group of supergiants that includes Luminous Blue Variables, such as {\eta} Carinae. Over the years, some of them were proven to be binary systems, but the presence of a secondary component in other is still elusive. At the same time, there is growing evidence that the B[e] phenomenon can be due to binary mergers or interactions in triple systems.

- **Abstract**
 BL Lac has entered an active state since 2020, with multiwavelength observations revealing intense flares. In this study, we conducted 12-night multicolor optical monitoring using an 85 cm telescope from 2020 September to 2024 June and collected long-term broad-band archived data from radio to $\gamma$-rays. Intraday variabilities were detected on four nights, and most of them exhibited a bluer-when-brighter behavior. Both clockwise and counterclockwise spectral hysteresis loops were found within a single night. However, no reliable intraband time lag was detected for the intranight variabilities. On long timescales, the cross-correlation analysis shows that the variations of the optical, X-ray, and $\gamma$-ray bands do not reveal an obvious time delay, while the variations in the radio bands lagged them by about 370 days. The measured time lags suggest two distinct emission regions respectively responsible for the optical to $\gamma$-ray radiation and for the radio radiation, with a spatial separation of approximately $4.50\times10^{19}\ \rm cm$. We modeled the broad-band spectral energy distributions during four flaring epochs and one quiescent epoch, and found evidence for the possible persistent existence of a very high energy emission region. We also confirmed a spectral evolution of the source from an intermediate synchrotron peaked BL Lac object to a low synchrotron peaked BL Lac object.

- **Abstract**
 Haro 2 is a blue compact dwarf galaxy and the closest (at 21Mpc) known $Ly\alpha$ emitter. UV and optical observations have found Haro 2 to be immersed in shells of partly ionized gas expanding at $\sim200$km/s. Observations of CO(2-1) (Becket et al 2020; Paper 1) with moderate ($2^{\prime\prime}$) resolution discovered a large-scale one-sided outflow associated with a soft X-ray bubble and apparently driven by the young star clusters created in the recent starburst. We present here SMA observations of CO(3-2) with $1.1^{\prime\prime}$ resolution in Haro 2. The opposite-side component of the large molecular outflow is detected lying in the direction of the fast ionized outflow; it is very confined in area. An additional outflow is apparent in the CO(3-2); it is south-east of the galaxy in a region holding weak star formation and a moderate-luminosity hard X-ray source. All the molecular outflow and filament velocities are within $\lesssim\pm50$km/s of the systemic velocity of the galaxy.

- **Abstract**
 We present the first detailed photometric characterization of TIC 470127886, a previously unstudied multi-periodic variable star discovered in TESS photometry. Analysis of 145,374 high-cadence observations spanning 696 days (944-day baseline, 2023 January-2024 October) across 10 sectors (60, 59, 58, 53, 52, 73, 86, 79, 78, 85) reveals complex periodic variability with a primary period of 5.544527 +/- 0.004307 days and false alarm probability 1.47 x 10^-87. Lomb-Scargle analysis identifies three significant periods at 5.545, 5.801, and 8.874 days with amplitudes of 15,702, 12,772, and 12,670 ppm. The phase-folded light curve shows smooth, sinusoidal morphology consistent with ellipsoidal variation from tidal distortion in a close binary, with no eclipse features. A three-component sinusoidal model, appropriate for ellipsoidal variables, provides excellent fit quality. Validation tests confirm signal authenticity and persistence, and systematic checks verify no contamination from nearby stars (>3 mag fainter). We classify TIC 470127886 as an ellipsoidal variable candidate with 0.70 confidence, with multi-period behavior suggesting additional variability mechanisms beyond tidal distortion. This work demonstrates high-precision characterization of complex multi-periodic variables in TESS photometry.

          Statistical analysis of eclipsing binaries with monotonic orbital-period variations: A-type W UMa contact systems

- **Abstract**
 On the basis of monotonic orbital-period variations, this study aims to identify genuine relationships between binary parameters and the rates of mass transfer (MT), mass loss (ML), and angular momentum loss (AML). Sample binaries with monotonic period variations are collected from the literature, together with well-determined binary parameters. Assuming the monotonic variations are responsible for any one of the MT, ML, and AML, their rates are calculated with the rates of change of period. After selecting crucial parameters using partial least-squares analysis, a parameter that exhibits the closest correlation with any one of the derived rates is further selected using partial regression plots. Moreover, power-law relationships are found for the discovered correlations. The properties of the sample binaries are also investigated by examining associations between binary parameters. In the systems with negative period variations, it is found that the rate of MT from more- to less-massive stars is a function of the primary radius; the AML rate is a function of the fill-out factor. In addition, the relationships between the mass ratio and stellar masses indicate that the ML rate relative to the MT rate decreases with increasing mass ratio below ~0.46. Meanwhile, in the systems with positive variations, it is found that the rate of MT from less- to more-massive stars is a function of the luminosity ratio and/or mass ratio; the ML rate is a function of the secondary temperature. The discussion also addresses possible processes occurring in the sample binaries.

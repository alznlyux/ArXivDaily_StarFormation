          Automated detection and modeling of binary microlensing events in OGLE-IV data. I. Events with well-separated bumps

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational microlensing depends primarily on the lens mass and presents a larger occurrence rate in crowded regions, which makes it the best tool to uncover the initial mass function (IMF) of low-mass stars in the Galactic bulge. The bulge IMF can be obtained from the luminosity function measured with the Hubble Space Telescope if one knows the statistics of binary stellar systems in the bulge. We aim to analyse a statistically significant number of binary-lens/single-source and single-lens/binary-source events, in order to explore the lower-mass end of the bulge IMF even in unresolved binary systems. This paper deals with events with clearly separated bumps and no caustic crossing or approach, whereas other types will be analysed in following works. A fully-automated approach in the search and modeling of binary events was implemented. Event detection was carried out with a modified version of the algorithm used in previous studies. Model fitting was carried out with Markov chain Monte Carlo and nested sampling methods, in order to find the most probable solution among binary lens or binary source models. We retrieved 107 binary events in Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) light curves spanning ten years in 9 high-cadence and 112 low-cadence fields towards the bulge. Several criteria were applied to reduce false positives, resulting in 55 most likely binary lenses and 52 binary sources. The tools were effective detecting a bona-fide sample of binary events, with a distribution of Einstein timescales around 35-40 days and flat distributions for mass ratio and source flux ratio. After proper consideration of detection efficiency, the statistics for binary fraction and mass ratio will provide valuable constraints for the bulge IMF.

 - **Abstract**
 The Einstein Telescope (ET), along with other third-generation gravitational wave (GW) detectors, will be a key instrument for detecting GWs in the coming decades. However, analyzing the data and estimating source parameters will be challenging, especially given the large number of expected detections - of order $10^5$ per year - which makes current methods based on stochastic sampling impractical. In this work, we use Dingo-IS to perform Neural Posterior Estimation (NPE) of high-redshift events detectable with ET in its triangular configuration. NPE is a likelihood-free inference technique that leverages normalizing flows to approximate posterior distributions. After training, inference is fast, requiring only a few minutes per source, and accurate, as corrected through importance sampling and validated against standard Bayesian inference methods. To confirm previous findings on the ability to estimate parameters for high-redshift sources with ET, we compare NPE results with predictions from the Fisher information matrix (FIM) approximation. We find that FIM underestimates sky localization errors substantially for most sources, as it does not capture the multimodalities in sky localization introduced by the geometry of the triangular detector. FIM also overestimates the uncertainty in luminosity distance by a factor of $\sim 3$ on average when the injected luminosity distance is $d^{\mathrm{inj}}_{\mathrm{L}} > 10^5~$Mpc, further confirming that ET will be particularly well suited for studying the early Universe.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of eleven high-velocity HI clouds at Galactic latitudes of 25-30 degrees, likely embedded in the Milky Way's nuclear wind. The clouds are detected with deep Green Bank Telescope 21 cm observations of a $3.2^\circ \times 6.2^\circ$ field around QSO 1H1613-097, located behind the northern Fermi Bubble. Our measurements reach $3\sigma$ limits on $ N_{\mathrm{HI}}$ as low as $3.1 \times 10^{17}$ cm$^{-2}$, more than twice as sensitive as previous HI studies of the Bubbles. The clouds span $-180 \leq v_{\mathrm{LSR}} \leq -90$ km/s and are the highest-latitude 21 cm HVCs detected inside the Bubbles. Eight clouds are spatially resolved, showing coherent structures with sizes of 4-28 pc, peak column densities of $\log(N_{\mathrm{HI}}/\mathrm{cm}^2) = 17.9\text{-}18.7$, and HI masses up to 1470 $M_\odot$. Several exhibit internal velocity gradients. Their presence at such high latitudes is surprising, given the short expected survival times for clouds expelled from the Galactic Center. These objects may be fragments of a larger cloud disrupted by interaction with the surrounding hot gas.

 - **Abstract**
 The launch of the Einstein Probe (EP) mission has revolutionized the detection and follow-up observations of fast X-ray transients (FXTs) by providing prompt and timely access to their precise localizations. In the first year of its operation, the EP mission reports the discovery of 72 high signal-to-noise FXTs. Subjected to the visibility in the sky and weather conditions, we search for the optical counterparts of 42 EP-discovered FXTs from the Lulin observatory. We successfully detect the optical counterparts of 12 FXTs, and five of those are first discovered by us from the Lulin observatory. We find that the optical counterparts are generally faint (r>20 mag) and decline rapidly (>0.5 mag per day). We also find that 11 out of 42 FXTs had shown direct evidence of their association with Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) through significant temporal and spatial overlapping. Furthermore, the luminosities and redshifts of FXTs with confirm optical counterparts in our observations are fully consistent with the faintest end of the GRB population. However, the non-detection of any associated optical counterpart with a significant fraction of FXTs suggests that EP FXTs are likely a subset of so-called `Dark' FXTs, similar to `Dark' GRBs. Additionally, the luminosities of two FXTs were also consistent with jetted tidal disruption events (TDEs). However, their luminosities differ significantly from those of typical supernova shock breakout or kilonova emissions. Thus, we conclude that a significant fraction of EP-discovered FXTs are associated with events having relativistic jets; either a GRB or a jetted TDE.

          Analytic Model for Covariance Matrices of the 2-, 3-, and 4-Point Correlation Functions in the Gaussian Random Field Approximation

 - **Abstract**
 Analyses of the galaxy N-Point Correlation Functions (NPCFs) have a large number of degrees of freedom, meaning one cannot directly estimate an invertible covariance matrix purely from mock catalogs, as has been the standard approach for the 2PCF and power spectrum. Instead, analyses use templates based on assuming a Gaussian Random Field density with the true, Boltzmann-solver-computed power spectrum. The resulting covariance matrices are sparse but have notable internal structure. To understand this structure better, we seek a fully analytic, closed-form covariance matrix template, using a power law power spectrum $P(k) \propto 1/k$. We obtain a simple closed-form solution for the covariance of the 2PCF, as well as closed-form solutions for the fundamental building blocks of the covariance matrices for the 3PCF, 4PCF, and beyond. We use our results to present a clearer picture of the covariance matrices' structure and sparsity, corresponding to triangular and non-triangular regions. This will be useful in guiding future NPCF analyses with spectroscopic surveys such as DESI, Euclid, Roman, and SPHEREx.

 - **Abstract**
 We present DeepVoid, an application of deep learning trained on a physical definition of cosmic voids to detect voids in density fields and galaxy distributions. By semantically segmenting the IllustrisTNG simulation volume using the tidal tensor, we train a deep convolutional neural network to classify local structure using a U-Net architecture for training and prediction. The model achieves a void F1 score of 0.96 and a Matthews correlation coefficient over all structural classes of 0.81 for dark matter particles in IllustrisTNG with interparticle spacing of $\lambda=0.33 h^{-1} \text{Mpc}$. We then apply the machine learning technique of curricular learning to enable the model to classify structure in data with significantly larger intertracer separation. At the highest tracer separation tested, $\lambda=10 h^{-1} \text{Mpc}$, the model achieves a void F1 score of 0.89 and a Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.6 on IllustrisTNG subhalos.

          Feasibility assessment of optical communications between ground and satellite on Mars through the simulation of atmospheric effects on signal quality leading to a proposal for a new communications network architecture during extreme weather

 - **Abstract**
 Mars is the next milestone in human exploration. However, there are still several challenges that must be assessed to ensure appropriate conditions in a future settlement. Communications services will be essential for this task, providing not only a link between Earth and Mars but also supporting Martian weather forecasting and any potential rescue missions. These applications require a robust, high data rate communications network that allows for rapid response, remote sensing and public engagement. This research aims to study the feasibility of ground-to-satellite (and vice versa) optical communications during extreme Martian weather conditions, focusing on the link between a ground station on the surface of Mars and a satellite orbiting the planet. Long-lasting and expansive Martian dust storms, particularly common in the southern hemisphere, pose a considerable challenge when considering the feasibility of optical communications with Mars due to their significant impact in terms of signal attenuation and scattering. The methodology of this study is based on a computer simulation of the system featuring the characterisation of the Martian atmosphere and optical link to measure the attenuation and undesired effects suffered by the data signal when applying different environmental configuration parameters. The flexibility of the approach allows for the prediction of communications link quality in extreme cases such as global dust storms. The simulation is based on atmospheric data from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter's Mars Climate Sounder instrument and considers the recently launched Laser Communication Relay Demonstration (LCRD). The extreme conditions during dust storms in the southern polar-hood region lead to the proposal of a new communications network architecture to ensure connectivity during these events.

          Ground to Dust: Collisional Cascades and the Fate of Kardashev II Megaswarms

 - **Abstract**
 Extraterrestrial intelligences are speculated to surround stars with structures to collect their energy or to signal distant observers. If they exist, these most likely are megaswarms, vast constellations of satellites (elements) in orbit around the hosts. Although long-lived megaswarms are extremely powerful technosignatures, they are liable to be subject to collisional cascades once guidance systems start failing. The collisional time is roughly an orbital period divided by the covering fraction of the swarm. Structuring the swarm orbits does not prolong the initial collisional time as long as there is enough randomness to ensure collisions, although it can reduce collision velocities. I further show that once the collisional cascade begins, it can develop extremely rapidly for hypervelocity collisions. Companion stars or planets in the stellar system induce perturbations through the Lidov-Kozai effect among others, which can result in orbits crossing within some millions of years. Radiative perturbations, including the Yarkovsky effect, also can destabilize swarms. Most megaswarms are thus likely to be short-lived on cosmic timescales without active upkeep. I discuss possible mitigation strategies and implications for megastructure searches.

          Flickers, Bursts, and Dips: Detecting Rapid Variability with the g(2) Autocorrelation Function

 - **Abstract**
 Rapid optical transient events can be hard to detect because of the limited number of photons they produce. I discuss a method of inferring the presence of fast, chaotic variability in photometry using the normalized autocorrelation function, what is called $g^{(2)}$ in quantum optics. The variability's signature is a bump in the function at short lags. No periodicity is needed for the method to work. Versions of this method are attested in stellar variability studies, but its uses in some other subfields apparently have not been realized. I calculate expected signal-to-noise ratios with shot noise and scintillation. This method could be used to find unknown phenomena, particularly sub-millisecond optical variability. I present simple models of three example use cases: a flickering artificial "lantern" near a host sun, optical microbursts from the Crab pulsar, and frequent irregular transits of a star by cometary bodies.

 - **Abstract**
 The Smith Cloud is a high-velocity cloud (HVC) on its final approach to the Milky Way that shows evidence of interaction with the Galaxy's disk. We investigate the metallicity and gas-phase chemical depletion patterns in this HVC using UV absorption-line observations toward two background QSOs taken with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST)/Cosmic Origin Spectrograph (COS) and H I 21-cm emission-line observations taken with Green Bank Telescope (GBT). We find evidence of silicon gas-phase depletion with [Si/S]$=\,-0.72^{+0.26}_{-0.24}$ and [Si/O]$_{3\sigma}\,\lesssim\,-0.05$, implying the presence of dust within the Smith Cloud. Because dust is galactic in origin, this HVC could trace the return leg of a Galactic fountain or a dwarf galaxy that passed through the Galactic plane.

 - **Abstract**
 The results of the first extragalactic gamma-ray survey by the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) are presented. The survey comprises 2720 hours of very high-energy gamma-ray observations of the extragalactic sky, recorded with H.E.S.S. from 2004 up to the end of 2012. These data have been re-analysed using a common consistent set of up-to-date data calibration and analysis tools. From this analysis, a list of 23 detected objects, predominantly blazars, was obtained. This catalogue was assessed in terms of the source class populations that it contains. The level of source parameter bias for the blazar sources, probed by this observational dataset, was evaluated using Monte-Carlo simulations. Spectral results obtained with the H.E.S.S. data were compared with the \textit{Fermi}-LAT catalogues to present the full gamma-ray picture of the detected objects. Lastly, this unique dataset was used to assess the contribution of BL Lacertae objects and flat-spectrum radio quasars to the extragalactic gamma-ray background light at several hundreds of giga-electronvolts. These results are accompanied by the release of the high-level data to the astrophysical community.

          "Oh FUors where art thou": A search for long-lasting YSO outbursts hiding in infrared surveys

 - **Abstract**
 Long-lasting episodes of high accretion can strongly impact stellar and planetary formation. However, the universality of these events during the formation of young stellar objects (YSOs) is still under debate. Accurate statistics of strong outbursts (FUors), are necessary to understand the role of episodic accretion bursts. In this work, we search for a population of FUors that may have gone undetected in the past because they either a) went into outburst before the start of modern monitoring surveys and are now slowly fading back into quiescence or b) are slow-rising outbursts that would not commonly be classified as candidate FUors. We hypothesise that the light curves of these outbursts should be well fitted by linear models with negative (declining) or positive (rising) slopes. The analysis of the infrared light curves and photometry of $\sim$99000 YSO candidates from SPICY yields 717 candidate FUors. Infrared spectroscopy of 20 candidates, from both the literature and obtained by our group, confirms that 18 YSOs are going through long-term outbursts and identifies two evolved sources as contaminants. The number of candidate FUors combined with previously measured values of the frequency of FUor outbursts, yield average outburst decay times that are 2.5 times longer than the rise times. In addition, a population of outbursts with rise timescales between 2000 and 5000 days must exist to obtain our observed number of YSOs with positive slopes. Finally, we estimate a mean burst lifetime of between 45 and 100 years.

          The new compact triple system: discovery of bright third star around contact binary using LAMOST-MRS spectra and photometry

 - **Abstract**
 We present a study of the third star orbiting around known contact eclipsing binary J04+25 using spectra from the LAMOST medium-resolution survey (MRS) and publicly available photometry. This is a rare case of a hierarchical triple, where the third star is significantly brighter than the inner contact subsystem. We successfully extracted radial velocities for all three components, using the binary spectral model in two steps. Third star radial velocities have high precision and allow direct fitting of the orbit. The low precision of radial velocity measurements in the contact system is compensated by large number statistics. We employed a template matching technique for light curves to find periodic variation due to the light time travel effect (LTTE) using several photometric datasets. Joint fit of third star radial velocities and LTTE allowed us to get a consistent orbital solution with $P_3=941.40\pm0.03$ day and $e_3=0.059\pm0.007$. We made estimations of the masses $M_{\rm 12,~3}\sin^3{i_3}=1.05\pm0.02,~0.90\pm0.02~M_\odot$ in a wide system and discussed possible determination of an astrometric orbit in the future data release of Gaia. Additionally, we propose an empirical method for measuring a period and minimal mass of contact systems, based on variation of the projected rotational velocity ($V\sin{i}$) from the spectra.

          Evolution of the inner accretion flow and the white-dwarf spin pulse during the 2023 outburst in GK Persei

 - **Abstract**
 We present our X-ray and optical observations performed by NICER, NuSTAR, and Tomo-e Gozen during the 2023 outburst in the intermediate polar GK Persei. The X-ray spectrum consisted of three components: blackbody emission of several tens of eVs from the irradiated white-dwarf surface, a source possibly including several emission lines around 1 keV, and multi-temperature bremsstrahlung emission from the accretion column. The 351.3-s white-dwarf spin pulse was detected in X-rays, and the observable X-ray flux from the column drastically decreased at the off-pulse phase, which suggests that the absorption of the column by the accreting gas called the curtain was the major cause of the pulse. As the system became brighter in optical, the column became fainter, the pulse amplitude became higher, and the energy dependence of pulses became weaker at $<$8~keV. These phenomena could be explained by the column's more pronounced absorption by the denser curtain as mass accretion rates increased. The blackbody and line fluxes rapidly decreased at the optical decline, which suggests the expansion of the innermost disk edge with decreasing accretion rates. The electron scattering or the column geometry may be associated with almost no energy dependence of high-energy pulses. The irradiated vertically-thick structure at the disk may generate optical QPOs with a period of $\sim$5700 s.

          Dynamical Dark Energy in the Crosshairs: A Joint Analysis with DESI, Pantheon plus, and TDCOSMO Constraints

 - **Abstract**
 The cosmological tensions between early- and late-Universe probes, particularly the Hubble tension ($H_0$) and $S_8$ discrepancy, challenge the validity of the standard ${\rm{\Lambda}CDM}$ model. Motivated by these tensions, we perform a comprehensive joint analysis of three representative dark energy models - ${\rm{\Lambda}CDM}$, the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization, and the Phenomenologically Emergent Dark Energy (PEDE) model - using the latest observational datasets: baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements from DESI Data Releases 1 and 2 (DR1/DR2), the Pantheon Plus sample of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), and time-delay cosmography from TDCOSMO lensing. Our multi-probe approach breaks key degeneracies among cosmological parameters ($H_0$, $r_d$, and $M_B$) and provides robust constraints on dark energy dynamics. The CPL model yields a statistically significant improvement over ${\rm{\Lambda}CDM}$, with $\Delta \chi^2 \approx -3.6$ for DESI DR2+Pantheon Plus+TDCOSMO, favoring a quintessence-like behavior ($w_0=-0.87^{+0.045 }_{-0.045} $, $w_a=-0.41^{+ 0.28}_{-0.28}$ at 1$\sigma$ confidence level). In contrast, the PEDE model exhibits severe tension with observations, yielding $\Delta \chi^2 \approx +53.1$ (DR1) and $\Delta \chi^2 \approx +132.3$ (DR2), despite its potential to marginally alleviate the $H_0$ tension. DESI DR2 tightens constraints on dynamical dark energy by $\sim$40\%, reinforcing evidence for redshift-evolving $w(z)$. Remarkably, our results demonstrate that such data combination can achieve precision comparable to Planck CMB measurements for dynamical dark energy studies, while offering complementary advantages in probing the late-time universe. This synergy between different observational data significantly enhances our ability to constrain dark energy properties.

 - **Abstract**
 Astronomical data is rich in volume, information and facets. Although this offers multiple research perspectives, processing the data remains a challenge. Infrastructures for analyzing, inspecting, exploring and communicating with data are mandatory. To address this issue, we introduce Jasmine, the JAvaScript Multimodal INformation Explorer. Jasmine allows users to open different data viewer modals that show a specific data point from a set. The viewer currently supports image data, as well as point cloud objects. Users can decide on which information about the data point they like to have displayed. Point clouds are interactive and allow for zooming, tossing, and turning. Picking a data point is enabled by providing a structured view of the set, arranged by a key property. This arrangement is achieved by autoencoding.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational-wave astronomy shows great promise in determining nuclear physics in a regime not accessible to terrestrial experiments. We introduce physics-informed priors constrained by nuclear theory and perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics calculations, as well as astrophysical measurements of neutron-star masses and radii. When these priors are used in gravitational-wave astrophysical inference, we show a significant improvement on nuclear equation of state constraints. Applying these to the first observed gravitational-wave binary neutron-star merger GW170817, the constraints on the radius of a $1.4\,M_\odot$ neutron star improve from $R_{1.4} ={12.54^{+1.05}_{-1.54}} \, {\rm km}$ to $R_{1.4} = 12.11^{+0.91}_{-1.11} \,{\rm km}$ and those on the tidal deformability from $\tilde{\Lambda}_{1.186} < 720$ to $\tilde{\Lambda}_{1.186} = 384^{+306}_{-158}$ ($90\%$ confidence intervals) at the events measured chirp mass $\mathcal{M}=1.186\,M_\odot$. We also show these priors can be used to perform model selection between binary neutron star and neutron star-black hole mergers; in the case of GW190425, the results provide only marginal evidence with a Bayes factor $\mathcal{BF}=1.33$ in favour of the binary neutron star merger hypothesis. Given their ability to improve the astrophysical inference of binary mergers involving neutron stars, we advocate for these physics-informed priors to be used as standard in the literature and provide open-source code for reproducibility and adaptation of the method.

 We present the results of the broadband timing and spectral analysis of the poorly understood SMC pulsar RX J0032.9-7348 (= SXP 7.02) using NuSTAR and NICER observations during its X-ray brightening in 2024. Our timing analysis revealed a pulsation period of approximately 7.02 s in the X-ray light curve. The pulse profile obtained in the broad energy range is double-peaked and asymmetric in nature and shows moderate variation with the energy. An absorbed power-law model describes the 0.5-8 keV NICER spectra well. The 3-50 keV NuSTAR spectrum is best described with an absorbed power-law modified with a high-energy cutoff model. We find no evidence of iron or cyclotron line features in the energy spectrum. During our observation period, the 0.5-50 keV luminosity varies in the range of $\sim 8\times10^{36} - 4\times10^{37}$ erg s$^{-1}$. We also discuss the dependence of spectral parameters on the rotational phase of the pulsar through phase-resolved spectroscopy.

 In an era when we are charting multiple planets per system, one might wonder the extent to which "missing" (or failing to detect) a planet can skew our interpretation of the system architecture. We address this question with a simple experiment: starting from a large, homogeneous catalog, we remove planets and monitor how several well-defined metrics of the system architecture change. We first perform this test on a catalog of observed exoplanets. We then repeat our test on a catalog of synthetic planetary systems with underlying hyperparameters that have been fit to reproduce the observed systems as faithfully as possible (though imperfectly). For both samples, we find that the failure to detect one or more planets tends to create more irregularly spaced planets, whereas the planet mass similarity and coplanarity are essentially unaffected. One key difference between the synthetic and observed data sets is that the observed systems have more evenly spaced planets than the observation-bias-applied synthetic systems. Since our tests show that detection bias tends to increase irregularity in spacing, the even spacing in the observed planetary systems is likely astrophysical rather than the result of the Kepler missions' inherent detection biases. Our findings support the interpretation that planets in the same system have similar sizes and regular spacing and reinforce the need to develop an underlying model of planetary architectures that reproduces these observed patterns.

 - **Abstract**
 Claims of detections of gases in exoplanet atmospheres often rely on comparisons between models including and excluding specific chemical species. However, the space of molecular combinations available for model construction is vast and highly degenerate. Only a limited subset of these combinations is typically explored for any given detection. As a result, apparent detections of trace gases risk being artifacts of incomplete modeling rather than robust identification of atmospheric constituents, especially in the low signal-to-noise regime. We illustrate these challenges using the sub-Neptune K2-18~b, where recent claims of a potential biosignature detection vanish when the considered model space is expanded. We show that numerous alternative models without potential biosignature gases provide equivalent or better fits to the observations. We demonstrate that the significance of a claimed detection relies on the choice of models being compared, and that model preference does not necessarily imply the presence of any specific gas.

 Under $\Lambda$CDM, recent baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) distance measures from DESI, which favor a low matter density $\Omega_m$, are in moderate $2-3\sigma$ tension with cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations. This tension appears alternately as a preference for the sum of neutrino masses dropping below the $\sum m_\nu = 0.06$eV value required by neutrino oscillation measurements to formally negative values; a discrepant value of $\Omega_m$ at 0.06eV; or preference for dynamical dark energy beyond $\Lambda$CDM. We show that this tension largely arises from the CMB lensing constraints on the calibration of the sound horizon for geometric measurements and relies on the measurement of the reionization optical depth $\tau$ from large-angle CMB polarization to set the lensing amplitude. Dropping these constraints removes the neutrino tension at $\sum m_\nu=0.06$eV entirely, favoring $\tau = 0.091\pm 0.011$ in $\Lambda$CDM. Beyond $\Lambda$CDM, it brings the preference for $w_0-w_a$ dynamical dark energy to below $95\%$ CL. We explore the freedom in interpreting the low-$\ell$ EE polarization constraint due to analysis choices and reionization modeling beyond the standard step-function assumption and find that this drops the neutrino tension in $\Lambda$CDM to below $95\%$ CL. Alternately, this raising of $\tau$ can also be achieved by the same reduction in large-scale curvature fluctuations that also ameliorates the low-$\ell$ temperature anomaly.

 The collision of two neutron stars is a rich source of information about nuclear physics. In particular, the kilonova signal following a merger can help us elucidate the role of neutron stars in nucleosynthesis, and informs us about the properties of matter above nuclear saturation. Approximate modeling of neutrinos remains an important limitation to our ability to make predictions for these observables. Part of the problem is the fermionic nature of neutrinos. By the exclusion principle, the expected value $f_\nu$ for the number of neutrinos in a quantum state is at most 1. Any process producing neutrinos is suppressed by a blocking factor $(1-f_\nu)$. Recent simulations focused on neutrino physics mostly use a gray two-moment scheme to evolve neutrinos. This evolves integrals of $f_\nu$ over momentum space, preventing direct calculations of blocking factors. Monte Carlo methods may be an attractive alternative, providing access to the full distribution of neutrinos. Their current implementation is however inadequate to estimate $f_\nu$: in our most recent simulations, a single Monte Carlo packet causes, in the worst cases, estimates of $f_\nu$ to jump from $f_\nu=0$ to $f_\nu\sim 10^5$. While this is concerning, this brazen violation of the fermionic nature of neutrinos has been largely inconsequential as the interactions used in simulations avoid direct calculations of $f_\nu$. We are however reaching a level of modeling at which this problem can no longer be ignored. Here, we discuss the relatively simple origin of this issue. We then show that very rough estimates of $f_\nu$ can in theory be obtained in merger simulations, but that they will require a combination of unintuitive weighting schemes for Monte Carlo packets and smoothing of the neutrino distribution at coarser resolution than what the merger simulation uses.

 Aims. The metal-poor star BPM 3066 belongs to the retrograde halo and presents unexpectedly strong spectral features of lithium. To gain insight into the origin of this peculiar abundance, we investigate the chemistry and kinematic properties of this star. Methods. We performed a local thermodynamic equilibrium chemical abundance analysis of UVES/VLT high-resolution spectra of BPM 3066 using ATLAS9 and ATLAS12 model atmospheres and the MyGIsFOS code. We further characterised the orbital properties of the star by integrating its orbit and analysing its integrals of motion using the galpy code. Results. The star BPM 3066 shows an exceptional overabundance of both lithium and beryllium. The abundances are A(Li) = 3.0 and A(Be) = 2.1, which are respectively about 0.8 and 2.2 dex higher than the Li and Be abundances expected at [Fe/H] = -1.5, the metallicity of the star. The observed ratio 7Li/9Be is 7.9, which is close to that expected from a synthesis by spallation processes. Overabundances of Si, Al, and of the neutron capture elements Sr,Y, Zr, and Ba are also measured. Kinematically, BPM 3066 has an eccentric, strongly retrograde orbit, confined to a height lower than 1 kpc from the galactic plane, and it is a candidate member of the Sequoia/Thamnos accreted galaxy. Conclusions. The processes leading to the 7Li and 9Be synthesis could have occurred in the environment of a hypernova. This is supported by some abundance anomalies like the high value of Si, [Si/Fe]=1.2 and [Si/O]=1.1. However, the simultaneous high values of N, Na, Al, Sc, Ti, and Cu are at odds with the expectations from a hypernova. Alternatively, the abundances of BPM 3066 could result from the engulfing of rocky planets that were rich in spallated Li and Be. In both cases, it is remarkable that such an extreme abundance pattern has been found in a star belonging to the Sequoia/Thamnos accreted galaxy.

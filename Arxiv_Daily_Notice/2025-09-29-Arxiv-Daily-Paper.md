 - **Abstract**
 The Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) is an international observatory currently under construction, which will consist of two sites (one in the Northern Hemisphere and one in the Southern Hemisphere). It will eventually be the largest and most sensitive ground-based gamma-ray observatory. In the meantime, a small subarray composed of four Large-Sized Telescopes (LSTs) at the Northern site will begin collecting data in the coming year. In preparation, we present a stereoscopic event reconstruction using graph neural networks (GNNs) to combine information from several telescopes of this subarray. In our previous work, we explored the use of GNNs for the stereoscopic reconstruction of gamma-ray events on simulated data from the Prod5 sample and showed that GNNs provide a better stereoscopic reconstruction. We now compare this approach to the currently foreseen method that analytically combines the output of monoscopic random forests, and explore how GNNs can be used in fusion with the Random forest algorithm in order to provide a more sensitive stereoscopic system.

 - **Abstract**
 The study of the last stages of planet formation, also known as debris disks, is fundamental to place constrains on the formation of planetary sized bodies. Debris disks are composed of dust and occasionally small amounts of gas, both released through dynamical interactions of small rocky bodies and dust particles, such as collisions and evaporation. The distribution of the dust can reveal the presence of forming planets and its composition can directly trace that of comets, asteroids and even planets. While we have been observing debris disks for 40 years now, most observations so far have been restricted to the cold outer regions of the system, and therefore information of the terrestrial zone is still missing. The improved spatial resolution, inner working angle and sensitivity that the Habitable Worlds Observatory will provide will enable a much closer look into the structure and composition of debris disks (particularly of its inner region) and enable the search for the forming rocky planets within the disk.

 - **Abstract**
 Planetesimal formation likely lasted for millions of years in the Solar nebula, and the cold classicals in the Kuiper belt are suggested to be the direct products of streaming instability. The presence of minor planetary bodies in the outer Solar System and the exo-Kuiper belts provide key constraints to planet formation models. In this work, we connected dust drift and coagulation, planetesimal formation, N-body gravity, pebble accretion, planet migration, planetary core accretion, gap opening, and internal photoevaporation in one modeling framework. We demonstrate that multiple classes of minor planets, or planetesimals, can form during disk dissipation and remain afterwards, including a scattered group, a resonant group and a dynamically cold group. Significant growth by pebble accretion was prevented by both dynamical heating due to the giant planet in the system and rapid dispersal of the disk towards the end of its lifetime. We also conducted a parameter study which showed that this is not a universal case, where the outcome is determined by the competition for dust between planetesimal formation and pebble accretion. Combining this scenario with sequential planet formation, this model provides a promising pathway towards an outer Solar System formation model.

 - **Abstract**
 Circumbinary planets (CBPs) provide a unique window into planet formation and dynamical evolution in complex gravitational environments. Their orbits are shaped not only by the protoplanetary disk but also by the perturbations from two stellar hosts, making them sensitive probes of both early- and late-stage dynamical processes. In this work, we investigate the unusual architecture of the VHS J125601.92-125723.9 system, where a retrograde, nearly polar tertiary orbits an extremely low-mass substellar binary in a hierarchical triple configuration. We find that triple body dynamics can naturally reproduce the observed high eccentricity of the inner binary and the tertiary's near-polar obliquity. However, this configuration alone cannot account for the observed mutual inclination, which is both near-polar and retrograde. This tension suggests two possible formation pathways: either the planet formed in an aligned, protoplanetary disk-like configuration and was later tilted by an additional, undetected fourth companion (below current Gaia limits), or the system formed close to its current state. Stellar flybys, in contrast, are unlikely due to their long timescales. Our results highlight both the explanatory power and the limitations of triple dynamics, and the potential role of hidden companions in shaping extreme planetary architectures.

          Stochastic analysis of ultra-high energy cosmic ray interactions

 - **Abstract**
 Photonuclear interactions between ultra-high-energy cosmic ray (UHECR) nuclei and surrounding photon fields are key to understanding the connection between the compositions observed at Earth and those emitted from the sources. These interactions can completely disintegrate a nucleus of iron over trajectory lengths of a few and up to hundreds of megaparsecs, depending on the energy of the UHECR. The stochastic nature of these interactions means that it is not possible to describe them deterministically for a single cosmic ray, and an exact formulation of the probability distributions is not yet available. Current approaches describe these interactions using either Monte Carlo simulations or solving ordinary differential equations that neglect stochasticity. Because of the limitations of these approaches, only partial capture of the process is achieved. This paper presents an analytic probabilistic description of UHECR interactions and the resulting nuclear cascades, establishing their connection to Markov jump processes. The fundamental properties of these cascades are presented, as is the computation of the usual quantities of interest, such as the horizon, spectrum, and composition. The benefits of this description are outlined using astrophysical examples related to extragalactic propagation and UHECR sources.

 - **Abstract**
 An international conference Radio Stars in the Era of New Observatories was held at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Haystack Observatory on 2024 April 17-19. The conference brought together more than 60 researchers from around the world, united by an interest in using radio wavelength observations to explore the physical processes that operate in stars (including the Sun), how stars evolve and interact with their environments, and the role of radio stars as probes of our Galaxy. Topics discussed at the meeting included radio emission from cool and ultracool dwarfs, extrasolar space weather, stellar masers, thermal radio emission from evolved stars, circumstellar chemistry, low frequency observations of the Sun, radio emission from hot stars, applications of very long baseline interferometry techniques to stellar astrophysics, stellar explosive events, the detection of radio stars in the latest generation of widefield sky surveys, the importance of radio stars for understanding the structure and evolution of the Milky Way, and the anticipated applications for stellar astrophysics of future radio observatories on the ground and in space. This article summarizes research topics and results featured at the conference, along with some background and contextual information. It also highlights key outstanding questions in stellar astrophysics where new insights are anticipated from the next generation of observational facilities operating at meter through submillimeter wavelengths.

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of the Universe's late-time accelerated expansion remains unknown. The General Relativistic Entropic Acceleration (GREA) theory offers a compelling alternative to $\Lambda$CDM, attributing cosmic acceleration to entropy growth associated with cosmic and black hole horizons, without invoking a cosmological constant. We test GREA against the latest DESI DR2 Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), multiple Type Ia supernova compilations (Union3, Pantheon$\texttt{+}$, DES-SN5YR), and cosmic microwave background (CMB) distance measurements. While GREA is not nested within $\Lambda$CDM, it achieves a comparable goodness-of-fit, highlighting its potential as a theoretically motivated framework that circumvents some of the fine-tuning issues of the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. We find that the best-fit model features a transient phantom crossing at $z \lesssim 2$, with $w_a\equiv \mathrm{d} w(a=1)/\mathrm{d}a \simeq-0.3$, in good agreement with observations. However, its present-day value $w_0\equiv w(z=0)$ is tightly constrained to be $w_0\simeq-1$. Upcoming low-redshift (i.e. $z < 1$) cosmological probes, from both background and perturbations, will offer promising avenues for further exploring the viability of the GREA theory.

          The EBLM project XVI. Spin-orbit alignment of the low mass eclipsing binary EBLM J0021-16

 - **Abstract**
 Thousands of tight ($<1$ AU) main sequence binaries have been discovered, but it is uncertain how they formed. There is likely too much angular momentum in a collapsing, fragmenting protostellar cloud to form such binaries in situ, suggesting some post processing. One probe of a binary's dynamical history is the angle between the stellar spin and orbital axes -- its obliquity. The classical method for determining stellar obliquity is the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect. It has been applied to over 100 hot Jupiters, but to less than a dozen stellar binaries. In this paper, we present the Rossiter-McLaughlin measurement of EBLM J0021-16, a $0.19M_\odot$ M-dwarf eclipsing a $1.05M_\odot$ G-dwarf on a 5.97 day, almost-circular orbit. We combine CORALIE spectroscopy with TESS photometry of primary and secondary eclipses and star spot modulation. We show that the orbital axis is well-aligned with the primary star's spin axis, with a true 3D obliquity of $\psi=4.01\pm0.54^{\circ}$. EBLM J0021-16 becomes one of only a handful of eclipsing binaries where a true obliquity has been measured. Finally, we derive the M-dwarf's mass and radius to a fractional precision better than 1\%. The radius of the M dwarf is inflated by 6\% ($7.4\sigma$) with respect to stellar models, consistent with many other M-dwarfs in the literature.

 - **Abstract**
 HR6819 is the first system with a puffed-up low mass stripped star and a classical Be star whose nature has been confirmed by optical interferometry. It shows the most extreme mass ratio (15.7 +/- 1.1), the lowest stripped star mass (0.270 +/- 0.056 Msun), and one of the shortest orbital periods (40.3266 +/- 0.0016 days) among similar post-interaction binaries. These properties make HR6819 a unique test case for binary interaction physics, in particular the efficiency of mass transfer onto the Be progenitor required to reach such an extreme mass ratio. We reconstruct the possible evolutionary history of the system with grids of MESA simulations spanning mass transfer efficiencies from fully to fifty percent conservative. We show that stable Roche lobe overflow cannot simultaneously reproduce the observed orbital period and extreme mass ratio: the maximum ratio achievable is ~11.5 at ~40 days, even in the fully conservative case. Furthermore, the observed luminosities of both components exceed those expected from their model masses; the luminosity of the stripped star would be consistent with a ~0.7 Msun mass, over twice its dynamical mass. Our results demonstrate that the post-interaction properties of HR6819 cannot be explained by stable mass transfer under standard assumptions.

 - **Abstract**
 A Structural and Thermal Model (STM) has been developed to support the new spaceborne Closed-Cycle Dilution Refrigerator (CCDR), which aims to provide continuous cooling at 100~mK for long-duration astrophysical missions. The STM is based on a hexapod architecture that ensures both thermal decoupling and mechanical robustness during launch. In this paper, we present the characterization of its thermal and mechanical performances. A dedicated experimental setup was used to investigate the thermal behavior of the STM across a broad temperature range. The study reveals limitations of the collar design, with incomplete power interception from thermal boundary resistances and vibration test failure traced to defective strut gluing. These results guide the next STM iteration with optimized collar and strut assembly for reliable CCDR operation in space.

 - **Abstract**
 We present new results for the hot Jupiters HAT-P-16b, TOI-1516b, and TOI-2046b, based on photometric observations collected using both space- and ground-based facilities. Ground-based data were collected in the 2020-2024 time span with the 0.6 m telescope (ADYU60) located at the Adiyaman University Application and Research Center (Adiyaman, Türkiye) and the 1.0 m telescope at the Türkiye National Observatory (TUG, Türkiye). Through a combination of fits to our ground-based data, the mid-transit times data from TESS and additional data taken from the literature, we present an updated linear ephemeris for each system. Transit timing variations (TTVs) were analyzed using linear, orbital decay, and apsidal precession models. The resulting BIC($\Delta$BIC) values indicate that the orbital decay model is statistically favored for HAT-P-16b and TOI-1516b, while the constant period model is preferred for TOI-2046b. False alarm probabilities (FAPs) were computed to assess the significance of any periodic signals. TOI-1516b displays a strong TTV signal with a FAP (of 0.0001) well below the 0.01 threshold, suggesting a likely dynamical origin that warrants further investigation. The higher FAP value (0.0055) for HAT-P-16b suggests that the case of a possible presence of an additional body in the system is less convincing. In contrast, the much higher FAP value (0.0196) for TOI-2046b implies that there are no statistically significant TTVs.

 - **Abstract**
 With JWST, observing separate spectra of the morning and evening limbs of hot Jupiters has finally become a reality. The first such observation was reported for WASP-39b, where the evening terminator was observed to have a larger transit radius by about 400 ppm and a stronger 4.3 $\mu$m CO$_2$ feature than the morning terminator. Multiple factors, including temperature differences, photo/thermochemistry, clouds and hazes, could cause such limb asymmetries. To interpret these new limb asymmetry observations, a detailed understanding of how the relevant processes affect morning and evening spectra grounded in forward models is needed. Focusing on WASP-39b, we compare simulations from five different general circulation models (GCMs), including one simulating disequilibrium thermochemistry and one with cloud radiative feedback, to the recent WASP-39b limb asymmetry observations. We also post-process the temperature structures of all simulations with a 2D photochemical model and one simulation with a cloud microphysics model. Although the temperatures predicted by the different models vary considerably, the models are remarkably consistent in their predicted morning--evening temperature differences. Several equilibrium-chemistry simulations predict strong methane features in the morning spectrum, not seen in the observations. When including disequilibrium processes, horizontal transport homogenizes methane, and these methane features disappear. However, even after including photochemistry and clouds, our models still cannot reproduce the observed ${\sim}2000$ ppm asymmetry in the CO$_2$ feature. A combination of factors, such as varying metallicity and unexplored parameters in cloud models, may explain the discrepancy, emphasizing the need for future models integrating cloud microphysics and feedback across a broader parameter space.

 - **Abstract**
 We use a variety of visualization techniques to display the interior and surface flows in a double white dwarf binary undergoing direct-impact mass transfer and evolving dynamically to a merger. The structure of the flow can be interpreted in terms of standard dynamical, cyclostrophic and geostrophic arguments. We describe and showcase some visualization and analysis techniques of potential interest for astrophysical hydrodynamics. In the context of R Coronae Borealis stars, we find that mixing of accretor material with donor material at the shear layer between the fast accretion belt and the slower rotating accretor body will always result in some dredge-up. We also discuss briefly some potential applications to other types of binaries.

 - **Abstract**
 We present component-separated polarization maps of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and Galactic thermal dust emission, derived using data from the BICEP/Keck experiments through the 2018 observing season and Planck. By employing a maximum-likelihood method that utilizes observing matrices, we produce unbiased maps of the CMB and dust signals. We outline the computational challenges and demonstrate an efficient implementation of the component map estimator. We show methods to compute and characterize power spectra of these maps, opening up an alternative way to infer the tensor-to-scalar ratio from our data. We compare the results of this map-based separation method with the baseline BICEP/Keck analysis. Our analysis demonstrates consistency between the two methods, finding an 84% correlation between the pipelines.

          Adaptive Reconstruction of Cluster Halos (ARCH): Integrating Shear and Flexion for Substructure Detection

 - **Abstract**
 We present ARCH (Adaptive Reconstruction of Cluster Halos), a new gravitational lensing pipeline for cluster mass reconstruction that applies a joint shear-flexion analysis to JWST imaging. Previous approaches have explored joint shear+flexion reconstructions through forward modeling and Bayesian inference frameworks; in contrast, ARCH adopts a staged optimization strategy that incrementally filters and selects candidate halos rather than requiring a global likelihood model or strong priors. This design makes reconstruction computationally tractable and flexible, enabling systematic tests of multiple signal combinations within a unified framework. ARCH employs staged candidate generation, local optimization, filtering, forward selection, and global strength refinement, with a combined fit metric weighted by per-signal uncertainties. Applies to Abell 2744 and El Gordo, the pipeline recovers convergence maps and subcluster masses consistent with published weak+strong lensing results. In Abell 2744 the central core mass within 300$h^{-1}$ kpc is $2.1\times 10^{14} M_\odot h^{-1}$, while in El Gordo the northwestern and southeastern clumps are recovered at $2.6\times 10^{14} M_\odot h^{-1}$ and $2.3\times 10^{14} M_\odot h^{-1}$. Jackknife resampling indicates typical 1$\sigma$ uncertainties of $10^{12}-10^{13} M_\odot h^{-1}$, with the all signal and shear+$\mathcal{F}$ reconstructions providing the most stable results. These results demonstrate that flexion, when anchored by shear, enhances sensitivity to cluster substructure while maintaining stable cluster-scale mass recovery.

 - **Abstract**
 The Seyfert 1 galaxy J1626+5120 is estimated to host a $10^8 M_{\odot}$ black hole (BH) accreting at Eddington ratio $\dot{m}_{\text{Edd}} \approx 0.043$. Its long-term multi-band light curve data show flicker-like variations, but in a well-sampled $g$-band light curve, we are able to determine a $\simeq 329$\,d quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) at a $\sim$4.53$\sigma$ significance. Six optical spectra were obtained for the source, three of which were taken by us. The spectra show that the variations were mainly because of flux changes blueward of 4000\,Å. We also analyze X-ray and ultraviolet (UV) data obtained with {\it the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory (Swift)}, which targeted the source in the past two years. X-ray and UV emissions of the source show variations correlated with optical. Time lags of four UV bands and four optical bands are determined with respect to the X-ray emission, which are consistent with a continuum reprocessing disk model. These properties point out a disk origin for the QPO, likely due to Lense-Thirring (LT) precession of the accretion flow at $\sim$20 gravitational radii of the BH. This QPO could be a key case linking sub-year long QPOs in jets, which have more cases reported, to LT precession.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a substantial update to the MESA Isochrones and Stellar Tracks (MIST) library, extending the MIST model grids and isochrones down the white dwarf (WD) cooling sequence with realistic physics for WD cooling timescales. This work provides a large grid of MESA models for carbon-oxygen core WDs with hydrogen atmospheres (spectral type DA/DC), descended from full prior stellar evolution calculations. The model tracks, isochrones, and WD cooling timescale contours are available on the MIST project website and at this https URL. Our WD models provide a very large, publicly available grid with detailed physics for WD cooling timescales: realistic interior and envelope compositions, with element diffusion and heavy-element sedimentation, nuclear burning at the base of the WD hydrogen envelope, core crystallization, and C/O phase separation. As a large grid of open-source stellar evolution models, these WD models provide both out-of-the-box model tracks for comparison with observations and a framework for building further WD models to investigate variations in WD physics.

          FITrig: A High-Performance Detection Technique for Efficient Ultra-Long-Period Pulsars

 - **Abstract**
 Ultra-long-period (ULP) pulsars, a newly identified class of celestial transients, offer unique insights into astrophysics, though very few have been detected to date. In radio astronomy, most time-domain detection methods cannot find these pulsars, and current image-based detection approaches still face challenges, including low sensitivity, high false positive rate, and low computational efficiency. In this article, we develop Fast Imaging Trigger (FITrig), a GPU-accelerated, statistics-based method for ULP pulsar detection and localisation. FITrig includes two complementary approaches -- an image domain and an image-frequency domain strategy. FITrig offers advantages by increasing sensitivity to faint pulsars, suppressing false positives (from noise, processing artefacts, or steady sources), and improving search efficiency in large-scale wide-field images. Compared to the state-of-the-art source finder SOFIA 2, FITrig increases the detection speed by 4.3 times for large images (50K x 50K pixels) and reduces false positives by up to 858.8 times (at 6$\sigma$ significance) for the image domain branch, while the image-frequency domain branch suppresses false positives even further. FITrig maintains the capability to detect pulsars that are 20 times fainter than surrounding steady features, even under critical Nyquist sampling conditions. In this article, the performance of FITrig is demonstrated using both real-world data (MeerKAT observations of PSR J0901-4046) and simulated datasets based on MeerKAT and SKA AA2 telescope configurations. With its real-time processing capabilities and scalability, FITrig is a promising tool for next-generation telescopes, such as the SKA, with the potential to uncover hidden ULP pulsars.

 - **Abstract**
 Pit craters are circular to subcircular depressions that lack a rim and ejecta layer and typically have a conical shape. There are several mechanisms that can explain the formation of such depressions and they are associated with collapse due to the removal of subsurface material. Possible origins of pit craters include: volcanic processes (collapse of lava tubes, magmatic chambers, intrusion of dikes), karstic dissolution, extensional faulting or volatile processes. Here, we propose that pit craters are stratigraphically on top of the ice-related landforms and present complex relationships with the gullies. The spatial relationship between the pits and these structures, along with the absence of evidence of present or past volcanic activity and the lack of evidence of any extensional faulting allows us to propose that the origin of the pit craters in the study area might be related to some volatile process. We propose here that these particular pit craters at Hale crater, are morphologically similar to Icelandic depressions located in a glacial environment. We conclude that the landforms found in the area are in close relation with glacial or periglacial conditions and pit craters might be formed by sublimation/melting of ground ice.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the spatial distribution, kinematics, and metallicity of stars in the Draco dwarf spheroidal galaxy using data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). We identify 155 high probability members of Draco using line of sight velocity and metallicity information derived from DESI spectroscopy along with {\it Gaia} DR3 proper motions. We find a mean line of sight velocity of $ -290.62\pm0.80$ km s$^{-1}$ with dispersion = $9.57^{+0.66}_{-0.62}$ km s$^{-1}$ and mean metallicity $\rm{[Fe/H]}$ = $-2.10\pm0.04$, consistent with previous results. We also find that Draco has a steep metallicity gradient within the half-light radius, and a metallicity gradient that flattens beyond the half-light radius. We identify eight high probability members outside the King tidal radius, four of which we identify for the first time. These extra-tidal stars are not preferentially aligned along the orbit of Draco. We compute an average surface brightness of 34.02 mag $\rm arcsec^{-2}$ within an elliptical annulus from the King tidal radius of 48.1 arcmin to 81 arcmin.

 - **Abstract**
 We study systematically the total expansion experienced by a certain perturbation mode during single-field inflation, not resorting to explicit models of inflation or reheating. By assuming that during the reheating stage the equation of state w{rh} can be written as a function of e-folds, the unknown dynamics during reheating parametrized by w{rh} is confined within a time integral so that any dependence on the models of inflation and reheating is isolated from model-independent contributions. Especially, the dependence on the reheating dynamics via w{rh} and the reheating temperature T{rh} is dominating. We give two illustrative examples of w{rh} to discuss its impacts on the total expansion, which can be different as much as 10 even for the same reheating temperature, depending on the shape of w{rh}.

          Fermi detection of $γ$-rays from the radio-quiet Seyfert galaxy NGC 3281

 - **Abstract**
 We report the detection of significant $\gamma$-ray emission with $\it Fermi$-LAT from the radio-quiet Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 3281, with a luminosity of $5.9\,(\pm 1.7)\times10^{41}\rm\,erg\,s^{-1}$ at a significance of $6.22\,\sigma$ (TS = $42.81$). The power-law photon index is $2.61~(\pm 0.24)$, indicative of a soft spectrum. The star formation activity in NGC 3281 is insufficient to explain its $\gamma$-ray luminosity based on the empirical relation between the infrared and $\gamma$-ray luminosities observed in other sources. The multiwavelength spectrum can be explained as due to inverse Compton scattering by relativistic electrons in the corona or jet of seed photons from the corona, disk and torus. The source is Compton-thick and attenuation of GeV photons due to pair production in the corona is nonnegligible (with an optical depth of about 10). The intrinsic $\gamma$-ray luminosity is inferred to be $3.4\,\times10^{42}$ and $2.2\,\times10^{41}\rm\,erg\,s^{-1}$ for the corona and jet model, respectively. The observed $\gamma$-ray and radio luminosities is roughly consistent with the known correlation between the two quantities, among the lowest luminosity regime. The jet origin is valid only if the radio emission is dominated by the jet.

 - **Abstract**
 HI 21-cm absorption lines are investigated to determine the origin of the neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) of the Magellanic Bridge (MB). Using the MeerKat Absorption Line Survey (MALS) data we report the detection of an HI absorption line at a peak signal-to-noise ratio of 10 caused by MB gas against the radio source J033242.97-724904.5. In combination with earlier data obtained with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) our new detected HI line permits the exploration of the MB atomic hydrogen gas across 4-6 kpc. The radial velocity profiles from the ATCA data and new data from MALS are analysed. Apart from the excitation conditions, the radial velocity structure of the HI gas seen in emission and absorption is investigated. Eventually the gas-to-dust ratio is quantified to identify the origin of the MB gas being either from the SMC (Small Magellanic Cloud) or the LMC (Large Magellanic Cloud). The HI absorption lines towards lines of sight separated by several kpc consistently coincide with the densest and perhaps coolest gas at the lower radial-velocity limit of the corresponding HI emission profiles. The gas-to-dust ratio is found to be consistent with an origin of the MB gas from the LMC. The large scale velocity distribution as seen from the HI absorption features favors the LMC-SMC direct collision scenario over the close fly-by scenario, as also currently found by numerical simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 We presented the optimization procedures of the baffle mounted on the GroundBIRD telescope for measuring the polarization of the Cosmic Microwave Background~(CMB). The telescope employs dual mirror reflective telescopes installed in a cryostat. The primary objectives were to minimize stray light contamination, maintain the integrity of the main beam, and ensure that thermal loading from the baffle remains significantly below that from the atmosphere. Using quasi-optical simulations, we have optimized the baffle's aperture angle to suppress stray light without degrading the main beam quality. We confirmed through Moon observations that the optimized baffle design works to eliminate the contamination of the stray light as expected. Furthermore, no measurable degradation in the noise equivalent temperature~(NET) was detected, indicating minimal thermal impact. These results show that our baffle optimization strategy effectively reduces systematic errors while maintaining observational sensitivity, providing valuable insights for future CMB experiments with similar optical architectures.

 The MAGIC and LST-1 telescopes, located at the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory on La Palma, operate dedicated On-Site Analysis (OSA) pipelines that provide rapid, automated processing of observational data. These systems produce high-level data products just a few hours after observations are completed, enabling quick-look analyses, next-day data quality assessments, and rapid-response science such as flare detection and Target of Opportunity follow-ups. OSA pipelines have been in continuous operation since 2012 for MAGIC and since 2021 for LST-1, automatically processing nightly data using the standard analysis chain. The experience gained from both systems provides essential lessons for the development of Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory's (CTAO's) on-site analysis, demonstrating the practical and scientific benefits of fast data processing in Cherenkov telescopes.

 - **Abstract**
 The temperature and polarization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), as measured today, may offer key insights into the topology of the early universe prior to inflation, for example, by discriminating between flat and warped geometries. In this paper, we focus on a Kaluza-Klein model with an extra spatial dimension that compactifies at the Grand Unified Theory (GUT) epoch, subject to mixed Neumann/Dirichlet boundary conditions at fixed points. As a consequence, a set of infrared cutoffs naturally emerges in both the scalar and tensor spectra, leading to observable consequences in the CMB. We examine in detail the possible signatures of such a topology, particularly in relation to the even-odd parity imbalance already reported by the COBE, WMAP and Planck missions in the temperature angular correlations at large scales. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to the existing Planck E-mode polarization data, and to the high-precision B-mode polarization measurements expected from the forthcoming LiteBIRD mission.

          Detection of HI filament: Pair Stacking vs. Filament Stacking

 - **Abstract**
 It is anticipated that the faint 21 cm signal emitted by neutral hydrogen within cosmic filaments can be detected. However, because of the signal's weakness, stacking techniques are necessary. We assessed two stacking methods--pair stacking and filament stacking--using the EAGLE and IllustrisTNG simulations. Pair stacking leverages the fact that cosmic filaments serve as the connectors between cosmic web nodes, while filament stacking directly aggregates cosmic filaments identified by galaxy distributions. Our analysis indicates that, although pair stacking is convenient, it faces contamination from massive structures, the signal from filament gets very weak after the contamination is removed. Conversely, HI detection via filament stacking appears more viable. The column density exceeds $10^{17} \,{\rm cm}^{-2}$ even when all halos are masked, and it is nearly 10 times higher than what is achieved with pair stacking. The effectiveness of filament stacking could further increase with a high number density galaxy catalog and better spatial resolution in radio observation intensity mapping. With the advent of new optical and radio data, the future detection of HI filaments looks promising.

          Starshades as technosignatures in direct imaging phase curves: Application to the Habitable Worlds Observatory targets

 - **Abstract**
 A star's luminosity increases as it evolves along the Main Sequence (MS), which inevitably results in a higher surface temperature for planets in orbit around the star. Technologically advanced civilizations may tackle this issue by installing artificial structures -- starshades -- which can reduce the radiation received by the planet. Starshades, if they exist, are potentially detectable with current or near-future technology. We have simulated phase curve signatures in direct imaging of hypothetical starshades in systems targeted by the upcoming Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), which will be tasked with searching for Earth-like exoplanets orbiting nearby stars. The starshade is assumed to be a circular, reflecting surface placed at the inner Lagrange point between the star and the planet. Our results show that the phase curve of a starshade has a distinct shape compared to that of a typical planet. The phase curve signature lies above the expected $1\sigma=10^{-11}$ single-visit precision in contrast ratio of the telescope for 70.8% of the target stars for the expected inner working angle (IWA) of around 60 mas. If the IWA can be reduced to 45 mas, the percentage of stars above the $1\sigma$ limit increases to 96.7%. With a sufficiently small IWA, HWO should be able to detect anomalies in light curves caused by starshades or similar highly-reflective surfaces -- which could serve as key indicators for technologically advanced civilizations.

 - **Abstract**
 This study presents an analysis of cosmological parameters, focusing on resolving the Hubble tension and constraining neutrino masses within a coupled quintom model. By utilizing datasets from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), Pantheon + Analysis, Cosmic Chronometers (CC), Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), and CMB Lensing, we explore the interplay between cosmological parameters and observational constraints. The model effectively reduces the Hubble tension, achieving a consistency in $H_0$ measurements of $1.37\sigma$ and $1.24\sigma$ for the CMB + ALL dataset For Planck 2018 and R22 respectively. Additionally, the study refines constraints on the total mass of neutrinos ($\Sigma_{m_{\nu}}$), with a finding of $0.115\,\text{eV}$ for the CMB + ALL dataset. The analysis examines the effective equation of state parameter ($w_{\text{eff}}$), indicating a transition towards a universe dominated by exotic energy forms. The combined datasets refine $w_{\text{eff}}$ to $-1.02\pm0.018$, underscoring the importance of multi-dataset integration in understanding dark energy dynamics. Furthermore, the interaction constant $\beta$ between the quintom scalar field and neutrinos is constrained to $0.65 \pm 0.12$ for the CMB + ALL dataset. The potential parameters $\lambda_{\sigma} = -2.09 \pm 0.082$ and $\lambda_{\phi} = 2.43 \pm 0.12$ are also determined, providing insights into the quintom model's implications for cosmological dynamics. This study offers compelling evidence for the coupled quintom model's capability to resolve the Hubble tension and refine constraints on neutrino properties, enhancing our understanding of the universe's evolution.

          N+2 Mapmaking for Polarized CMB Experiments

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce N+2 mapmaking as a novel approach to constructing maps in both intensity and polarization for multi-detector CMB data. The motivation behind this method is two-fold: Firstly, it provides individual temperature detector maps from a multi-detector set, which may be useful for component separation purposes, in particular for line emission reconstruction. Secondly, it simultaneously outputs coadded polarization maps with minimal temperature-to-polarization leakage sensitivity. Algorithmically speaking, the N+2 mapmaker is closely related to the `spurious mapmaking' algorithm pioneered by the WMAP team, but rather than solving for a spurious S map together with the three normal Stokes IQU parameters, we solve for N temperature maps and two Stokes (Q and U) parameters per pixel. The result is a statistically coherent set of physically meaningful per-detector temperature maps, each with slightly different bandpasses as defined by each detector, combined with coadded polarization maps. We test this approach on Planck Low Frequency Instrument (LFI) 30 GHz data, and find that the Planck scanning strategy is too poorly cross-linked to allow for a clean separation between temperature and polarization. However, noting that pairs of detectors within a single horn are strongly anti-correlated, we anticipate that solving for horn maps, as opposed to individual detector maps, may provide an optimal compromise between noise and temperature-to-polarization leakage minimization. When applied to simulated data with a rotating half-wave plate, for which the polarization angle coverage is greatly improved, the algorithm performs as expected.

 - **Abstract**
 Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) are organic molecules responsible for the Aromatic Infrared Bands (AIBs), observed across a multitude of astrophysical environments. Despite their ubiquity, the precise formation mechanisms of PAHs remain unclear. One of the possible way for PAHs to form is in the outflows of evolved stars, such as HD 44179, which produces the Red Rectangle nebula - a known emitter of AIBs. However, no specific PAH molecules have been detected in such environments, complicating the understanding of PAH formation and evolution. This study aimed to detect the PAH molecule corannulene C20H10, a viable candidate for radio detection due to its large dipole moment of 2.07D. We analyzed high-resolution band 4 ALMA observations of the Red Rectangle nebula, collected over almost 9 hrs. Although corannulene emission was not detected, we estimated a firm upper limit on its abundance compared to hydrogen (5x10^-13) and we discuss the lack of detection in the context of our current understanding of PAH formation and destruction mechanisms. Additionally, we report tentative detection of signals at 139.612 GHz, 139.617 GHz, and 139.621 GHz, potentially originating from cyclopropenyledine c-C3H2 and the 140 GHz H2O maser.

 - **Abstract**
 The Simons Observatory (SO) is a new suite of cosmic microwave background telescopes in the Chilean Atacama Desert with an extensive science program spanning cosmology, Galactic and extragalactic astrophysics, and particle physics. SO will survey the millimeter-wave sky over a wide range of angular scales using six spectral bands across three types of dichroic, polarization-sensitive transition-edge sensor (TES) detector modules: Low-Frequency (LF) modules with bandpasses centered near 30 and 40 GHz, Mid-Frequency (MF) modules near 90 and 150 GHz, and Ultra-High-Frequency (UHF) modules near 220 and 280 GHz. Twenty-five UHF detector modules, each containing 1720 optically-coupled TESs connected to microwave SQUID multiplexing readout, have now been produced. This work summarizes the pre-deployment characterization of these detector modules in laboratory cryostats. Across all UHF modules, we find an average operable TES yield of 83%, equating to over 36,000 devices tested. The distributions of (220, 280) GHz saturation powers have medians of (24, 26) pW, near the centers of their target ranges. For both bands, the median optical efficiency is 0.6, the median effective time constant is 0.4 ms, and the median dark noise-equivalent power (NEP) is ~40 aW/rtHz. The expected photon NEPs at (220, 280) GHz are (64, 99) aW/rtHz, indicating these detectors will achieve background-limited performance on the sky. Thirty-nine UHF and MF detector modules are currently operating in fielded SO instruments, which are transitioning from the commissioning stage to full science observations.

 - **Abstract**
 The death of massive stars is accompanied by the formation of central and accreting compact objects and the subsequent launch of relativistic jets. However, not all jets successfully drill their way out of the stellar envelope. Unsuccessful jets, also known as choked jets, may still produce radiation at lower frequencies by dissipating the jet energy into a pressurized cocoon. This cocoon expands within the stellar envelope and eventually breaks out as a mildly relativistic outflow. We investigate the plasma physics in the surroundings of massive collapsing stars harboring choked jets via relativistic, non-resistive MHD simulations. As a result, we define the parameter space allowing for jets to remain choked, and we quantify the acceleration rate and efficiency for charged particles in the strong shocks of such astrophysical environments. Preliminary results show that high Mach numbers ($\sim 100$) after 5-10 seconds of constant energy injection characterize the forward shock, possibly allowing for efficient particle acceleration and high-energy neutrino production. Our results are presented for blue supergiant progenitors.

 - **Abstract**
 The "Diamond Ring" in Cygnus X, southwest of the DR21 ridge, is a nearly circular structure of $\sim$6 pc in diameter, prominent in FIR emission and enclosed by clumpy molecular clouds traced in CO. It hosts an HII region, visible in cm emission, and resembles a classical expanding HII bubble routinely seen in the 158 $\mu$m [CII] line. However, SOFIA FEEDBACK observations in the spectrally resolved [CII] line reveal instead a slightly tilted ring of $\sim$10$^3$ M$_\odot$ expanding slowly at $\sim$1.3 km s$^{-1}$, with a bulk line-of-sight (LOS) velocity near $-2$ km s$^{-1}$. The central "Diamond" is an unrelated dense clump at $\sim$7 km s$^{-1}$. The driving source, classified from IR spectroscopy, is a B0.5e star that powers the HII region. Unlike typical 3D shells, this marks the first case where we detect only a slowly expanding CII ring. We suggest the HII region and CII bubble, initially formed by a massive star, expanded outward from a flat slab of molecular gas nearly in the plane of the sky. The ring is now confined by swept-up material of the slab, while shell components moving perpendicular to the LOS have dissipated, leading to a reduction in expansion. Dedicated simulations tracing the evolution of the CII bubble support this geometry, consistent with previous reports of HII region evolution in flat molecular clouds. We propose that the "Diamond Ring" represents the terminal phase of an expanding CII bubble driven by stellar winds and thermal pressure.

 - **Abstract**
 We present Hyper-Py, a fully restructured and extended Python implementation of HYPER (HYbrid Photometry and Extraction Routine, Traficante et al. 2015). HYPER was originally implemented in IDL, aiming to deliver robust and reproducible photometry of compact sources in FIR/sub-mm/mm maps. HYPER combines source detection via high-pass filtering, background estimation through local polynomial fitting, and source modeling with 2D elliptical Gaussians, simultaneously fitting multiple Gaussians to deblend overlapping sources. Hyper-Py preserves the original logic while offering improvements in performance, configurability, and background modeling capabilities, making it a flexible modern tool for source extraction and photometry across diverse datasets. Notably, Hyper-Py enables background estimation and subtraction across individual slices of 3D datacubes, allowing consistent background modeling along the spectral axis for line or continuum studies in spectrally resolved observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Small bodies exist in distinct populations within their planetary systems. These reservoir populations hold a range of compositions, which to first order are dependent on formation location relative to their star. We provide a general overview of the nature of the reservoirs that source exocomets, from the influence of the stellar environment through planetesimal formation to comparisons with Solar System populations. Once transitioned from a young protoplanetary disc to a debris disc, a star can expect to be rained with exocomets. While exocomets are predominantly detected to date at A-type stars, planetesimals plausibly exist across a range of stellar masses, based on exoplanet abundance, debris disc occurrence and white dwarf infall.

 - **Abstract**
 High velocity clouds supply the Milky Way with gas that sustains star formation over cosmic timescales. Precise distance measurements are therefore essential to quantify their mass inflow rates and gauge their exact contribution to the Galaxy's gas supply. We use a sample of 1,293 SDSS-V BOSS stellar spectra within 10 degrees of the high-velocity Smith Cloud (SC) to trace Na I absorption and dust extinction as functions of distance. By fitting ISM-corrected MaStar templates to each spectrum, we isolate residual equivalent widths and extinction then compare trends in the SC region to a same-latitude control field. Stars beyond 1 kpc toward the SC exhibit a significant Na I equivalent width excess ($>$0.1 Angstroms, $>$3sigma) relative to the control. Joint fits of Na I equivalent width and Av against both low and high-velocity H I column densities show that the low-velocity component is strongly correlated with both quantities, while the high-velocity term is marginally significant in extinction and consistent with zero in Na I, consistent with a patchy, low dust-to-gas ratio. Given that the excess Na I begins at distances $<2$ kpc uniquely in the direction of the Cloud, and previous estimates of the SC place it at 12.4 $\pm$ 1.3 kpc, further investigation of its distance is warranted.

 - **Abstract**
 The Taurid Resonant Swarm (TRS) within the Taurid Complex hosts dynamically-concentrated debris in a 7:2 mean-motion resonance with Jupiter. Fireball observations have confirmed that the TRS is rich in sub-meter-sized particles, but whether this enhancement extends to larger, asteroid-sized objects remains unclear. Here we reanalyze the data obtained by a Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) campaign during the 2022 TRS encounter, and find that the TRS may host up to $\sim10^2$ Tunguska-sized objects and up to $\sim10^3$ Chelyabinsk-sized objects, the latter of which agrees the estimate derived from bolide records. This translates to an impact frequency of less than once every 4 million years. However, we caution that these numbers are based on the unverified assumption that the orbital distribution of the TRS asteroids follows that of fireball-sized meteoroids. Future wide-field facilities, such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, could take advantage of TRS's close approaches in the 2020-30s and validate the constraints of the asteroid-sized objects in the TRS.

 - **Abstract**
 The search for dark matter has been ongoing for decades within both astrophysics and particle physics. Both fields have employed different approaches and conceived a variety of methods for constraining the properties of dark matter, but have done so in relative isolation of one another. From an astronomer's perspective, it can be challenging to interpret the results of dark matter particle physics experiments and how these results apply to astrophysical scales. Over the past few years, the ESCAPE Dark Matter Test Science Project has been developing tools to aid the particle physics community in constraining dark matter properties; however, ESCAPE itself also aims to foster collaborations between research disciplines. This is especially important in the search for dark matter, as while particle physics is concerned with detecting the particles themselves, all of the evidence for its existence lies solely within astrophysics and cosmology. Here, we present a short review of the progress made by the Dark Matter Test Science Project and their applications to existing experiments, with a view towards how this project can foster complementary with astrophysical observations.

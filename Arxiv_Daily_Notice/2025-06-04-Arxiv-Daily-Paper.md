 - **Abstract**
 Pulsar glitches, sudden changes in a neutron star's rotation, offer a unique window into the extreme physics governing these celestial bodies. The post-glitch recovery phase, characterized by a gradual recovery, reveals insights into the superfluid dynamics within the star. The post-glitch recovery phase probes the coupling mechanisms between different stellar components, sheds light on the properties of neutron star matter at supra-nuclear densities and even allows us to predict the time to the next glitch. In this work, we present a detailed analysis of the Vela pulsar's rotational behavior using around 100 months of observational data spanning from September 2016 to January 2025, during which four glitches were identified. Here, we demonstrate the post-glitch recovery of these glitches within the framework of the vortex creep model, providing new insights into the Vela pulsar's internal structure. Notably, we present the first-ever investigation of vortex residuals (the discrepancy between observed values and those predicted by the vortex creep model) through the lens of the vortex bending model, marking a significant step forward in understanding neutron star physics through pulsar glitches.

 - **Abstract**
 The airglow continuum in the near infrared is a challenge to quantify due to its faintness, and the grating scattered light from atmospheric hydroxyl (OH) emission lines. Despite its faintness, the airglow continuum sets the fundamental limits for ground-based spectroscopy of faint targets, and makes the difference between ground and space-based observation in the interline regions between atmospheric emission lines. We aim to quantify the level of airglow continuum radiance in the VIS -- NIR wavelength range observable with silicon photodetectors for the site Observatorio del Roque de los Muchachos in a way that our measurement will not be biased by the grating scattered light. We aim to do this by measuring the airglow continuum radiance with a minimal and controlled contamination from the broad instrumental scattering wings caused by the bright atmospheric OH lines. We measure the airglow continuum radiance with longslit $\lambda/\Delta\lambda\sim4000$ spectrograph in $\sim$100Å wide narrow band passes centered at 6720, 7700, 8700 and 10500Å (in line with the R, I, and Z broadbands) with the 2.5-meter Nordic Optical Telescope under photometric dark sky conditions. The bandpasses are chosen to be as clean as possible from atmospheric absorption and the OH line emission keeping the radiation reaching the grating surface at minimum. We observe the zenith equivalent airglow continuum to be 22.5mag/arcsec2 at 6720Å band, and 22mag/arcsec2 at 8700Å. We derive upper limits of 22mag/arcsec2 at 7700Å due to difficulty to find a clean part of spectrum for measurement, and 20.8mag/arcsec2 at 10500Å due to low system sensitivity. Within measurement errors and the natural variability expected for the airglow emission our results for the Observatorio del Roque de los Muchachos are comparable to values reported for other major observatory sites.

          Collisionless relaxation to quasi-steady state attractors in cold dark matter halos: origin of the universal NFW profile

 - **Abstract**
 Collisionless self-gravitating systems such as cold dark matter halos are known to harbor universal density profiles despite the intricate non-linear physics of hierarchical structure formation in the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. The origin of these attractor states has been a persistent mystery, particularly because the physics of collisionless relaxation is not well understood. To solve this long-standing problem, we develop a self-consistent quasilinear theory in action-angle space for the collisionless relaxation of inhomogeneous, self-gravitating systems by perturbing the governing Vlasov-Poisson equations. We obtain a quasilinear diffusion equation that describes the secular evolution of the mean coarse-grained distribution function $f_0$ of accreted matter in the fluctuating force field of a halo. The diffusion coefficient not only depends on the fluctuation power spectrum but also on the evolving potential of the system, which reflects the self-consistency of the problem. Diffusive heating by an initially cored halo develops an $r^{-1}$ cusp in the density profile of the accreted material, with $r$ the halocentric radius. Subsequent accretion and relaxation around this $r^{-1}$ cusp develops an $r^{-3}$ fall-off, establishing the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) density profile, a quasi-steady state attractor of collisionless relaxation that is not particularly sensitive to initial conditions. Given enough time though, the halo tends to Maxwellianize and develop an isothermal sphere profile. We demonstrate for the first time that the universal NFW profile emerges as an attractor solution to a self-consistent theory for collisionless relaxation.

 - **Abstract**
 Inferences on the properties Type II supernovae (SNe) can provide significant insights into the lives and deaths of the astrophysical population of massive stars and potentially provide measurements of luminosity distance, independent of the distance ladder. Here, we introduce surrogate models for the photospheric properties and lightcurves of Type II SNe trained on a large grid of simulations from the radiation hydrodynamics code, {\sc stella}. The trained model can accurately and efficiently ($\sim 30$ms) predict the lightcurves and properties of Type II SNe within a large parameter space of progenitor ($10-18 M_{\odot}$ at ZAMS) and nickel masses ($0.001-0.3M_{\odot}$), progenitor mass-loss rate ($10^{-5}-10^{-1}~M_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$), CSM radius ($1-10\times10^{14}$cm), and SN explosion energies ($0.5-5 \times 10^{51}$erg). We validate this model through inference on lightcurves and photosphere properties drawn directly from the original {\sc stella} simulations not included in training. In particular, for a synthetic Type II SNe observed within the 10-year LSST survey, we find we can measure the progenitor and nickel masses with $\approx 9\%$ and $\approx 25\%$ precision, respectively, when fitting the photometric data while accounting for the uncertainty in the surrogate model itself. Meanwhile, from real observations of SN~2004et, SN~2012aw, and SN~2017gmr we infer a progenitor ZAMS mass of $12.15_{-1.06}^{+1.03} M_{\odot}$, $10.61_{-0.32}^{+0.37} M_{\odot}$, $10.4 \pm 0.3 M_{\odot}$, respectively. We discuss systematic uncertainties from our surrogate modelling approach and likelihood approaches to account for these uncertainties. We further discuss future extensions to the model to enable stronger constraints on properties of Type II SNe and their progenitors, for cosmological applications, and applications of our surrogate modelling approach to other transients.

          SN 2024bfu, SN 2025qe, and the early light curves of type Iax supernovae

 - **Abstract**
 Type Iax supernovae (SNe Iax) are perhaps the most numerous class of peculiar thermonuclear supernova and yet their sample size, particularly those observed shortly after explosion, remains relatively small. In this paper we present photometric and spectroscopic observations of two SNe Iax discovered shortly after explosion, SN 2024bfu and SN 2025qe. Both SNe were observed by multiple all-sky surveys, enabling tight constraints on the moment of first light and the shape of the early light curve. Our observations of SN 2025qe begin <2 d after the estimated time of first light and represent some of the earliest observations of any SN Iax. We identify features consistent with carbon absorption throughout the spectroscopic evolution of SN 2025qe, potentially indicating the presence of unburned material throughout the ejecta. Inspired by our early light curve coverage, we gather a sample of SNe Iax observed by ATLAS, GOTO, and ZTF, and measure their rise times and early light curve power-law rise indices. We compare our findings to a sample of normal SNe Ia and find indications that SNe Iax show systematically shorter rise times, but the small sample size and relatively large uncertainties prevent us from identifying statistically significant differences in most bands. We find some indication that SNe Iax show systematically lower rise indices than normal SNe Ia in all bands. The low rise indices observed among SNe Iax is qualitatively consistent with extended $^{56}$Ni distributions and more thoroughly-mixed ejecta compared to normal SNe Ia, similar to predictions from pure deflagration explosions.

          Uplifting, Depressing, and Tilting Dark Energy

 - **Abstract**
 Current data in the form of baryon acoustic oscillation, supernova, and cosmic microwave background distances prefer a cosmology that accelerates more strongly than $\Lambda$CDM at $z\approx0.5-1.5$, and more weakly at $z\lesssim0.5$. We examine dark energy physics that can accommodate this, showing that interactions (decays, coupling to matter, nonminimal coupling to gravity) fairly generically tend not to give a satisfactory solution (in terms of fitting both distances and growth) even if they enable the effective dark energy equation of state to cross $w=-1$. To fit the cosmological data it appears the dark energy by itself must cross $w=-1$, a highly unusual physical behavior.

 - **Abstract**
 The simple stellar population models produced by stellar population and spectral synthesis (SPS) codes are used as spectral templates in a variety of astrophysical contexts. In this paper, we test the predictions of four commonly used stellar population synthesis codes (YGGDRASIL, BPASS, FSPS, and a modified form of GALAXEV which we call GALAXEVneb) by using them as spectral templates for photometric SED fitting with a sample of 18 young stellar clusters. All clusters have existing HST COS FUV spectroscopy that provide constraints on their ages as well as broadband photometry from HST ACS and WFC3. We use model spectra that account for both nebular and stellar emission, and additionally test four extinction curves at different values of $R_V$. We find that for individual clusters, choice of extinction curve and SPS model can introduce significant scatter into the results of SED fitting. Model choice can introduce scatter of 34.8 Myr in age, a factor of 9.5 in mass, and 0.40mag in extinction. Extinction curve choice can introduce scatter of up to a factor of 32.3 Myr in age, a factor of 10.4 in mass, and 0.41mag in extinction. We caution that because of this scatter, one-to-one comparisons between the properties of individual objects derived using different SED fitting setups may not be meaningful. However, our results also suggest that SPS model and extinction curve choice do not introduce major systematic differences into SED fitting results when the entire cluster population is considered. The distribution of cluster properties for a large enough sample is relatively robust to user choice of SPS code and extinction curve.

 - **Abstract**
 Inflation is known to produce large infrared scalar fluctuations. Further, if a scalar field $(\chi)$ is non-minimally coupled with gravity through $\xi \chi^2 R$, those infrared modes experience \textit{tachyonic instability} during and after inflation. Those large non-perturbative infrared modes can collectively produce hot Big Bang universe upon their horizon entry during the post-inflationary period. We indeed find that for reheating equation of state (EoS), $w_{\phi} > 1/3$, and coupling strength, $\xi>1/6$, large infrared fluctuations lead to successful reheating. We further analyze perturbative reheating by solving the standard Boltzmann equation in both Jordan and Einstein frames, and compare the results with the non-perturbative ones. Finally, embedding this infrared reheating scenario into the well-known $\alpha-$attractor inflationary model, we examine possible constraints on the model parameters in light of the latest ACT, DESI results. To arrive at the constraints, we take into account the latest bounds on tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r_{0.05}\leq 0.038$, isocurvature power spectrum, $\mathcal{P}_{\mathcal{S}} \lesssim 8.3\times 10^{-11}$, and effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, $\Delta N_{\rm eff} \lesssim 0.17 $. Subject to these constraints, we find successful reheating to occur only for EoS $w_{\phi}\gtrsim 0.6$, which translates to a sub-class of $\alpha-$attractor models being favored and placing them within the 2$\sigma$ region in the $ n_s-r$ plane of the latest ACT, DESI data. In this range of EoS, we find that the coupling strength should lie within $2.11\lesssim\xi\lesssim 2.95$ for $w_{\phi}=0.6$. Finally, we compute secondary gravitational wave signals induced by the scalar infrared modes, which are found to be strong enough to be detected by future GW observatories, namely BBO, DECIGO, LISA, and ET.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a search for distant planets in Pan-STARRS1. We calibrated our search by injecting an isotropic control population of synthetic detections into Pan-STARRS1 source catalogs, providing a high-fidelity alternative to injecting synthetic sources at the image level. We found that our method is sensitive to a wide range of distances, as well as all rates and directions of motion. We identified 692 solar system objects (109 of which are not yet listed in the Minor Planet Center's database), including 642 TNOs, 23 of which are dwarf planets. By raw number of detections, this makes our search the third most productive Kuiper Belt survey to date, in spite of the fact that we did not explicitly search for objects closer than 80 au. Although we did not find Planet Nine or any other planetary objects, we were able to show that the remaining parameter space for Planet Nine is highly concentrated in the galactic plane.

 - **Abstract**
 The scintillation of pulsars reveals small-scale structure of the interstellar medium. A powerful technique for characterizing the scintillating structures (screens) combines analysis of scintillation arcs and very long baseline interferometry (VLBI). We present the results of a VLBI analysis of the scintillation arcs of PSR B1133+16 from simultaneous observations with Arecibo, VLA, Jodrell Bank, Effelsberg, and Westerbork. Three arcs appear in the data set, all of which appear consistent with being the result of very anisotropic scattering screens. We are able to measure their orientations on the sky, down to uncertainties of $3^\circ$ for the two stronger screens, and measure distances, of $140\pm30$, $180\pm20$, and $280\pm50{\rm\,pc}$, consistent with, but substantially more precise than what was inferred previously from annual modulation patterns in the scintillation. Comparing with the differential dust extinction with distance in this direction, the two nearer screens appear associated with the wall of the Local Bubble.

          Interior redox state effects on the stability of secondary atmospheres and observational manifestations: LP 791-18 d as a case study for outgassing rocky exoplanets

 - **Abstract**
 Recent advances in space and ground-based facilities now enable atmospheric characterization of a selected sample of rocky exoplanets. These atmospheres offer key insights into planetary formation and evolution, but their interpretation requires models that couple atmospheric processes with both the planetary interior and the surrounding space environment. This work focuses on the Earth-size planet LP791 18d, which is estimated to receive continuous tidal heating due to the orbital configuration of the system; thus, it is expected to exhibit volcanic activity. We estimate the mantle temperature of 1680-1880 K. Our results show that the atmospheric mean molecular weight gradient is controlled by oxygen fugacity rather than bulk metallicity. Furthermore, we use the atmospheric steady-state solutions produced from the interior redox state versus surface pressure parameter space and explore their atmospheric stability. We find that stability is achieved only in highly oxidized scenarios while reduced interior states fall into the hydrodynamic escape regime with mass loss rates on the order of 10^5-10^8 kg/s. We argue that scenarios with reduced interior states are likely to have exhausted their volatile budget during the planets lifetime. Furthermore, we predict the atmospheric footprint of the planets interior based on its oxidation state and assess its detectability using current or forthcoming tools to constrain the internal and atmospheric composition. We show that the degeneracy between bare rock surfaces and thick atmospheres can be resolved by using three photometric bands to construct a color-color diagram that accounts for potential effects from photochemical hazes and clouds. Our modeling approach connects interior and atmospheric processes, providing a basis to explore volatile evolution and potential habitability.

 - **Abstract**
 The development of large-aperture submillimeter telescopes, such as the Large Submillimeter Telescope (LST) and the Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST), is essential to overcome the limitations of current observational capabilities in submillimeter astronomy. These telescopes face challenges related to maintaining high surface accuracy of the main reflector while minimizing the weight of the telescope structure. This study introduces a genetic algorithm (GA)-based structural optimization, previously applied in related works, to 50 m-class backup structures (BUSes) with a variable focal position, addressing the challenge of achieving both lightweight construction and high surface accuracy through the consideration of homologous deformation. We model the BUS as a truss structure and perform multi-objective optimization using a GA. The optimization process considers two structures: axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric between the top and bottom. The optimization aims to find structures that simultaneously minimize the maximum stroke length of actuators and the mass of the BUS under practical constraints. The optimized structures show improved surface accuracy, primarily due to the minimization of the maximum actuator stroke length, and reduced weight, both achieved under the imposed constraints. Notably, we find a homologous BUS solution that achieves a surface error of down to $\sim 5\,\mu\mathrm{m}$ RMS with a tiny portion of the truss nodes being actively controlled. The results highlight the potential of GA-based optimization in the design of next-generation submillimeter telescopes, suggesting that further exploration of non-axisymmetric structures could yield even more effective solutions. Our findings support the application of advanced optimization techniques to achieve high-performance and cost-effective telescope designs.

          WASP-121b's transmission spectrum observed with JWST/NIRSpec G395H reveals thermal dissociation and SiO in the atmosphere

 - **Abstract**
 WASP-121b has been established as a benchmark ultrahot Jupiter, serving as a laboratory for the atmospheric chemistry and dynamics of strongly irradiated extrasolar gas giants. Here, we present and analyze WASP-121b's transmission spectrum observed with NIRSpec G395H on board the James Webb Space Telescope and find evidence for the thermal dissociation of H$_2$O and H$_2$ on the planet's permanent dayside. Additionally, we detect SiO at a statistical significance of $5.2\sigma$ which is compatible with chemical equilibrium in the atmosphere. Constraining the abundance of SiO and abundance ratios between silicon and volatile atoms in WASP-121b's atmosphere could help discriminate between possible migration histories of the planet. The three-dimensional nature of thermal dissociation on WASP-121b's dayside and of recombination on its nightside, however, poses a challenge to constraining molecular abundances and elemental abundance ratios from the transmission spectrum. To account for this, we implemented an atmospheric model in the NEMESIS framework that splits the planet's atmosphere into dayside and nightside. A retrieval applying our atmospheric model to WASP-121b's transmission spectrum favors a higher H$_2$O abundance on the nightside than on the dayside, demonstrating the impact of hemispheric heterogeneity when attempting to constrain WASP-121b's bulk H$_2$O inventory.

          A Bayesian PINN Framework for Barrow-Tsallis Holographic Dark Energy with Neutrinos: Toward a Resolution of the Hubble Tension

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the Barrow-Tsallis Holographic Dark Energy (BTHDE) model using both traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods and a Bayesian Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) framework, employing a range of cosmological observations. Our analysis incorporates data from Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), CMB lensing, Cosmic Chronometers (CC), and the Pantheon+ Type Ia supernova compilation. We focus on constraining the Hubble constant $ H_0 $, the nonextensive entropy index $ q $, the Barrow exponent $ \Delta $, and the Granda-Oliveros parameters $ \alpha $ and $ \beta $, along with the total neutrino mass $ \Sigma m_\nu $. The Bayesian PINN approach yields more precise constraints than MCMC, particularly for $ \beta $, and tighter upper bounds on $ \Sigma m_\nu $. The inferred values of $ H_0 $ from both methods lie between those from Planck 2018 and SH$_0$ES (R22), alleviating the Hubble tension to within $ 1.3\sigma $-$2.1\sigma $ depending on the dataset combination. Notably, the Bayesian PINN achieves consistent results across CC and Pantheon+ datasets, while maintaining physical consistency via embedded differential constraints. The combination of CMB and late-time probes leads to the most stringent constraints, with $ \Sigma m_\nu < 0.114 $ eV and $ H_0 = 70.6 \pm 1.35 $ km/s/Mpc. These findings suggest that the BTHDE model provides a viable framework for addressing cosmological tensions and probing modified entropy scenarios, while highlighting the complementary strengths of machine learning and traditional Bayesian inference in cosmological modeling.

 - **Abstract**
 SVOM, the Space-based Variable astronomical Object Monitor, launched on June 22nd 2024, is a Chinese-French mission focused on exploring the brightest phenomena in the cosmos - Gamma-Ray Bursts. Among the four instruments on board is the Micro-channel X-ray Telescope (MXT). The MXT camera features a 256x256 pixel pnCCD detector to perform X-ray imaging and spectroscopy in the 0.2-10 keV energy range. Cruising in a low-Earth orbit (600 km) that crosses the South Atlantic Anomaly, the MXT focal plane is exposed to radiation, primarily protons, that will lead to performance degradation over time. The challenge for MXT, and possibly for future missions with similar mass and mechanical constraints, is to maintain spectral performance all along the mission duration. To assess the expected radiation-induced performance degradation, a spare flight model of MXT focal plane underwent an irradiation campaign with 50 MeV protons at the Arronax cyclotron facility in June 2022. Then, the proton irradiated spare model was characterized in detail at the X-ray Metrology beamline of the SOLEIL Synchrotron facility in June 2023, as well as with a laboratory X-ray fluorescence source. We find through the evaluation of key indicators of performance such as the charge transfer inefficiency (CTI) and the low energy threshold, that MXT will remain compliant to its requirements over the SVOM mission lifetime. We also report an unexpected effect of proton irradiation that is the inversion of the trend of CTI with energy, recovered with two different sources illuminating the detector, and never reported in literature so far.

 - **Abstract**
 The COMPAS public rapid binary population synthesis code has undergone a number of key improvements since the original COMPAS methods paper (Team COMPAS: Riley et al., 2022) was published. These include more sophisticated and robust treatments of binary interactions: mass transfer physics, common-envelope events, tides and gravitational-wave radiation reaction; and updated prescriptions for stellar evolution, winds and supernovae. The code structure and outputs have also been updated, with a focus on improving resolution without sacrificing computational speed. This paper describes the substantive changes in the code between the previous methods paper and COMPAS v03.20.02.

 We present the chemical composition of a sample of 37 red giant branch (RGB) stars belonging to the main body of the remnant of the Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf spheroidal galaxy. All stars were observed with the FLAMES-UVES high-resolution spectrograph. Twenty-three new targets are selected along the blue side of the RGB of Sgr, but outside the galaxy stellar nucleus, in order to avoid contamination by the stars of the metal-poor globular cluster M54. Additionally, we re-analyzed archival spectra of fourteen targets located on the red RGB. For this sample, we derive the abundances of 21 chemical species (from Oxygen to Europium) representing different nucleosynthetic sites. The sample covers a large range of metallicity, from [Fe/H]~-2 to ~ -0.4 dex and we can identify the transition between the enrichment phases dominated by core-collapse (CC-SNe) and Type Ia (SNe-Ia) supernovae. The observed [{\alpha}/Fe] trend suggests a knee occurring at [Fe/H]~-1.5/-1.3 dex, compatible with the rather low star formation efficiency of Sgr. At lower [Fe/H], Sgr stars exhibit a chemical composition compatible with Milky Way stars of similar [Fe/H]. The only relevant exceptions are [Mn/Fe], [Zn/Fe], and [Eu/Fe]. At [Fe/H] higher than ~ -1.5/-1.3 dex, instead, the chemical pattern of Sgr significantly deviates from that of the Milky Way for almost all the elements analyzed in this study. Some of the abundance patterns reveal a lower contribution by very massive stars exploding as hypernovae (e.g. [Mn/Fe], [Zn/Fe]), a higher contribution by sub-Chandrasekhar progenitors of SNe Ia (e.g. [Ni/Fe]) and a high production efficiency of rapid neutron-capture elements ([Eu/Fe]).

 The NSF-DOE Vera C. Rubin Observatory is a new 8m-class survey facility presently being commissioned in Chile, expected to begin the 10yr-long Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) by the end of 2025. Using the purpose-built Sorcha survey simulator (Merritt et al. In Press), and near-final observing cadence, we perform the first high-fidelity simulation of LSST's solar system catalog for key small body populations. We show that the final LSST catalog will deliver over 1.1 billion observations of small bodies and raise the number of known objects to 1.27E5 near-Earth objects, 5.09E6 main belt asteroids, 1.09E5 Jupiter Trojans, and 3.70E4 trans-Neptunian objects. These represent 4-9x more objects than are presently known in each class, making LSST the largest source of data for small body science in this and the following decade. We characterize the measurements available for these populations, including orbits, griz colors, and lightcurves, and point out science opportunities they open. Importantly, we show that ~70% of the main asteroid belt and more distant populations will be discovered in the first two years of the survey, making high-impact solar system science possible from very early on. We make our simulated LSST catalog publicly available, allowing researchers to test their methods on an up-to-date, representative, full-scale simulation of LSST data.

          Impact of convective overshooting on the single-degenerate model of Type Ia supernovae

 - **Abstract**
 The single-degenerate (SD) model is one of the principal models for the progenitors of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). However, it faces some challenges, the primary being its inability to account for the observed SN Ia birth rate. Many studies have attempted to address this issue by expanding the parameter space, defined by the initial donor star mass and orbital period, that can lead to SNe Ia, as well as by improving binary population synthesis. While these efforts have led to significant progress, many uncertainties in stellar physics persist, which influences the outcomes of such studies. Convective overshooting, which can significantly affect the internal structure of a star and subsequently its evolution within a binary system, is one of the most significant sources of uncertainty in stellar physics. We investigate the effect of convective overshooting on the parameter space and birth rate of SNe Ia within the SD model. We employed the common-envelope wind (CEW) model, a new version of the SD model, as our progenitor model. Using MESA, we obtained the parameter space that leads to SNe Ia for three different convective overshooting parameters and calculated the corresponding SN Ia birth rate. Convective overshooting expands the upper boundaries (corresponding to a larger initial donor mass) and right boundaries (corresponding to a longer initial orbital period) of the parameter space for systems with massive white dwarfs (WDs; >= 0.75Msun). However, the minimum WD mass and the parameter space for low-mass WDs - and, consequently, the calculated SN Ia birth rate - vary non-monotonically with convective overshooting parameters. The CEW model may explain the SNe Ia that interact with the circumstellar medium (CSM), i.e., SNe Ia-CSM. We find that the parameter space for SNe Ia-CSM increases with convective overshooting parameters, as does their birth rate.

 - **Abstract**
 We reconsider the 680 million year old Elatina series of sedimentary laminae from South Australia that show a remarkably stable periodicity with a main period of around 12 years, which is close to the Schwabe cycle, and a second period of 314 years that has been coined Elatina cycle. By analyzing the residuals of the series' minima from a linear trend, and deriving Dicke's ratio, we first show that the series exhibits a high degree of phase stability, except one single break point which may indicate a 90° phase jump. We discuss the data in terms of a recently developed synchronization model of the solar dynamo. This model is then employed to infer those orbital periods of Venus, Earth, Jupiter and Saturn that would be required to jointly explain the moderately changed Schwabe cycle, and the Elatina cycle when interpreted as a prolonged Suess-de Vries cycle. Assuming pairwise conservations of the sum of the angular momenta of Jupiter/Saturn and Venus/Earth, respectively, we find solutions of the underlying inverse problem which amount to approximately 1 percent angular momentum increase of Jupiter and a 0.005 per cent angular momentum increase of Earth. The plausibility of such changes over a period of seven hundred million years is discussed in light of solar system dynamics.

 - **Abstract**
 The rapid rotation of Be stars is supposed to mainly originate from binary evolution. In recent years, more and more Be stars with helium (He) star companions have been discovered, which provides a significant opportunity to study binary interaction physics. In this work, we perform binary population synthesis with an updated binary mass transfer stability criterion and try to understand the details of mass transfer processes by constructing a series of Be star + He star (BeHe) binary populations. We found that the simulations and the observations can be divided into two groups according to the masses of components, corresponding to the two distinct evolutionary processes during the mass transfer. In particular, we found that the mass ratios of BeHe binaries may be taken as a probe of the initial mass ratios of the primordial binaries. Moreover, the results suggest that a higher mass transfer efficiency ($\gtrsim 0.5$) supports the observations better. The simulations predicted too many Be star binaries experiencing Case B mass transfer, which conflicts with the observations. The reason is due to either observational selection effects or unclear physical factors.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the origin of comets requires knowledge of how the Solar System formed from a cloud of dust and gas 4.567 Gyr ago. Here, a review is presented of how the remnants of this formation process, meteorites and to a lesser extent comets, shed light on Solar System evolution. The planets formed by a process of collisional agglomeration during the first hundred million years of Solar System history. The vast majority of the original population of planetary building blocks (~100 km-scale planetesimals) was either incorporated into the planets or removed from the system, via dynamical ejection or through a collision with the Sun. Only a small fraction of the original rocky planetesimals survive to this day in the form of asteroids (which represent a total of ~0.05% of Earth's mass) and comets. Meteorites are fragments of asteroids that have fallen to Earth, thereby providing scientists with samples of Solar System-scale processes for laboratory-based analysis. Meteorite datasets complement cometary datasets, which are predominantly obtained via remote observation as there are few cometary samples currently available for laboratory-based measurements. This chapter discusses how analysis of the mineralogical, elemental, and isotopic characteristics of meteorites provides insight into (i) the origin of matter that formed planets, (ii) the pressure, temperature, and chemical conditions that prevailed during planet formation, and (iii) a precise chronological framework of planetary accretion. Also examined is the use of stable isotope variations and nucleosynthetic isotope anomalies as constraints on the dynamics of the disk and planet formation, and how these data are integrated into new models of Solar System formation. It concludes with a discussion of Earth's accretion and its source of volatile elements, including water and organic species.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an exploratory framework to test whether noise-like input can induce structured responses in language models. Instead of assuming that extraterrestrial signals must be decoded, we evaluate whether inputs can trigger linguistic behavior in generative systems. This shifts the focus from decoding to viewing structured output as a sign of underlying regularity in the input. We tested GPT-2 small, a 117M-parameter model trained on English text, using four types of acoustic input: human speech, humpback whale vocalizations, Phylloscopus trochilus birdsong, and algorithmically generated white noise. All inputs were treated as noise-like, without any assumed symbolic encoding. To assess reactivity, we defined a composite score called Semantic Induction Potential (SIP), combining entropy, syntax coherence, compression gain, and repetition penalty. Results showed that whale and bird vocalizations had higher SIP scores than white noise, while human speech triggered only moderate responses. This suggests that language models may detect latent structure even in data without conventional semantics. We propose that this approach could complement traditional SETI methods, especially in cases where communicative intent is unknown. Generative reactivity may offer a different way to identify data worth closer attention.

 We present high-frequency (18-24 GHz) radio continuum observations towards 335 methanol masers, excellent signposts for young, embedded high-mass protostars. These complete the search for hypercompact HII (HCHII) regions towards young high-mass star-forming clumps within the fourth quadrant of the Galactic plane. HCHII regions are the earliest observable signatures of radio continuum emission from high-mass stars ionizing their surroundings, though their rarity and short lifetimes make them challenging to study. We have observed methanol maser sites at 20-arcsec resolution and identified 121 discrete high-frequency radio sources. Of these, 42 compact sources are embedded in dense clumps and coincide with methanol masers, making them as excellent HCHII region candidates. These sources were followed up at higher resolution (0.5-arcsec) for confirmation. We constructed spectral energy distributions across 5-24 GHz to determine their physical properties, fitting either a simple HII region model or a power-law as needed. This analysis identified 20 HCHII regions, 9 intermediate objects, 3 UCHII regions, and 3 radio jet candidates. Combining these results with previous findings, the SCOTCH survey has identified 33 HCHII regions, 15 intermediate objects, 9 UCHII regions, and 4 radio jet candidates, tripling the known number of HCHII regions. Eleven of these sources remain optically thick at 24 GHz. This survey provides a valuable sample of the youngest HII regions and insights into early massive star formation.

 - **Abstract**
 Planet-forming disks around brown dwarfs and very low-mass stars (VLMS) are on average less massive and are expected to undergo faster radial solid transport than their higher mass counterparts. Spitzer had detected C$_2$H$_2$, CO$_2$ and HCN around these objects. With better sensitivity and spectral resolving power, JWST recently revealed incredibly carbon-rich spectra from such disks. A study of a larger sample of objects is necessary to understand how common such carbon-rich inner disk regions are and to put constraints on their evolution. We present and analyze MIRI observations of 10 disks around VLMS from the MIRI GTO program. This sample is diverse, with the central object ranging in mass from 0.02 to 0.14 $M_{\odot}$. They are located in three star-forming regions and a moving group (1-10 Myr). We identify molecular emission in all sources and report detection rates. We compare the molecular flux ratios between different species and to dust emission strengths. We also compare the flux ratios with the stellar and disk properties. The spectra of these VLMS disks are extremely molecular rich, and we detect the 10 $\mu$m silicate dust emission feature in 70% of the sample. We detect C$_2$H$_2$ and HCN in all of the sources and find larger hydrocarbons such as C$_4$H$_2$ and C$_6$H$_6$ in nearly all sources. Among O-bearing molecules, we find firm detections of CO$_2$, H$_2$O, and CO in 90%, 50%, and 20% of the sample, respectively. We find that the detection rates of organic molecules correlate with other organic molecules and anti-correlate with inorganic molecules. Hydrocarbon-rich sources show a weaker 10$\mu$m dust strength as well as lower disk dust mass than the oxygen-rich sources. We find potential evidence for C/O enhancement with disk age. The observed trends are consistent with models that suggest rapid inward solid material transport and grain growth.

 - **Abstract**
 A deep understanding of our Galaxy desires detailed decomposition of its stellar populations via their chemical fingerprints. This requires precise stellar abundances of many elements for a large number of stars. Here we present an updated catalog of stellar labels derived from LAMOST low-resolution spectra in a physics-sensible and rigorous manner with DD-Payne, taking labels from high-resolution spectroscopy as training set. The catalog contains atmospheric parameters for 6.4 million stars released in LAMOST DR9, and abundances for 22 elements, namely, C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Sr, Y, Zr, Ba, La, Ce, Nd, Sm, and Eu, for nearly 3.6 million stars with spectral signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) higher than 20. The [Fe/H] is valid down to $\sim$-4.0, while elemental abundance ratios [X/Fe] are mostly valid for stars with [Fe/H] $\gtrsim-2.0$. Measurement errors in these labels are sensitive to and almost inversely proportional with SNR. For stars with S/N>50, we achieved a typical error of 30 K in Teff, 0.07 dex in $\log g$, $\sim0.05$ dex in abundances for most elements with atomic number smaller than Sr, and 0.1--0.2 dex for heavier elements. Homogenization to the label estimates is carried out via dedicated internal and external calibration. In particular, the non-local thermal equilibrium effect is corrected for the [Fe/H] estimates, the Teff is calibrated to the infrared flux method scale, and the $\log~g$ is validated with asteroseismic measurements. The elemental abundances are internally calibrated using wide binaries, eliminating systematic trend with effective temperature. The catalog is publicly available.

 - **Abstract**
 Large-format infrared detectors are at the heart of major ground and space-based astronomical instruments, and the HgCdTe HxRG is the most widely used. The Near Infrared Spectrometer and Photometer (NISP) of the ESA's Euclid mission launched in July 2023 hosts 16 H2RG detectors in the focal plane. Their performance relies heavily on the effect of image persistence, which results in residual images that can remain in the detector for a long time contaminating any subsequent observations. Deriving a precise model of image persistence is challenging due to the sensitivity of this effect to observation history going back hours or even days. Nevertheless, persistence removal is a critical part of image processing because it limits the accuracy of the derived cosmological parameters. We will present the empirical model of image persistence derived from ground characterization data, adapted to the Euclid observation sequence and compared with the data obtained during the in-orbit calibrations of the satellite.

 Using archival data, we have made an HI absorption study of the 7$^\prime$ halo surrounding the Sgr A complex, observed towards the Galactic centre (GC) region. We find strong HI absorption near velocities of $-$53 km s$^{-1}$, which is due to the 3-kpc arm, placing it beyond 5 kpc from us. We further examined the HI absorption properties towards 5 different parts of the 7$^\prime$ halo. Absorption by +50 km s$^{-1}$ GC cloud is seen towards only 3 parts of the halo, but not towards the other 2 regions. Strong emissions in CO and CS are, however, identified toward all the above 5 parts of the halo by the +50 km s$^{-1}$ GC molecular cloud. This does show that the 7$^\prime$ halo is partly behind, and partly in front of the +50 km s$^{-1}$ cloud. To our knowledge, this, for the first time clearly shows the 7$^\prime$ halo to be located at the same distance as the +50 km s$^{-1}$ molecular cloud, i.e., at the GC region.

 The upcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) at the Vera C. Rubin Observatory is expected to revolutionize solar system astronomy. Unprecedented in scale, this ten-year wide-field survey will collect billions of observations and discover a predicted $\sim$5 million new solar system objects. Like all astronomical surveys, its results will be affected by a complex system of intertwined detection biases. Survey simulators have long been used to forward-model the effects of these biases on a given population, allowing for a direct comparison to real discoveries. However, the scale and tremendous scope of the LSST requires the development of new tools. In this paper we present Sorcha, an open-source survey simulator written in Python. Designed with the scale of LSST in mind, Sorcha is a comprehensive survey simulator to cover all solar system small-body populations. Its flexible, modular design allows Sorcha to be easily adapted to other surveys by the user. The simulator is built to run both locally and on high-performance computing (HPC) clusters, allowing for repeated simulation of millions to billions of objects (both real and synthetic).

 - **Abstract**
 V838 Monocerotis (V838 Mon) erupted in 2002 as a luminous red nova after which it cooled and began to form dust. The remnant is predicted to become a blue straggler. Interferometric observations in the HKLM bands have uncovered a stable bipolar feature in the closest vicinity of the remnant star. We aim to constrain the physical structure and nature of the circumstellar material immediately surrounding V838 Mon. Using the radiative-transfer code RADMC3D we managed to constrain the dust density distribution that best represents recent VLTI and CHARA interferometric imaging experiments. We also present recent SAAO-HIPPO polarimetric measurements which further test dust distribution models. We find that a multi-component model consisting of jets, a torus, and an ellipsoid provides an adequate fit to H band interferometric observables, however, it struggles to reproduce the extremely small closure phase deviations in the K band. The jets in our model are vital to produce nonzero closure phases, as they help to produce a gap in the torus, which is the sole source of asymmetry. The polarimetric measurements show that the intrinsic linear polarization is currently very low, with degree of polarization < 2%, consistent with our model. Although not unique, our dust model suggests a persistent torus-like structure and jet or jets in the remnant, in agreement with several predictions for an intermediate-mass merger product. However, even though these features may be important signposts of the evolution of V838 Mon to the blue straggler phase, the origin of these features, remains largely unclear.

 - **Abstract**
 We present 14.5-year multi-wavelength analysis of flat-spectrum radio quasar B2 1348+30B using Swift-UVOT, Swift-XRT, and Fermi-LAT observations. In the gamma-ray band, the 3 day bin lightcurve reveals two major flaring events on 2010-09-19 (55458 MJD) and 2022-05-26 (59725 MJD) detected at flux levels $(2.5\pm 0.5) \times 10^{-7}\,\rm{ph\,cm^{-2}\,s^{-1}}$ and $(5.2\pm 0.6) \times 10^{-7}\,\rm{ph\,cm^{-2}\,s^{-1}}$. The Bayesian block analysis of the flares suggested the variability timescale to be $\leq$ 3\,day. To study the dynamic nature of the source, multi-wavelength spectrum was obtained for three flux states which includes the two flaring state and a relative low state. The $\gamma$-ray spectra of the source in all the states are well fitted by a power-law model with maximum photon energy < 20 GeV. In X-ray, a power-law model can explain the flaring state spectra while a broken power-law with extremely hard high energy component was required to model the low flux state. This indicates the presence of the low energy cutoff in the Compton spectral component. A simple one-zone leptonic model involving synchrotron, synchrotron self Compton and external Compton mechanism can successfully reproduce the broad-band spectral energy distribution of all the flux states. The model parameters suggest significant increase in the jet Lorentz factor during the high flux states. Further, the best fit parameters are used to constrain the minimum energy of the emitting electron distribution from the hard high energy spectrum of the low flux state. This analysis was extended to draw limits on the kinetic power of the blazar jet and was compared with the Eddington luminosity of the central black hole.

 - **Abstract**
 Excess over the stellar photospheric emission of main-sequence stars has been found in interferometric near-infrared observations, and is attributed to the presence of hot exozodiacal dust (HEZD). As part of our effort to detect and characterize HEZD around the nearby A3 V star Fomalhaut, we carried out the first interferometric observations with the MATISSE instrument at the VLTI in the photometric bands L and M for the Fomalhaut system. Assuming a dust distribution either as a narrow ring or spherical shell for modeling the HEZD, we aim to constrain the HEZD parameters by generating visibilities and fitting them to the MATISSE data using different approaches. The L band data provide a marginal detection of circumstellar radiation, potentially caused by the presence of HEZD, which is only the second detection of HEZD emission in the L band. An analysis of the data with different fitting approaches showed that the best-fit values for the HEZD parameters are consistent with those of previous Fomalhaut observations, which underlines the functionality of MATISSE. Assuming a dust ring, it would have an inner ring radius of \(0.11\ \mathrm{au}\), an outer ring radius of \(0.12\ \mathrm{au}\), a narrow dust grain size distribution around a dust grain radius constrained by \(0.53\ \mu\mathrm{m}\), and a total dust mass of \(3.25\times 10^{-10}\ \rm{M}_{\oplus}\). Finally, the results indicate that the choice of the geometric model has a more significant impact on the derived dust-to-star flux ratio than the specific fitting approach applied. Since different dust-to-star flux ratios can result from the applied fitting approaches, this also has an impact on the parameter values of the HEZD around Fomalhaut and most likely for other HEZD systems. Moreover, further NIR and MIR data are required for a more comprehensive description of the emission originating in the vicinity of Fomalhaut.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the largest survey to date characterising intended and unintended emission from Starlink satellites across the SKA-Low frequency range. This survey analyses ~76 million full sky images captured over ~29 days of observing with an SKA-Low prototype station - the Engineering Development Array 2 - at the site of SKA-Low. We report 112,534 individual detections of 1,806 unique Starlink satellites, some emitting broadband emission and others narrowband emission. Our analysis compares observations across different models of Starlink satellite, with 76% of all v2-mini Ku and 71% of all v2-mini Direct to Cell satellites identified. It is shown that in the worst cases, some datasets have a detectable Starlink satellite in ~30% of all images acquired. Emission from Starlink satellites is detected in primary and secondary frequency ranges protected by the International Telecommunication Union, with 13 satellites identified between 73.00 - 74.60 MHz and 703 identified between 150.05 - 153.00 MHz. We also detect the reflections of terrestrial FM radio off different models of Starlink satellites at 99.70 MHz. The polarisation of the broadband emission shows the flux density of two orthogonal polarisations is anti-correlated with temporally shifting spectral structure observed. We compare our results to previous EDA2 and LOFAR results and provide open public access to our final data products to assist in quantifying future changes in this emission.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the velocity ellipsoids in an $N$-body$+$SPH simulation of a barred galaxy which forms a bar with a BP bulge. We focus on the 2D kinematics, and quantify the velocity ellipses by the anisotropy, $\beta_{ij}$, the correlation, $\rho_{ij}$, and the vertex deviation, $l_{\rm v}$. We explore the variations in these quantities based on stellar age within the bulge and compare these results with the Milky Way's bulge using data from APOGEE DR16 and {\it Gaia} DR3. We first explore the variation of the model's velocity ellipses in galactocentric velocities, $v_R$ and $v_\phi$, for two bulge populations, a (relatively) young one and an old one. The bar imprints quadrupoles on the distribution of ellipse properties, which are stronger in the young population, as expected from their stronger bar. The quadrupoles are distorted if we use heliocentric velocities $v_r$ and $v_l$. We then project these kinematics along the line of sight onto the $(l,b)$-plane. Along the minor axis $\beta_{rl}$ changes from positive at low $|b|$ to negative at large $|b|$, crossing over at lower $|b|$ in the young stars. Consequently the vertex deviation peaks at lower $|b|$ in the young population, but reaches similar peak values in the old. The $\rho_{rl}$ is much stronger in the young stars, and traces the bar strength. The APOGEE stars split by the median [Fe/H] follow the same trends. Lastly we explore the velocity ellipses across the entire bulge region in $(l,b)$ space, finding good qualitative agreement between the model and observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Modern spectroscopic surveys output large data volumes. Theoretical models provide a means to transform the information encoded in these data to measurements of physical stellar properties. However, in detail the models are incomplete and simplified, and prohibit interpretation of the fine details in spectra. Instead, the available data provide an opportunity to use data-driven, differential analysis techniques, as a means towards understanding spectral signatures. We deploy such an analysis to examine core helium-fusing red clump (RC) and shell hydrogen-fusing red giant branch (RGB) stars, to uncover signatures of evolutionary state imprinted in optical stellar spectra. We exploit 786 pairs of RC and RGB stars from the GALAH survey, chosen to minimise spectral differences, with evolutionary state classifications from TESS and K2 asteroseismology. We report sub-percent residual, systematic spectral differences between the two classes of stars, and show that these residuals are significant compared to a reference sample of RC$-$RC and RGB$-$RGB pairs selected using the same criteria. First, we report systematic differences in the Swan ($\rm{C}_2$) band and CN bands caused by stellar evolution and a difference in mass, where RGB stars at similar stellar parameters have higher masses than RC stars. Secondly, we observe systematic differences in the line-width of the H$_{\alpha}$ and H$_{\beta}$ lines caused by a difference in microturbulence, as measured by GALAH, where we measure higher microturbulence in RC stars than RGB stars. This work demonstrates the ability of large surveys to uncover the subtle spectroscopic signatures of stellar evolution using model-free, data-driven methods.

 - **Abstract**
 Imaging terrestrial exoplanets around nearby stars is a formidable technical challenge, requiring the development of coronagraphs to suppress the stellar halo of diffracted light at the location of the planet. In this review, we derive the science requirement for high-contrast imaging, present an overview of diffraction theory and the Lyot coronagraph, and define the parameters used in our optimization. We detail the working principles of coronagraphs both in the laboratory and on-sky with current high-contrast instruments, and we describe the required algorithms and processes necessary for terrestrial planet imaging with the extremely large telescopes and proposed space telescope missions: * Imaging terrestrial planets around nearby stars is possible with a combination of coronagraphs and active wavefront control using feedback from wavefront sensors. * Ground based 8-40m class telescopes can target the habitable zone around nearby M dwarf stars with contrasts of $10^{-7}$ and space telescopes can search around solar-type stars with contrasts of $10^{-10}$. * Focal plane wavefront sensing, hybrid coronagraph designs and multiple closed loops providing active correction are required to reach the highest sensitivities. * Polarization effects need to be mitigated for reaching $10^{-10}$ contrasts whilst keeping exoplanet yields as high as possible. * Recent technological developments, including photonics and microwave kinetic inductance detectors, will be folded into high-contrast instruments.

 - **Abstract**
 We present new or updated angular diameters, physical radii, and effective temperatures for 145 stars from the Navy Precision Optical Interferometer data archive. We used data from 1996 to late-2021, and we describe the differences between early and late data, which hinge upon an update of the beam combiner in 2002. We came across several sub-categories of stars of interest: 13 of our stars are promising targets for the Habitable World Observatory and therefore require as much study as possible, and 14 more are asteroseismic targets and have stellar masses after we combined our radii and effective temperatures with frequencies of maximum oscillation power values from the literature. In addition to this, many of the stars here show measurements to the first null in the visibility curve and beyond, which is the gateway to determining second-order effects such as direct measurements of limb-darkening. Finally, we consider the stars in the larger context of previous NPOI measurements and find the majority 75% of the angular diameters in the overall NPOI sample have uncertainties of 2% or less.

          Normal Distribution of Crab Pulsar Glitch Activity from a Glitch Cluster Perspective

 - **Abstract**
 As the most extensively and continuously monitored neutron star, the Crab pulsar serves as representative of the earliest evolutionary stage. Its unique and complex glitch phenomenology provides an unparalleled testing ground for theoretical models of neutron star interior dynamics. Within the self-organized criticality paradigm, Crab pulsar glitch sizes are modeled by a power-law distribution and waiting times by an exponential distribution. However, this framework is incompatible with neutron-star microphysics and fails to account for the quasi-periodic glitch behavior. Using a glitch-clustering perspective, which is motivated by the hypothesis that each event releases only a fraction of the stored angular momentum, we merged small glitches occurring within short temporal separations. We reveal a correlation between glitch size and waiting time and uncover that the waiting-time cumulative distribution function follows a normal distribution. Crucially, without recourse to complex statistical models, this approach permits a reasonable forecast of the next glitch. From the perspective of the dense-glitch region, the Crab pulsar currently falls within the $3\sigma$-$4\sigma$ probability interval. For the existence of a long-term periodicity of 6.68 years, the $\pm1\sigma$ interval defines a time window extending from the present to approximately 387 days ahead, this implies the next glith would emerge at any time before MJD 61081 (February 2026).

 - **Abstract**
 During the course of publishing angular diameters from the Navy Precision Optical Interferometer data archive, we found we had data on 17 confirmed exoplanet host stars and one exoplanet candidate (HD 20902/alpha Per). Here, we update our previously published stellar radii with more precise Gaia parallaxes when available, and use our radius and effective temperature measurements to fit each star's mass and age using MIST models. The mass changed by more than 10% for 9 of the 18 stars. Combining our updated masses, radii, and temperatures, we present refined planetary masses as well as habitable zone calculations.

 - **Abstract**
 Cold dark matter may form dense structures around supermassive black holes (SMBHs), significantly influencing their local environments. These dense regions are ideal sites for the formation of extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs), in which stellar-mass compact objects gradually spiral into SMBH, emitting gravitational waves (GWs). Space-based gravitational-wave (GW) observatories such as LISA and Taiji will be sensitive to these signals, including early-stage EMRIs (E-EMRIs) that persist in the low-frequency band for extended periods. In this work, we investigate the impact of dark matter-induced dynamical friction on E-EMRIs in the Milky Way Center, model its effect on the trajectory, and calculate the resulting modifications to the GW spectrum. Our analysis suggests that this influence might be sizable and lead to detectable deviations in the spectrum, namely suppression at low frequencies and enhancement at high frequencies, therefore providing a potential probe for dark matter with future GW detectors in space, such as LISA and Taiji.

          Local dark matter density from Gaia DR3 K-dwarfs using Gaussian processes

 - **Abstract**
 Modern astrophysical surveys have produced a wealth of data on the positions and velocities of stars in the Milky Way with varying accuracies. An ever-increasing detail in observational data calls for more complex physical models and in turn more sophisticated statistical methods to extract information. We perform a vertical Jeans analysis, including a local approximation of the tilt term, using a sample of $200\,000$ K-dwarf stars from the Gaia DR3 catalogue. After combination with the Survey-of-Surveys (SoS) catalogue, $160\,888$ of those have radial velocity measurements. We use Gaussian processes as priors for the covariance matrix of radial and vertical velocities. Joint inference of the posterior distribution of the local dark matter density and the velocity moments is performed using geometric variational inference. We find a local dark matter density of ${\rho_\mathrm{dm} = 0.0131 \pm 0.0041\, \mathrm{M}_\odot\,\mathrm{pc}^{-3} = 0.50 \pm 0.15\, \mathrm{GeV}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-3}}$ at the Sun's position, which is in agreement with most other recent analyses. By comparing a ($z$-dependent) Gaussian process prior with a ($z$-independent) scalar prior for the tilt term, we quantify its impact on estimates of the local dark matter density and argue that careful modelling is required to mitigate systematic biases.

 - **Abstract**
 Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for solving differential equations by integrating physical laws into the learning process. This work leverages PINNs to simulate gravitational collapse, a critical phenomenon in astrophysics and cosmology. We introduce the Schrödinger-Poisson informed neural network (SPINN) which solve nonlinear Schrödinger-Poisson (SP) equations to simulate the gravitational collapse of Fuzzy Dark Matter (FDM) in both 1D and 3D settings. Results demonstrate accurate predictions of key metrics such as mass conservation, density profiles, and structure suppression, validating against known analytical or numerical benchmarks. This work highlights the potential of PINNs for efficient, possibly scalable modeling of FDM and other astrophysical systems, overcoming the challenges faced by traditional numerical solvers due to the non-linearity of the involved equations and the necessity to resolve multi-scale phenomena especially resolving the fine wave features of FDM on cosmological scales.

 We report the results from the ground and on-orbit verifications of the XRISM timing system when the satellite clock is not synchronized to the GPS time. In this case, the time is determined by a free-run quartz oscillator of the clock, whose frequency changes depending on its temperature. In the thermal vacuum test performed in 2022, we obtained the GPS unsynchronized mode data and the temperature-versus-clock frequency trend. Comparing the time values calculated from the data and the true GPS times when the data were obtained, we confirmed that the requirement (within a 350 $\mu$s error in the absolute time, accounting for both the spacecraft bus system and the ground system) was satisfied in the temperature conditions of the thermal vacuum test. We also simulated the variation of the timing accuracy in the on-orbit temperature conditions using the Hitomi on-orbit temperature data and found that the error remained within the requirement over $\sim 3 \times 10^{5}$ s. The on-orbit tests were conducted in 2023 September and October as part of the bus system checkout. The temperature versus clock frequency trend remained unchanged from that obtained in the thermal vacuum test and the observed time drift was consistent with that expected from the trend.

 - **Abstract**
 Modelling the coherent pulsations observed during thermonuclear bursts offers a valuable method to probe the poorly understood equation of state of dense and cold matter. Here we apply the pulse profile modelling technique to the pulsations observed with RXTE during the 2001 superburst of 4U 1636$-$536. By employing a single, uniform-temperature hot spot model with varying size and temperature, along with various assumptions for background/accretion contribution, we find that each assumption leads to different inferred mass, radius, and compactness constraints. This highlights the critical need to better understand the mass accretion rate enhancement/reduction during thermonuclear bursts to accurately model burst oscillation sources using pulse profile modelling.

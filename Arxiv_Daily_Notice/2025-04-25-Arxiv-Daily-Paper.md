          On the feasibility of laser satellite communications from the Martian surface

 - **Abstract**
 Free space optical (FSO) communication using lasers is a rapidly developing field in telecommunications that can offer advantages over traditional radio frequency technology. For example, optical laser links may allow transmissions at far higher data rates, require less operating power and smaller systems and have a smaller risk of interception. In recent years, FSO laser links have been demonstrated, tested or integrated in a range of environments and scenarios. These include FSO links for terrestrial communication, between ground stations and cube-sats in low Earth orbit, between ground and satellite in lunar orbit, as part of scientific or commercial space relay networks, and deep space communications beyond the moon. The possibility of FSO links from and to the surface of Mars could be a natural extension of these developments. In this paper we evaluate some effects of the Martian atmosphere on the propagation of optical communication links, with an emphasis on the impact of dust on the total link budget. We use the output of the Mars Climate Database to generate maps of the dust optical depth for a standard Mars climatology, as well as for a warm (dusty) atmosphere. These dust optical depths are then extrapolated to a wavelength of 1.55 um, and translated into total slant path optical depths to calculate link budgets and availability statistics for a link between the surface and a satellite in a sun-synchronous orbit. The outcomes of this study are relevant to potential future missions to Mars that may require laser communications to or from its surface. For example, the results could be used to constrain the design of communication terminals suitable to the Mars environment, or to assess the link performance as a function of ground station location.

          On Validating Angular Power Spectral Models for the Stochastic Gravitational-Wave Background Without Distributional Assumptions

 - **Abstract**
 It is demonstrated that estimators of the angular power spectrum commonly used for the stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) lack a closed-form analytical expression for the likelihood function and, typically, cannot be accurately approximated by a Gaussian likelihood. Nevertheless, a robust statistical analysis can be performed by extending the framework outlined in \cite{PRL} to enable the estimation and testing of angular power spectral models for the SGWB without specifying distributional assumptions. Here, the technical aspects of the method are discussed in detail. Moreover, a new, consistent estimator for the covariance of the angular power spectrum is derived. The proposed approach is applied to data from the third observing run (O3) of Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo.

          Thermal Emission and Confirmation of the Frigid White Dwarf Exoplanet WD 1856+534b

 - **Abstract**
 We report the detection of thermal emission from and confirm the planetary nature of WD 1856+534b, the first transiting planet known to orbit a white dwarf star. Observations with JWST's Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) reveal excess mid-infrared emission from the white dwarf, consistent with a closely-orbiting Jupiter-sized planet with a temperature of $186^{+6}_{-7}$ K. We attribute this excess flux to the known giant planet in the system, making it the coldest exoplanet from which light has ever been directly observed. These measurements constrain the planet's mass to no more than six times that of Jupiter, confirming its planetary nature and ruling out previously unexcluded low-mass brown dwarf scenarios. WD 1856+534b is now the first intact exoplanet confirmed within a white dwarf's "forbidden zone", a region where planets would have been engulfed during the star's red giant phase. Its presence provides direct evidence that planetary migration into close orbits, including the habitable zone, around white dwarfs is possible. With an age nearly twice that of the Solar System and a temperature akin to our own gas giants, WD 1856+534b demonstrates JWST's unprecedented ability to detect and characterize cold, mature exoplanets, opening new possibilities for imaging and characterizing these worlds in the solar neighborhood.

 - **Abstract**
 The mass of the Local Group (LG), comprising the Milky Way (MW), Andromeda (M31), and their satellites, is crucial for validating galaxy formation and cosmological models. Traditional virial mass estimates, which rely on line-of-sight (LoS) velocities and simplified infall assumptions, are prone to systematic biases due to unobserved velocity components and anisotropic kinematics. Using the TNG cosmological simulation, we examine two limiting cases: the \underline{minor infall} model -- ignoring perpendicular velocities to the LoS directions) and the \underline{major infall} model -- assuming purely radial motion towards the Center of Mass (CoM). Our simulations demonstrate that geometric corrections are vital: the minor-infall model underestimates the true mass, while the major-infall model overestimates it. By applying these calibrated corrections to observed dwarf galaxy kinematics within 1 Mpc of the LG's CoM, we derive a refined LG mass of $M_{\mathrm{LG}} = (2.99 \pm 0.60) \times 10^{12}\, M_\odot$. This finding aligns with predictions from the $\Lambda$CDM model, timing arguments, and independent mass estimates, resolving previous discrepancies. Our analysis highlights the importance of correcting for velocity anisotropy and offers a robust framework for dynamical mass estimation in galaxy groups.

          The black hole - pair instability boundary for high stellar rotation

 - **Abstract**
 The Pair Instability (PI) boundary is crucial for understanding heavy merging Black Holes (BHs) and the second mass gap's role in galactic chemical evolution. So far, no works have critically and systematically examined how rotation and mass loss affect the PI boundary or BH masses below it. Rapid rotation significantly alters stellar structure and mass loss, which is expected to have significant effects on the evolution of stellar models. We have previously derived a critical core mass independent of stellar evolution parameters, finding the BH (Pulsational) PI boundary at $M_{ CO, crit} = 36.3 M_\odot$ for a carbon-oxygen (CO) core. Using MESA, we model massive stars around the PI boundary for varying rotation rates and metallicities. We implement mechanical mass loss in MESA, studying its effects on massive stars in low-metallicity environments. Below $1/100$th $Z_\odot$, mechanical mass loss dominates over radiative winds. We check the BH-PI boundary for rapid rotators to confirm our critical core mass criterion and derive model fits describing rotation's impact on core and final masses. Fast rotators reach a point (typically $\Omega / \Omega_{crit} \approx 0.6$) where the entire star becomes chemically homogeneous, evolving like a stripped star. This lowers the maximum BH mass before PI to its critical core mass of $M_{CO, crit} = 36.3 M_\odot$, aligning with the bump feature in the BH mass distribution observed by LIGO/VIRGO.

          Towards understanding stellar variability at the sub m/s level: Isolating granulation signals in synthetic spectral lines

 - **Abstract**
 Granulation in the photospheres of FGK-type stars induces variability in absorption lines, complicating exoplanet detection via radial velocities and characterisation via transmission spectroscopy. We aim to quantify the impact of granulation on the radial velocity and bisector asymmetry of stellar absorption lines of varying strengths and at different limb angles. We use 3D radiation-hydrodynamic simulations from MURaM paired with MPS-ATLAS radiative transfer calculations to synthesise time series' for four Fe I lines at different limb angles for a solar-type star. Our line profiles are synthesised at an extremely high resolution (R = 2,000,000), exceeding what is possible observationally and allowing us to capture intricate line shape variations. We introduce a new method of classifying the stellar surface into three components and use this to parameterise the line profiles. Our parameterisation method allows us to disentangle the contributions from p-modes and granulation, providing the unique opportunity to study the effects of granulation without contamination from p-mode effects. We validate our method by comparing radial velocity power spectra of our granulation time series to observations from the LARS spectrograph. We find that we are able to replicate the granulation component extracted from observations of the Fe I 617 nm line at the solar disk centre. We use our granulation-isolated results to show variations in convective blueshift and bisector asymmetry at different limb angles, finding good agreement with empirical results. We show that weaker lines have higher velocity contrast between granules and lanes, resulting in higher granulation-induced velocity fluctuations. Our parameterisation provides a computationally efficient strategy to construct new line profiles, laying the groundwork for future improvements in mitigating stellar noise in exoplanet studies.

          Black hole-accretion disk collision in general relativity: Axisymmetric simulations

 - **Abstract**
 Motivated by recent discoveries of X-ray quasi-periodic eruptions, we revisit the collision of a black hole and an accretion disk. Assuming that they are orbiting a supermassive black hole in orthogonal orbits, we perform a general relativistic simulation of the collision, varying the relative velocity $V_0$ from $0.032c$ to $0.2c$ (where $c$ is the speed of light) with a variety of disk thickness and a realistic local density profile for the disk. Our findings indicate that the mass of the outflow matter from the disk, $m_{\rm ej}$, is slightly less than the expected value. Meanwhile, the typical energy associated with this outflow $E_{\rm ej}$ is $\sim m_{\rm ej}V_0^2$. Thus, the predicted peak luminosity from disk flares is approximately equal to the Eddington luminosity of the black hole, whereas the peak time and duration of the flares, which are $\propto m_{\rm ej}^{1/2}$, are shorter than that previously believed. We also demonstrate that the property of the outflow matter induced by the incoming and outgoing stages of the black hole collision is appreciably different. We find that a high mass accretion rate onto the black hole from the disk persists for a timescale of $\sim 10^6$ Schwarzschild time of the black hole after the collision for $V_0/c \lesssim 0.1$, making this long-term accretion onto the black hole the dominant emission process for black hole-disk collision events. Implications of these results are discussed.

          Sub-Day Timescale X-ray Spectral Variability of the TeV Blazars Mrk 421 and 1ES 1959+650

 - **Abstract**
 We present X-ray spectra ($0.7-20$ keV) of two high synchrotron-peaked blazars Mrk 421 and 1ES 1959+650 from simultaneous observations by the SXT and LAXPC instruments onboard \textit{AstroSat} and the \textit{Swift}-XRT during multiple intervals in 2016-19. The spectra of individual epochs are satisfactorily fitted by the log-parabola model. We carry out time-resolved X-ray spectroscopy using the \textit{AstroSat} data with a time resolution of $\sim$10 ks at all epochs, and study the temporal evolution of the best-fit spectral parameters of the log-parabola model. The energy light curves, with duration ranging from $0.5-5$ days, show intra-day variability and change in brightness states from one epoch to another. We find that the variation of the spectral index ($\alpha$) at hours to days timescale has an inverse relation with the energy flux and the peak energy of the spectrum, which indicates a harder-when-brighter trend in the blazars. The variation of curvature ($\beta$) does not follows a clear trend with the flux and has an anti-correlation with $\alpha$. Comparison with spectral variation simulated using a theoretical model of time variable nonthermal emission from blazar jets shows that radiative cooling and gradual acceleration of emitting particles belonging to an initial simple power-law energy distribution can reproduce most of the variability patterns of the spectral parameters at sub-day timescales.

          Excitation of post-AGB Star Binary Eccentricity by Massive Polar-Aligned Circumbinary Disks

 - **Abstract**
 Many post-AGB star binaries are observed to have relatively high orbital eccentricities (up to 0.6). Recently, AC Her was observed to have a polar-aligned circumbinary disk. We perform hydrodynamic simulations to explore the impact of a polar-aligned disk on the eccentricity of a binary. For a binary system with central masses of 0.73 M_sun and 1.4 M_sun, we find that a disk with a total mass of 0.1 M_sun can enhance the binary eccentricity from 0.2 to 0.7 within 5000 years, or from 0.01 to 0.65 within 15000 years. Even if the disk mass is as low as 0.01 M_sun, the binary eccentricity grows within our simulation time while the system remains stable. These eccentricity variations are associated with the variations of the inclination between the disk and the binary orbit due to von Zeipel-Kozai-Lidov oscillations. The oscillations eventually damp and leave the binary eccentricity at a high value. The numerical results are in good agreement with analytical estimates. In addition, we examine the AC-Her system and find that the disk mass should be on the order of 10^(-3)M_sun for the disk to remain polar.

 - **Abstract**
 Producing stable $^{58}$Ni in Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) requires sufficiently high density conditions that are not predicted for all origin scenarios, so examining the distribution of $^{58}$Ni using the NIR [Ni II] 1.939 $\mu$m line may observationally distinguish between possible progenitors and explosion mechanisms. We present 79 telluric-corrected NIR spectra of 22 low-redshift SNe Ia from the Carnegie Supernova Project-II ranging from +50 to +505 days, including 31 previously unpublished spectra. We introduce the Gaussian Peak Ratio, a detection parameter that confirms the presence of the NIR [Ni II] 1.939 $\mu$m line in 8 SNe in our sample. Non-detections occur at earlier phases when the NIR Ni line has not emerged yet or in low signal-to-noise spectra yielding inconclusive results. Subluminous 86G-like SNe Ia show the earliest NIR Ni features around ~+50 days, whereas normal-bright SNe Ia do not exhibit NIR Ni until ~+150 days. NIR Ni features detected in our sample have low peak velocities ($v$~1200 km/s) and narrow line widths ($\leq$ 3500 km/s), indicating stable $^{58}$Ni is centrally located. This implies high density burning conditions in the innermost regions of SNe Ia and could be due to higher mass progenitors (i.e. near-$M_{ch}$). NIR spectra of the nearly two dozen SNe Ia in our sample are compared to various model predictions and paired with early-time properties to identify ideal observation windows for future SNe Ia discovered by upcoming surveys with Rubin-LSST or the Roman Space Telescope.

          Venus and Bright Planets Through a Large-Scale Camera Obscura: Optical and Mechanical Issues of Conducting the Observations

 - **Abstract**
 The article describes observations of the crescent of Venus and other bright planets using a large camera obscura. The goal of the article is to demonstrate that these observations can be successfully performed. Achieving positive results depends on solving several key problems. The most significant of these is the difficulty of perceiving the extremely faint light of a planet on the camera obscura screen. This issue is resolved through the use of special directional screens. Two main types (translucent and reflective) are described in the article. The construction of a so-called ``artificial Venus'', designed to test directional screens and determine the average sensitivity of human vision, is also presented. \\ Other serious challenges include aiming the camera obscura at the celestial object and compensating for Earth's rotation. One of the methods discussed involves the use of a flat intermediate mirror and a special mount for its guidance.\\ The objective of the paper is fulfilled through the presentation of both visual and photographic observation results. In addition to Venus's crescent, observations of the Saturn's rings are also presented. The proposed design of the camera obscura, which incorporates a specialized projection system, enables the separation of its two functions: directing light from objects and focusing its energy. The elements performing these tasks are fully scalable. This can be used in the construction of modern telescopes. The article also comments on the possibility of observing the phases of Venus in the distant past and the important consequences resulting from this.

          Formation and Evolution Simulations of Saturn, Including Composition Gradients and Helium Immiscibility

 - **Abstract**
 The formation of Saturn is modeled by detailed numerical simulations according to the core-nucleated accretion scenario. Previous models are enhanced to include the dissolution of accreting planetesimals, composed of water ice, rock, and iron, in the gaseous envelope of the planet, leading to a non-uniform composition with depth. The immiscibility of helium in metallic hydrogen layers is also considered. The calculations start at a mass $0.5$ Earth masses and are extended to the present day. At 4.57 Gyr, the model, proceeding outwards, has the following structure: (i) a central core composed of $100$% heavy elements and molecules, (ii) a region with decreasing heavy element mass fraction, down to a value of $0.1$, (iii) a layer of uniform composition with the helium mass fraction $Y$ enhanced over the primordial value, (iv) a helium rain region with a gradient in $Y$, (v) an outer convective, adiabatic region with uniform composition in which $Y$ is reduced from the primordial value, and (vi) the very outer layers where cloud condensation of the heavy elements occurs. Models of the distribution of heavy elements as a function of radius are compared with those derived to fit the observations of the Cassini mission, with rough qualitative agreement. The helium mass fraction in Saturn's outer layers is estimated to be around $20$%. Models are found which provide good agreement with Saturn's intrinsic luminosity and radius.

 - **Abstract**
 The outer solar system is theoretically predicted to harbour an undiscovered planet, often referred to as P9. Simulations suggest that its gravitational influence could explain the unusual clustering of minor bodies in the Kuiper Belt. However, no observational evidence for P9 has been found so far, as its predicted orbit lies far beyond Neptune, where it reflects only a faint amount of Sunlight. This work aims to find P9 candidates by taking advantage of two far-infrared all-sky surveys, which are IRAS and AKARI. The epochs of these two surveys were separated by 23 years, which is large enough to detect the ~3'/year orbital motion of P9. We use a dedicated AKARI Far-Infrared point source list for our P9 search - AKARI Monthly Unconfirmed Source List, which includes sources detected repeatedly only in hours timescale, but not after months. We search for objects that moved slowly between IRAS and AKARI detections given in the catalogues. First, we estimated the expected flux and orbital motion of P9 by assuming its mass, distance, and effective temperature to ensure it can be detected by IRAS and AKARI, then applied the positional and flux selection criteria to narrow down the number of sources from the catalogues. Next, we produced all possible candidate pairs whose angular separations were limited between 42' and 69.6', corresponding to the heliocentric distance range of 500 - 700 AU and the mass range of 7 - 17 Earth masses. There are 13 pairs obtained after the selection criteria. After image inspection, we found one good candidate, of which the IRAS source is absent from the same coordinate in the AKARI image after 23 years and vice versa. However, AKARI and IRAS detections are not enough to determine the full orbit of this candidate. This issue leads to the need for follow-up observations, which will determine the Keplerian motion of our candidate.

 - **Abstract**
 We formulate an effective field theory (EFT) of coupled dark energy (DE) and dark matter (DM) interacting through energy and momentum transfers. In the DE sector, we exploit the EFT of vector-tensor theories with the presence of a preferred time direction on the cosmological background. This prescription allows one to accommodate shift-symmetric and non-shift-symmetric scalar-tensor theories by taking a particular weak coupling limit, with and without consistency conditions respectively. We deal with the DM sector as a non-relativistic perfect fluid, which can be described by a system of three scalar fields. By choosing a unitary gauge in which the perturbations in the DE and DM sectors are eaten by the metric, we incorporate the leading-order operators that characterize the energy and momentum transfers besides those present in the conventional EFT of vector-tensor and scalar-tensor theories and the non-relativistic perfect fluid. We express the second-order action of scalar perturbations in real space in terms of time- and scale-dependent dimensionless EFT parameters and derive the linear perturbation equations of motion by taking into account additional matter (baryons, radiation). In the small-scale limit, we obtain conditions for the absence of both ghosts and Laplacian instabilities and discuss how they are affected by the DE-DM interactions. We also compute the effective DM gravitational coupling $G_{\rm eff}$ by using a quasi-static approximation for perturbations deep inside the DE sound horizon and show that the existence of momentum and energy transfers allow a possibility to realize $G_{\rm eff}$ smaller than in the uncoupled case at low redshift.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a unique discovery of three new detected systems showing two different phenomena together. These are 2+2 quadruple stellar systems showing two eclipsing binaries as the inner pairs. And besides that, these systems were also found to exhibit the precession of the inner orbits causing the inclination changes manifesting themselves through the eclipse depth variations. We are not aware of any similar known system on the sky nowadays, hence our discovery is really unique. In particular these systems are: CzeV4315 = HD 228777 (periods 6.7391 d and 0.91932 d, inclination change of pair B of about 1.4deg/yr); ASASSN-V J075203.23-323102.7 = GDS_J0752031-323102 (8.86916 d + 2.6817 d, inclination change of pair B of about 1.03deg/yr, now only ellipsoidal variations); ASASSN-V J105824.33-611347.6 = TIC 465899856 (2.3304 d + 13.0033 d, inclination change of pair B, now undetectable). These systems provide us unique insight into the quadruple-star dynamics, including the orbit-orbit interaction, Kozai-Lidov cycles, and testing the stellar formation theories of these higher order multiples.

 Gaia Data Release 3 (GDR3) contains a wealth of information to advance our knowledge of stellar physics. In these lecture notes we introduce the data products from GDR3 that can be exploited by the stellar physics community. Then we visit different regions of the HR diagram, discuss the open scientific questions, and describe how GDR3 can help advance this particular topic. Specific regions include hot OB and A type stars, FGK main sequence, giants, and variable sources, low mass stars, and ultra-cool dwarfs. Examples of scientific exploitation are also provided. These lecture notes are accompanied by a 3-hour lecture presentation and a 3-hour practical session that are publicly available on the website of the Ecole Evry Schatzman 2023: Stellar physics with Gaia, this https URL, see Lectures and Hands-on Work.

          Formation of the glycine isomer glycolamide (NH$_2$C(O)CH$_2$OH) on the surfaces of interstellar ice grains: Insights from atomistic simulations

 - **Abstract**
 Syn-glycolamide, a glycine isomer, has recently been detected in the G+0.693-0.027 molecular cloud. Investigations on its formation in the interstellar medium could offer insights into synthetic routes leading to glycine in prebiotic environments. Quantum chemical simulations on glycolamide (NH$_2$C(O)CH$_2$OH) formation on interstellar ice mantles, mimicked by a water ice cluster model, are presented. Glycolamide synthesis has been here modeled considering a stepwise process: the coupling between formaldehyde (H$_2$CO) and the radical of formamide (NH$_2$CO$^{\bullet}$) occurs first, forming the glycolamide precursor NH$_2$C(O)CH$_2$O$^{\bullet}$, which is then hydrogenated to give anti-glycolamide. We hypothesize that anti-to-syn interconversion will occur in conjunction with glycolamide desorption from the ice surface. The reaction barrier for NH$_2$C(O)CH$_2$O$^{\bullet}$ formation varies from 9 to 26 kJ mol$^{-1}$, depending on surface binding sites. Kinetic studies indicate that this reaction step is feasible in environments with a $T > 35~\text{K}$, until desorption of the reactants. The hydrogenation step leading to anti-glycolamide presents almost no energy barrier due to the easy H atom diffusion towards the NH$_2$C(O)CH$_2$O$^{\bullet}$ intermediate. However, it competes with the extraction of an H atom from the formyl group of NH$_2$C(O)CH$_2$O$^{\bullet}$, which leads to formyl formamide, NH$_2$C(O)CHO, and H$_2$. Nonetheless, according to our results, anti-glycolamide formation is predicted to be the most favored reactive channel.

          Free Cosmic Density Bispectrum on Small Scales

 - **Abstract**
 We study the asymptotic behaviour of the free, cold-dark matter density fluctuation bispectrum in the limit of small scales. From an initially Gaussian random field, we draw phase-space positions of test particles which then propagate along Zel'dovich trajectories. A suitable expansion of the initial momentum auto-correlations of these particles leads to an asymptotic series whose lower-order power-law exponents we calculate. The dominant contribution has an exponent of $-11/2$. For triangle configurations with zero surface area, this exponent is even enhanced to $-9/2$. These power laws can only be revealed by a non-perturbative calculation with respect to the initial power spectrum. They are valid for a general class of initial power spectra with a cut-off function, required to enforce convergence of its moments. We then confirm our analytic results numerically. Finally, we use this asymptotic behaviour to investigate the shape dependence of the bispectrum in the small-scale limit, and to show how different shapes grow over cosmic time. These confirm the usual model of gravitational collapse within the Zel'dovich picture.

 - **Abstract**
 Black holes, both supermassive and stellar-mass, impact the evolution of their surroundings on a large range of scales. While the role of supermassive black holes is well studied, the effects of stellar-mass black holes on their surroundings, particularly in inducing structures in the interstellar medium (ISM), remain under explored. This study focuses on the black hole X-ray binary GRS 1915+105, renowned for its active jets, and the primary aim is to unveil and characterise the impact of GRS 1915+105 on its environment by identifying structures induced by jet-ISM interaction. Methods: We observed GRS 1915+105 with MeerKAT for a total exposure time of 14~hr, and we obtained the deepest image of GRS 1915+105 to date. Using a previously proposed self-similar model for large-scale jets, we inferred the properties of both the jets and the ISM, providing insights into the jet-ISM interaction site. Our observations revealed a bow shock structure near GRS 1915+105, likely induced by a jet interacting with the ISM and blowing an overpressured cavity in the medium. We constrained the ISM density to 100--160 particles\,cm$^{-3}$ while assuming a temperature range of 10$^4$--10$^6$\,K, which implies a bow shock expansion velocity of $20\,{\rm km\,s}^{-1}<\dot{L} <\,360\,{\rm km\,s}^{-1}$. We estimate that the jet responsible for the formation of the bow shock has an age between 0.09 and 0.22 Myr, and the time-averaged energy rate Conclusions: Our results confirm that in stellar-mass black holes, the energy dissipated through jets can be comparable to the accretion energy, and through the interaction of the jet with the ISM, such energy is transferred back to the environment. This feedback mechanism mirrors the powerful influence of supermassive black holes on their environments, underscoring the significant role a black hole's activity has in shaping its surroundings.

 - **Abstract**
 This study aims to detect and characterize quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) signals in X-ray observations of NGC 4151. We employed the Weighted Wavelet Z-transform (WWZ) and Lomb-Scargle periodogram (LSP) methods for our analysis. QPO signals with frequencies of 5.91 $\times 10^{-4}$ Hz and 5.68 $\times 10^{-4}$ Hz were detected in observations conducted by Chandra (ObsID 7830) in 2007 and XMM-Newton (ObsID 0761670301) in 2015, with confidence levels of 3.7 $\sigma$ and 3.3 $\sigma$, respectively. These signals are the first to be independently observed by two different telescopes over an eight-year period with closely matched frequencies. Most notably, the combined confidence level of the QPO signals from these two independent observations reaches an exceptional 5.2 $\sigma$, which is rare in astrophysical research and significantly strengthens our conviction in the authenticity of these signals. A detailed analysis of the observational data suggests that these QPO signals may be correlated with the properties of the central supermassive black hole. Additionally, spectral analysis of the observational data revealed no significant spectral differences between the QPO and non-QPO segments. These findings provide new insights into the X-ray variability mechanisms of the central black hole in NGC 4151 and offer a novel perspective for black hole mass estimation.

 - **Abstract**
 The nearby (d=3.6 Mpc) starburst galaxy M82 has been studied for several decades by very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) networks such as e-MERLIN and the European VLBI Network (EVN). The numerous supernova remnants (SNRs), HII regions and other exotic transients make it a perfect laboratory for studying stellar evolution and the interstellar medium (ISM). Its proximity provides a linear resolution of 17 pc/arcsec, enabling decadal-time-scale variability and morphology studies of the tens of compact radio sources. In this proceedings, we describe new techniques developed in the last ten years that provide deeper, more robust imaging, enable in-band spectral index mapping, and allow wider fields of view to be imaged to find new radio sources.

 Recent observations have revealed the spectral feature of carbonaceous grains even in a very distant galaxy. We develop a state-of-the-art dust synthesis code by self-consistently solving molecule and dust formation in supernova (SN) ejecta that contain various elements in different layers. With a progenitor mass 25 Msun and explosion energy 10^{52} erg, we run the following four test calculations to investigate the impact of input physics. (i) With molecule formation solved, our SN model produces 8.45x10^{-2} Msun carbonaceous grains. (ii) If all available C and Si were initially depleted into CO and SiO molecules, respectively, the C grain mass could be underestimated by ~40%. In these two models producing 0.07 Msun 56Ni without mixing fallback, a large amount of silicates (0.260 Msun) created in O-rich layers are also ejected and likely to hide the spectral feature of carbonaceous grains. We then consider mixing-fallback that can reproduce the observed elemental abundance ratios of C-normal and C-enhanced extremely metal-poor stars in the Milky Way. (iii) In the former, the mass ratio of carbonaceous to silicate grains is still small (~0.3). However, (iv) in the latter (known as a ``faint SN'), while the C grain mass is unchanged (6.78x10^{-2} Msun), the silicate mass is reduced (9.98x10^{-3} Msun). Therefore, we conclude that faint SNe can be a significant carbonaceous dust factory in the early Universe.

 - **Abstract**
 We present optical, radio, and X-ray observations of EP250108a/SN 2025kg, a broad-line Type Ic supernova (SN Ic-BL) accompanying an Einstein Probe (EP) fast X-ray transient (FXT) at $z=0.176$. EP250108a/SN 2025kg possesses a double-peaked optical light curve and its spectrum transitions from a blue underlying continuum to a typical SN Ic-BL spectrum over time. We fit a radioactive decay model to the second peak of the optical light curve and find SN parameters that are consistent with the SNe Ic-BL population, while its X-ray and radio properties are consistent with those of low-luminosity GRB (LLGRB) 060218/SN 2006aj. We explore three scenarios to understand the system's multi-wavelength emission -- (a) SN ejecta interacting with an extended circumstellar medium (CSM), (b) the shocked cocoon of a collapsar-driven jet choked in its stellar envelope, and (c) the shocked cocoon of a collapsar-driven jet choked in an extended CSM. All three models can explain the optical light curve and are also consistent with the radio and X-ray observations. We favor models (a) and (c) because they self-consistently explain both the X-ray prompt emission and first optical peak, but we do not rule out model (b). From the properties of the first peak in models (a) and (c), we find evidence that EP250108a/SN 2025kg interacts with an extended CSM, and infer an envelope mass $M_{\rm e} \sim 0.1\,\rm M_\odot$ and radius $R_{\rm e} \sim 4 \times 10^{13}$ cm. EP250108a/SN 2025kg's multi-wavelength properties make it a close analog to LLGRB 060218/SN 2006aj, and highlight the power of early follow-up observations in mapping the environments of massive stars prior to core collapse.

 Context. Observations with warm Spitzer and JWST revealed high and variable brightness in the planet 55 Cnc e. Aims. Inventory of the tidal effects on the rotational and orbital evolution of the planet 55 Cnc e enhanced by the nonzero orbital eccentricity. Methods. The creep-tide theory is used in simulations and dynamical analyses that explore the difficult trapping of the planet rotation in a 3:2 spin-orbit resonance and the most probable synchronization of the rotation. Results. The strong tidal dissipation of energy, enhanced by the non-zero orbital eccentricity, may explain the observed brightness anomalies. However, the strong dissipation should also circularize the orbit. The observed non-zero eccentricity, if true, would indicate that an unknown planet in a close orbital resonance with 55 Cnc e perturbing the motion of this planet should exist.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar activity can be observed at different wavelengths in a variety of different activity indicators. We investigated the correlation between coronal and chromospheric emissions by combining X-ray data from stars detected in the eROSITA all-sky surveys (eRASS1 and eRASS:5) with Ca II infrared triplet (IRT) activity indices as published in the third Gaia data release (Gaia DR3). We specifically studied 24 300 and 43 200 stellar sources with reliable Ca II IRT measurement and X-ray detection in eRASS1 and eRASS:5, which is by far the largest stellar sample available so far. The largest detection fraction is obtained for highly active sources and stars of a late spectral type, while F-type and less active stars (as measured in the Ca II IRT) remain mostly undetected in X-rays. Also, the correlation is the strongest for late-type sources, while F-type stars show a rather weak correlation between the X-ray to bolometric flux ratio and the Ca II IRT activity index. The relation between the X-ray and Ca II IRT surface fluxes changes with the fractional X-ray flux without showing two separated branches as described in previous studies. For fast rotators, both activity indicators saturate at a similar Rossby number and the X-ray to bolometric flux ratio decreases faster than the IRT index for slower rotating stars. As a consequence, the ratio between X-ray and IRT fluxes is constant in the saturation regime and decreases for slow rotators.

 - **Abstract**
 Analyses of stellar spectra, stellar populations, and transit light curves rely on grids of synthetic spectra and center-to-limb variations (limb darkening) from model stellar atmospheres. Extensive model grids from PHOENIX, a generalized non-LTE 1D and 3D stellar atmosphere code, have found widespread use in the astronomical community, however current PHOENIX/1D models have been substantially improved over the last decade. To make these improvements available to the community, we have constructed the NewEra LTE model grid consisting of 37438 models with $2300K \leq T_{eff} \leq 12000K$, $0.0\le log{(g)} \le 6.0$ metallicities [M/H] from $-4.0$ to $+0.5$, and for metallicities $-2.0 \le [M/H] \le 0.0$ additional $\alpha$ element variations from $-0.2 \le [\alpha/{\rm Fe}] \le +1.2$ are included. The models use databases of 851 million atomic lines and 834 billion molecular lines and employ the Astrophysical Chemical Equilibrium Solver for the equation of state. All models in the NewEra grid have been calculated in spherical symmetry because center-to-limb variation differences from plane-parallel models are quite large for giants and not insignificant for dwarfs. All model data are provided in the Hierarchical Data Format 5 (HDF5) format, including low and high sampling rate spectra. These files also include a variety of details about the models, such as the exact abundances and isotopic patterns used and results of the atomic and molecular line selection. Although the model structures have small differences with the previous grid generation, the spectra show significant differences, mostly due to the updates of the molecular line lists.

 - **Abstract**
 Galactic archaeology relies on accurate stellar parameters to reconstruct the galaxy's history, including information on stellar ages. While the precision of data has improved significantly in recent years, stellar models used for age inference have not improved at a similar rate. In fact, different models yield notably different age predictions for the same observational data. In this paper, we assess the difference in age predictions of various widely used model grids for stars along the red giant branch. Using open source software, we conduct a comparison of four different evolution grids and we find that age estimations become less reliable if stellar mass is not known, with differences occasionally exceeding $80\%$. Additionally, we note significant disagreements in the models' age estimations at non-solar metallicity. Finally, we present a method for including theoretical uncertainties from stellar evolutionary tracks in age inferences of red giants, aimed at improving the accuracy of age estimation techniques used in the galactic archaeology community.

 - **Abstract**
 After the inflationary phase, the universe enters the preheating phase, during which the inflaton field rolls down its potential and oscillates. When the potential significantly deviates from a parabolic shape at its minimum, these oscillations trigger an instability in the scalar perturbations, leading to their amplification. This phenomenon, known as self-resonance, has important implications in cosmology. Notably, since scalar perturbations couple to tensor perturbations at second order in the equations of motion, this amplification results in the production of Gravitational Waves (GWs), referred to as Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves (SIGWs). In this study, we investigate the production of SIGWs during the preheating phase for a class of inflationary models known as $\alpha$-attractors, characterized by a single parameter $\alpha$. We focus on small values of this parameter, specifically $\alpha \sim O(10^{-1} - 10^{-4})$, where the self-resonance effect is particularly pronounced. We obtain lower bounds on this parameter, $\log_{10}(\alpha)>-3.54$ for the T-model and $\log_{10}(\alpha)>-3.17$ for the E-model, based on the energy density of SIGWs constrained by Big Bang nucleosynthesis, which ultimately translates into lower bounds on the tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r>9.61\times10^{-7}$ for the T-model and $r>2.25\times10^{-6}$ for the E-model.

 - **Abstract**
 Accretion and outflows are astrophysical phenomena observed across a wide range of objects, from white dwarfs to supermassive black holes. Developing a complete picture of these processes requires complementary studies across this full spectrum of jet-launching sources. Jet-interstellar medium (ISM) interaction sites near black hole X-ray binaries provide unique laboratories to study jet energetics. This work aims to detect and characterise the bow shock near one black hole X-ray binary, Cyg X-1, and then use this bow shock structure to parametrise the properties of the jet launched by Cyg X-1 over its lifetime. We used the MeerKAT radio telescope to investigate the bow shock structure formed by the interaction between the jets of Cyg X-1 and the ISM. We successfully detect the bow shock north of Cyg X-1 in the L and S bands and report its size and brightness. We present the spectral index distribution across the bow shock, which is in the range -0.9 to 0.4, with an error distribution (0.6 to 1.5) that peaks at unity. We determine that the unshocked ISM density is 6-7 cm^-3 for a temperature range of 10^4 to 3*10^6 K. This temperature range suggests that the velocity of the bow shock is 21 km/s to 364 km/s. The age of the Cyg X-1 jet responsible for the bow shock is 0.04 to 0.3 Myr, and the power of the jet is constrained to 2*10^31 ergs/s to 10^35 ergs/s. We also detect new morphological features of the bow shock in the S-band image. The comparison of archival H_alpha maps with the new radio observations hints at different regions of emission, different temperature ranges, and different ISM densities. The spectral index suggests a consistent emission origin across the structure. The ISM density around Cyg X-1 is on the higher end for Galactic environments, and our results indicate a lower jet energy transport rate than prior estimates.

          Insights from Analytical Theory of Eccentric Circumbinary Disks

 - **Abstract**
 Eccentric cavities in circumbinary disks precess on timescales much longer than the binary orbital period. These long-lived steady states can be understood as trapped modes in an effective potential primarily determined by the binary quadrupole and the inner-disk pressure support, with associated frequencies $\omega_Q$ and $\omega_P$. Within this framework, we show that the ratio $\omega_P/\omega_Q$ is the main parameter determining the mode spectrum, and obtain a thorough understanding of it by systematically solving this problem with various degrees of sophistication. We first find analytical solutions for truncated power-law disks and use this insight in disks with smooth central cavities. Our main findings are: (i) The number of modes increases for thinner disks and more-equal-mass binaries. (ii) For 2D disks, the normalized ground-mode frequency, $\omega_0/(\omega_Q+\omega_P)$, decreases monotonically with the ratio $\omega_P/\omega_Q$. (iii) For thin disks, $\omega_P\ll\omega_Q$, the ground-mode frequency coincides with the maximum of the effective potential, which tracks the gravitational quadrupole frequency inside the inner-disk cavity, and is thus rather sensitive to the density profile of the cavity, where these modes are localized. (iv) For thick disks, $\omega_P\gg\omega_Q$, increasing pressure support anchors the peak of the effective potential at the inner cavity radius as the ground-mode extends farther out and its frequency decreases. (v) In agreement with numerical simulations, with $\omega_P/\omega_Q \simeq 0.1$, we find that disk precession is rather insensitive to the density profile and ground-mode frequencies for 3D disks are about half the value for 2D disks.

 - **Abstract**
 The Lyman-alpha (Ly{\alpha};1216 Å) line is the brightest emission line in the quiescent solar spectrum and radiates a significant fraction of the available nonthermal energy during flares. Despite its importance, there is a lack of detailed studies of Ly{\alpha} spectral variability during flares. Recently, spectrally resolved Ly{\alpha} flare observations from the SORCE/SOLSTICE instrument have become available. This study examines Ly{\alpha} spectral variability and its relationship with HXR emission from nonthermal electrons, using observations of two M-class flares from SORCE/SOLSTICE and RHESSI. Imaging observations from STEREO/SECCHI EUVI and SDO/AIA provide further context. Enhancements across the Ly{\alpha} line profile were found to closely correlate with bursts of HXR emission, suggesting a primarily nonthermal origin. Red enhancement asymmetries at the peak of each flare were attributed to chromospheric evaporation, while blue wing enhancement and blue asymmetry were linked to a bright filament-eruption seen in SDO/AIA 1600 Å images. These findings contribute to the understanding of spectral Ly{\alpha} variability during flares and highlight the need for future studies using a higher quality and quantity of spectral Ly{\alpha} flare observations. Such studies will further characterise the physical mechanisms driving Ly{\alpha} flare variability.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic inflation may exhibit stochastic periods during which quantum fluctuations dominate over the semi-classical evolution. Extracting observables in these regimes is a notoriously difficult program as quantum randomness makes them fully probabilistic. However, among all the possible quantum histories, the ones which are relevant for Cosmology are conditioned by the requirement that stochastic inflation ended. From an observational point of view, it would be more convenient to model stochastic periods as starting from the time at which they ended and evolving backwards in times. We present a time-reversed approach to stochastic inflation, based on a reverse Fokker-Planck equation, which allows us to derive non-perturbatively the probability distribution of the field values at a given time before the end of the quantum regime. As a motivated example, we solve the flat semi-infinite potential and derive a new and exact formula for the probability distribution of the quantum-generated curvature fluctuations. It is normalisable while exhibiting tails slowly decaying as a Levy distribution. Our reverse-time stochastic formalism could be applied to any inflationary potentials and quantum diffusion eras, including the ones that can lead to the formation of primordial black holes.

 We present the first extensive seismic modelling of SX Phe stars in the stellar system $\omega$ Cen. First, using the new values of reddening $E(B-V)$ and distance modulus $(m-M)_V$, and bolometric corrections from Kurucz model atmospheres, we determine the effective temperatures and luminosities of all SX Phe variables in $\omega$ Cen with available $(B-V)$ colours. Next, we carefully select SX Phe stars that have a frequency ratio strongly suggesting excitation of two radial modes, and, in addition, their preliminary pulsational models have the values of $(T_{\rm eff},~ L)$ consistent with observational determinations. For five double-mode radial pulsators, we perform an extensive seismic modeling using the Bayesian analysis based on Monte Carlo simulations. We study the effect of opacity tables and helium abundance. With the OPAL data and $Y=0.30$, we obtained masses in the range (1.0,~1.2) M$_{\odot}$, metallicity $Z\in(0.0007,~0.0029)$ and the age of about (1.9,~3.8) Gyr. The OP and OPLIB seismic models have always higher metallicites, sometimes outside the allowed range for $\omega$ Cen. In the case of three stars, we find seismic models within the observed range of $(T_{\rm eff},~L)$ with all three opacity tables. In the case of two stars, with the highest metallicity, seismic models computed with the OP and OPLIB tables are located far outside the observed error box. The OPAL seismic models follow the age$-$metallicity relation known for $\omega$ Cen from the literature.

 - **Abstract**
 Open clusters offer unique opportunities to study stellar dynamics and evolution under the influence of their internal gravity, the Milky Way's gravitational field, and the interactions with encounters. Using the Gaia DR3 data for a catalog of open clusters within 500 parsecs that exhibit tidal features reported by the literature, we apply a novel method based on 3D principal component analysis to select a ``golden sample'' of nearby open clusters with minimal line-of-sight distortions. This approach ensures a systematic comparison of 3D and 2D structural parameters for tidally perturbed clusters. The selected golden sample includes Blanco 1, Melotte 20, Melotte 22, NGC 2632, NGC 7092, NGC 1662, Roslund 6 and Melotte 111. We analyze these clusters by fitting both 2D and 3D King Profiles to their stellar density distributions. Our results reveal systematic discrepancies: most of the golden sample clusters exhibit larger 3D tidal radii compared to their 2D counterparts, demonstrating that the 2D projection effects bias the measured cluster size. Furthermore, the 3D density profiles show stronger deviations from King profiles at the tidal radii ($\Delta \rho_{\rm 3D} > \Delta \rho_{\rm 2D}$), highlighting enhanced sensitivity to tidal disturbances. Additionally, we investigate the spatial distribution of cluster members relative to their bulk motion in the Galactic plane. We find that some clusters exhibit tidal features oriented perpendicular to their direction of motion, which can be attributed to the fact that the current surveys only detect the curved inner regions of the tidal features. In conclusion, this work offers a golden sample of nearby open clusters that are most reliable for 3D structure analysis and underscores the necessity of 3D analysis in characterizing OC morphological asymmetries, determining cluster size, and identifying tidal features.

 - **Abstract**
 We consider, in the context of axion-inflation, the \textit{Pure Natural Inflation} (PNI) model coupled with an SU(2) gauge sector via a Chern-Simons term. As the axion rolls down its potential, it dissipates energy in the gauge sector thus sourcing fluctuations of scalar and tensor degrees of freedom therein. Gauge field fluctuations will, in turn, feed primordial gravitational waves as well as curvature perturbations. Remarkably, we can use upcoming cosmological probes to test this mechanism across a vast range of scales, from the CMB to laser interferometers. Due to their flat plateau at large field values, we find that PNI potentials fare better vis-á-vis CMB observations than the conventional sinusoidal potential of chromo-natural inflation (CNI). We show that, even when the dynamics begin in the weak backreaction regime, the rolling of the axion leads to a build-up of the gauge-quanta production, invariably triggering the strong backreaction of the gauge sector tensors on the background dynamics. This transition results in the copious production of both scalar and tensor perturbations, which we study in detail. The gravitational wave signatures include a rich peak structure with a characteristic scale-dependent chirality, a compelling target for future gravitational wave detectors. Additionally, the peak in scalar perturbations may lead to the formation of primordial black holes, potentially accounting for a significant fraction of the observed dark matter abundance.

 - **Abstract**
 We present WI2easy, a Mathematica package for high-precision analysis of warm inflation (WI) dynamics, enabling efficient computation of both background evolution and curvature perturbations. Designed with a user-friendly interface, the tool supports a broad spectrum of inflaton potentials--including large-field, small-field, and hybrid models--and accommodates arbitrary dissipation coefficients dependent on temperature, field amplitude, or both, encompassing canonical forms prevalent in WI studies. Users can define custom models through intuitive commands, generating full dynamical trajectories and perturbation spectra in a streamlined workflow. This facilitates rapid confrontation of theoretical predictions with observational constraints, empowering systematic exploration of WI parameter spaces. WI2easy bridges the gap between theoretical models and observational cosmology, offering a robust, adaptable framework for next-generation inflationary analyses.

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce a new 1D stellar spectral synthesis Python code called \stardis. \stardis\ is a modular, open-source radiative transfer code that is capable of spectral synthesis from near-UV to IR for FGK stars. We describe the structure, inputs, features, underlying physics, and assumptions of \stardis\ as well as the radiative transfer scheme implemented. To validate our code, we show spectral comparisons between \stardis\ and \textsc{korg} with the same input atmospheric structure models, and also compare qualitatively to \textsc{phoenix} for solar models. We find that \stardis\ generally agrees well with \textsc{korg} for solar models on the few percent level or better, that the codes can diverge in the ultraviolet, with more extreme differences in cooler stars. \stardis\ can be found at \href{this https URL}{this https URL}, and documentation can be found at \href{this https URL}{this https URL}.

 - **Abstract**
 Mass loss through stellar winds governs the evolution of stars on the asymptotic giant branch (AGB). In the case of carbon-rich AGB stars, the wind is believed to be driven by radiation pressure on amorphous carbon (amC) dust forming in the atmosphere. The choice of dust optical data will have a significant impact on atmosphere and wind models of AGB stars. We compare two commonly used optical data sets of amC and investigate how the wind characteristics and photometric properties resulting from dynamical models of carbon-rich AGB stars are influenced by the micro-physical properties of dust grains. We computed two extensive grids of carbon star atmosphere and wind models with the DARWIN 1D radiation-hydrodynamical code. Each of the two grids uses a different amC optical data set. The stellar parameters of the models were varied to cover a wide range of possible combinations. A posteriori radiative transfer calculations were performed for a sub-set of the models, resulting in photometric fluxes and colours. We find small, but systematic differences in the predicted mass-loss rates for the two grids. The grain sizes and photometric properties are affected by the different dust optical data sets. Higher absorption efficiency leads to the formation of a greater number of grains, which are smaller. Models that are obscured by dust exhibit differences in terms of the covered colour range compared to observations, depending on the dust optical data used. An important motivation for this study was to investigate how strongly the predicted mass-loss rates depend on the choice of dust optical data, as these mass-loss values are more frequently used in stellar evolution models. Based on the current results, we conclude that mass-loss rates may typically differ by about a factor of two for DARWIN models of C-type AGB stars for commonly used dust optical data sets.

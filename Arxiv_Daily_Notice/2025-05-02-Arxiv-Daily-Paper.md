 - **Abstract**
 Small satellite technologies have enhanced the potential and feasibility of geodesic missions, through simplification of design and decreased costs allowing for more frequent launches. On-satellite data acquisition systems can benefit from the implementation of machine learning (ML), for better performance and greater efficiency on tasks such as image processing or feature extraction. This work presents convolutional autoencoders for implementation on the payload of small satellites, designed to achieve dual functionality of data compression for more efficient off-satellite transmission, and at-source anomaly detection to inform satellite data-taking. This capability is demonstrated for a use case of disaster monitoring using aerial image datasets of the African continent, offering avenues for both novel ML-based approaches in small satellite applications along with the expansion of space technology and artificial intelligence in Africa.

 - **Abstract**
 Ideal spatial demultiplexing (SPADE) is proven to be a quantum-optimal tool for exoplanet detection, i.e., asymmetric source discrimination. However, recent investigations into the related problems of separation estimation and symmetric source discrimination showed its efficiency to be limited in the presence of noise. In this work, we use analytical tools to scrutinize the practical applicability of SPADE and derive the associated optimal decision strategy for exoplanet detection in the presence of experimental imperfections. On the one hand, we find that the probability of detection of noisy SPADE has the same scaling with planet-star separation and relative brightness as conventional techniques, such as direct imaging and coronagraphs. On the other hand, we prove that, due to a superior scaling coefficient under realistic noise conditions, SPADE remains the most efficient method for practical exoplanet detection in the sub-Rayleigh regime.

 - **Abstract**
 The existence of billion-solar-mass black holes hosted in luminous quasars within the first gigayear of cosmic history poses a challenge to our understanding of supermassive black hole (SMBH) growth. The problem is further exacerbated by the very short quasar lifetimes of $t_{\rm Q}\lesssim 10^6$ years, as derived from the extent of their proximity zone (PZ) sizes observed in the quasars' rest-UV spectra. However, the quasar lifetime estimates based on the extents of the proximity zones may be underestimated, as time-variable obscuration effects might have limited the quasars' emission along our sightline in the past. In this work, we present independent quasar lifetime measurements for six quasars at $z \sim 6$ leveraging the extended nebular emission perpendicular to our line-of-sight. We use observations from the Very Large Telescope/Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) to search for extended Ly$\alpha$ emission in the circumgalactic medium around quasars with small proximity zones and estimate their lifetimes as the light travel time between the SMBH and the outer edge of the nebula. We find agreement between the independent lifetime estimates. For one object we find a proximate absorption system prematurely truncating the extent of the quasar's proximity zone, which thus results in an expected discrepancy between the lifetime estimates. Our results provide further evidence that the quasars' current accretion episode has only recently begun, challenging our models of SMBH growth.

          Can Close-In Exoplanets form by Pebble Accretion?

 - **Abstract**
 Pebble accretion is the leading theory for the formation of exoplanets more massive than the Earth. Many parameters influence planet growth in the pebble accretion models. In this paper, we study the influence of pebble fragmentation velocity, turbulence strength, stellar metallicity, stellar mass, and planet location on the growth of planets located within 1 au from their parent stars. Analysing the close-in planets from NASA's Exoplanet Archive, we find that the turbulence strength influences planet growth more than the pebble fragmentation velocity does. Planets orbiting stars with higher metallicity have an overall higher probability of reaching their pebble isolation mass than those orbiting lower metallicity stars, but the impact of metallicity is not as high as that of stellar mass, orbital separation, and most importantly disc turbulence.

 - **Abstract**
 We performed astrophysics model calculations with updated nuclear data to identify a possible bypass of the $^{64}{\rm Ge}$ waiting-point, a defining feature of the rapid-proton capture (rp-) process that powers type-I x-ray bursts on accreting neutron stars. We find that the rp-process flow through the $^{64}{\rm Ge}$ bypass could be up to 36\% for astrophysically relevant conditions. Our results call for new studies of $^{65}{\rm Se}$, including the nuclear mass, $\beta$-delayed proton emission branching, and nuclear structure as it pertains to the $^{64}{\rm As}(p,\gamma)$ reaction rate at x-ray burst temperatures.

          Variable Polarization of WR~31a: Binary Companion or Co-Rotating Interaction Region?

 - **Abstract**
 WR 31a (Hen 3-519) is likely a post-luminous blue variable (LBV) star that is evolving to become a classical Wolf-Rayet star. Multicolor (UBVR) photopolarimetric observations of WR 31a were obtained over nine nights in early 2007. The linear polarization data of WR 31a trace a "loop" structure in a Stokes Q-U diagram, which is similar in all four passbands. After mean subtraction, the four loops align to form a single overall pattern. Such loops can be expected to arise from binary systems. We test the binary hypothesis with two models. The data are fit for a strictly circular orbit to derive an orbital period of 16.7 d, requiring a high inclination perspective of $i\sim 80^\circ$. We also consider an elliptical orbit under simplifying assumptions, yielding a match for $i\sim 75^\circ$ with eccentricity $e\sim 0.5$ and a longer orbital period of about 70 d. The prevalence of binarity among massive stars is well-known; the prospect of detecting a binary companion during the post-LBV stage of WR 31a would add to an emerging narrative of diverse interactions between massive multiple components as a function of evolutionary stage. However, if the loop originates because of a co-rotating interaction region (CIR), then the rotation period could be 8.5 d or 17 d. This would give an estimated equatorial rotation speed of 95 or 190 km/s. Either of these is a significant fraction of the estimated critical speed of rotational break-up at 320 km/s (for an Eddington factor of $\Gamma=0$).

 - **Abstract**
 TeV halos are extended very-high-energy (VHE; 0.1-100 TeV) gamma-ray emission around middle-aged pulsars. So far they have only been found around isolated pulsars, but it has been suggested that they may also be powered by millisecond pulsars (MSPs). We searched for VHE gamma-ray emission from MSPs reported by radio and GeV gamma-ray observatories in 2565 days of data from the High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) Observatory. We found no significant emission from individual pulsars. By combining the likelihood profiles of all MSPs accessible to HAWC, our analysis suggests that the excess emission around the MSP population is consistent with a background. Our result suggests that MSPs are not as efficient as isolated pulsars in producing TeV halos. This finding has strong implications on the physics interpretation of the Galactic Center GeV excess and high-latitude Galactic diffuse emission.

          Reduced solar quadrupole moment compensates for lack of asteroids in long-term solar system integrations

 - **Abstract**
 State-of-the-art long-term solar system integrations include several second order effects such as the Sun's quadrupole moment J2 and a contribution from asteroids (plus the Moon and general relativity). We recently showed that including 10 asteroids and a reduced J2 in our astronomical solutions provides the best match with geologic data to -58 Myr. However, the rationale for the reduced J2 remained ambiguous and may suggest that parameters for long-term integrations compatible with geologic observations are not fully compatible with our knowledge of the current solar system (specifically J2). Here we show that a reduced J2 compensates for a diminished asteroid population in long-term solar system integrations, which may appear surprising. We present an analysis and offer a mechanism for the long-term compensating effects of J2 and asteroid mass in the solar system (not planetary systems in general). Our analysis suggests that "differential effects" on specific secular frequencies involved in resonant terms (i.e., (g4-g3) and (s4-s3)), are critical in the long term, rather than short-term effects on the orbital elements of individual planetary orbits across the board. Also, our results indicate that if long-term intergrations including the full asteroid population were computationally feasible, a J2 value (within errors) compatible with our current knowledge of the solar system could be used. Attempts to improve the long-term accuracy of astronomical solutions by, e.g., tinkering with initial conditions using current/future astronomical observations are futile unless asteroid deficiencies in the solar system model are addressed.

 - **Abstract**
 Future high-precision X-ray and gravitational wave observations of neutron stars (NSs) are expected to measure NS radii to better than $\sigma=0.1$ km accuracy, providing unprecedented opportunities to extract novel information about the nature and equation of state (EOS) of supradense matter in NS cores. Within a Bayesian framework using a meta-model for NS EOS encapsulating a first-order hadron-quark phase transition and satisfying all known constraints from both nuclear physics and astrophysics, we investigate how NS radius data with higher precision may better inform us about (1) the NS crust-core transition density $\rho_{cc}$, (2) the hadron-quark transition density $\rho_t$, quark matter fraction $F_{\rm{QM}}$ and its radius $R_{\rm{QM}}$, and (3) high-density NS EOS parameters. Using fiducial NS radius data with mocked precisions varying from $\sigma=1.0$ km to 0.1 km, we found (a) the most probable crust-core transition density $\rho_{cc}$ and its 68\% confidence boundaries are essentially unaffected by $\sigma$ especially for massive NSs; (b) our answers to the questions (2) and (3) listed above depend sensitively on the prior range of hadron-quark transition density $\rho_t$ assumed. Using its fiducial range of $(1.0-6.0)\rho_0$, the posterior PDF($\rho_t$) has a major peak around $(1.7-2.0)\rho_0$ that is sufficient but unnecessary in describing all existing NS radius data, and a minor peak around $(3.0-5.0)\rho_0$ consistent with the indication about $\rho_t$ of recent Beam Energy Scan Experiments at RHIC. Narrowing down the prior range of $\rho_t$ to $(3.0-6.0)\rho_0$, NS radius data with smaller $\sigma$ can constrain more stringently the posterior PDF($\rho_t$), $F_{\rm{QM}}$, $R_{\rm{QM}}$ and several high-density hadronic EOS parameters.

 - **Abstract**
 The first simultaneous observations of the Fe XVIII 974.86 Å and Fe XX 721.56 Å forbidden lines from the Spectral Imaging of the Coronal Environment (SPICE) spectrograph on Solar Orbiter are presented. The lines were observed from the post-flare loops of an M2.5 class solar flare that peaked at 23:49 UT on 2024 March 23. The Fe XX/Fe XVIII ratio is used to derive a temperature space-time map for the flaring period, with values ranging from 8 to 20 MK. The map reveals repeated episodes of heating at the SPICE slit location over a 30 min period. For one location with the brightest emission, the plasma cooled from 10 MK to 8 MK in 5 min which is longer than the expected conductive cooling time of 170 s, suggesting continued background heating during the cooling period. Doppler shifts of between 0 and +10 km/s were obtained with precisions of 1-4 km/s, but the accuracies are lower due to uncertainties over the absolute wavelength calibration hence we can not conclude there are plasma flows in the flare loops. The widths of the two lines were found to be close to the instrumental widths with no evidence of non-thermal broadening, although this result is limited by the instrument resolution. The Fe XVIII and Fe XX lines have high signal-to-noise with only a 5 s exposure time, demonstrating that the lines will be valuable for high-cadence flare studies with SPICE.

          On the secular evolution of the semi-major axis in canonical formalism

 - **Abstract**
 There are several astrophysical configurations where one is interested only in the long-term dynamical evolution. Although the first-order version of this approximation is usually sufficient in applications, second-order corrections may be relevant, too. Here we use the Hamiltonian formalism to show how such higher-order terms lead to the long-term evolution of the semi-major axis.

 - **Abstract**
 In this letter, we investigate cosmology within the framework of modified $f(Q, L_m)$ gravity using the non-linear model $f(Q, L_m) = -Q + \alpha L_m^n + \beta$, where $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $n$ are free parameters. The modified Friedmann equations are derived for a matter-dominated universe, and an analytical solution is obtained. Using Hubble, Pantheon+, and joint datasets, we constrain the model parameters and examine their implications. The results indicate that the model accommodates varying $H_0$ values, contributing to the Hubble tension, while $n \neq 1$ suggests deviations from general relativity (GR). The deceleration parameter confirms a transition to acceleration at $z_t \approx 0.6 - 0.8$, with present values supporting cosmic acceleration. This model offers a viable alternative to GR-based cosmology.

 - **Abstract**
 The prestellar core Barnard 68 (B68) is a prototypical source to study the initial conditions and chemical processes of star formation. A previous numerical simulation suggested the southeastern bullet is impacting on the main body of B68. In order to obtain more observational evidence, mapping observations of the ground state SO ($1_0-0_1$) emission line at 30 GHz were made with the Effelsberg 100 m telescope. Based on the velocity field and channel maps derived from SO, three velocity components were clearly detected. The velocity field of the main body indicates rotation and is well fitted by a solid-body rotation model. The measured radial velocity difference between the bullet and the main core is about 0.4 km s$^{-1}$, which is almost equal to the velocity obtained by the previous numerical simulation. Therefore, the bullet is most likely impacting onto the rotating main body of B68. A 1D spherical non-LTE Monte-Carlo radiation transfer RATRAN code is performed to derive the radial abundance profile of SO by analyzing the observed velocity-integrated intensity. SO is depleted inside a 60$^{\prime\prime}$ (0.02 pc) radius from the core. The abundance stays constant at 2.0$\times$10$^{-9}$ for radii larger than 60$^{\prime\prime}$ from the center of the main core. The abundance is enhanced at the interface of the bullet and the main core indicating that shock waves were produced by the collision between the bullet and the main core. In conclusion, based on the kinematical and chemical analysis, our observational results support the previously proposed core-core collision scenario in B68.

 - **Abstract**
 In $f(R)$ gravity, the scalaron$\unicode{x2014}$a scalar degree of freedom arising from modification of General Relativity$\unicode{x2014}$could account for all dark matter if its mass lies in the meV$\unicode{x2013}$MeV range. In this work, we revisit the scalaron's interactions with Standard Model particles, assuming their minimal coupling to gravity. In particular, we refine the scalaron decay rate into photons. Assuming the scalaron constitutes all of dark matter, we calculate the average cosmological background radiation produced by these decays. We also estimate the contribution of primordial thermal scalarons to the present dark matter density and find it to be negligible. This supports the original scenario in which the scalaron dark matter behaves as a coherently oscillating field.

 - **Abstract**
 (abridged) Weak gravitational lensing (WL) is the unique and powerful probe into the large-scale structures of the Universe. Removing the shape noise from the observed WL field, i.e., denoising, enhances the potential of WL by accessing information at small scales where the shape noise dominates without denoising. We utilise two machine learning (ML) models for denosing: generative adversarial network (GAN) and diffusion model (DM). We evaluate the performance of denosing with GAN and DM utilising the large suite of mock WL observations, which serve as the training and test data sets. We apply denoising to 1,000 maps with GAN and DM models trained with 39,000 mock observations. Both models can fairly well reproduce the true convergence map on large scales. Then, we measure cosmological statistics: power spectrum, bispectrum, one-point probability distribution function, peak and minima counts, and scattering transform coefficients. We find that DM outperforms GAN in almost all statistics and recovers the correct statistics down to small scales within roughly $0.3 \sigma$ level at the scales accessible from current and future WL surveys. We also conduct the stress tests on the trained model; denoising the maps with different characteristics, e.g., different source redshifts, from the data used in training. The performance degrades at small scales, but the statistics can still be recovered at large scales. Though the training of DM is more computationally demanding compared with GAN, there are several advantages: numerically stable training, higher performance in the reconstruction of cosmological statistics, and sampling multiple realisations once the model is trained. It has been known that DM can generate higher-quality images in real-world problems than GAN, the superiority has been confirmed as well in the WL denoising problem.

          Attitude Control of Spacecraft for Autonomous Attenuation of Unknown Periodic Disturbance Torque

 - **Abstract**
 Recently, deep space exploration, especially focusing on halo orbits, the periodic orbits of the Moon, has been widely studied. The spacecraft in halo orbits performs periodic orbital motion, which affects the attitude motion by periodic disturbances. The conventional attitude control method, PD control, is widely used, but its application to periodic disturbance attenuation is inefficient. To address these challenges, this study proposes a predictive Repetitive Control (RC) approach that addresses periodic disturbances, particularly GG torque, by exploiting the periodic nature of the system dynamics. The proposed method is also applied to the case of using a Reaction Wheel (RW) as an attitude control actuator. Despite the inherent challenges posed by RW limitations, including saturation torque and transmission delay, our predictive RC approach effectively mitigates these effects. Numerical simulations demonstrate the robust performance of the proposed method in maintaining attitude control for spacecraft traversing halo orbits near the Earth-Moon $L_2$ point, validating its potential for future deep space exploration missions.

          Constraints on the state of the IGM at $z\sim 8-10$ using redshifted 21-cm observations with LOFAR

 - **Abstract**
 The power spectra of the redshifted 21-cm signal from the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) contain information about the ionization and thermal states of the intergalactic medium (IGM), and depend on the properties of the EoR sources. Recently, Mertens et al 2025 has analysed 10 nights of LOFAR high-band data and estimated upper limits on the 21-cm power spectrum at redshifts 8.3, 9.1 and 10.1. Here we use these upper limit results to constrain the properties of the IGM at those redshifts. We focus on the properties of the ionized and heated regions where the temperature is larger than that of the CMB. We model the 21-cm power spectrum with the code GRIZZLY, and use a Bayesian inference framework to explore the source parameters for uniform priors on their ranges. The framework also provides information about the IGM properties in the form of derived parameters. In a model which includes a radio background in excess of the CMB, the 95 (68) per cent credible intervals of disfavoured models at redshift 9.1 for the chosen priors correspond to IGM states with averaged ionization and heated fraction below 0.46 ($\lesssim 0.05$), an average gas temperature below 44 K (4 K), and a characteristic size of the heated region $\lesssim 14 ~h^{-1} ~\mathrm{Mpc}$ ($\lesssim 3 ~h^{-1} ~\mathrm{Mpc}$). The 68 per cent credible interval suggests an excess radio background which is more than 100 per cent of the CMB at 1.42 GHz, while the 95 per cent credible interval of the radio background efficiency parameter spans the entire prior range. The behaviour of the credible intervals is similar at all redshifts. The models disfavoured by the LOFAR upper limits are extreme ones, as they are mainly driven by rare and large ionized or heated regions.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an analysis of the young stellar moving group ASCC 127 using Gaia DR3 data, significantly expanding its membership to 3,971 stars -- double the number identified in previous studies. Using kinematic and distance criteria, ASCC 127 is divided into five subgroups (Groups 1-5) with ages spanning from 15 to 32 Myr. Groups 1-5 are spatially linked to the Cepheus Flare star-forming region, revealing potential evidence of four sequential star formation episodes at approximately 32 Myr, 20 Myr, 15 Myr, and 7 Myr. Through dust and gas mapping, we identify a spatial cavity extending several tens of parsecs, which may have resulted from feedback processes such as supernovae associated with earlier generations of stars in the region. This structure, along with the larger Loop III feature, indicates that feedback from massive stars likely influenced the interstellar medium (ISM). By integrating young stellar populations with ISM studies, we provide a detailed picture of the feedback-driven star formation history in the Cepheus Flare region.

          Thermal evolution model from cometary nuclei to asteroids considering contraction associated with ice sublimation

 - **Abstract**
 Comet--asteroid transition (CAT) objects are small solar system bodies in the process of evolving from cometary nuclei into asteroids, as they gradually lose volatile substances due to solar heating. The volatile material is mainly water ice, and the time required for its complete depletion is called the desiccation time. Estimating the desiccation time is important for examining the formation and evolution of small solar system bodies. Here, we propose a new theoretical model for evaluating the desiccation time as a function of orbital elements, considering the contraction of the entire cometary nucleus due to ice sublimation. First, we performed numerical calculations of the thermal evolution of a cometary nucleus in an eccentric orbit, considering the seasonal variation in the solar heating rate. Next, we derived the desiccation time analytically as a function of orbital elements based on a steady-state model considering the solar heating rate averaged over the seasons. We compared the numerical solutions for the desiccation time with the analytical solutions and clarified the conditions under which the analytical model can be applied. Additionally, based on the analytical model, we derived formulae for estimating the emission rates of water vapor and dust on the surface of the cometary nucleus, the maximum size of the emitted dust, and the dust emission velocity, by assuming the amount of ice remaining inside the nucleus. Using these analytical solutions, we considered the internal structure and evolution process of typical CAT objects. Our analytical model was generally consistent with that of the results of earlier observations of these objects. Our model provides a theoretical guideline for discussing the evolution of cometary nuclei and the possibility of retaining internal ice in asteroids.

 Pairwise velocities of the large-scale structure encode valuable information about the growth of structure. They can be observed indirectly through redshift-space distortions and the kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect. Whether it is Gaussian or non-Gaussian, pairwise velocity has a broad distribution, but the cosmologically useful information lies primarily in the mean - the streaming velocities; the dispersion around the mean is often treated as a nuisance and marginalized over. This conventional approach reduces the constraining power of our observations. Here, we show that this does not have to be the case, provided the physics behind the dispersion is understood. We demonstrate that by splitting the halo/galaxy samples according to their density environments and measuring the streaming velocities separately, the total signal-to-noise is several times greater than in conventional global measurements of the pairwise velocity distribution (PVD). This improvement arises because the global PVD is a composite of a series of near-Gaussian distributions with different means and dispersions, each determined by its local density environment. Around underdense and overdense regions, the mean streaming velocities are positive and negative, respectively. By splitting the data, we avoid cancellation between these opposing velocities, effectively turning what would be considered dispersion in the global PVD into a signal. Our findings indicate substantial potential for improving the analysis of PVD observations using the kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect and redshift-space distortions.

 - **Abstract**
 Simulation-based inference provides a powerful framework for extracting rich information from nonlinear scales in current and upcoming cosmological surveys, and ensuring its robustness requires stringent validation of forward models. In this work, we recast forward model validation as an out-of-distribution (OoD) detection problem within the framework of machine learning (ML)-based simulation-based inference (SBI). We employ probability density as the metric for OoD detection, and compare various density estimation techniques, demonstrating that field-level probability density estimation via continuous time flow models (CTFM) significantly outperforms feature-level approaches that combine scattering transform (ST) or convolutional neural networks (CNN) with normalizing flows (NFs), as well as NF-based field-level estimators, as quantified by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Our analysis shows that CTFM not only excels in detecting OoD samples but also provides a robust metric for model selection. Additionally, we verified CTFM maintains consistent efficacy across different cosmologies while mitigating the inductive biases inherent in NF architectures. Although our proof-of-concept study employs simplified forward modeling and noise settings, our framework establishes a promising pathway for identifying unknown systematics in the cosmology datasets.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) show hints of tension with data from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) when interpreted within the standard model of cosmology. In this short note we discuss the consequences of one solution to this tension, a small but negative spatial curvature with $R_k = 21 H_0^{-1}$, which DESI measures at $2\sigma$. We describe the physical role of curvature in cosmological distance measures tied to recombination, i.e. the CMB and BAO, and the relation to neutrino mass constraints which are relaxed to $\sum m_\nu < 0.10$ eV when curvature is allowed to deviate from zero. A robust detection of negative curvature would have significant implications for inflationary models: improved BAO measurements, particularly from future high-redshift spectroscopic surveys, will be able to distinguish curvature from other solutions to the DESI-CMB tension like phantom dark energy at high significance.

 - **Abstract**
 Kilohertz quasi-periodic oscillations (kHz QPOs) are believed to originate from the orbital timescales of the inner accretion flow, reflecting the dynamics of the innermost disk regions under strong gravitational forces. Despite numerous radiative and geometric models proposed so far, a comprehensive explanation of the observed properties of these variability components remains elusive. This study systematically examines kHz QPOs, their variability, and their connection to spectral properties in $4U 1636-536$ using AstroSat data. Our analysis tracks the source transition from hard to soft states in the hardness-intensity diagram. Broad spectral analysis (0.7-25 keV) using SXT and LAXPC data indicates a spectrum shaped by reflection from a thermal corona, with contributions from boundary layer emission and a soft disk component. We find significant changes in optical depth, blackbody temperature, and inner disk temperature that likely drive state transitions. Power density spectra reveal three variability types: a low frequency QPO (LFQPOs) (~30 Hz), and two simultaneous kHz QPOs. The LFQPOs and the upper kHz QPOs appear more prominently in soft spectral states. The presence of LFQPOs and twin kHz QPOs in soft spectral states enable us to estimate the neutron star mass at (2.37 $\pm$ 0.02) $M_\odot$ using the relativistic precession model (RPM). Additionally, time-lag and root mean square (rms) analysis provide insights into the size of the corona and the radiative origin of these variability components.

 - **Abstract**
 We present JWST observations of the near-Earth asteroid (3200) Phaethon using the Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam), Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec), and Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) to further investigate the composition of Phaethon's surface. Our NIRSpec data confirms that Phaethon's surface is dehydrated, showing no evidence of hydrated minerals in the 3-$\mu$m region. We estimate an upper limit on the hydrogen content in phyllosilicates of 0.06 wt%. Comparisons with laboratory spectra of carbonaceous chondrites suggest that Phaethon's surface composition is best matched by thermally metamorphosed samples of the CM chondrite Murchison (heated to 1000$^{\circ}$C), rather than CY meteorites as previous work suggested. We find no evidence of ongoing surface evolution due to recent perihelion passages. A comparison of the mid-infrared spectra of Phaethon and Bennu shows distinct spectral differences that are consistent with their different thermal histories. Our findings further refine our understanding of Phaethon's current surface composition and evolution and provide additional insights for the upcoming DESTINY+ mission.

          Luminosity Function of collapsar Gamma-Ray Bursts:the Progenitor of Long Gamma-Ray Bursts Is Not Singular

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are powerful probes of the high-redshift universe. However, the proportion of collapsar GRBs among long GRBs and their event rate relative to the star formation rate (SFR) remain contentious issues. We assume that long GRBs with $z\geq 2$ are all collapsar GRBs and construct the luminosity function using a high-redshift sample from the Swift satellite spanning 2004 to 2019. We model the luminosity function with a broken power-law form and consider three scenarios: no evolution, luminosity evolution, and density evolution. Our results are as follows: 1) The no-evolution model can be ruled out. 2) The fitting results indicate that to adequately explain the observations, a significant redshift evolution in either luminosity (evolution index $\delta = 1.54^{+0.21}_{-0.22}$) or density ($\delta = 2.09^{+0.29}_{-0.26}$) is required. This excludes the possibility that the evolution of long GRBs with redshift is due to contamination from non-collapsar GRBs. 3) The luminosity evolution model predicts that the number of collapsar GRBs with $z<2$ and $P \geq 1 \, \text{ph} \, \text{cm}^{-2} \, \text{s}^{-1}$ is 138.6, accounting for 82.5% of the observed long GRBs with $z<2$ and $P \geq 1 \, \text{ph} \, \text{cm}^{-2} \, \text{s}^{-1}$. The density evolution model predicts that the number of collapsar GRBs with $z<2$ and $P \geq 1 \, \text{ph} \, \text{cm}^{-2} \, \text{s}^{-1}$ is 80.2, accounting for 47.7% of the observation. Regardless of the model, a substantial portion of the long GRBs are not collapsar GRBs.

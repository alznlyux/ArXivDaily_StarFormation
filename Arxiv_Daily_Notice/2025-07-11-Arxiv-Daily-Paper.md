 - **Abstract**
 The Decadal Survey on Astronomy and Astrophysics 2020 highlights the importance of advancing research focused on discovering and characterizing habitable worlds. In line with this priority, our goal is to investigate how planetary systems evolve through atmospheric escape and to develop methods for identifying potentially Earth-like planets. By leveraging the ultraviolet (UV) capabilities of the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), we can use transit spectroscopy to observe atmospheric escape in exoplanets and explore the processes that shape their evolution, assess the ability of small planets to retain their atmospheres, and search for signs of Earth-like atmospheres. To achieve this, we support the development of a UV spectrograph with moderate- to high-resolution capabilities for point-source observations, coverage of key spectral features in the 100-300 nm range, and detectors that can register high count rates reliably. This article is an adaptation of a science case document developed for the Characterizing Exoplanets Steering Committee within HWO's Solar Systems in Context Working Group.

 - **Abstract**
 We evaluate 9 Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) agent configurations on 105 Cosmology Question-Answer (QA) pairs that we built specifically for this this http URL RAG configurations are manually evaluated by a human expert, that is, a total of 945 generated answers were assessed. We find that currently the best RAG agent configuration is with OpenAI embedding and generative model, yielding 91.4\% accuracy. Using our human evaluation results we calibrate LLM-as-a-Judge (LLMaaJ) system which can be used as a robust proxy for human evaluation. These results allow us to systematically select the best RAG agent configuration for multi-agent system for autonomous scientific discovery in astrophysics (e.g., cmbagent presented in a companion paper) and provide us with an LLMaaJ system that can be scaled to thousands of cosmology QA pairs. We make our QA dataset, human evaluation results, RAG pipelines, and LLMaaJ system publicly available for further use by the astrophysics community.

          Correlations between Dust Extinction Features across All Wavelength Scales: From Diffuse Interstellar Bands to R(V)

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding variations in the dust extinction curve is imperative for using dust as a tracer of local structure in the interstellar medium, understanding dust chemistry, and observational color corrections where dust is a nuisance parameter. However, the extinction curve is complicated and exhibits features across a wide range of wavelength scales, from narrow atomic lines and diffuse interstellar bands ("DIBs"), to intermediate-scale and very broad structures ("ISS" and "VBS"), and the overall slope of the optical extinction curve, parameterized by R(V). Robust, population-level studies of variations in these features are only now possible with large, all-sky, spectroscopic surveys. However, these features are often studied independently because they require drastically different spectral resolution. In this work, we couple features with disparate wavelength scales by cross-matching precision catalogs of DIB measurements from APOGEE and Gaia RVS with low-resolution extinction-curve measurements from Gaia XP. Using this combination, we show that there are meaningful correlations between the strengths of extinction-curve features across all wavelength scales. We present a model that statistically explains part of the excess scatter in DIB strength versus extinction, and we show variation in line shapes of two DIBs as a function of R(V). We find that most DIBs increase in strength with increasing R(V) and/or increasing strength of the ISS, though we found one DIB that anomalously decreases in strength with increasing R(V). Using the behavior of the ensemble of DIBs in APOGEE, we present this as the first evidence of systematic chemical variation accompanying R(V) variation.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a detailed spectropolarimetric study of the Sco-like Z-source GX 349+2, simultaneously observed with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) and Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR). During the observations GX 349+2 was found mainly in the normal branch. A model-independent polarimetric analysis yields a polarisation degree of $1.1\% \pm 0.3\%$ at a polarisation angle of $29° \pm 7°$ in the 2--8 keV band, with ${\sim}4.1\sigma$ confidence level significance. No variability of polarisation in time and flux has been observed, while an energy-resolved analysis shows a complex dependence of polarisation on energy, as confirmed by a spectropolarimetric analysis. Spectral modeling reveals a dominant disc blackbody component and a Comptonising emitting region, with evidence of a broad iron line associated with a reflection component. Spectropolarimetric fits suggest differing polarisation properties for the disc and Comptonised components, slightly favouring a spreading layer geometry. The polarisation of the Comptonised component exceeds the theoretical expectations, but is in line with the results for other Z-sources with similar inclination. A study of the reflection's polarisation is also reported, with polarisation degree ranging around 10% depending on the assumptions. Despite GX 349+2's classification as a Sco-like source, these polarimetric results align more closely with the Cyg-like system GX 340+0 of similar inclination. This indicates that polarisation is governed primarily by accretion state and orbital inclination, rather than by the subclass to which the source belongs.

          JWST COMPASS: A NIRSpec G395H Transmission Spectrum of the Super-Earth GJ 357 b

 - **Abstract**
 We present JWST NIRSpec/G395H transmission spectroscopy observations of GJ 357 b, a warm ($T_{\mathrm{eq}} \approx 525$ K) super-Earth ($1.2\ \mathrm{R_{\oplus}} $, $1.84\ \mathrm{M_{\oplus}} $) orbiting a nearby M3-type star, with a median precision of 18 ppm and 27 ppm in NRS1 and NRS2, respectively. These precisions are obtained by binning the spectrum into 53 spectroscopic channels with a resolution of 60 pixels (around 0.02 $\mu$m) each. Our analysis of the transmission spectrum reveals no detectable atmospheric spectral features. By comparing the observed spectrum with 1D forward models, we rule out atmospheres with mean molecular weights (MMW) lower than 8 g/mol to $3 \sigma$, as well as atmospheres with metallicities less than 300x solar. The lack of a low MMW primary atmosphere is consistent with a primordial H$_2$ rich atmosphere having escaped, given the planet's $\gtrsim5$ Gyr age, relatively low surface gravity (log g = 3.09), and its likely history of substantial incident extreme ultraviolet radiation. We conclude that GJ 357 b most likely possesses either a high-MMW secondary atmosphere, perhaps rich in oxidized gases like CO$_2$, or is a bare rock with no atmosphere. Upcoming scheduled JWST thermal emission observations could help distinguish between these scenarios by detecting signatures indicative of atmospheric heat redistribution or molecular absorption.

          The Orbital Eccentricity-Radius Relation for Planets Orbiting M Dwarfs

 - **Abstract**
 The orbital eccentricity-radius relation for small planets is indicative of the predominant dynamical sculpting processes during late-stage orbital evolution. Previous studies have shown that planets orbiting Sun-like stars exhibit an eccentricity-radius trend such that larger planets have higher orbital eccentricities, and that radius gap planets may have modestly higher orbital eccentricities than planets on either side of the radius gap. In this work, we investigate the trend for a sample of smaller M dwarf stars. For a sample of 236 single- and multi-transit confirmed planets or candidates discovered by the TESS and Kepler missions, we constrain orbital eccentricity for each planet from the transit photometry together with a stellar density prior. We investigate the binned eccentricity-planet radius relation for the combined planet sample and present evidence for a positive eccentricity-radius relationship with elevated eccentricities for planets larger than 3.5 R_earth, similar to the trend for planets orbiting Sun-like stars. We find modest evidence that single-transit M dwarf planets near the radius gap exhibit higher eccentricity, consistent with trends for Sun-like stars. However, we see no evidence for an increased eccentricity near the radius gap among multi-transit M dwarf planets. We discuss implications for these results in the context of predominant atmospheric loss mechanisms: namely, supporting evidence for photoevaporation in M dwarf planets vs. planet-planet collisions or giant impacts in FGK dwarf planets.

          Radius valley scaling among low mass stars with TESS

 - **Abstract**
 The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has been highly successful in detecting planets in close orbits around low-mass stars, particularly M dwarfs. This presents a valuable opportunity to conduct detailed population studies to understand how these planets depend on the properties of their host stars. The previously observed radius valley in Sun-like stars has not been unambiguously detected among M dwarfs, and how its properties varies when compared with more massive stars remains uncertain. We use a volume-limited sample of low mass stars with precise photometric stellar parameters from the bioverse catalog of TESS Objects of Interest (TOIs) confirmed planets and candidates within 120 pc. We detect the radius valley around M dwarfs at a location of 1.64 $\pm$ 0.03 $R_{\oplus}$ and with a depth of approximately 45${\%}$. The radius valley among GKM stars scales with stellar mass as $R_p \propto M_*^{0.15\pm 0.04}$. The slope is consistent, within 0.3$\sigma$, with those around Sun-like stars. For M dwarfs, the discrepancy is 3.6$\sigma$ with the extrapolated slope from the Kepler FGK sample, marking the point where the deviation from previous results begins. Moreover, we do not see a clear shift in the radius valley between early and mid M dwarfs. The flatter scaling of the radius valley for lower-mass stars suggests that mechanisms other than atmospheric mass loss through photoevaporation may shape the radius distribution of planets around M dwarfs. Comparison of the slope with various planet formation and evolution models matches well with pebble accretion models including waterworlds, indicating a potentially different regime of planet formation that can be probed with exoplanets around the lowest mass stars.

          Mass Distribution of Binary Black Hole Mergers from Young and Old Dense Star Clusters

 - **Abstract**
 Dense star clusters are thought to contribute significantly to the merger rates of stellar-mass binary black holes (BBHs) detected by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration. We combine $N$-body dynamic models of realistic dense star clusters with cluster formation histories to estimate the merger rate distribution as a function of primary mass for merging BBHs formed in these environments. It has been argued that dense star clusters -- most notably old globular clusters -- predominantly produce BBH mergers with primary masses $M_p\approx30\,M_{\odot}$. We show that dense star clusters forming at lower redshifts -- and thus having higher metallicities -- naturally produce lower-mass BBH mergers. We find that cluster BBH mergers span a wide range of primary mass, from about $6\,M_{\odot}$ to above $100\,M_{\odot}$, with a peak near $8\,M_{\odot}$, reproducing the overall merger rate distribution inferred from gravitational wave detections. Our results show that most low-mass BBH mergers (about $95\%$ with $M_p\lesssim 20\,M_{\odot}$) originate in metal-rich ($Z \sim Z_{\odot}$) dense star clusters, while more massive BBH mergers form predominately in metal-poor globular clusters. We also discuss the role of hierarchical mergers in shaping the BBH mass distribution. Gravitational wave detection of dynamically-formed low-mass BBH mergers -- potentially identifiable by features such as isotropic spin distributions -- may serve as probes of cluster formation histories in metal-rich environments at low redshifts.

 - **Abstract**
 Accurate and efficient simulation-based emulators are essential for interpreting cosmological survey data down to nonlinear scales. Multifidelity emulation techniques reduce simulation costs by combining high- and low-fidelity data, but traditional regression methods such as Gaussian processes struggle with scalability in sample size and dimensionality. In this work, we present T2N-MusE, a neural network framework characterized by (i) a novel 2-step multifidelity architecture, (ii) a 2-stage Bayesian hyperparameter optimization, (iii) a 2-phase $k$-fold training strategy, and (iv) a per-$z$ principal component analysis strategy. We apply T2N-MusE to selected data from the Goku simulation suite, covering a 10-dimensional cosmological parameter space, and build emulators for the matter power spectrum over a range of redshifts with different configurations. We find the emulators outperform our earlier Gaussian process models significantly and demonstrate that each of these techniques is efficient in training neural networks or/and effective in improving generalization accuracy. We observe a reduction in validation error by more than a factor of five compared to previous work. This framework has been used to build the most powerful emulator for the matter power spectrum, GokuNEmu, and will also be used to construct emulators for other statistics in future.

          The Roasting Marshmallows Program with IGRINS on Gemini South III: Seeing deeper into the metal depleted atmosphere of a gas-giant on the cusp of the hot to ultra-hot Jupiter transition

 - **Abstract**
 Ultra-hot Jupiters are a class of gas-giant exoplanets that show a peculiar combination of thermochemical properties in the form of molecular dissociation, atomic ionization, and inverted thermal structures. Atmospheric characterization of gas giants lying in the transitional regime between hot and ultra-hot Jupiters can help in understanding the physical mechanisms that cause the fundamental transition in atmospheres between the two classes of hot gas giants. Using Doppler spectroscopy with IGRINS on Gemini South (1.4 to 2.5 $\mu$m), we present the day-side high-resolution spectrum of WASP-122b (T$_{\mathrm{day}}$=2258$ \pm$ 54 K), a gas-giant situated at this transition. We detect the signal from H$_{2}$O, based on which we find that WASP-122b has a significantly metal-depleted atmosphere with metallicity log$_{10}$[Z$_{\mathrm{P}}$/Z$_{\odot}$] = $-$1.48$\pm$0.25 dex (0.033$_{-0.016}^{+0.018}$ $\times$ solar), and solar/sub-solar C/O ratio = 0.36$\pm$0.22 (3$\sigma$ upper limit 0.82). Drastically low atmospheric metallicity pushes the contribution function to higher pressures, resulting in the planetary spectral lines to originate from a narrow region around 1 bar where the thermal profile is non-inverted. This is inconsistent with solar composition radiative convective equilibrium (RCTE) which predicts an inverted atmosphere with spectral lines in emission. The sub-solar metallicity and solar/sub-solar C/O ratio is inconsistent with expectations from core-accretion. We find the planetary signal to be significantly shifted in K$_{\mathrm{P}}$ and V$_{\mathrm{sys}}$, which is in tension with the predictions from global circulation models and require further investigation. Our results highlight the detailed information content of high-resolution spectroscopy data and their ability to constrain complex atmospheric thermal structures and compositions of exoplanets.

 - **Abstract**
 The IceCube Neutrino Observatory at the South Pole detects neutrinos from the entire sky, both of astrophysical and atmospheric origin, via the Cherenkov light emitted when these neutrinos interact in the ice, giving rise to rapidly moving charged particles. Neutrino events with vertices contained within the detector volume are useful for studying the neutrino flavor ratio, as they allow for a better reconstruction of the event morphology. The Medium Energy Starting Events (MESE) data sample is a selection of such events with energies of at least 1 TeV. This sample includes electron-, muon-, and tau-neutrino events, processed consistently. We use it to constrain the flavor ratio of astrophysical neutrinos at Earth, which in turn informs us of the flavor composition at the source itself. In this talk, we will present the results of this study, based on 11.4 years of IceCube data.

 - **Abstract**
 Surface radio antenna-based measurements of cosmic-ray air showers present significant computational challenges in accurately reconstructing physics observables, in particular, the depth of shower maximum, X$_{max}$. State-of-the-art template fitting methods rely on extensive simulation libraries, limiting scalability. This work introduces a technique utilizing graph neural networks to reconstruct key air-shower parameters, in particular, direction and shower-core, energy, and X$_{max}$. For training and testing of the networks, we use a CoREAS simulation library made for a future enhancement of IceCube's surface array with radio antennas. The neural networks provide a scalable framework for large-scale data analysis for next-generation astroparticle observatories, such as IceCube-Gen2.

 - **Abstract**
 The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a multi-messenger observatory at the South Pole. As preparation for an enhancement of its surface array, IceTop, a prototype station consisting of elevated scintillation panels and radio antennas has been installed and is operating since 2020. The radio antennas detect emissions from cosmic-ray-induced air showers, and their precise orientation is essential for an accurate reconstruction of the air-shower properties. This work presents a novel method to determine the orientation by analyzing periodic variations of the Galactic background noise recorded by the antennas. In particular, we examine noise level variations correlated with the Earth's rotation and the apparent position of the Galactic Center. The method can provide a potential alternative or augment GPS-based measurements of the alignment of radio antennas at the South Pole.

 - **Abstract**
 Adding to the large radial velocity survey of nearby solar-type stars (summary in Tokovinin, 2023a), spectroscopic orbits are determined for four hierarchical systems: HIP 49442 (inner and outer periods of 164.55 d and 34 yr, respectively), HIP 55691 (2.4 and 415 yr), HIP 61465 (86.8 d), and HIP 78662C (0.82 d). Each system is discussed individually. Seven Gaia orbits of low-mass dwarfs, each with two additional resolved (interferometric and wide) companions, i.e. potential quadruples, are tested by monitoring radial velocities; five orbits are confirmed and two are refuted. Five of these systems are quadruples of 3+1 hierarchy, one is quintuple, and one is triple. Strengths and limitations of the Gaia data on multiple systems and the need of complementary observations are highlighted.

 - **Abstract**
 We report on an unusual radio source J180526-292953, initially identified as a steep spectrum, polarized point source toward the Galactic bulge and found to coincide with the nearby K dwarf HD317101A. We conducted a multi-wavelength radio study utilizing new GMRT observations and archival data from ASKAP, MeerKAT, and the VLA. At 1.5 GHz, HD317101A exhibits highly polarized coherent emission with variable activity lasting several hours with an apparent period of 3.7 days, which is consistent with electron cyclotron maser (ECM) emission. The behavior at 3 GHz is distinctive, with a short burst lasting tens of seconds to minutes, a flat spectrum, and no detected polarization, possibly suggesting gyro-synchrotron emission. High-resolution optical spectroscopy from CHIRON/SMARTS confirms HD317101A as a mature, chromospherically inactive K7V star, while Gaia astrometry, combined with speckle imaging from Zorro/Gemini-S, indicates the presence of a close-in M5.5V companion. We evaluated three possible origins for the combined radio behavior: chromospheric activity, auroral emission (possibly from a star-planet interaction), or an ultra-long-period transient. The bulk of the evidence favors an auroral origin, but the dominant stellar source of the ECM emission remains uncertain. Future VLBI observations, long-term TESS monitoring, high resolution spectroscopy and further radio characterization will be key to distinguishing between various scenarios.

 - **Abstract**
 GRAND (the Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection) is a proposed next-generation observatory targetting primarily the detection of ultra-high-energy neutrinos, with energies exceeding about 100 PeV. GRAND is envisioned as a collection of large-scale ground arrays of self-triggered radio antennas that target the radio emission from extensive air showers initiated by UHE particles. Three prototype arrays are presently in operation: GRANDProto300 in China, with 65 units running since end of 2024, GRAND@Auger in Argentina with 10 units deployed on the site of the Pierre Auger Observatory, and GRAND@Nançay in France, a 4-unit setup installed at the Nançay radio-observatory and used for test purposes. The main objective of the GRAND prototype phase is to validate the detection principle and technology of GRAND, in preparation for its next phase, GRAND10k. GRAND10k will consist of two arrays of 10'000 antennas each, covering both the Northern and Southern hemispheres, to be deployed from 2030 on. Here we give an overview of the GRAND concept, its science goals, the status of the prototypes, their performances and first detection of cosmic rays, and the technical perspective they open for the future.

 The Open Cluster Chemical Abundances and Mapping (OCCAM) survey seeks to curate a large, comprehensive, uniform dataset of open clusters and member stars to constrain key Galactic parameters. This eighth entry from the OCCAM survey, based on the newly released SDSS-V/MWM Data Release 19 (DR19), has established a sample of 164 high quality open clusters that are used to constrain the radial and azimuthal gradients of the Milky Way. The DR19 cluster sample [Fe/H] abundances are roughly consistent with measurements from other large-scale spectroscopic surveys. However, the gradients we calculate deviate considerably for some elements. We find an overall linear Galactic radial [Fe/H] gradient of $-0.075 \pm 0.006$ dex kpc$^{-1}$ using the cluster's current Galactocentric Radius ($R_{GC}$) and a gradient of $-0.068 \pm 0.005$ dex kpc$^-1$ with respect to the cluster's guiding center radius. We do not find strong evidence for significant evolution of the differential element gradients ([X/Fe]) investigated here (O, Mg, Si, S, Ca, Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Na, Al, K, Ce, Nd). For the first time using the OCCAM sample we have sufficient numbers of clusters to investigate Galactic azimuthal variations. In this work, we do find evidence of azimuthal variations in the measured radial abundance gradient in the Galactic disk using our open cluster sample.

 IceCube Upgrade, starting in the Antarctic summer season 2025/2026, will enhance the sensitivity of the current IceCube in the GeV range and improve understanding of the ice properties. Around 700 new modules will be deployed deep in the ice along seven strings, spaced $3\,\mathrm{m}$ vertically within a horizontal region of $100\,\mathrm{m}$. IceCube Upgrade mainly consists of two types of Cherenkov photon detectors, $\sim280$ Dual optical sensors in an Ellipsoid Glass for Gen2 (D-Eggs) and $\sim400$ multi-PMT Digital Optical Modules (mDOMs). Here, we present the status of mDOM production and acceptance testing for mass-produced mDOMs. The majority of the modules have already been produced, and all 128 modules on the first 2 strings have been successfully shipped to the South Pole after multiple steps of testing. Each mDOM contains 24 photomultipliers nearly isotropically distributed on the surface to achieve uniform photon sensitivity, making the integration and testing complicated. To reduce the amount of testing time, we have developed parallelized and automated software.

 - **Abstract**
 Despite extensive efforts, discovery of high-energy astrophysical neutrino sources remains elusive. We present an event-level simultaneous maximum likelihood analysis of tracks and cascades using IceCube data collected from April 6, 2008 to May 23, 2022 to search the whole sky for neutrino sources and, using a source catalog, for coincidence of neutrino emission with gamma-ray emission. This is the first time a simultaneous fit of different detection channels is used to conduct a time-integrated all-sky scan with IceCube. Combining all-sky tracks, with superior pointing-power and sensitivity in the northern sky, with all-sky cascades, with good energy-resolution and sensitivity in the southern sky, we have developed the most sensitive point-source search to date by IceCube which targets the entire sky. The most significant point in the northern sky aligns with NGC 1068, a Seyfert II galaxy, which shows a 3.5$\sigma$ excess over background after accounting for trials. The most significant point in the southern sky does not align with any source in the catalog and is not significant after accounting for trials. A search for the single most significant Gaussian flare at the locations of NGC 1068, PKS 1424+240, and the southern highest significance point shows results consistent with expectations for steady emission. Notably, this is the first time that a flare shorter than four years has been excluded as being responsible for NGC 1068's emergence as a neutrino source. Our results show that combining tracks and cascades when conducting neutrino source searches improves sensitivity and can lead to new discoveries.

 - **Abstract**
 Comets are primitive remnants of the early Solar System whose composition offers fundamental clues to their formation and evolution. High-resolution, broad-wavelength spectroscopy is crucial for identifying volatile species and constraining the physical conditions within the coma. We aim to characterize the gas composition and physical environment of the newly discovered comet C/2025 N1 through optical and near-infrared spectroscopy. We used a medium-resolution spectrum of comet C/2025 N1 with X-shooter at the ESO Very Large Telescope (VLT), covering the 300-2500 nm wavelength range. Standard data reduction and flux calibration were applied. It corresponds to a spectral slope at least a factor of $\sim1.86$ higher than that of 2I/Borisov. Although the object clearly shows activity, only upper limits to the production rates of OH and CN can be estimated: $8.0\times10^{24}$ s$^{-1}$ and $4.9\times10^{23}$ s$^{-1}$, respectively. We obtained red spectral slopes consistent with those of typical D-type asteroids and outer Solar System objects.

 - **Abstract**
 We have investigated the lensing event KMT-2024-BLG-0404. The light curve of the event exhibited a complex structure with multiple distinct features, including two prominent caustic spikes, two cusp bumps, and a brief discontinuous feature between the caustic spikes. While a binary-lens model captured the general anomaly pattern, it could not account for a discontinuous anomaly feature between the two caustic spikes. To explore the origin of the unexplained feature, we conducted more advanced modeling beyond the standard binary-lens framework. This investigation demonstrated that the previously unexplained anomaly was resolved by introducing an additional lens component with planetary mass. The estimated masses of the lens components are $M_{\rm p}= 17.3^{+25.5}_{-8.8}~M_{\rm E}$ for the planet, and $M_{\rm h,A}=0.090^{+0.133}_{-0.046}~M_\odot$ and $M_{\rm h,B}=0.026^{+0.038}_{-0.013}~M_\odot$ for the binary host stars. Based on these mass estimates, the lens system is identified as a planetary system where a Uranus-mass planet orbits a binary consisting of a late M dwarf and a brown dwarf. The distance to the planetary system is estimated to be $D_{\rm L} = 7.21^{+0.93}_{-0.97}$~kpc, with an 82\% probability that it resides in the Galactic bulge. This discovery represents the ninth planetary system found through microlensing with a planet orbiting a binary host. Notably, it is the first case where the host consists of both a star and a brown dwarf.

 - **Abstract**
 These notes are very much work-in-progress and simply intended to showcase, in various degrees of details (and rigour), some of the cosmology calculations that class_sz can do. We describe the class_sz code in C, Python and Jax. Based on the Boltzmann code class, it can compute a wide range of observables relevant to current and forthcoming CMB and Large Scale Structure surveys. This includes galaxy shear and clustering, CMB lensing, thermal and kinetic Sunyaev and Zeldovich observables, Cosmic Infrared Background, cross-correlations and three-point statistics. Calculations can be done either within the halo model or the linear bias model. For standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology and extensions, class_sz uses high-accuracy cosmopower emulators of the CMB and matter power spectrum to accelerate calculations. With this, along with efficient numerical integration routines, most class_sz output can be obtained in less than 500 ms (CMB $C_\ell$'s or matter $P(k)$ take $\mathcal{O}(1\mathrm{ms})$), allowing for fast or ultra-fast parameter inference analyses. Parts of the calculations are "jaxified", so the software can be integrated into differentiable pipelines.

          Axisymmetric second order perturbations of rotating main sequence stars

 - **Abstract**
 We calculate the second order perturbations driven by oscillation modes of rotating stars. Assuming that the typical amplitude $a$ of oscillation modes is small, we expand the perturbed quantities as $Q=Q^{(0)}+Q^{(1)}+Q^{(2)}+\cdots$ where $Q^{(0)}$ represents the equilibrium state and $Q^{(1)}$ and $Q^{(2)}$ are the first order and second order perturbations in $a$, respectively. We assume that the first order perturbations are given by non-axisymmetric modes and the second order perturbations are axisymmetric. For the second order perturbations, we derive a set of linear partial differential equations, which have inhomogeneous terms due to the first order perturbations. For low frequency $g$- and $r$-modes and overstable convective (OsC) modes of main sequence stars, we calculate the second order velocity field $\mathbf{v}^{(2)}$ and find that prograde $g$-modes and OsC modes tend to accelerate and retrograde $r$-modes to decelerate $v_\phi^{(2)}$ in the surface equatorial regions where $v_\phi^{(2)}$ is the $\phi$ component of $\mathbf{v}^{(2)}$. Using the angular momentum conservation equation derived for waves, we discuss that low frequency $g$- and $r$-modes transport angular momentum between the inner and outer parts of the envelope. For OsC modes in the core resonantly coupled with envelope prograde $g$-modes, we find that they can transport angular momentum from the core to the outer envelope so that they tend to brake the core rotation. We also suggest that the OsC modes provide the outer envelope of rotating stars with the torque enough to support a decretion disc.

 As of early 2025, the GRAND Collaboration operates three prototype arrays: GRANDProto300 in China, GRAND@Nançay in France, and GRAND@Auger in Argentina. The GRAND@Auger prototype was established through an agreement between the GRAND and Pierre Auger Collaborations, repurposing ten Auger Engineering Radio Array (AERA) stations as GRAND detection units. This setup provides a unique opportunity for coincident air-shower detection, enabling direct event-by-event comparison between GRAND@Auger and the well-established Pierre Auger detectors. Such comparisons allow for a detailed assessment of the detection principle and reconstruction capabilities of GRAND. In this contribution, we present an overview of the commissioning and preliminary results of GRAND@Auger, including the measurement of the Galactic background noise and the detection of the first self-triggered candidate event in coincidence with the Pierre Auger Observatory. Both results underscore the role of GRAND@Auger in advancing the GRAND project and refining the techniques required for large-scale radio detection of ultra-high-energy particles.

 - **Abstract**
 The IceCube Neutrino Observatory, located at the geographic South Pole, uses the glacial ice volume to detect astrophysical neutrinos. Detection of the neutrinos from the northern sky provides the opportunity to use a large effective volume. However, as the cross-section increases with energy, most high-energy neutrinos are absorbed by the Earth. On the other hand, probing down-going PeV neutrinos from the southern sky becomes challenging because of the large cosmic ray induced muon backgrounds. This contribution presents a method for classifying atmospheric muon bundles and single muons by analyzing the lateral and longitudinal characteristics of through-going track-like events from the southern sky. Muons generated in cosmic ray air showers form muon bundles, exhibiting a lateral spread spanning tens of meters within IceCube. We explore the time residual feature for the observed Cherenkov light to separate bundles from single muons. We also utilize energy losses along the track, which lead to fluctuations in the light intensity: bundles follow a smooth pattern, whereas single muons are more stochastic. A Boosted Decision Tree algorithm is trained on simulated, well-reconstructed cosmic ray and neutrino events to classify neutrino-induced single muons and cosmic ray bundles.

 - **Abstract**
 The GRAVITY interferometer has achieved microarcsecond precision in near-infrared interferometry, enabling tracking of flare centroid motion in the strong gravitational field near the Sgr A*. It might be promising to serve as a unique laboratory for exploring the accretion matter near black holes or testing Einstein's gravity. Recent studies debated whether there is a non-Keplerian motion of the flares in the GRAVITY dataset. It motivates us to present a comprehensive analysis based on error estimation under the Bayesian framework. This study uses asctrometric flare data to investigate the possibility that the flares exhibit deviations from the circular Keplerian motion. By fixing the black hole mass of Sgr A* and using the averaged astrometric data from the four flares, our results find that the super-Keplerian orbit is favored at the near $1\sigma$ confidence level, where the non-Keperian parameter is $\omega/\omega_k=1.45^{+0.35}_{-0.38}$. By treating the black hole mass as a free parameter, both the averaged and individual data exhibit no significant evidence in favor of non-Keplerian motions, where the non-Keplerian parameter is close to $1$ within $1\sigma$ confidence level. We further analyze flares undergoing planar geodesic motion, where the orbital circularity parameter is $\gamma = 0.99_{-0.10}^{+0.07}$. This indicates that the astrometric data favor the circular orbits. Future improvements in astrometry precision might enable stronger constraints on the kinematical behavior of the flares, potentially offering insights into black hole physics or accretion matter in the strong-field regime.

 - **Abstract**
 The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a cubic-kilometer detector located in the Antarctic ice at the geographic South Pole. It reads out over 5,000 photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) to detect Cherenkov light produced by secondary particles, enabling IceCube to identify both atmospheric and astrophysical neutrinos. One of the main challenges in this effort is effectively distinguishing between muons induced by neutrinos and those generated by cosmic-ray air showers. To address this challenge, the Advanced Northern Tracks Selection (ANTS) employs a graph convolutional neural network. This network is designed to utilize both the sensor data and the geometric arrangement of the detector's photomultiplier tubes (PMTs). By representing each module as a node in a graph and extracting features from each module, the network can capture and integrate both local and global features. This work details the implementation of the network architecture and highlights the improvements in background rejection efficiency compared to existing methods for selecting muon tracks.

 - **Abstract**
 The IceCube Neutrino Observatory searches for the origins of astrophysical neutrinos using various techniques to overcome the significant backgrounds produced by cosmic-ray air showers. One such technique involves combining the neutrino data with other cosmic messengers to identify spatial and temporal correlations. IceCube contributes to multi-messenger astrophysics (MMA) by providing alerts for interesting events observed in the detector. The Gamma-ray Follow-Up (GFU) cluster alert system is one stream that identifies potential neutrino flares in realtime, producing around 20 alerts per year. GFU-cluster alerts have been privately shared with Imaging Air Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs) through memoranda of understanding since IceCube's predecessor, AMANDA. To preserve blindness to the full behavior of our data, the current system mutes updates from sources following the initial GFU-cluster alert sent, preventing further updates until the activity drops below the alert threshold. With growing knowledge of the potential environments that produce astrophysical neutrinos and to foster open collaboration, the GFU-cluster alerts will shift to be publicly shared. Additionally, the new alert platform will provide all above-threshold information such that the source behavior after the initial alert is not obscured. The above threshold data will be distributed through an interactive website that will update the community on the status of active GFU-cluster alerts. This presentation will introduce the new GFU-cluster platform and the accompanying website, soon to be accessible to the MMA community.

 - **Abstract**
 When ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) interact with ambient photon backgrounds, a flux of extremely-high-energy (EHE), so-called cosmogenic, neutrinos is produced. The observation of these neutrinos with IceCube can probe the nature of UHECRs. We present a search for EHE neutrinos using $12.6 \, \mathrm{years}$ of IceCube data. The non-observation of neutrinos with energies $\gtrsim 10 \, \mathrm{PeV}$ constrains the all-flavor neutrino flux at $1 \, \mathrm{EeV}$ to be below $E^2 \Phi_{\nu_e + \nu_\mu + \nu_\tau} \simeq 10^{-8} \, \mathrm{GeV} \, \mathrm{cm}^{-2} \, \mathrm{s}^{-1} \, \mathrm{sr}^{-1}$, the most stringent limit to date. This constrains the proton fraction in UHECRs of energy above $30 \, \mathrm{EeV}$ to be $\lesssim 70\%$ if the evolution of the UHECR sources is similar to the star formation rate. Our analysis circumvents uncertainties associated with hadronic interaction models in studies of UHECR air showers, which also suggest a heavy composition at such energies.

 - **Abstract**
 We analyse ESPRESSO data for the stars HD10700, HD20794, HD102365, and HD304636 acquired via its Guaranteed Time Observations (GTO) programme. We characterise the stars' radial velocity (RV) signals down to a precision of 10 cm/s on timescales ranging from minutes to planetary periods falling within the host's habitable zone (HZ). We study the RV signature of pulsation, granulation, and stellar activity, inferring the potential presence of planets around these stars. Thus, we outline the population of planets that while undetectable remain compatible with the available data. A simple model of stellar pulsations successfully reproduced the intra-night RV scatter of HD10700 down to a few cm/s. For HD102365 and HD20794, an additional source of scatter at the level of several 10 cm/s remains necessary to explain the data. A kima analysis was used to evaluate the number of planets supported by the nightly averaged time series of each of HD10700, HD102365, and HD304636, under the assumption that a quasi-periodic Gaussian process (GP) regression is able to model the activity signal. While a frequency analysis of HD10700 RVs is able to identify a periodic signal at 20d, when it is modelled along with the activity signal the signal is formally non-significant. ESPRESSO data on their own do not provide conclusive evidence for the existence of planets around these three stars. ESPRESSO is shown to reach an on-sky RV precision of better than 10 cm/s on short timescales (<1h) and of 40 cm/s over 3.5 yr. A subdivision of the datasets showcases a precision reaching 20-30 cm/s over one year. These results impose stringent constraints on the impact of granulation mechanisms on RV. In spite of no detections, our analysis of HD10700 RVs demonstrates a sensitivity to planets with a mass of 1.7M$_{\oplus}$ for periods of up to 100 d, and a mass of 2-5M$_{\oplus}$ for the star's HZ.

 - **Abstract**
 The Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND) aims to detect and study ultra-high-energy (UHE) neutrinos by observing the radio emissions produced in extensive air showers. The GRANDProto300 prototype primarily focuses on UHE cosmic rays to demonstrate the autonomous detection and reconstruction techniques that will later be applied to neutrino detection. In this work, we propose a method for reconstructing the arrival direction and energy with high precision using state-of-the-art machine learning techniques from noisy simulated voltage traces. For each event, we represent the triggered antennas as a graph structure, which is used as input for a graph neural network (GNN). To significantly enhance precision and reduce the required training set size, we incorporate physical knowledge into both the GNN architecture and the input data. This approach achieves an angular resolution of 0.14° and a primary energy reconstruction resolution of about 15%. Additionally, we employ uncertainty estimation methods to improve the reliability of our predictions. These methods allow us to quantify the confidence of the GNN predictions and provide confidence intervals for the direction and energy reconstruction. Finally, we explore strategies to evaluate the consistency and robustness of the model when applied to real data. Our goal is to identify situations where predictions remain trustworthy despite domain shifts between simulation and reality.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding stars and their evolution is a key goal of astronomical research and has long been a focus of human interest. In recent years, theorists have paid much attention to the final interior processes within massive stars, as they can be essential for revealing neutrino-driven supernova mechanisms and other potential transients of massive star collapse. However, it is challenging to observe directly the last hours of a massive star before explosion, since it is the supernova event that triggers the start of intense observational study. Here we report evidence for a final phase of stellar activity known as a ``shell merger'', an intense shell burning in which the O-burning shell swallows its outer C-/Ne-burning shell, deep within the progenitor's interior moments before the supernova explosion. In the violent convective layer created by the shell merger, Ne, which is abundant in the stellar O-rich layer, is burned as it is pulled inward, and Si, which is synthesized inside, is transported outward. The remnant still preserves some traces of such Ne-rich downflows and Si-rich upflows in the O-rich layer, suggesting that inhomogeneous shell-merger mixing began just hours ($\lesssim 10^4$ s) before its gravitational collapse. Our results provide the first observational evidence that the final stellar burning process rapidly alters the internal structure, leaving a pre-supernova asymmetry. This breaking of spherical symmetry facilitates the explosion of massive stars and influences various supernova and remnant characteristics, including explosion asymmetries and the neutron star's kick and spin.

 - **Abstract**
 The intensity and energy spectrum of galactic cosmic rays in the heliosphere are significantly influenced by the 11-year solar cycle, a phenomenon known as solar modulation. Understanding this effect and its underlying physical mechanisms is essential for assessing radiation exposure and associated risks during space missions. Starting from a previously developed effective predictive model of solar modulation, validated using cosmic ray flux measurements from space-based detectors such as PAMELA and AMS-02, we build a generalizable forecasting strategy for the long-term evolution of cosmic ray fluxes. This strategy is based on identifying delayed cross-correlation relationships between solar proxies and the model's parameters. It integrates recent findings on time lags between cosmic ray fluxes and solar activity, and incorporates advanced time-series signal processing techniques. The framework not only performs well in reproducing observed data, but also shows strong potential for applications in space radiation monitoring and forecasting. By efficiently capturing the long-term variability of galactic cosmic rays, our approach contributes valuable insights for evaluating radiation risks, ultimately supporting safer and more effective space exploration.

 - **Abstract**
 FRB 20180916B is a repeating Fast Radio Burst (FRB) which produces bursts in a 5.1 day active window which repeats with a 16.34 day period. Models have been proposed to explain the periodicity using dynamical phenomena such as rotation, precession or orbital motion. Polarization Position Angle (PA) of the bursts can be used to distinguish and constraint the origin of the long term periodicity of the FRB. We aim to study the PA variability on short (within an observation) and long timescales (from observation to observation). We aim to compare the observed PA variability with the predictions of various dynamical progenitor models for the FRB. We use the calibrated burst dataset detected by uGMRT in Band 4 (650 MHz) which have been published in arXiv:2409.12584 . We transform the PA measured at 650 MHz to infinite frequency such that PAs measured in different observations are consistent, and finally measure the changes within and across active windows. We find that PA of the bursts vary according to the periodicity of the source. We constrain the PA variability to be within seven degrees on timescales less than four hours for all MJDs. In addition, we also tentatively note the PA measured at the same phase in the active window varies from one cycle to another. Using the findings, we constrain rotational, precession and binary progenitor models. Rotational model partially agrees with observed PA variability but requires further study to fully constrain. We robustly rule out all flavors of precessional models where either precession explains the periodicity of the FRB or the variability from one cycle to another. Lastly, we draw similarities between FRB 20180916B and a X-ray binary system, Her X 1, and explicitly note that both the sources exhibit a similar form of PA variability.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) generated by the ringdown phase of primordial black holes (PBHs) formed in the early universe. As the ringdown signal is independent of the PBH formation mechanism, the resulting SGWB offers a model-independent probe of PBHs. We numerically compute the ringdown waveform and derive the corresponding SGWB. We show that such a signal could be detected by future pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) for PBHs heavier than the solar mass. Additionally, we evaluate the SGWB from binary PBH mergers and demonstrate that it lies within the sensitivity bands of next-generation ground-based interferometers such as Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope, suggesting a multi-band observational strategy for probing the PBH dark matter scenario.

 Cosmic ray shower detection using large radio arrays has gained significant traction in recent years. With massive improvements in signal modelling and microscopic simulations, the analysis of incoming events is still severely limited by the simulation cost of radio emission to interpret the data. In this work, we show that a neural network can be used for simulating such radio pulses. We also demonstrate how such a neural network can be used for $X_\mathrm{max}$ reconstruction, while retaining comparable resolution to using full Monte-Carlo CORSIKA/CoREAS simulations for radio emission.

 - **Abstract**
 The evolution of one member of a stellar binary into a white dwarf has been proposed as a mechanism that triggers the formation of close-in gas giant planets. The star's asymmetric mass loss during the AGB stage gives it a "kick" that can initiate Eccentric Lidov-Kozai oscillations, potentially causing a planet around the secondary star to migrate inwards and perturbing the eccentricity and inclination of its orbit. Here we present a measurement of the stellar obliquity of TOI-1259Ab, a gas giant in a close-in orbit around a K star with a white dwarf companion about 1650 au away. By using the NEID spectrograph to detect the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect during the planetary transit, we find the sky-projected obliquity to be $\lambda = 6^{+21}_{-22}\,^\circ$. When combined with estimates of the stellar rotation period, radius, and projected rotation velocity, we find the true 3D obliquity to be $\psi = 24^{+14}_{-12}\,^\circ$ ($\psi < 48^\circ$ at 95% confidence), revealing that the orbit of TOI-1259Ab is well aligned with the star's equatorial plane. Because the planet's orbit is too wide for tidal realignment to be expected, TOI-1259Ab might have formed quiescently in this well-aligned configuration. Alternatively, as we show with dynamical simulations, Eccentric Lidov-Kozai oscillations triggered by the evolution of the binary companion are expected to lead to a low obliquity with a probability of about $\sim$14%.

 - **Abstract**
 The early spectra of the kilonova (KN) AT2017gfo following the binary neutron star merger GW170817 exhibit numerous features shaped by r-process nucleosynthesis products. Although a few species were tentatively detected, no third-peak elements were unambiguously identified, as the amount of atomic data required for radiative transfer modeling is immense. Although comprehensive atomic data, including atomic opacities, is now available for many elements, wavelength-calibrated data remains limited to a select few ions. To examine the atomic opacities of all singly and doubly ionized lanthanides, from La (Z = 57) to Yb (Z = 70), we perform atomic structure calculations using the FAC code. Our calculations incorporate an innovative optimization of the local central potential and the number of configurations considered, alongside a calibration technique aimed at enhancing agreement between theoretical and experimental atomic energy levels. We assess the accuracy of the computed data, including energy levels and electric dipole (E1) transition strengths, as well as their impact on KN opacities. We find that strong transitions ($\log(gf)>-1$) are in good agreement with both experiments and semi-empirical calculations. For ions with substantial experimental data, the computed opacities exhibit good agreement with prior calculations. By calibrating low-lying energy levels with experimental data, we have identified 66,591 transitions with experimentally calibrated wavelength information, rendering future lanthanide line identifications through radiative transfer modeling feasible. In total, our calculations encompass 28 ions, yielding 146,856 energy levels below the ionization threshold and 28,690,443 transitions among these levels.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations of DESI hint that dark matter (DM) may not be cold but have a non-zero equation of state (EoS) parameter, and that dark energy (DE) may not be a cosmological constant. In this work, we explore the possibility of a non-zero DM EoS parameter within the framework of dynamical DE. We perform analysis by using the latest baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data from DESI DR2, the cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from Planck, and the type Ia supernova (SN) data from DESY5 and PantheonPlus. When using the combination of CMB, BAO, and SN data, our results indicate a preference for a non-zero DM EoS parameter at the $2.8\sigma$ and $3.3\sigma$ level within the content of a constant DE EoS. In contrast, for a time-evolving DE EoS parameterized by $w_0$ and $w_a$, this preference decreases to $0.8\sigma$ and $1.1\sigma$. Furthermore, allowing a non-zero DM EoS yields best-fit values of $w_0$ and $w_a$ that exhibit smaller deviations from the $\Lambda$CDM expectations, and Bayesian evidence analysis shows a comparable preference for this model relative to $\Lambda$CDM. The overall results of this work indicate that a non-zero DM EoS parameter warrants further exploration and investigation.

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a method for estimating the Fisher score--the gradient of the log-likelihood with respect to model parameters--using score matching. By introducing a latent parameter model, we show that the Fisher score can be learned by training a neural network to predict latent scores via a mean squared error loss. We validate our approach on a toy linear Gaussian model and a cosmological example using a differentiable simulator. In both cases, the learned scores closely match ground truth for plausible data-parameter pairs. This method extends the ability to perform Fisher forecasts, and gradient-based Bayesian inference to simulation models, even when they are not differentiable; it therefore has broad potential for advancing cosmological analyses.

 - **Abstract**
 Large-scale primordial perturbations have been well constrained by current cosmological observations, but the properties of small-scale perturbations remain elusive. This study focuses on second-order tensor-scalar induced gravitational waves (TSIGWs) generated by large-amplitude primordial scalar and tensor perturbations on small scales. We provide the analytical expressions for the kernel functions and the corresponding energy density spectra of second-order TSIGWs. By combining observations of SGWB across different scales, TSIGWs can be used to constrain small-scale primordial curvature perturbations and primordial gravitational waves. Furthermore, we discuss the feasibility of TSIGWs dominating the current PTA observations under various primordial power spectra scenarios. Our results indicate that TSIGWs generated by monochromatic primordial power spectra might be more likely to dominate the current PTA observations.

          Planets larger than Neptune have elevated eccentricities

 NASA's Kepler mission identified over 4000 extrasolar planets that transit (cross in front of) their host stars. This sample has revealed detailed features in the demographics of planet sizes and orbital spacings. However, knowledge of their orbital shapes - a key tracer of planetary formation and evolution - remains far more limited. We present measurements of eccentricities for 1646 Kepler planets, 92% of which are smaller than Neptune. For all planet sizes, the eccentricity distribution peaks at e=0 and falls monotonically toward zero at e=1. As planet size increases, mean population eccentricity rises from $\langle e \rangle = 0.05 \pm 0.01$ for small planets to $\langle e \rangle = 0.20 \pm 0.03$ for planets larger than $\sim$ 3.5 Earth-radii. The overall planet occurrence rate and planet-metallicity correlation also change abruptly at this size. Taken together, these patterns indicate distinct formation channels for planets above and below $\sim$ 3.5 Earth-radii. We also find size dependent associations between eccentricity, host star metallicity, and orbital period. While smaller planets generally have low eccentricities, there are hints of a noteworthy exception: eccentricities are slightly elevated in the ``radius valley,'' a narrow band of low occurrence rate density which separates rocky ``super-Earths'' (1.0-1.5 Earth-radii) from gas-rich ``sub-Neptunes'' (2.0-3.0 Earth-radii. We detect this feature at $2.1\sigma$ significance. Planets in single- and multi-transiting systems exhibit the same size-eccentricity relationship, suggesting they are drawn from the same parent population.

 Neural networks (NNs) have a great potential for future neutrino telescopes such as IceCube-Gen2, the planned high-energy extension of the IceCube observatory. IceCube-Gen2 will feature new optical sensors with multiple photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) designed to provide omnidirectional sensitivity. Neural networks excel at handling high-dimensional problems and can naturally incorporate the increased complexity of these new sensors. Additionally, their fast inference time makes them promising candidates for handling the high event rates expected from IceCube-Gen2. This contribution presents potential applications of neural networks in the IceCube-Gen2 in-ice optical array. First, we introduce a method to simulate the IceCube-Gen2 optical modules' photon acceptance using a NN that leverages the modules' inherent symmetries. Secondly, we present the status of neutrino NN-based reconstruction efforts, including the adaptation of a novel IceCube technique that combines normalizing flows with transformer NNs. Finally, we describe current progress in noise cleaning applications based on node classification with graph neural networks (GNNs), a method that has already shown promising results for the forthcoming low-energy extension, IceCube-Upgrade.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an improved baryonification (BFC) model that modifies dark-matter-only $N$-body simulations to generate particle-level outputs for gas, dark matter, and stars. Unlike previous implementations, our approach first splits each simulation particle into separate dark matter and baryonic components, which are then displaced individually using the BFC technique. By applying the hydrostatic and ideal gas equations, we assign pressure and temperature values to individual gas particles. The model is validated against hydrodynamical simulations from the FLAMINGO and TNG suites (which feature varied feedback prescriptions) showing good agreement at the level of density and pressure profiles across a wide range of halo masses. As a further step, we calibrate the BFC model parameters to gas and stellar mass ratio profiles from the hydrodynamical simulations. Based on these calibrations, we baryonify $N$-body simulations and compare the resulting total matter power spectrum suppressions to the ones from the same hydrodynamical simulation. Carrying out this test of the BFC method at each redshift individually, we obtain a 2 percent agreement up to $k=5\,h$/Mpc across all tested feedback scenarios. We also define a reduced, 2+1 parameter BFC model that simultaneously accounts for feedback variations (2 parameters) and redshift evolution (1 parameter). The 2+1 parameter model agrees with the hydrodynamical simulations to better than 2.5 percent over the scales and redshifts relevant for cosmological surveys. Finally, we present a map-level comparison between a baryonified $N$-body simulation and a full hydrodynamical run from the TNG simulation suite. Visual inspection of dark matter, gas, and stellar density fields, along with the integrated pressure map, shows promising agreement. Further work is needed to quantify the accuracy at the level of observables.

          A Semi-Analytic model for Effects of Fuzzy Dark Matter Granule Perturbations on Orbital Motion

 - **Abstract**
 In fuzzy dark matter scenarios, the quantum wave nature of ultralight axion-like particles generates stochastic density fluctuations inside dark matter halos. These fluctuations, known as granules, perturb the orbits of subhalos and other orbiting bodies. While previous studies have simulated these effects using N-body techniques or modeled them statistically using diffusion approximations, we propose an alternative framework based on representing the perturbations as a Fourier series with random coefficients, which can be applied to individual orbits, not just populations. We extend the model to finite-size subhalos, identifying a critical length scale below which subhalos behave as point-mass particles. In contrast, larger subhalos exhibit suppressed perturbations from granules due to their extended mass profiles. Using FDM-Simulator, we validate our finite-size model by isolating granule accelerations and confirming their statistical effects on subhalo dynamics.

 Spatially resolved observations of the Sun and the astronomical sample size of stellar bodies are the respective key strengths of solar and stellar observations. However, the large difference in object brightness between the Sun and other stars has led to distinctly different instrumentation and methodologies between the two fields. We produce and analyze synthetic full-disk spectra derived from 19 small area field-of-view optical observations of solar flares acquired by the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope (SST) between 2011 and 2024. These are used to investigate what can and cannot be inferred about physical processes on the Sun from Sun-as-a-star observations. The recently released Numerical Empirical Sun-as-a-Star Integrator (NESSI) code provides synthetic full-disk integrated spectral line emission based on smaller field-of-view input, accounting for center-to-limb variations and differential rotation. We use this code to generate pseudo-Sun-as-a-star spectra from the SST observations. ...

 - **Abstract**
 White dwarfs represent the most common end stage of stellar evolution and are important for a range of astrophysical questions. The high-resolution ultraviolet spectroscopic capability of the Habitable World Observatory (HWO) offers a unique capability to characterize white dwarfs. In this documents, we focus on two specific science cases for HWO -- white dwarfs as probes of extrasolar planet compositions, and fundamental astrophysics. HWO will have the sensitivity to measure a suite of heavy elements, such as S, C, O, Fe, and Si, in a large sample of polluted white dwarfs to constrain the water content and the light elements in the cores of extrasolar planets. HWO can also be used to search for any small variation on the fine structure constant in the presence of strong gravity. Both science cases require a minimum resolving power of 60,000, and a ultraviolet coverage down to at least 900 Angstrom.

 - **Abstract**
 A detailed analysis of the structural, astrophysical, kinematic, and dynamical properties of the open clusters Roslund 3 and Ruprecht1 74 is carried out using CCD UBV photometry in conjunction with astrometric and photometric data from Gaia DR3. Membership probabilities were computed via the UPMASK algorithm applied to Gaia proper motions and trigonometric parallaxes, leading to the identification of 198 likely members for Roslund 3 and 397 for Ruprecht 174. Astrophysical parameters were derived using both the classical approach, where parameters are independently determined, and a MCMC technique, which estimates them simultaneously. The agreement between the results from both methods confirms their reliability and highlights the robustness of the classical method. The reddening values were determined as $E(B-V)=0.410\pm 0.046$ mag for Roslund 3 and $E(B-V)=0.615\pm 0.042$ mag for Ruprecht 174. The estimated distances are $d=1687 \pm 121$ pc for Roslund 3 and $d=2385 \pm 163$ pc for Ruprecht 174. Both clusters exhibit metallicities close to the solar value, with [Fe/H] = $0.030 \pm 0.065$ dex for Roslund 3 and [Fe/H] = $0.041 \pm 0.064$ dex for Ruprecht 174. The corresponding ages were found to be $\tau=60\pm 6$ and $\tau=520\pm 50$ Myr, respectively. The present day mass function slopes were found to be $1.18 \pm 0.13$ for Roslund 3 and $1.53 \pm 0.30$ for Ruprecht 174, consistent with the canonical Salpeter value within uncertainties. Galactic orbital analyses indicate that both clusters are thin-disk members confined within the Solar circle. Additionally, relaxation times and spatial distributions of stars suggest that both clusters have reached dynamical relaxation and exhibit clear signs of mass segregation.

 - **Abstract**
 Planets with large bodies of water on their surface will have more temperate and stable climates, and such planets are the ideal places for life-as-we-know-it to arise and evolve. A key science case for the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) is to determine which planets host surface liquid water. Aside from its implications for planetary climate and astrobiology, detecting surface water on terrestrial exoplanets would place important constraints on our theories of planet formation and volatile delivery. Rotational variability in the reflectance of an exoplanet may reveal surface features rotating in and out of view, including oceans. Orbital changes in reflectance and polarization, meanwhile, are sensitive to the scattering phase function of the planetary surface, including specular reflection from large bodies of water. Although these techniques are applicable to all temperate terrestrial exoplanets, we focus in this document on the directly-imaged planets that are more likely to drive the HWO coronagraph design. Identification of water oceans relies on detecting a liquid, and using other lines of evidence to narrow that liquid down to being water. Liquids have smoother surfaces than most solids, and hence exhibit specular reflection instead of diffuse reflection. In practice, this makes lakes and oceans look dark from most illumination angles, but mirror-like at glancing angles. HWO is uniquely capable of identifying surface liquid oceans via their optical properties. Given that discovering an ocean on an exoplanet would confirm its status as a habitable world, this science case is literally the raison d'etre of the Habitable Worlds Observatory.

 - **Abstract**
 Modern cosmological inference increasingly relies on differentiable models to enable efficient, gradient-based parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification. Here, we present a novel approach for predicting the abundance of dark matter haloes and their cosmology dependence using a differentiable, field-level neural network (NN) model, and study how well the cosmology dependence is captured by common parametrisations of the halo mass function (HMF), and by our NN-based approach. By training a 3D U-Net on initial density fields from fast N-body simulations with varying cosmological parameters, we enable direct, differentiable mapping from the linear density field to protohalo patches and their mass bins. Our method achieves competitive accuracy in identifying protohalo regions and in capturing the dependence of the HMF on cosmological parameters. Our NN derivatives agree well with finite differences of both analytical and emulated HMFs, at the level of the disagreement among the different models. We further demonstrate how the NN model can additionally be used to investigate the response of the HMF to changes in the initial Gaussian random field. Finally, we also demonstrate that a differentiable model can be used to extrapolate existing models at very high precision.

 - **Abstract**
 Seismic structure inversions have been used to study the solar interior for decades. With the high-precision frequencies obtained using data from the Kepler mission, it has now become possible to study other solar-like oscillators using structure inversions, including both main-sequence and subgiant stars. Subgiant stars are particularly interesting because they exhibit modes of mixed acoustic-buoyancy nature, which provide the opportunity to probe the deeper region of stellar cores. This work examines whether the structure inversion techniques developed for the pure acoustic modes of the Sun and other main-sequence stars are still valid for mixed modes observed in subgiant stars. We construct two grids of models: one of main-sequence stars and one of early subgiant stars. Using these grids, we examine two different parts of the inversion procedure. First, we examine what we call the "kernel errors", which measure how well the mode sensitivity functions can recover known frequency differences between two models. Second, we test how these kernel errors affect the ability of an inversion to infer known structure differences. On the main sequence, we find that reliable structure inversion results can be obtained across the entire range of masses and large frequency separations we consider. On the subgiant branch, however, the rapid evolution of mixed modes leads to large kernel errors and hence difficulty recovering known structure differences. Our tests show that using mixed modes to infer the structure of subgiant stars reliably will require improvements to current fitting approaches and modifications to the structure inversion techniques.

 - **Abstract**
 Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques are increasingly used across astrophysics, enabled by the growing availability of data and improved acquisition methods. These approaches now support tasks from redshift estimation to source classification. In this work, we aim to (i) classify blazars from the Fermi 4LAC-DR3 catalogue, in particular to identify the likely origin of blazars of uncertain type (BCUs), and (ii) investigate the full blazar sample to study their structure and redshift-luminosity evolution. We focus especially on the transition region between Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars (FSRQs) and BL Lacertae objects (BL Lacs), which may yield insights into accretion disk evolution. We examine Changing-Look Blazars (CLBs) as potential intermediates in this transition. We implement a classification pipeline using both a strong benchmark model (XGBoost) and a foundation model pre-trained on millions of tabular datasets (TabPFN). By extracting and reducing the high-dimensional latent space of the best model, we provide a 2D representation of the blazar population. This reveals a continuum between FSRQs and BL Lacs, including CLBs as transitional sources. These results support a scenario of gradual evolution from radiatively efficient (FSRQ-like) to inefficient (BL Lac-like) accretion. Ultimately, we show that a single probability score, combined with the latent space, offers a new framework for interpreting blazar diversity beyond discrete classes.

          Evolving Dark Sector and the Dark Dimension Scenario

 - **Abstract**
 String theory naturally leads to the expectation that dark energy is not stable, and may be evolving as captured by the Swampland de Sitter conjectures. Moreover, motivated by the distance conjecture a unification of dark sector has been proposed, where the smallness of dark energy leads to one extra dimension of micron size with dark matter being the KK graviton excitations in this extra dimension. We consider the natural possibility that the radius of the dark dimension varies as the dark energy decreases, leading to the variation of the dark matter mass. This correlates the decrease of the dark energy with the variation of the dark matter mass as they depend on the variations of a scalar field $\phi$ controlling the radius of the extra dimension. A simple realization of this idea for small range of $\phi$ is captured by choosing a potential which is locally of the form $V=V_0\ {\rm exp}(-c\phi)$ and dark matter mass $m_{\rm DM}=m_0\ {\rm exp}(-c' \phi)$ where the sign of $\phi$ is chosen such that $c'\geq 0$ while we have two choices for the sign of $c$ depending on whether the dark dimension expands or shrinks when the dark energy dominates. We find excellent agreement with recent experimental data from DESI DR2 combined with SN measurements and reproduces the same significance as CPL parametrization with the added benefit of providing a natural explanation for the apparent phantom behavior ($w<-1$) reported by DESI and DES based on a physical model. Regardless of the SN dataset, there is a preference for non-zero values of $c'$ and $c$ that are in the expected $O(1)$ range in Planck units as suggested by the Swampland criteria. In particular, there is a remarkable consistency with $c'\simeq 0.05 \pm 0.01$ for all dataset combinations including SN, and close to the experimental upper bound of $c'\lesssim 0.2$ demanded by the lack of detection of fifth force in the dark sector.

 - **Abstract**
 Large-scale photometric surveys are revolutionizing astronomy by delivering unprecedented amounts of data. The rich data sets from missions such as the NASA Kepler and TESS satellites, and the upcoming ESA PLATO mission, are a treasure trove for stellar variability, asteroseismology and exoplanet studies. In order to unlock the full scientific potential of these massive data sets, automated data-driven methods are needed. In this review, I illustrate how machine learning is bringing asteroseismology toward an era of automated scientific discovery, covering the full cycle from data cleaning to variability classification and parameter inference, while highlighting the recent advances in representation learning, multimodal datasets and foundation models. This invited review offers a guide to the challenges and opportunities machine learning brings for stellar variability research and how it could help unlock new frontiers in time-domain astronomy.

 - **Abstract**
 The Star-Planet Activity Research CubeSat (SPARCS) is a NASA-funded 6U-CubeSat mission designed to monitor ultraviolet (UV) radiation from low-mass stars. These stars' relatively high-frequency and high-energy UV flares significantly affect the atmospheres of orbiting exoplanets, driving atmospheric loss and altering the conditions for habitability. SPARCS aims to capture time-resolved photometric data in the far-UV and near-UV simultaneously to better characterize the flares and detect the strongest and rarest among them. In addition, SPARCS is testing innovative technology, such as delta-doped detectors with near 100% internal quantum efficiency and detector-integrated metaldielectric UV bandpass filters. This mission will increase the technology readiness level of these critical components, positioning them for inclusion in future flagship missions like the Habitable Worlds Observatory. This paper outlines SPARCS' mission goals and provides an update as the spacecraft is completed and awaits its planned late-2025 launch to a sun-synchronous low-Earth orbit. It also highlights the critical role of small missions in providing training and leadership development opportunities for students and researchers, advancing technology for larger observatories, and shares lessons learned from collaborations between academic, government, and industry partners.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a sample of 53 galaxy spectra at z_spec ~ 5-12 from the JWST CEERS and RUBIES surveys, combining NIRSpec PRISM spectroscopy with NIRCam photometry. We aim to use these data to establish best practices for measuring the UV spectral slope ($\beta$) in the era of JWST. We adopt power-law fits to the rest-frame UV continuum from the spectroscopic data as our fiducial, or `true', $\beta$ values, and compare them to photometric estimates derived through three methods: (1) photometric power-law fitting, (2) power-law fitting to an SED model fitted to the photometry, (3) single-color fitting near the Lyman break, and (4) single-color fitting at fixed rest-frame wavelengths. We find that photometric power-law fitting most closely recovers the spectroscopic slopes, with minimal bias and scatter. SED fitting performs moderately well, and can be preferable in cases of low signal-to-noise where photometric power-law fitting may become unreliable. Single-color estimates, while commonly used in past studies, show the most significant deviations and are not recommended when more than a single color is available. Our results highlight the limitations and strengths of each approach and provide practical guidance for measuring $\beta$ from photometry when spectra are unavailable or are of insufficient quality.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the science case for characterizing the nature of the first stars using the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO). High-resolution ultraviolet (UV) spectroscopy with the HWO has the potential to confirm any surviving low-mass zero-metallicity first stars by placing unprecedented low limits on their metal abundances. It also has the potential to substantially increase the number of elements detectable in the spectra of known long-lived low-mass stars, which exhibit extremely low metal abundances that reveal the metals produced by the first stars. Elements important for this science case with UV transitions include C, Mg, Al, Si, P, S, Sc, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn. HWO would expand the discovery space when compared with the Hubble Space Telescope by enabling high-resolution UV spectroscopy for much fainter stars throughout the Milky Way and neighboring stellar systems.

          Dialogue Concerning the Two Shock Codes

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/
 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we summarize the shock physics and the treatment of radiative transfer in two well-established shock codes -- the MAPPINGS code (Dopita1976,Binette1985,Sutherland1993) and the Cox/Raymond code (hereafter CR code) (Cox1972,Raymond1976,Raymond1979). We compare the ionization states, temperatures, electron densities, and the energy transportation of the shock models with shock velocities of 50, 110, 150 and 300 km/s. In summary, both codes adopt the Rankine-Hugoniot flow equation to describe the shock flows, giving the same shock physical properties at the immediate area behind shock fronts. The different treatments of radiative transfer in these two codes leads to somewhat different computation of the ionization and thermal structures of shocks, as well as the emission-line fluxes. This work highlights the importance of the delicate treatment of photoionization in shock models, providing insight of the future development of shock codes, such as the 3D shock codes.

          Little Red Dots from Ultra-Strongly Self-Interacting Dark Matter

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the possibility that the recently identified population of high-redshift, obscured quasars - known as "Little Red Dots" (LRDs) - originates from early black hole seed formation driven by ultra-strongly self-interacting dark matter (uSIDM). In this framework, dark matter halos undergo gravothermal core collapse due to large self-interaction cross sections, resulting in the rapid formation of massive black hole (BH) seeds with masses $\gtrsim 10^{5} M_\odot$ at redshifts $z \gtrsim 5$. We develop a semi-analytic model that tracks the evolution of the dark matter halo population, the redshift of collapse $z_{\rm coll}$, and the corresponding BH mass function. Black hole growth is modeled stochastically via a log-normal Eddington ratio distribution and a finite duty cycle. We find that the uSIDM scenario naturally reproduces key observed properties of LRDs, including their abundance, compactness, and characteristic BH masses, while offering a mechanism for early, obscured black hole formation that is difficult to achieve in standard CDM-based models. The predicted SMBH mass function at $z \sim 5$ shows excellent agreement with LRD observational data and SIDM merger-tree simulations, particularly at the high-mass end $(m_{\rm BH} \gtrsim 10^{7} M_\odot)$. These results suggest that LRDs may serve as powerful observational tracers of exotic dark sector physics and that SMBH formation in the early universe could be significantly shaped by non-gravitational dark matter interactions.

          Inferring the neutron star equation of state with nuclear-physics informed semiparametric models

 - **Abstract**
 Over the past decade, an abundance of information from neutron-star observations, nuclear experiments and theory has transformed our efforts to elucidate the properties of dense matter. However, at high densities relevant to the cores of neutron stars, substantial uncertainty about the dense matter equation of state (EoS) remains. In this work, we present a semiparametric EoS framework aimed at better integrating knowledge across these domains in astrophysical inference. We use a Meta-model at low densities, and Gaussian Process extensions at high densities. Comparisons between our semiparametric framework to fully nonparametric EoS representations show that imposing nuclear theoretical and experimental constraints through the Meta-model up to nuclear saturation density results in constraints on the pressure up to twice nuclear saturation density. We show that our Gaussian Process trained on EoS models with nucleonic, hyperonic, and quark compositions extends the range of EoS explored at high density compared to a piecewise polytropic extension schema, under the requirements of causality of matter and of supporting the existence of heavy pulsars. We find that maximum TOV masses above $3.2 M_{\odot}$ can be supported by causal EoS compatible with nuclear constraints at low densities. We then combine information from existing observations of heavy pulsar masses, gravitational waves from binary neutron star mergers, and X-ray pulse profile modeling of millisecond pulsars within a Bayesian inference scheme using our semiparametric EoS prior. With current astrophysical observations, we find a favored pressure at two times nuclear saturation density of $P(2\rho_{\rm nuc}) = 1.98^{+2.13}_{-1.08}\times10^{34}$ dyn/cm$^{2}$, a radius of a $1.4 M_{\odot}$ neutron star value of $R_{1.4} = 11.4^{+0.98}_{-0.60}$\;km, and $M_{\rm max} = 2.31_{-0.23}^{+0.35} M_{\odot}$ at the 90\% credible level.

 - **Abstract**
 The symbiotic channel of Type Ia supernovae progenitors is crucial for explaining the observed circumstellar material in some Type Ia supernovae. While extensive numerical and observational efforts have been dedicated to exploring the progenitor system, limited emphasis has been placed on studying the surviving companions arising from the symbiotic channel. In this paper, we present a numerical study of the symbiotic systems using {\tt MESA} as potential Type Ia supernova progenitors. We conduct 1260 binary stellar evolution simulations, over a wide range of parameters, incorporating the optically thick wind model developed by Hachisu et al., and predict the post-impact evolution of these surviving companions. We classify four types of progenitor systems based on the evolutionary stage of the companion at the onset of the explosion: red giant companions, with or without prior helium flash events, and asymptotic giant branch companions, with or without the thermal pulsing phase. After the SN impact, a blue dwarf star with either a helium or carbon-oxygen core is left behind. However, if a small portion of the envelope ($\gtrsim$ 0.3\%) remains on the core of the surviving companion, the overall post-supernova evolution may remain similar to its pre-explosion state, albeit slightly fainter, making observation a challenging endeavor.

          Time evolution of white-light flare accompanied by probable postflare loops on M-type dwarf EV Lacertae

 - **Abstract**
 White-light flares are explosive phenomena accompanied by brightening of continuum from near-ultraviolet to optical, which occur on the Sun and stars. In order to investigate the mechanism of white-light flares, we carried out simultaneous optical photometry (TESS : 6000-10000 Å) and spectroscopy (Seimei Telescope : 4100-8900 Å) of a M-dwarf EV Lac on 2019 September 14. We detected a flare with high-time-cadence ($\sim 50$ sec) spectroscopic observation. At the peak, the continuum of the flare component is well fitted by a blackbody spectrum with temperature of $T = 8122 \pm 273$ K, which is comparable with the results of previous studies that reported the spectral energy distribution of near-ultraviolet to optical during the flare could be approximated by single-temperature blackbody radiation at $T \sim 10^{4}$ K. We also estimated the time evolution of the flare temperature during the decay phase. The radiative energy of this flare within the optical range is $4.4 \times 10^{32}$ erg, taking into account the time-dependent variation in the decreasing flare temperature and expanding flare area. Furthermore, we detected a delayed increase in the flux of H$\alpha$ after the photometric flare peak, secondary increase, and gradual increase even after the white-light flare ended. Comparison of our results with light curves obtained by the Sun-as-a-star analysis of solar flares indicates that these signals may be due to postflare loops near the stellar limb. Our result about time evolution of white-light continuum will help to gain more insight into the mechanism of white-light flares both on the Sun and stars. Additionally, since extreme ultraviolet radiation from flare loops plays a key role in planetary atmospheric escape, the existence of postflare loops on stellar flares and its time evolution will help future studies about habitability of close-in planets.

 - **Abstract**
 Accurate redshift measurements are essential for studying the evolution of quasi-stellar objects (QSOs) and their role in cosmic structure formation. While spectroscopic redshifts provide high precision, they are impractical for the vast number of sources detected in large-scale surveys. Photometric redshifts, derived from broadband fluxes, offer an efficient alternative, particularly when combined with machine learning techniques. In this work, we develop and evaluate a neural network model for predicting the redshifts of QSOs in the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Early Data Release spectroscopic catalogue, using photometry from DESI, the Widefield Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) and the Galactic Evolution Explorer (GALEX). We compare the performance of the neural network model against a k-Nearest Neighbours approach, these being the most accurate and least resource-intensive of the methods trialled herein, optimising model parameters and assessing accuracy with standard statistical metrics. Our results show that incorporating ultraviolet photometry from GALEX improves photometric redshift estimates, reducing scatter and catastrophic outliers compared to models trained only on near infrared and optical bands. The neural network achieves a correlation coefficient with spectroscopic redshift of $0.9187$ with normalised median absolute deviation of $0.197$, representing a significant improvement over other methods. Our work combines DESI, WISE and GALEX measurements, providing robust predictions which address the difficulties in predicting photometric redshift of QSOs over a large redshift range.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic rays, originating from stars, supernovae, and other astrophysical sources, are composed of high-energy particles that enter Earths atmosphere. Upon interaction with atmospheric nuclei, these primary cosmic rays generate secondary particles, including neutrons, electrons, and muons, with muons constituting a dominant component at ground level. Muons, due to their relative abundance, stability, and well-characterized energy loss mechanisms, serve as critical probes for investigating the fundamental properties of cosmic rays. Studies of muon energy distribution, diurnal anisotropy, and their modulation by solar activity provide critical insights into the mechanism of particle acceleration in cosmic ray sources and the effects of solar and this http URL study aims to characterize the counting spectra and anisotropic properties of cosmic ray muons by using a plastic scintillator detector system. The experiment was conducted over a three-month period, from December 2023 to February 2024, leveraging long-bar plastic scintillator detectors equipped with dual-end photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) and a high-resolution digital data acquisition system. A dual-end coincidence measurement technique was used to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio by suppressing thermal noise and other background interferences. Diurnal variations in muon count rates exhibit a pronounced pattern, with a systematic reduction occurring between 8:00 AM and 1:00 PM. This phenomenon is attributed to the solar shielding effects, where enhanced solar activity during daytime hours modulates the flux of galactic cosmic rays reaching Earths surface. The study further corroborates these findings through cross-comparisons with data from the Yangbajing Cosmic Ray Observatory. These observations underscore the robustness of the plastic scintillator detector system for capturing detailed muon spectra and anisotropic patterns.

 - **Abstract**
 I explore models of the dust-scattered component of the Cosmic Ultraviolet Background (CUVB) at the North Galactic Pole (NGP) in order to develop a framework for calculating the dust-scattered light as a function of the optical depths. As expected, I find that the dust-scattered emission scales linearly with reddening up to $E(B-V) \approx 0.1$\ mag and derive a parametric model for this dependence. I have applied these models to fit the far-ultraviolet (1350--1800 Å) observations from the \textit{Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX)} finding that the optical constants of the interstellar dust grains -- albedo ($a$) and phase function asymmetry factor ($g$) -- are consistent with predictions from the Astrodust model ($a = 0.33$, $g = 0.68$). I detect an isotropic offset of $267 \pm 7$ ph cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ sr$^{-1}$ Å$^{-1}$, half of which remains unaccounted for by known Galactic or extragalactic sources. I will now extend my analysis to wider sky regions with the goal of generating high-resolution extinction maps.

 - **Abstract**
 Fermi-LAT observations revealed that each GeV phase-folded light-curve (aka. phaseogram) of the Crab, Geminga, Dragonfly and Vela pulsars consists of two pulses (P1 & P2) and a "Bridge" between them. There is clearly a "bump" at the Bridge phase of Vela's pulse profiles, that could also be regarded as the third pulse (P3). Differently, the Crab's, Geminga's & Dragonfly's bridges relatively resemble a "valley floor". Despite such an apparent difference, it is interesting to investigate whether their bridge emissions are still within the same general picture as Vela's. Assuming the north-south symmetry, we would expect the fourth component (Bridge2/P4) to exist as well. However, such a hypothetical Bridge2/P4 is not intuitively identified on $\gamma$-ray phaseograms of the Crab, Geminga, Dragonfly and Vela pulsars. It is also intriguing to hint at the rationale for the non-discovery of Bridge2/P4. Our prototypical toy model is free of assumptions on emission regions or radiation mechanisms. Instead, it assumes a north-south symmetric geometry and one circularly symmetric beam per hemisphere, while taking into account Doppler shifts (the most innovative element), time delays and energy-dependent beam shapes. Tentative compatibility of our fitting results with wind models is reported. Notably, for the Crab pulsar, we found a preliminary qualitative correlation between our model predictions and the IXPE results on X-ray polarisation. The softer $\gamma$-ray pulsation of the Geminga pulsar is found to span over its full phase. Prompted by systematic evaluations, we outline some potential improvements for our toy model.

          Resurgence of CO in a warm bubble around accreting protoplanets and its observability

 - **Abstract**
 The cold outer regions of protoplanetary disks are expected to contain a midplane-centered layer in which gas-phase CO molecules freeze-out and their overall abundance is low. The layer then manifests itself as a void in the channel maps of CO rotational emission lines. We explore whether the frozen-out layer can expose the circumplanetary environment of embedded accreting protoplanets to observations. To this end, we performed 3D radiative gas-dust hydrodynamic simulations, directly linking opacities and optical depths to the redistribution of sub-$\mu$m- and mm-sized dust grains. A Jupiter-mass planet with accretion luminosity $\sim$$10^{-3}\,L_{\odot}$ was considered as the nominal case. The accretion heating sustains a warm bubble around the planet, locally increasing the abundance of gas-phase CO molecules. Radiative transfer predictions of the emergent sky images show that the bubble becomes a conspicuous CO emission source in channel maps, appearing as a low-intensity optically thick spot located in-between the `dragonfly wings' that trace the foreside and backside line-forming surfaces. The emission intensity of the bubble is nearly independent of the tracing isotopologue, suggesting a very rich observable chemistry, as long as its signal can be deblended from the extended disk emission. This can be achieved with isotopologues that are optically thin or weakly thermally stratified across the planet-induced gap, such as C$^{18}$O. For those, the bubble stands out as the brightest residual in synthetic ALMA observations after subtraction of axially-averaged channel maps inferred from the disk kinematics, enabling new automatic detections of forming protoplanets. By contrast, the horseshoe flow steadily depletes large dust grains from the circumplanetary environment which becomes unobservable in the sub-mm continuum, in accordance with the scarcity of ALMA detections.

          Constraints on Cosmologically Coupled Black Holes from Planck 2018 and Other Cosmological Probes

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmologically coupled black holes (CCBHs) are alternative black hole models whose masses evolve as $M \propto a^3$ on cosmological scales. This characteristic suggests that CCBHs could contribute to the accelerated expansion of the Universe. In this paper, I consider a CCBH model in which the cosmological constant is effectively induced, while the baryonic mass is conserved within conventional black holes. This model is motivated by the theoretical framework of Schwarzschild - de Sitter black holes. Assuming that the accelerated cosmic expansion is caused by CCBHs, I perform a cosmological parameter estimation using datasets including Planck 2018 CMB, CMB lensing, BAO, and supernovae. The analysis reveals notable shifts in cosmological parameters, such as $H_0 = 72.24^{+0.34}_{-0.35} \mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$, compared to the standard $\Lambda \mathrm{CDM}$. My $H_0$ constraint is consistent with the value $H_0 = 73.04 \pm 1.04 \mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$ reported by SH0ES within $1 \sigma$. However, the overall fit to the data worsens, with a total $\chi^2 = 2884.12$ for the CCBH model, compared to $\chi^2 = 2836.12$ for the $\Lambda$CDM model. I show that the effect of cosmological coupling is suppressed by a factor of $10^{-16}$ at $\sim$pc scales, rendering it negligible compared to the standard black hole mass in local astrophysical phenomena, although the CCBH model can explain the accelerated expansion.

 - **Abstract**
 Based on a 10 years sample of gamma-ray flares of FSRQs collected with FERMI and AGILE, I report on this proceeding the advance on a statistical study of variability for a sample of more than 300 FSRQs. I will focus on waiting time between flares (defined as the time intervals between consecutive activity peaks (Pacciani 2022). The investigation revealed that gamma-ray activity can be modeled with overlapping bursts of flares, with flares uniformly distributed within each burst, and a typical burst rate of 0.6 y$^{-1}$. Moreover, a statistically relevant fast component with timescale of order of days is revealed. From these results, constraints on flares emission mechanisms were derived. I also discuss the preliminary results on an investigation of flares luminosity and duration in gamma-rays. A Simple fitting model is shown, correlating peak luminosity and duration of gamma-ray flares (paper in preparation).

 - **Abstract**
 The Solar Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (SUIT) observes the Sun in the near-ultraviolet regime on board the Aditya-L1 satellite, India's dedicated mission to study the Sun. SUIT will image the Sun in the wavelength range of 200-400 nm using 11 science bandpasses with varying spectral bandwidths between 0.1-58 nm. Within this range, the Sun provides huge incoming solar flux to the telescope that also varies by a factor of ~ 20 from the lower end to the upper end of the wavelength band of interest. Thermal Filter Assembly (TFA) is an optical component at the SUIT entrance aperture, directly facing the Sun. The TFA is used to control the heat load entering the telescope cavity and also to reduce the signal reaching the SUIT camera system and the charge-coupled device (CCD) sensor, which is limited in full-well capacity and the linear operational regime. The TFA is designed to allow only 0.1-0.45% of the incoming flux to pass within 200-400 nm. The choice of materials for substrate and coating for the filter poses several challenges in terms of contamination, corrosion/ oxidation and durability during the manufacturing process. Additionally, long-term exposure to harsh space environments and the formation of pinholes are other concerns. Direct exposure to the sun leads to a strong temperature gradient along the thickness of the filter. The design and assembly of the TFA are performed to avoid any thermo-elastic stress affecting optical performance. Different levels of qualification tests and the operation of SUIT in orbit for more than 14 months have confirmed the perfect working of the TFA. To the best of our knowledge, the design, development, and testing of such a rejection filter is the first of its kind for space telescopes in the near ultraviolet range.

          Modelling delta Scuti pulsations: A new grid of p, g, and f modes across pre-main-sequence to post-main-sequence evolution

 - **Abstract**
 Space-based photometry from missions such as TESS has revealed that many young delta Scuti stars exhibit regular high-frequency pulsation patterns. These pulsations provide a powerful means of inferring stellar properties, particularly ages, for pre-main-sequence and early main-sequence delta Scuti stars, for which traditional age-dating methods are poorly constrained. Realising this potential requires robust theoretical models that capture the complexities of stellar structure and evolution. We present a comprehensive grid of 30 million stellar pulsation models, computed using the MESA stellar evolution code and the GYRE oscillation code, tailored specifically to delta Scuti stars. The grid spans a wide range of masses, metallicities, and surface rotation velocities, and covers evolutionary phases from the early pre-main-sequence through the main sequence and into the post-main-sequence contraction phase. For each model, we compute hundreds of adiabatic pulsation frequencies for degrees l = 0-3, capturing p-modes, g-modes, f-modes, and their interactions through avoided crossings. Our analysis maps the behaviour of asteroseismic observables, including the large frequency separation (Delta nu) and the phase offset parameter (epsilon), across age, mass, and rotation. We investigate how these parameters change with evolutionary stage and revisit the scaling relations applicable to delta Scuti stars. This new model grid, which is publicly available, is designed to support the asteroseismology community in interpreting delta Scuti pulsations and in probing the evolution and internal structure of these stars. These improvements over previous model grids will allow for reliable age estimates and stronger constraints on stellar evolution pathways and the timing of planet formation across A- and F-type stellar populations.

 - **Abstract**
 We aim to deepen our understanding of the M-L transition on planetary-mass companions and isolated brown dwarfs, and search for evidence of possible differences between these two populations of objects. To this end, we present a set of 21 VLT/SINFONI K-band observations from five archival programs at a spectral resolution of 4000. We aim to measure atmospheric properties, such as temperature, surface gravity, and metallicity, to understand the similarities and differences between objects ranging from M5 to L5 in spectral type. We extracted the spectra of these targets with the TExTRIS code. Subsequently, we model them using ForMoSA, a Bayesian forward modeling tool for spectral analysis, exploring four families of self-consistent atmospheric models: ATMO, BT-Settl, Exo-REM, and Sonora. Here we present the spectra of our targets and the derived parameters from the atmospheric modeling. We observed a drop in effective temperature of more than 500 K as a function of spectral type at the M/L transition, likely related to limitations in the current atmospheric models. In addition, we report carbon-to-oxygen ratio measurements for three companions (2M 0103 AB b, AB Pic b, and CD-35 2722 b), which contribute to the growing list of exoplanets for which this value has been measured. In conclusion, the VLT/SINFONI Library highlights two key points. First, there is a critical need to further investigate the discrepancies among grids of spectra generated by self-consistent models, as these models yield varying results and do not uniformly explore the parameter space. Second, we do not observe apparent discrepancies in the K-band spectra between companions and isolated brown dwarfs, which potentially suggests that these super-Jupiter objects formed through a similar process; however, this warrants further investigation.

 - **Abstract**
 We show that multi-field inflationary models with negligible turning in field space during inflation can lead to an effective sourcing of adiabatic from entropic perturbations {\it after} the end of inflation. We illustrate this general phenomenon with a detailed analysis of an inflationary model whose scalar potential is determined by modular invariance. Its entropic perturbations are frozen during inflation, but instead, they are converted into adiabatic perturbations in the first post-inflationary $e$-folds. The curvature power spectrum, giving rise to CMB fluctuations, reaches a novel and enhanced plateau in this process; we address the implications for the inflationary observables $A_{s}$, $n_{s}$ and $r$.

 - **Abstract**
 The processes governing the production of astrophysical high-energy neutrinos are still debated, and the sources originating them remain an open question. Among the putative emitters, active galactic nuclei have gained increasing attention. Blazars, in particular, stand out due to their ability to accelerate particles in environments with external radiation fields. Recent observations suggest they may contribute to the neutrino flux detected by IceCube. We study the physical properties of a subsample of 52 blazars proposed as candidate neutrino emitters, based on a positional cross-correlation analysis between IceCube hotspots and the 5BZCat catalog. We aim to provide a first characterization of their central engines and physical nature, to explore the potential link with neutrino production. We analyze the optical spectroscopic properties of the 52 candidate neutrino-emitter blazars to infer their accretion regime. The study is complemented by radio and $\gamma$-ray data, which trace the intrinsic jet power. We compare the sample to other blazar populations in the literature, perform statistical tests, and explore, through simulations, the applicability of methods that include censored data. Overall, the target sample shows properties compatible with the reference samples. We observe a mild tendency to prefer objects with intense radiation fields, typical of radiatively efficient accretors, and high radio power. Among them, 24 are detected by Fermi-LAT, spanning various $\gamma$-ray luminosities. We also show that statistical tests commonly used in the literature need to be handled with caution, as they are sensitive to the number of censored data and the sample size.

          On Dust Devil Diameters, Occurrence Rates, and Activity

 - **Abstract**
 As a phenomenon that occurs on Earth and on Mars, the diameter of a dust devil helps determine the amount of dust the devil injects into the atmosphere for both worlds -- for a given dust flux density (dust lifted per area per time), a wider devil will lift more dust into the air. However, the factors that determine a dust devil's diameter $D$ and how it might relate to ambient conditions have remained unclear. Moreover, estimating the contribution to an atmospheric dust budget from a population of dust devils with a range of diameters requires an accurate assessment of the differential diameter distribution, but considerable work has yet to reveal the best representation or explain its physical basis. In this study, we propose that this distribution follows a power-law $\propto D^{-5/3}$ and provide a simple physical explanation for why the distribution takes this form. By fitting diameter distributions of martian dust devil diameters reported in several studies, we show that the data from several studies support this proposed form. Using a previous model that treats dust devils as thermodynamic heat engines, we also show that the areal density of dust devils (number per unit area) $N_0$ scales with the product of their thermodynamic efficiency $\eta$ and the sensible heat flux $F_{\rm s}$ as $N_0 \propto \eta F_{\rm s}$.

 We perform a comprehensive wide-band ($3-100$keV) spectro-temporal analysis of 13 outbursting BH-XRBs, using data (quasi)simultaneous with radio observations to unravel the complex disc-jet connection. RXTE observations are analyzed for XTEJ1859+226, GX339-4 (2002, 2006, and 2010 outbursts), 4U1543-47, H1743-322 (2003 and 2009 outbursts), XTEJ1550-564, XTEJ1752-223, XTEJ1650-500, SwiftJ1753.5-0127, XTEJ1748-288, and GROJ1655-40. For SwiftJ1727.8-1613 and MAXIJ1535-571, we utilize HXMT data, while both AstroSat and HXMT observations are analyzed for SwiftJ1658.2-4242. Type-C QPOs observed in harder states (LHS, HIMS; $F_{nth}\ge0.4$) exhibit positive lag for low-inclination sources ($i<50^{\circ}$), whereas it generally exhibits negative lag for high-inclination sources ($i>60^{\circ}$), except XTEJ1550-564, SwiftJ1727.8-1613, H1743-322 (2003 outburst) and GROJ1655-40. Notably, type-A QPOs exhibit negative lags ($\sim1-10$ms) regardless of source inclination, while type-B QPOs show positive lags in low-inclination sources, and both positive and negative lags ($\sim1-15$ms) in high-inclination sources, typically occurring in SIMS ($F_{nth}\lesssim0.45$). Systematic appearance of type-A QPOs preceding radio flares in several sources suggests that type-A QPOs indicate telltale signs of jet ejection, while type-B QPOs are closely linked with radio flares (i.e., transient jets). Present findings suggest the corona evolves from a radially extended to a vertically elongated structure during the type-C to type-B transition via type-A QPOs, with type-B QPOs linked to radially compact or vertically extended coronal geometries, resembling jet ejection. The strong radio-X-ray luminosity correlation seems to provide compelling evidence of accretion-powered jets. Finally, we find that jets in SIMS are moderately relativistic in nature with velocities $\gtrsim 0.3-0.8c$ in BH-XRBs under consideration.

 - **Abstract**
 I present an analysis of archival spectra of 200 sources toward the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) that were obtained with the Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) on board the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). I have used these data to assess cluster membership and measure spectral types for the targets. Fifty-three sources are classified as likely cluster members, 24 of which have spectral types that are suggestive of brown dwarfs ($>$M6). Seven of the NIRSpec targets were previously identified as "Jupiter-mass binary objects" (JuMBOs), all of which are background sources rather than brown dwarfs based on the NIRSpec data. The spectral classifications of those objects are consistent with the results of my recent study of the JWST photometry in the ONC, which found that only a few JuMBO components have the colors expected for brown dwarfs, none of which form pairs that have uniquely wide separations or low masses relative to known binary brown dwarfs.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent measurements of cosmogenic $^{10}$Be in deep-ocean ferromanganese crusts from the Central and Northern Pacific have revealed an anomalous concentration between 11.5 and 9.0 Myr ago, peaking at 10.1 Myr. One possible explanation is a nearby supernova (SN) event. Motivated by this and by the proximity of the Solar System to the Orion star-forming region during that period, we estimate the probability that at least one SN occurred between the onset and peak of the anomaly. Using an open cluster catalog based on Gaia DR3, we trace back the orbits of 2725 clusters and the Sun over the past 20 Myr and compute the expected number of SN events. We find 19 clusters with a probability greater than 1% each of producing at least one SN within 100 pc of the Sun in the time interval 11.5-10.1 Myr ago. The total cumulative probability exceeds zero at 35 pc from the Sun and increases rapidly with distance, reaching 68% near 100 pc. Two young clusters dominate the SN probability: ASCC 20 contributes most within 70 pc, while OCSN 61 becomes more significant beyond that distance. Our results support the plausibility of a SN origin for the $^{10}$Be anomaly and highlight the importance of additional $^{10}$Be records from independent terrestrial archives to determine whether the anomaly is of astrophysical or terrestrial origin.

 We have located archival observations of the centaur 2015 OU$_{194}$ from 2017 and 2018, which extend its data-arc length from 1.0 to 3.5 years. We show that it is in an outer $3:4$ mean motion resonance with Uranus, henceforth referred to as U$_{3/4}$. The resonance is stable from at least 1000 kyrs in the past till 500 kyrs in the future. We find no mention in the literature of known objects in this resonance, or in any other resonance between the orbits of Uranus and Neptune. Looking for additional candidates, we find that 2013 RG$_{98}$ also stays in U$_{3/4}$ for several hundred kyrs around the present epoch. A third candidate, 2014 NX$_{65}$, is strongly influenced by Neptune.

 Context. The dust and gas temperature in proto-planetary disks play critical roles in determining their chemical evolution and influencing planet formation processes. Aims. We attempted an accurate measurement of the dust and CO temperature profile in the edge-on disk of the Flying Saucer. Methods. We used the unique properties of the Flying Saucer, its edge-on geometry and its fortunate position in front of CO clouds with different brightness temperatures to provide independent constraints on the dust temperature. We compared it with the dust temperature derived using the radiative transfer code DiskFit and the CO gas temperature. Results. We find clear evidence for a substantial gas temperature vertical gradient, with a cold (10 K) disk mid-plane and a warmer CO layer where T(r) is 27 K at 100 au, dropping with exponent 0.3. Direct evidence for CO depletion in the mid-plane, below about 1 scale height, is also found. At this height, the gas temperature is 15-20 K, consistent with the expected CO freeze out temperature. The dust disk appears optically thin at 345 GHz, and exhibits moderate settling.

          Evaluating an Embryo Origin for Detached TNOs within Full Kuiper Belt Formation Models

 - **Abstract**
 With perihelia well beyond Neptune, but semimajor axes and eccentricities indicative of substantial perturbation, the origins of detached trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) remain a dynamical puzzle. In particular, detached TNOs with orbital inclinations below ~25 degrees are not easily generated from any known mechanism currently in the modern solar system. One notable hypothesis for the origins of detached TNOs is that a ~Mars- to Earth-mass planetary embryo detached the perihelia of these objects from Neptune during the process of Kuiper belt formation before the embryo itself was ejected. We numerically model this scenario via simulations of Kuiper belt formation from a primordial planetesimal belt that is dispersed through the migration of the giant planets. In addition to ~100,000 Kuiper belt objects, each of our simulations contains a hypothetical population of embryos in the primordial belt. We find that our embryos are unlikely to reach the high-perihelion, large semimajor axis orbit necessary to efficiently detach TNO perihelia from Neptune's influence. Moreover, embryos will typically take at least 100 Myrs to reach these unlikely orbits, at which point most of the primordial belt will have already been ejected by the planets, limiting the available population that can be detached. Finally, the TNOs that our embryos do detach consistently have a semimajor axis distribution that is more biased toward small values than observed detached TNOs have. Thus, we conclude that planetary embryos in the primordial Kuiper belt are not likely to have been the primary mechanism for the origin of detached TNOs.

          Deep Potential: Recovering the gravitational potential and local pattern speed in the solar neighborhood with GDR3 using normalizing flows

 - **Abstract**
 The gravitational potential of the Milky Way encodes information about the distribution of all matter -- including dark matter -- throughout the Galaxy. Gaia data release 3 has revealed a complex structure that necessitates flexible models of the Galactic gravitational potential. We make use of a sample of 5.6 million upper-main-sequence stars to map the full 3D gravitational potential in a one-kiloparsec radius from the Sun using a data-driven approach called ``Deep Potential''. This method makes minimal assumptions about the dynamics of the Galaxy -- that the stars are a collisionless system that is statistically stationary in a rotating frame (with pattern speed to be determined). We model the distribution of stars in 6D phase space using a normalizing flow and the gravitational network using a neural network. We recover a local pattern speed of $\Omega_p = 28.2\pm0.1\mathrm{\,km/s/kpc}$, a local total matter density of $\rho=0.086\pm0.010\mathrm{\,M_\odot/pc^3}$ and local dark matter density of $\rho_\mathrm{DM}=0.007\pm0.011\mathrm{\,M_\odot/pc^3}$. The full 3D model exhibits spatial fluctuations, which may stem from the model architecture and non-stationarity in the Milky Way.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding how the dynamical state of the interstellar medium (ISM) changes across spatial scales can provide important insights into how the gas is organized and ultimately collapses to form stars. To this end, we present ALMA $^{12}\mathrm{CO}(2-1)$ observations at $7$ pc ($0.4''$) spatial resolution across a $1.4~\mathrm{kpc}\times5.6~\mathrm{kpc}$ ($1'.3\times1'.3$) region located in the disk of the nearby ($D = 3.5$ Mpc), massive, star-forming galaxy NGC 253. We decompose this emission with a hierarchical, multiscale dendrogram algorithm to identify 2463 structures with deconvolved sizes ranging from $\sim3$ to $300$ pc, complete to a limiting mass of $10^4~\mathrm{M_\odot}$. By comparing the virial parameter of these structures against physical properties including size, mass, surface density, velocity dispersion, and hierarchical position, we carry out a comprehensive search for a preferred scale at which gravitationally bound structures emerge. Ultimately, we do not identify any emergent scale for bound objects in our data, nor do we find a correlation between the virial parameter and structure sizes. These findings suggest that gravitational binding cannot be used to define molecular clouds and emphasize the need for multiscale approaches to characterize the ISM.

 - **Abstract**
 The spectral resolution ($R \equiv \lambda / \Delta \lambda$) of spectroscopic data is crucial information for accurate kinematic measurements. In this letter, we present a robust measurement of the spectral resolution for the JWST's Near Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) in all its modes: fixed slit (FS), integral field spectroscopy (IFS), and multi-object spectroscopy (MOS). We modeled H and He lines of the planetary nebula SMP LMC 58 using a Gaussian line spread function (LSF) to estimate the wavelength-dependent resolution for multiple disperser and filter combinations. We corrected for the intrinsic width of the planetary nebula's H and He lines due to its expansion velocity by measuring it from a higher-resolution X-shooter spectrum. We find that NIRSpec's in-flight spectral resolutions exceed the pre-launch estimates provided in the JWST User Documentation by 5-45% across all the configurations and covered wavelengths. We recover the expected trend that the resolution increases with the wavelength within a configuration. The robust and accurate LSFs presented in this letter will enable high-accuracy kinematic measurements using NIRSpec for applications in cosmology and galaxy evolution.

          Shot noise in clustering power spectra

 - **Abstract**
 We show that the `shot noise' bias in angular clustering power spectra observed from discrete samples of points is not noise, but rather a known additive contribution that naturally arises due to degenerate pairs of points. In particular, we show that the true shot noise contribution cannot have a `non-Poissonian' value, even though all point processes with non-trivial two-point statistics are non-Poissonian. Apparent deviations from the `Poissonian' value can arise when significant correlations or anti-correlations are localised on small spatial scales. However, such deviations always correspond to a physical difference in two-point statistics, not a difference in noise. In the context of simulations, if clustering is treated as the tracer of a discretised underlying density field, any sub- or super-Poissonian sampling of the tracer induces such small-scale modifications and vice versa; we show this explicitly using recent innovations in angular power spectrum estimation from discrete catalogues. Finally, we show that the full covariance of clustering power spectra can also be computed explicitly: it depends only on the two-, three- and four-point statistics of the point process. The usual Gaussian covariance approximation appears as one term in the shot noise contribution, which is non-diagonal even for Gaussian random fields and Poisson sampling.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a science case for the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) to map the circumgalactic medium (CGM) in emission by targeting ultraviolet emission lines, which trace the 10^4 - 10^6 K gas engaged in the feedback and accretion mechanisms driving galaxy evolution. While the CGM-galaxy connection is clearly evident through absorption line experiments and limited work done in optical and radio emission from the ground, the nature of this connection is poorly understood with regard to how these cosmic ecosystems exchange matter and energy. We outline a two-pronged experiment with Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) utilizing both multi-object spectroscopy to map kpc-scale CGM structures such as galactic superwinds and integral field spectroscopy to unveil the sub-kpc-scale processes such as thermal instabilities, which are theorized to govern the cool gas reservoirs long detected in pencil-beam absorption surveys. This article is an adaptation of a science case document developed by HWO's CGM/IGM Working Group.

 - **Abstract**
 Our Earth, being the only living planet that we know, provides us with clues that photosynthetic life-forms may be dominant on other exoplanets for billions of years. Spectropolarimetric signatures of the terrestrial photosynthetic life (PSLife) are well studied in the lab and remotely sensed with space and airborne instrumentation. An astonishing biosignature revealed by these measurements is an extremely strong linear polarization (tens \%) associated with broad absorption bands of biological pigments (biopigments) driving photosynthesis in various organisms. Also, unique circular-polarization signatures are associated with biopigments and other complex macromolecules as a sign of homochirality which is ubiquitous in terrestrial life forms. Thus, low-resolution spectro- or multi-band polarimetry of exoplanets directly imaged at an unprecedented contrast using the HWO coronagraph is a novel opportunity for a robust discovery of life on exoplanets. Here we propose to carry out two surveys and two follow-up observing programs. Survey 1 will identify potentially habitable planets (PHPs) through detection of atmospheres, clouds and liquid surface water (ocean) using linear polarimetry. Survey 2 will identify Living World (LW) candidates among PHPs by searching for strong linear polarization signatures associated with strong and broad absorption bands reminiscent of terrestrial biopigments. Follow-up program 3 will obtain multi-color surface maps of LWs, determine the distribution and abundance of alien photosynthetic organisms with exo-biopigments (exoBPs) and correlate their properties with the atmospheric and surface compositions. Follow-up program 4 will employ circular polarization to verify homochirality of exoBPs. This comprehensive approach aims at providing a quantitative answer to the ultimate question "Are we are alone in the Universe?".

 - **Abstract**
 The standard formation model of close-in low-mass planets involves efficient inward migration followed by growth through giant impacts after the protoplanetary gas disk disperses. While detailed N-body simulations have enhanced our understanding, their high computational cost limits statistical comparisons with observations. In our previous work, we introduced a semi-analytical model to track the dynamical evolution of multiple planets through gravitational scattering and giant impacts after the gas disk dispersal. Although this model successfully reproduced N -body simulation results under various initial conditions, our validation was still limited to cases with compact, equally-spaced planetary systems. In this paper, we improve our model to handle more diverse planetary systems characterized by broader variations in planetary masses, semi-major axes, and orbital separations and validate it against recent planet population synthesis results. Our enhanced model accurately reproduces the mass distribution and orbital architectures of the final planetary systems. Thus, we confirm that the model can predict the outcomes of post-gas disk dynamical evolution across a wide range of planetary system architectures, which is crucial for reducing the computational cost of planet formation simulations.

 We report the results of our long-term multiwavelength spectral energy distribution (SED) study on the flat spectrum radio quasar 3C 279 during the $\sim14$ years (2008--2022) of {\sl Fermi}-LAT (Large Area Telescope) observing period. The {\sl Fermi}-LAT data were complemented with data in other wavebands obtained from {\sl Swift}-XRT/UVOT, Whole Earth Blazar Telescope (WEBT), along with other optical and radio data from several observatories. Different activity states were identified from the weekly binned $\gamma$-ray light curve, and it was possible to create 168 high-quality and quasi-simultaneous broadband SEDs. We modeled the SEDs using a one-zone leptonic scenario, including the emission region outside the broad-line region (BLR), involving synchrotron, synchrotron self-Compton, and external Compton mechanisms. Such extensive broadband modeling is essential for constraining the underlying multiwavelength radiative mechanisms in the 3C 279 jet and permits to estimate the physical parameters and explore their evolution in time. Our SED modeling study suggests that the increase in the Doppler beaming factor along with the variation of the emitting electrons is the cause for the flares in this source. The multiwavelength emission of 3C 279 was found to be well explained by the scenario in which the emission region is outside the BLR at a distance of $\sim6.42\times10^{3} R_S$. However, for two of the very bright $\gamma$-ray states, the emission region was found to be close to the outer boundary of the BLR at a distance of $\sim1.28\times10^{3} R_S$ from the central black hole.

          The virial factor $f$ of the H$β$ Broad-line for NGC 5548 and NGC 4151

 - **Abstract**
 The variability of virial factor $f$ is investigated for two active galactic nucleus, NGC 5548 and NGC 4151, which had been previously reverberation mapped (RM) over 20 times in the past 30 years. Using four velocity tracers from the broad H$\beta$ width at half-maximum ($\rm FWHM_{\rm H\beta} $) or the line dispersion from the mean or rms spectra, $f$ for each RM epoch are calculated. Significant correlations are found between $f$ and observational parameters, such as the broad line widths, the Eddington ratios and the line profile shapes. For NGC 5548, $f \propto \rm {FWHM}_{mean}^{-0.70\pm0.13}$ and for NGC 4151, $f \propto \rm {FWHM}_{mean}^{-3.31\pm0.59}$. This suggests that a variable $f$ should be included to weight the virial SMBH mass. Using a simple model of thick-disc broad line regions (BLRs), we show that changes in mean inclination can explain $f$ variation. The inclination range is $14.1-40.6$ deg for NGC 5548 and $14.0-55.1$ deg for NGC 4151. Modeling the light curves of $f$ with a damped random walk process yields mean timescales of 638 and 668 days, consistent with BLR dynamical timescales within uncertainties. This indicates that $f$ variations are linked to BLR dynamics, likely due to changes in geometry or inclination.

 - **Abstract**
 The Lane-Emden equation, a nonlinear second-order ordinary differential equation, plays a fundamental role in theoretical physics and astrophysics, particularly in modeling the structure of stellar interiors. Also referred to as the polytropic differential equation, it describes the behavior of self-gravitating polytropic spheres. In this study, we present a novel approach to the solution of the eigenvalue problem which arises when considering the Lane-Emden equation for n = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). The novelty of this work is that, we not only solve the Lane-Emden equation via PINNS but we also determine the eigenvalue, r, which is the stellar radius. Hyperparameter tuning was conducted using Bayesian optimization in the Optuna framework to identify optimal values for the number of hidden layers, number of neurons, activation function, optimizer, and learning rate for each value of n. The results show that, for n = 0, 1, PINNs achieve near-exact agreement with theoretical eigenvalues (errors < 0.000806%). While for more nonlinear cases, n = 2, 3 and n=4, PINNs yield errors below 0.0009% and 0.05% respectively, validating their robustness.

 This study explores transient quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in the $\gamma$-ray emission of two blazars, PMN J0531$-$4827 and PKS 1502+106, using over a decade of Fermi Large Area Telescope observations. The analysis focuses on identifying QPO signatures in their long-term light curves and interpreting the variability through a curved jet model, which predicts multiplicative oscillations with exponentially decaying amplitudes. We develop an analysis methodology to characterize the QPO and the specific properties of the amplitude of such QPOs. The findings offer insights into the dynamic processes driving relativistic jet evolution and their potential connections to underlying mechanisms, such as binary systems or other phenomena influencing the observed characteristics of these blazars.

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of the terrestrial water remains debated, as standard Solar System formation models suggest that Earth formed from dry grains, inside the snowline of the Proto-Solar Nebula (PSN). Here, we revisit this issue through the lens of computational chemistry. While the classically used snowline relies on a single condensation temperature, recent work in quantum chemistry shows that the binding energy of water on icy grains has a gaussian distribution, which implies a gradual sublimation of water rather than a sharp transition. We use the computed distribution of binding energies to estimate the radial distribution of adsorbed ice on the dust grains across the PSN protoplanetary disk. Our model reproduces the full range of estimated water abundances on Earth and matches the hydration trends observed in chondrite groups at their predicted formation distances. Thus, we suggest that a significant fraction of Earth's water may have been acquired locally at early stages of the Solar System formation, without requiring delivery from beyond the classical snowline.

          A systematic study of binary neutron star merger rate density history using simulated gravitational wave and short gamma-ray burst observations

 - **Abstract**
 Measuring the merger rate density history of binary neutron stars (BNS) can greatly aid in understanding the history of heavy element formation in the Universe. Currently, second-generation Gravitational Wave (GW) detectors can only measure the BNS merger rate density history at low redshifts ($z$ $\sim$ 0.1). Short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs) may trace the BNS merger to higher redshifts ($z$ $\sim$ 3). However, not all BNS mergers result in sGRBs, and it is not certain that all sGRBs originate from BNS mergers. In this study, we simultaneously utilize simulated BNS merger GW signals detected by the advanced LIGO design and sGRB signals detected by {\it Fermi}/GBM to constrain the BNS merger rate density history up to $z$ $\sim$ 3. The results indicate that with $\sim$ 8 GWs and 571 sGRBs, the BNS merger rate density can be measured with an accuracy of about 50\% through $z=0$ to $z=1$. The ratio of the jet opening angle-corrected sGRB event rate density to the BNS merger rate density, denoted as $\eta$, can be constrained to a relative uncertainty of 45\%. With $\sim$ 21 GWs and 761 sGRBs, the BNS merger rate density can be measured to approximately 35\% and 40\% at $z=0$ and $z=1$, respectively. Meanwhile, $\eta$ can be constrained to a relative uncertainty of 28\%. Additionally, in our parameterized simulation, we find that at least approximately $\sim$550 sGRBs are needed to constrain the characteristic delay time in the star formation rate model, given a relative error of 50\% in the estimated redshift.

          Metallicities of M Dwarf Planet Host Stars from Kepler, K2, and TESS observed by APOGEE: Trends with Exoplanetary Radii and Orbital Periods

 - **Abstract**
 One important property in studying the exoplanet population is the host star metallicity ([M/H]). In this study, we derived stellar metallicities and oxygen abundances for 45 M dwarf stars (with 65 exoplanets) using the near-infrared high-resolution spectra from the SDSS APOGEE survey and synthetic spectra computed in LTE. We also investigated the exoplanetary radii distribution for a larger sample of 246 exoplanets orbiting 188 M dwarf stars. The [M/H] versus [O/M] distribution obtained indicates that our sample is composed mainly of thin disk stars, which follow the behavior of the low-alpha sequence in the Milky Way thin disk. Small planets with radii smaller than 3R$_{\oplus}$ were found around stars with a range of metallicities (-0.6$<$[M/H]$<$+0.3), while larger planets of the sample orbit only stars with [M/H]$>=0.0$. These results indicate that while small planets can form in different environments, larger planets preferentially form in metal-rich protoplanetary disks. Exoplanets with P$_{\rm orb}<$4.3 days orbit on average more metal-rich stars than planets with longer periods. This threshold is smaller than that found for FGK stars (8--10 days) and might be related to M dwarfs having a smaller dust sublimation radius. The distribution of exoplanets with R$_{\rm p}>$4R$_{\oplus}$ shows a concentration at orbital periods between 2 and 5 days, which may result from inward orbital migration. There is also a different behavior between single-detected exoplanets and planets from multiplanetary systems, with the latter being found on average around more metal-poor stars, and with orbital periods roughly up to 3 days.

          Siberian radioheliograph image classification using ensemble of CLIP, EfficientNet and CatBoost models

 - **Abstract**
 The Siberian Radioheliograph (SRH) is a ground-based radio interferometer in Irkutsk, Russia, designed for high-resolution solar observations in the microwave range. It can observe dynamic solar events with spatial resolutions of 7-30 arcseconds and temporal resolution up to 0.1 seconds. Generating solar radio images from the Siberian Radioheliograph (SRH) is a multi-step calibration process that corrects instrumental and atmospheric distortions, using redundancy-based calibration with both adjacent and non-adjacent antenna pairs to address phase and amplitude errors in visibility data. The CLEAN algorithm is then applied to deconvolve the point spread function, reduce sidelobes, and enhance the visibility of solar features, resulting in higher quality and more reliable images. While the calibration process generally improves image quality, it can sometimes result in noisy or spatially shifted images that are not suitable for scientific use. We developed a deep learning approach for automatic image quality classification. The training dataset was prepared using a zero-shot CLIP model and further validated manually. We evaluated four different models: a fine-tuned EfficientNet, two CatBoost variants using embeddings from CLIP and EfficientNet, and an Ensemble model that combined predictions from all three individual models. The Ensemble model achieved the best performance.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a torsion-based cosmological model within the Einstein-Cartan framework, analyze it using combined DESI, PantheonPlus/DESY5, and CMB datasets, a reveals several interesting features. The torsion parameter $\alpha$ shows a trend of change from $\alpha=0.042^{+0.035}_{-0.031}$ (CMB alone) to $\alpha=-0.0075\pm0.0058$ (full dataset), while remaining consistent with zero within $1.7\sigma$. The model demonstrates potential in addressing cosmological tensions, yielding $H_0 = 68.80\pm0.48~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$ and reducing the $S_8$ tension from $0.73\sigma$ to $0.1\sigma$ through its torsion-modified growth equation. Bayesian evidence analysis shows a clear preference for torsion cosmology in most dataset combinations, with the notable exception of CMB+DESI+DESY5 which slightly favors $\Lambda$CDM. Remarkably, substituting DESY5 with PantheonPlus data reverses this preference, yielding $\Delta\log\mathcal{Z} = -3.59$ - a strong indication of the model's viability. While not conclusive, these findings suggest torsion cosmology merits further investigation as a potential extension to $\Lambda$CDM.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the wavevector and variance anisotropies in the inertial range of the young solar wind observed by the Parker Solar Probe (PSP). Using the first 19 encounters of PSP measurements, we identify the young solar wind from different source regions: coronal hole (CH) interiors, streamers, and low Mach-number boundary layers (LMBLs), i.e., the peripheral region inside CHs. We assess the wavevector anisotropy with the 2D and slab turbulence model for the CH wind and the streamer wind, and the nearly incompressible (NI) MHD turbulence model for the LMBL wind where Taylor's hypothesis becomes questionable. Unlike the $\sim80\%$ 2D contribution typically reported at 1 au, our results show that only $26\%$ of the inertial range energy is associated with 2D fluctuations in the CH wind, and this fraction increases to $45\%$ in the streamer wind. As a representation of the LMBL wind, similarly, the oblique sub-Alfvénic intervals and the near-subsonic intervals are characterized by the dominance of slab fluctuations. All the results suggest that slab fluctuations are more abundant in the young solar wind below 0.3 au than at 1 au. Furthermore, we find a dependence of the variance anisotropy in the inertial range on proton plasma beta $\beta_p$. The variance anisotropy is the strongest in the LMBL wind with the lowest $\beta_p$, and the weakest in the streamer wind with the highest $\beta_p$. This contrast can be interpreted as the remnant of fluctuations from the coronal sources.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the Rossiter-McLaughlin measurement of the sub-Neptune TOI-1759A b with MAROON-X. A joint analysis with MuSCAT3 photometry and nine additional TESS transits produces a sky-projected obliquity of $|\lambda|$= $4^\circ\pm18^{\circ}$. We also derive a true obliquity of $\psi$=24$\pm12^{\circ}$ making this planet consistent with full alignment albeit to $<1\sigma$. With a period of 18.85 days and an $a/R_{*}$ of 40, TOI-1759A b is the longest period single sub-Neptune to have a measured obliquity. It joins a growing number of smaller planets which have had this measurement made and, along with K2-25 b, is the only single, aligned sub-Neptune known to date. We also provide an overview of the emerging distribution of obliquity measurements for planets with R$<8$ R$_{\oplus}$. We find that these types of planets tend toward alignment, especially the sub-Neptunes and super-Earths implying a dynamically cool formation history. The majority of misaligned planets in this category have 4$<$R$\leq$8 R$_{\oplus}$ and are more likely to be isolated than planets rather than in compact systems. We find this result to be significant at the $3\sigma$ level, consistent with previous studies. In addition, we conduct injection and recovery testing on available archival radial velocity data to put limits on the presence of massive companions in these systems. Current archival data is insufficient for most systems to have detected a giant planet.

 - **Abstract**
 The Nuclear Stellar Disk (NSD), together with the Nuclear Stellar Cluster and the supermassive black hole Sgr A*, forms the central region of the Milky Way. Galactic X-ray background emission is known to be associated with the old stellar population, predominantly produced by accreting white dwarfs. In this work we characterize the X-ray emission of the Galactic Center (GC) region using wide-field observations with the ART-XC telescope on board the SRG observatory in the 4-12 keV energy band. Our analysis demonstrates that the X-ray emission of the GC at a spatial scale of a few hundred parsecs is dominated by the regularly shaped NSD aligned in the Galactic plane, and characterized by latitudinal and longitudinal scale heights of approximately 20 pc and approximately 100 pc, respectively. The measured flux, 6.8 (+0.1, -0.3) x 10^-10 erg/s/cm^2 in the 4-12 keV band, corresponds to a luminosity of 5.9 (+0.1, -0.3) x 10^36 erg/s, assuming the GC distance of 8.178 kpc. The average mass-normalized X-ray emissivity of the NSD, 5.6 (+0.5, -0.7) x 10^27 erg/s/M_sun, exceeds the corresponding value of the Galactic ridge by a factor of 3.3 (+0.4, -0.5), confirming other studies. We also perform a deprojection of the observed NSD surface brightness distribution in order to construct a three-dimensional X-ray luminosity density model, which can be directly compared to the existing three-dimensional stellar mass models. The emissivity of the NSD as a function of distance to Sgr A* reveals a centrally concentrated maximum, indicating an enhanced radiative output per unit stellar mass in the inner NSD region. Finally, we conclude that the observed spatial properties of the NSD are fully consistent with the stellar mass density distribution, leaving only a small room for a possible diffuse component.

 - **Abstract**
 Radio-detection is now an established technique for studying ultra-high-energy (UHE) cosmic rays with energies exceeding $\sim 10^{17}$ eV. The next generation of radio experiments, such as the Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND), aims to expand this technique to the observation of Earth-skimming UHE neutrinos, which requires the detection of very inclined extensive air showers (EAS). Currently, GRAND is validating its detection principle -- autonomous radio detection -- in particular through the prototype array GRANDProto300, deployed in the Gobi Desert. In this phase, the array is limited to detecting inclined EAS from cosmic rays. Neutrinos cannot be observed because of the restricted detector size. We present a method to reconstruct the arrival direction and energy of EAS with zenith angles above $60^\circ$, applicable as well to upward-going trajectories. The approach combines a point-source-like description of the radio wavefront with the so-called Angular Distribution Function (ADF), a phenomenological model describing the angular pattern of radio signal amplitudes in the 50--200 MHz band. Applied directly to the voltage traces, this method enables efficient event selection with accurate direction reconstruction and a first-order energy estimate. We validate the approach with both simulations and experimental data, and reconstruct the first cosmic-ray candidates detected by GRANDProto300.

 The NUTRIG project is dedicated to the development of advanced radio self-trigger methods for large-scale arrays such as the Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND). The developed techniques are based on features of the radio emission of air showers to perform an efficient online rejection of background. We first describe a first-level trigger (FLT) template-matching method that uses the shape of transient radio pulses measured at the detection-unit level to target those induced by air showers. We present trigger efficiencies and throughput tests of the template-matching FLT in controlled laboratory conditions. Next, we describe the second-level trigger (SLT), which utilizes the measured FLT times and corresponding voltage amplitudes to construct a trigger at the array level. We present offline performances of the SLT, which performs a coarse reconstruction of timing, direction, and polarization of the air shower.

 - **Abstract**
 Measuring ultra-high energy neutrinos, with energies above $10^{16}$ eV, is the next frontier of the emerging multi-messenger era. Their detection requires building a large-scale detector with 10 times the instantaneous sensitivity of current instruments, sub-degree angular resolution, and wide daily field of view. The Hybrid Elevated Radio Observatory for Neutrinos (HERON) is designed to be that discovery instrument. HERON combines the complementary features of two radio techniques being demonstrated by the BEACON and GRAND prototypes. Its preliminary design consists of 24 compact, elevated phased stations with 24 antennas each, embedded in a sparse array of 360 standalone antennas. This setup tunes the energy threshold to below 100 PeV, where the neutrino flux should be high. The sensitivity of the phased stations combines with the powerful reconstruction capacities of the standalone antennas to produce an optimal detector. HERON is planned to be installed at an elevation of 1,000 m across a 72 km-long mountain range overlooking a valley in Argentina's San Juan province. It would be connected to the worldwide network of multimessenger observatories and search for neutrino bursts from candidate sources of cosmic rays, like gamma-ray bursts and other powerful transients. With HERON's deep sensitivity, this strategy targets discoveries that cast new light into the inner workings of the most violent astrophysical sources at uncharted energies. We present the preliminary design, performances, and observation strategy of HERON.

 - **Abstract**
 While decades of observations in the TeV gamma-ray band have revealed more than 200~sources with radio or X-ray counterparts, there remain dozens of unidentified TeV sources, which may provide crucial information of cosmic ray (CR) accelerators. HESS J1626$-$490 is an unidentified TeV gamma-ray source but is expected to originate from CRs that escaped from the nearby supernova remnant (SNR) G335.2+0.1 and are interacting with dense interstellar clouds. To test this scenario, we scrutinize the properties of the SNR and search for non-thermal counterparts by analyzing observational data in the radio, X-ray, and GeV gamma-ray bands. From analysis of the H\,{\sc i} and $^{12}$CO ($J{=}1{-}0$) line data, we identify the cloud associated with the SNR and compare the morphologies of the cloud and the gamma-ray emission. The distance and age of the SNR are estimated to be $3.3 \pm 0.6$~kpc and ${\sim}5$~kyr, respectively. From X-ray and GeV gamma-ray data analyses, we find an extended GeV gamma-ray emission overlapping with the SNR and H.E.S.S. source regions but no X-ray emission. The location of the peak of the extended GeV emission changes from near the SNR at $\lesssim 1$~GeV to the H.E.S.S. source at $>10$~GeV. We find a spectral hardening at ${\sim}50$~GeV, which is consistent with the existence of two components in the gamma-ray emission. We find that a combination of emission from the escaped CRs and the SNR itself can reproduce the observed broadband spectrum, on the assumption that the SNR has accelerated protons to ${\gtrsim}100$~TeV in the past.

          Exploring the habitability and interior composition of exoplanets lying within the extended habitable zone

 - **Abstract**
 Studying the habitability, internal structure and composition of exoplanets is crucial for understanding their potential to sustain life beyond our solar system. Characterizing planetary structures and atmospheric evolution provides valuable insights into surface conditions and the long-term habitability of these planets. In this study, we present a comprehensive analysis of exoplanets spanning from super-Earths to mini-Neptunes ($R_{\textrm{p}}$ $\leq$ 4 $R_{\oplus}$ and $M_{\textrm{p}}$ $\leq$ 15 $M_{\oplus}$) located within the extended habitable zone, along with parameterization of their host stars. We find that the planets in our sample orbit M dwarf stars and are tidally locked to them. Using archival photometric data from Gaia, Pan-STARRS1, 2MASS, and WISE, we estimate the atmospheric and physical parameters of the host stars. We also model the interior structure of these planets to infer their possible compositions. Additionally, under the assumption that these exoplanets can accrete a gaseous layer, we model the envelope fraction of the habitable exoplanets. With an Earth-like rocky composition, LHS 1140 b and TOI-1452 b can hold onto negligible amount of their initial gas layer. However, sustaining a sufficient amount of atmosphere over time, the planets LP 791-18 c, LTT 3780 c and K2-18 b are likely to be water worlds. The models suggest a water rich composition for TOI-1266 c without any significant amount of atmosphere. Modeling interior compositions and atmospheric escape scenarios allow us to assess the potential habitability of these planets by evaluating the likelihood of surface liquid water and the retention of stable atmospheres.

 - **Abstract**
 Single pulse studies offer vital insights into the emission physics of pulsars, particularly in the case of young, nearby sources where intrinsic variability is often pronounced. PSR~B0656+14, known for its sporadic and sometimes intense pulses, provides an excellent opportunity to investigate such behaviour at low radio frequencies. This study aims to characterize the single pulse behaviour of PSR~B0656+14 using low-frequency observations at 110-190 MHz from the Irish LOFAR station. Single-pulse extraction is performed, and individual pulse DMs are estimated to probe pulse-to-pulse dispersion variability. We also perform a wait-time analysis to understand the statistical nature of pulse occurrence, and estimate the spectral index from frequency-resolved flux density measurements. The pulse energy distribution is modelled using a combination of log-normal and power-law components. A total of 41 pulses were detected in a 5-hour observation, allowing a wait-time distribution analysis which is well-modelled by an exponential function, indicative of a Poisson process. Profile stability analysis indicates that a significant number of pulses are required to reach a stable average profile, unusual compared to many other pulsars. The single-pulse spectral index varies significantly from pulse to pulse, with a mean value of $\alpha = -0.5$ and a standard deviation of $\Delta\alpha=1.3$. The pulse energy distribution shows a hybrid behaviour, consistent of a log-normal distribution and a power-law tail. Our results confirm that PSR~B0656+14 exhibits highly variable, memory-less emission at low frequencies, with characteristics that resemble those seen in some rotating radio transients (RRATs). If such variability proves to be widespread among pulsars, population synthesis models and survey yield predictions would need to incorporate this currently overlooked feature to ensure accuracy.

 Superfluid vortices in neutron star crusts are thought to be pinned to the lattice of nuclei in the crust. The unpinning of superfluid vortices in spin glitches therefore motivates us to study the vortex-crust interaction explicitly with molecular dynamics. In this work, we present a new molecular dynamics methods to characterize the response of the crust to a rigid vortex. When vortex pinning forces and nearest neighbor Coulomb forces are comparable, we observe a qualitatively new phenomena of lattice entrainment with implications for the elastic evolution of the crust.

 - **Abstract**
 Identification of primary cosmic rays on an event-by-event basis is a much-desired capability of cosmic-ray observatories. Several cosmic-ray air-shower experiments use so-called photon tags for gamma hadron primary particle discrimination. These photon tag variables are derived from the total signals measured by an array of detectors and are correlated with the total number of muons in the air shower. In this work, variables based on time distribution of signals in detectors (trace-based discriminant variables) are studied and compared to total-signal-based variables. This study relies on simulated high-energy cosmic-ray air showers with energies around 10^17.5eV. Since the variables discussed are derived from total signals and their time traces, which can be directly measured in real data, they are suitable for use as discriminant variables in the real ground-based cosmic ray experiments.

 - **Abstract**
 Two fast radio bursts, FRB 20121102A and FRB 20180916B, show periodic activity with cycles of 159.3 and 16.33 days, respectively. These cycles consist of active and inactive windows, with peak activity centered within the active phase. For FRB 20180916B, studies have reported a frequency-dependent-or ``chromatic''-behaviour, where the activity window starts earlier and becomes narrower at higher frequencies. The activity across frequencies is typically modeled with a power law. In this work, we develop a simple model that combines the phase and frequency dependence of the activity windows of FRB 20121102A and FRB 20180916B. Our goal is to perform a chromaticity study for FRB 20121102A, incorporating model improvements to account for the cyclic nature of its activity window, and to compare the chromatic behaviour between both periodic FRBs. We standardise the detections from the 425 observing epochs for FRB 20121102A and the 214 epochs for FRB 20180916B to account for differences in radio telescope sensitivity. To the normalised detection rate phase distribution, we fit a von Mises distribution and extract the peak activity phase and activity width. These quantities, as a function of frequency, are then modelled as power-laws to construct the chromatic model. For both sources, the activity window starts earlier at higher frequencies. However, FRB 20121102A shows an activity window broadening at higher frequencies, while FRB 20180916B broadens at lower frequencies. FRB 20121102A appears to remain active during at least 80% of the cycle at C-band. The observed chromatic behaviour of FRB 20180916B is consistent with previous findings. For FRB 20121102A, a chromaticity in its activity window is also seen; however, the source appears to be active for longer at higher frequencies, opposite to the behaviour of FRB 20180916B.

 - **Abstract**
 Constraining neutrino mass through cosmological observations relies on precise simulations to calibrate their effects on large scale structure, while these simulations must overcome computational challenges like dealing with large velocity dispersions and small intrinsic neutrino perturbations. We present an efficient N-body implementation with semi-linear neutrino mass response which gives accurate power spectra and halo statistics. We explore the necessity of correcting the expansion history caused by massive neutrinos and the transition between relativistic and non-relativistic components. The above method of including neutrino masses is built into the memory-, scalability-, and precision-optimized parallel N-body simulation code CUBE 2.0. Through a suite of neutrino simulations, we precisely quantify the neutrino mass effects on the nonlinear matter power spectra and halo statistics.

 - **Abstract**
 The design of transfers to periodic orbits in the Earth--Moon system has regained prominence with NASA's Artemis and CNSA's Chang'e programs. This work addresses the problem of linking ballistic capture trajectories - exploiting multi-body dynamics for temporary lunar orbit insertion - with bounded periodic motion described in the circular restricted three-body problem (CR3BP). A unified framework is developed for optimizing bi-impulsive transfers to families of periodic orbits via a high-order polynomial expansion of the CR3BP dynamics. That same expansion underlies a continuous 'abacus' parameterization of orbit families, enabling rapid targeting and analytic sensitivity. Transfers to planar periodic-orbit families (Lyapunov L1 and L2, and distant retrograde orbits) are addressed first, followed by extension to spatial families, such as butterfly and halo L1/L2 orbits, with an emphasis towards Near-Rectilinear Halo Orbits (NRHOs). Numerical results demonstrate low-cost solutions and validate the method's adaptability for the design of lunar missions. The optimized trajectories can inform an established low-energy transfer database, enriching it with detailed cost profiles that reflect both transfer feasibility and underlying dynamical relationships to specific periodic-orbit families. Finally, the proposed transfers provide reliable initial guesses for rapid refinement, readily adaptable for further optimization across mission-specific needs.

 - **Abstract**
 The spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of 20 Milky Way (MW), 9 Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), 7 Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), 12 M31, and 7 M33 (classical) Cepheids with periods longer than 50 days were constructed using photometric data from the literature and fitted with model atmospheres with the aim of identifying objects with an infrared excess. The SEDs were fitted with stellar photosphere models to derive the best-fitting luminosity and effective temperature; a dust component was added when required. The distance and reddening values were taken from the literature. WISE and IRAC images were inspected to verify whether potential excess emission was related to the central objects. Only one star with a significant infrared (IR) excess was found in the LMC and none in the SMC, M31, and M33, contrary to earlier work on the MW suggesting that IR excess may be more prominent in MW Cepheids than in the Magellanic Clouds. One additional object in the MW was found to have an IR excess, but it is unclear whether it is a classical Cepheid or a type-{\sc ii} Cepheid. The stars were plotted in a Hertzsprung--Russell diagram (HRD) and compared to evolutionary tracks for CCs and to theoretical instability strips. For the large majority of stars, the position in the HRD is consistent with the instability strip. For stars in the MW uncertainties in the distance and reddening can significantly change their position in the HRD.

 - **Abstract**
 We evaluate global asymmetry in the luminosities of neutrinos emitted from rapidly-rotating proto-neutron stars (PNS's). We build axisymmetric models of PNS's in mechanical equilibrium with rotation by adding prescribed angular momentum distributions by hand to non-rotational PNS models, which are extracted from a one-dimensional (spherically symmetric) PNS cooling calculation at different times: \(t=2, 6, 10, 20, 30\)s after a supernova explosion. We then conduct two-dimensional (spatially axisymmetric) neutrino transport calculations on top of them with the matter profiles (and the spacetime geometry) fixed. We find for the rapidly-rotating models with \(T/|W|\sim 5\times 10^{-2}\) that the neutrino luminosity changes by \(\sim 3 \% \) depending on the observer position. We give detailed analyses of the neutrino-hemispheres as well as the neutrino luminosities that are defined observer-wise. We also calculate the low-frequency (\(\lesssim 1{\rm Hz}\)) gravitational waves produced by the neutrinos radiated asymmetrically. We find that those gravitational waves, if emitted from the Galactic center, can be detected by planned detectors such as B-DECIGO, DECIGO and AILA. Finally, we look for crossings in the energy-integrated angular distributions in momentum space for the electron neutrino sector, a signature of the fast flavor conversion. We find them near the PNS surface in all models.

 - **Abstract**
 We determined the ortho/para (o/p) ratios of NH2D and NHD2 in the archetypical pre-stellar core L1544. The core was observed in the two lowest rotational lines of ortho- and para-NH2D using the APEX and the IRAM 30 m telescopes. The ground-state lines of ortho- and para-NHD2 were observed with APEX. The distributions of chemical abundances in the core were predicted using a gas-grain chemistry model with two different scenarios concerning proton transfer reactions in the gas. One of the scenarios, the so-called full scrambling (FS), allows protons and deuterons to be completely mixed in the intermediate reaction complex before dissociation, whereas the other describes these reactions as proton or deuteron hops (PH). We also tested assumed abundance profiles independent of the chemistry models. Radiative transfer calculations were used to simulate the observed NH2D and NHD2 lines from the predicted and assumed abundance profiles. Our modelling efforts suggest that the ground-state lines of NH2D and NHD2 at the wavelength 0.9 mm that are observable with the same beam and in the same spectrometer band are the most reliable probes of the o/p ratios. Simulations using the PH reaction scheme show systematically better agreement with the observations than simulations with the FS model. Simulations using a broken power law abundance profile as a function of the gas density give spin ratios that are close to the predictions of the PH scenario: o/p-NH2D=2.85+-0.05, o/p-NHD2=2.10+-0.06 (1 sigma). The o/p ratios predicted by the PH scenario in the gas phase correspond to the nuclear spin statistical weights, that is, o/p-NH2D=3, o/p-NHD2=2. In view of the fact that H and D atom addition reactions on grain surfaces also result in these ratios, it is reasonable to assume that the spin ratios of interstellar ammonia and its deuterated forms are in general equal to their statistical values.

 LiteBIRD, the Lite (Light) satellite for the study of $B$-mode polarization and Inflation from cosmic background Radiation Detection, is a space mission focused on primordial cosmology and fundamental physics. In this paper, we present the LiteBIRD Simulation Framework (LBS), a Python package designed for the implementation of pipelines that model the outputs of the data acquisition process from the three instruments on the LiteBIRD spacecraft: LFT (Low-Frequency Telescope), MFT (Mid-Frequency Telescope), and HFT (High-Frequency Telescope). LBS provides several modules to simulate the scanning strategy of the telescopes, the measurement of realistic polarized radiation coming from the sky (including the Cosmic Microwave Background itself, the Solar and Kinematic dipole, and the diffuse foregrounds emitted by the Galaxy), the generation of instrumental noise and the effect of systematic errors, like pointing wobbling, non-idealities in the Half-Wave Plate, et cetera. Additionally, we present the implementation of a simple but complete pipeline that showcases the main features of LBS. We also discuss how we ensured that LBS lets people develop pipelines whose results are accurate and reproducible. A full end-to-end pipeline has been developed using LBS to characterize the scientific performance of the LiteBIRD experiment. This pipeline and the results of the first simulation run are presented in Puglisi et al. (2025).

 - **Abstract**
 Single massive satellites are of great observational interest, as they can produce prominent and potentially detectable signatures. For terrestrial planets and super-Earths, giant impacts in the late stages of formation may generate dense self-gravitating disks - favourable environments for the formation of such satellites. Motivated by this, we explore satellite formation in dense solid-particle disks through three-dimensional N-body simulations, focusing on the effects of disk mass and the surface density exponent. Our results reveal significant variability in the masses and configurations of satellites formed under identical disk parameters, highlighting the stochastic nature of the process. Higher disk masses and flatter surface density profiles favour the formation of more massive satellites. Disks with masses above 0.03 planetary masses typically yield a single dominant satellite, while those between 0.003 and 0.03 tend to form two-satellite systems. On average, the mass of the largest satellite scales linearly with the initial disk mass, in agreement with analytical predictions. We estimate that a disk with a minimal mass of 0.03 planetary masses around a 1.6 Earth-mass planet orbiting a Sun-like star could form an Earth-Moon-like system detectable by telescopes with a photometric precision of 10 parts per million - a level achievable by the James Webb Space Telescope.

 - **Abstract**
 Most direct N-body integrations of planetary systems use a symplectic integrator with a fixed timestep. A large timestep is desirable because simulations run fast. However, simulations yield unphysical results if the timestep is too large. Surprisingly, no systematic convergence study has been performed on long (Gyr) timescales. In this paper we present numerical experiments to determine the minimum timestep one has to use in long-term integrations of the Solar System in order to recover the system's fundamental secular frequencies and instability rate. We find that timesteps of up to 32 days, i.e. a third of Mercury's orbital period, yield physical results in 5 Gyr integrations. We argue that the chaotic diffusion that drives the Solar System's long-term evolution dominates over numerical diffusion and timestep resonances. Our results bolster confidence that most simulations in the literature are indeed converged and provide guidance on how to run time and energy efficient simulations while making sure results can be trusted.

 - **Abstract**
 The dynamically-driven double-degenerate double-detonation model has emerged as a promising progenitor candidate for Type Ia supernovae. In this scenario, the primary white dwarf ignites due to dynamical interaction with a companion white dwarf, which may also undergo a detonation. Consequently, two scenarios exist: one in which the secondary survives and another in which both white dwarfs detonate. In either case, substantial departures from spherical symmetry are imprinted on the ejecta. Here, we compute full non local thermodynamic equilibrium nebular-phase spectra in 1D and 3D to probe the innermost asymmetries. Our simulations reveal that the multidimensional structures significantly alter the overall ionisation balance, width and velocity of features, especially when the secondary detonates. In this scenario, some element distributions may produce orientation-dependent line profiles that can be centrally peaked from some viewing-angles and somewhat flat-topped from others. Comparison to observations reveals that both scenarios produce most observed features from the optical to mid-infrared. However, the current model realisations do not consistently reproduce all line shapes or relative strengths, and yield prominent optical Ar III emission which is inconsistent with the data. When the secondary detonates, including 3D effects, improves the average agreement with observations, however when compared to observations, particularly weak optical Co III emission and the presence of optical O I and near-infrared S I challenge its viability for normal Type Ia supernovae. Thus, our comparisons with normal Type Ia's tentatively favour detonation of only the primary white dwarf, but we stress that more model realisations and mid-infrared observations are needed.

 - **Abstract**
 We present \texttt{COMPASS}, a novel simulation-based inference framework that combines score-based diffusion models with transformer architectures to jointly perform parameter estimation and Bayesian model comparison across competing Galactic Chemical Evolution (GCE) models. \texttt{COMPASS} handles high-dimensional, incomplete, and variable-size stellar abundance datasets. % Applied to high-precision elemental abundance measurements, \texttt{COMPASS} evaluates 40 combinations of nucleosynthetic yield tables. The model strongly favours Asymptotic Giant Branch yields from NuGrid and core-collapse SN yields used in the IllustrisTNG simulation, achieving near-unity cumulative posterior probability. Using the preferred model, we infer a steep high-mass IMF slope and an elevated Supernova\,Ia normalization, consistent with prior solar neighbourhood studies but now derived from fully amortized Bayesian inference. % Our results demonstrate that modern SBI methods can robustly constrain uncertain physics in astrophysical simulators and enable principled model selection when analysing complex, simulation-based data.

 - **Abstract**
 Dynamical activity attributed to the destruction of minor planets orbiting white dwarfs has now been photometrically monitored in individual systems for up to one decade, long enough to measure significant cessation and re-emergence of transit features. Further, periodicities which hint at the presence of debris orbiting exterior to the white dwarf Roche radius, along with widely varying estimates for debris disc lifetimes (up to Myrs), complicate theories for the formation and dynamical evolution of these systems. Here, we illustrate that minor planets orbiting white dwarfs with periods of $\approx$5-25 hours and longer while completely or partially avoiding tidal disruption satisfy the conditions for the occurrence of the sesquinary catastrophe, a phenomenon that occurs in the solar system when impacts from returning ejecta from a moon are fast enough to be erosional to the point of destruction. We hence find that the region corresponding to $\approx$1-4 white dwarf rubble-pile Roche radii represents a danger zone where the collisional timescale for the sesquinary catastrophe to occur is $\sim 10^2-10^5$ yr, suggesting that debris discs around white dwarfs are in a state of semi-continuous replenishment.

 - **Abstract**
 Juno and Cassini have shown that Jupiter and Saturn likely contain extended gradients of heavy elements. Yet, how these gradients can survive over billions of years remains an open question. Classical convection theories predict rapid mixing and homogenization, which would erase such gradients on timescales far shorter than the planets' ages. To address this, we estimate the energy required to erode both dense and fuzzy cores, and compare it to what the planet can realistically supply. If the entire cooling budget is available to drive mixing, then even a compact core can, in principle, be destroyed. But if mixing is limited to the thermal energy near the core, which is another plausible scenario, the energy falls short. In that case, Jupiter can erode a fuzzy core by up to approximately $10~\mearth$, but a compact one remains intact. Saturn's core is more robust. Even in the fuzzy case, only about $1~\mearth$ is lost, and if the core is compact, erosion is negligible. The outcome depends sensitively on the assumed initial temperature and entropy profiles. Hotter and more superadiabatic interiors are more prone to mixing. We suggest that 3D simulations of convection driven from above, with realistic stratification and enough depth (i.e., many density scale heights) would be of great interest to further constrain the energy budget for core erosion.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of CHIME J1634+44, a Long Period Radio Transient (LPT) unique for two aspects: it is the first known LPT to emit fully circularly polarized radio bursts, and it is the first LPT with a significant spin-up. Given that high circular polarization ($>90$\%) has been observed in FRB~20201124A and in some giant pulses of PSR~B1937+21, we discuss the implications of the high circular polarization of CHIME J1634+44 and conclude its emission mechanism is likely to be ``pulsar-like''. While CHIME J1634+44 has a pulse period of 841 s, its burst arrival patterns are indicative of a secondary 4206 s period, probably associated with binary activity. The timing properties suggest it has a significantly negative period derivative of $\dot{P}=-9.03(0.11)$ s s$^{-1}$. Few systems have been known to spin-up, most notably transitional millisecond pulsars and cataclysmic binaries, both of which seem unlikely progenitors for CHIME J1634+44. If the period was only associated with the spin of the object, then the spin up is likely generated by accretion of material from a companion. If, however, the radio pulse period and the orbital period are locked, as appears to be the case for two other LPTs, the spin up of CHIME J1634+44 could be driven by gravitational wave radiation.

 - **Abstract**
 Free-floating planetary-mass objects (FFPMOs) are known to harbor disks at young ages. Here, we present 1-13 $\mu m$ spectra for eight young FFPMOs with masses of 5-10 M$_\mathrm{Jup}$ (at ages of 1-5 Myr), using the NIRSpec and MIRI instruments on the James Webb Space Telescope. We derive fundamental properties of these targets, and find spectral types of M9.5 to L4, with effective temperatures of 1600-1900 K. The photospheric spectra of our targets show a clear diversity at similar temperatures, especially in the 3-5 $\mu m$ range, unaccounted for by existing atmospheric models. We find a silicate absorption feature in the photosphere of one of our targets, the first such detection in very young FFPMOs, indicating silicate clouds in their cool atmospheres. Six of our objects show mid-infrared excess emission above the photosphere, as well as silicate emission features, demonstrating the presence of disks. The shape and strength of the latter features constitute strong evidence of grain growth and crystallization, similar to what is seen in more massive brown dwarfs and stars. We also detect emission lines from hydrocarbon molecules in the disks of several targets. These are the lowest mass isolated objects found so far with silicate and hydrocarbon emission features arising in their disks. The presence of disks and their characteristics point to the potential for the formation of rocky companions around free-floating planetary-mass objects.

 We examine scale and redshift dependence of mass-property relations (MPRs) for five hot gas properties of two large group- and cluster-scale halo samples realized by the IllustrisTNG, TNG-Cluster and FLAMINGO cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. For intrinsic properties of i) hot gas mass ($M_{\rm gas}$), ii) spectroscopic-like temperature ($T_{\rm sl}$), iii) soft-band X-ray luminosity ($L_{\rm X}$), and iv) X-ray ($Y_{\rm X}$) and v) Sunyaev-Zel'dovich ($Y_{\rm SZ}$) thermal energies, we use MPR parameters to infer mass proxy quality (MPQ) -- the implied scatter in total halo mass conditioned on a property -- for halos with $M_{\rm 500c} \geq 10^{13}{\, {\rm M}_\odot}$ at redshifts, $z \in \{0, 0.5, 1, 2\}$. We find: (1) in general, scaling relation slopes and covariance display moderate to strong dependence on halo mass, with redshift dependence secondary, (2) for halos with $M_{\rm 500c} > 10^{14}{\, {\rm M}_\odot}$, scalings of $M_{\rm gas}$ and $Y_{\rm SZ}$ simplify toward self-similar slope and constant intrinsic scatter (5 and 10%, respectively) nearly independent of scale, making both measures ideal for cluster finding and characterization to $z=2$, (3) halo mass-conditioned likelihoods of hot gas mass and thermal energy at fixed halo mass closely follow a log-normal form, (4) despite normalization differences ranging up to $0.4$ dex, there is good qualitative, and often quantitative, agreement between the scale-dependent slopes and property covariance of the two simulations. Slopes show appreciable redshift dependence at the group scale, while redshift dependence of the scatter is exhibited by low mass FLAMINGO halos only, (5) property correlations are largely consistent between the simulations, with values that mainly agree with existing empirical measurements. We close with a literature survey placing our MPR slopes and intrinsic scatter estimates into context.

 - **Abstract**
 Polarimetric radio observations of the Sun can provide rich information about emission mechanisms and the propagation medium. For the past five decades, solar polarimetric studies at low radio frequencies have almost always assumed the absence of linear polarization. This has been based on the expectations from coronal propagation effects. Here we present the first robust evidence of linear polarization from solar emissions at meter wavelengths using simultaneous measurements with two telescopes of very different designs separated by thousands of kilometers - the Murchison Widefield Array and the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope. Both datasets show consistent linear polarization fractions, confirming this detection. Rapid changes in morphology, as well as the fractional linear polarization at small time and frequency spans, further rule out any possibilities of an instrumental origin. Assuming the absence of linear polarization in solar radio emissions can result in incorrect interpretation of solar observations as well as those of other flare stars, which are often guided by learnings from solar studies. This discovery highlights the need for relaxing this assumption, and is essential for precise estimation of polarization signatures, ultimately leading to a better understanding of the plasma conditions in the Sun and other stars.

 - **Abstract**
 The analogues of $\gamma$ Cassiopea are binary early type Be stars which are X-ray bright and have hard thermal X-ray spectra. The nature of low-mass companions in these stars and mechanisms of their X-ray emission remain enigmatic. Among the proposed ideas is the presence of an accretion disc around a white dwarf (WD) companion to the Be star donor. We use modern radiative transfer models accounting for reflection physics in order to calculate the synthetic spectra of such systems, and assume that the hottest plasma is thermal and is located in the accretion disc boundary layer. The models are then used to analyse the archival X-ray observations of the $\gamma$ Cas analogue $\zeta$ Tau (a.k.a. Tiānguān) which were obtained by the XMM-Newton telescope. Comparisons with X-ray-emitting symbiotic systems, particularly $\delta$- and $\beta/\delta$-type systems, support the idea that the hard X-ray emission in $\zeta$ Tau is best explained by a WD accreting wind material of the Be star. The plasma temperature and luminosity of the boundary layer associated with the accretion disc are used to estimate a mass accretion rate of $\dot{M}_\mathrm{acc} \approx 4\times 10^{-10}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, implying a nova recurrence time above 10$^{5}$ yr. Our analysis advances the understanding the production of hard X-ray emission in $\gamma$ Cas analogues, further supporting the idea of accreting WDs as companions of Be-stars in these systems.

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are the most powerful transient objects in the Universe, and they are a primary target for the MAGIC Collaboration. Recognizing the challenges of observing these elusive objects with Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs), we implemented a dedicated observational strategy that included an automated procedure for rapid re-pointing to transient sources. Since 2013, this automated procedure has enabled MAGIC to observe GRBs at a rate of approximately ten per year, which led to the successful detection of two GRBs at very high energies (VHE; E > 100 GeV). We present a comprehensive analysis of 42 non-detected GRBs (4 short GRBs) observed by MAGIC from 2013 to 2019. We derived upper limits (ULs) on the observed energy flux as well as on the intrinsic energy flux corrected for absorption by the extragalactic background light (EBL) from the MAGIC observations in selected energy and time intervals. We conducted a comprehensive study of their properties to investigate the reasons for these non-detections, including the possible peculiar properties of TeV-detected GRBs. We find that strong EBL absorption significantly hinders TeV detection for the majority of GRBs in our sample. For a subset of 6 GRBs with redshift z < 2, we compared the UL on the intrinsic flux in the VHE domain with the simultaneous X-ray flux, which is observed to be at the same level in the current population of TeV-detected GRBs. Based on these inferred MAGIC ULs, we conclude that a VHE component with a luminosity comparable to the simultaneously observed X-ray luminosity cannot be ruled out for this sample.

 - **Abstract**
 Imaging of optical Galactic cirrus, the spatially resolved form of diffuse Galactic light, provides important insights into the properties of the diffuse interstellar medium (ISM) in the Milky Way. While previous investigations have focused mainly on the intensity characteristics of optical cirrus, their morphological properties remain largely unexplored. In this study, we employ several complementary statistical approaches -- local intensity statistics, angular power spectrum / $\Delta$-variance analysis, and Wavelet Scattering Transform analysis -- to characterize the morphology of cirrus in deep optical imaging data. We place our investigation of optical cirrus into a multi-wavelength context by comparing the morphology of cirrus seen with the Dragonfly Telephoto Array to that seen with space-based facilities working at longer wavelengths (Herschel 250~$\mu m$, WISE 12~$\mu m$, and Planck radiance), as well as with structures seen in the DHIGLS {\HI} column density map. Our statistical methods quantify the similarities and the differences of cirrus morphology in all these datasets. The morphology of cirrus at visible wavelengths resembles that of far-infrared cirrus more closely than that of mid-infrared cirrus; on small scales, anisotropies in the cosmic infrared background and systematics may lead to differences. Across all dust tracers, cirrus morphology can be well described by a power spectrum with a common power-law index $\gamma\sim-2.9$. We demonstrate quantitatively that optical cirrus exhibits filamentary, coherent structures across a broad range of angular scales. Our results offer promising avenues for linking the analysis of coherent structures in optical cirrus to the underlying physical processes in the ISM that shape them. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these morphological signatures can be leveraged to distinguish and disentangle cirrus from extragalactic light.

 - **Abstract**
 The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar object to be discovered. Pre-perihelion measurements provide a unique opportunity to study its activity and composition, which may alter as it is heated in the coming months. We provide an initial baseline from optical spectroscopic observations obtained only two days after discovery, using the MUSE instrument on the VLT on 2025 July 3, while 3I was at 4.47 au from the Sun and 3.46 au from the Earth. These observations confirm the cometary nature of 3I, and reveal a red coma with a spectral slope of $(18\pm4)\%/1000$~Å, redder than most Solar System comets but similar to the surface colour of some Solar System Trans-Neptunian Objects or Centaurs. We searched for but did not detect gas emission from C$_2$, NH$_2$, CN, and [OI], which is consistent with volatile non-detections for Solar System comets at this heliocentric distance. At present, the coma appears entirely dusty. Future observations of 3I as it comes closer to the Sun will provide an invaluable opportunity to witness the evolution of its activity, study its composition, test predictions of interstellar object population models, and compare 3I to Solar System comets.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the design for HALO7D-X, a survey of the stellar halo to investigate the accretion history of the Milky Way. The survey will use a combination of Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and Gaia data for sky position and proper motions of faint stars (18<G<21.5 mag), while line-of-sight velocity, distance, [Fe/H], and [alpha/Fe] will be measured using follow-up Keck spectroscopy. The survey will cover 30 lines of sight, made up of multiple HST archival fields and optimized for Keck DEIMOS spectroscopy. We use mock survey observations of the Bullock and Johnston stellar halo simulations to investigate the sensitivity of HALO7D-X to constrain the basic parameters of the accretion history of our Galaxy's stellar halo. We find that we are sensitive to the mass distribution and accretion timeline of the stellar halo progenitors, but not their orbital circularity. We find that the simulated halos fall into three different groups based on the similarities in their distributions of the observable dimensions of our survey. These groups are also distinct from each other in the mass distribution and accretion timeline of their progenitor satellites, showing that by using similarities in our observables among halos, we are able to identify similarities in their accretion histories. With HALO7D-X we will compare real Milky Way data with simulated halos and use this connection between observables and progenitor mass and accretion timeline to learn about the formation of our Galaxy's stellar halo.

 - **Abstract**
 We describe the physical characteristics of interstellar comet 3I\ATLAS, discovered on 2025 July 1 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System. The comet has eccentricity, $e$ $\simeq$ 6.08 and velocity at infinity, v$_{\infty}$ $\simeq$ 57 km/s, indicating an interstellar origin. We obtained g, r, i photometry with the Palomar 200-inch Next Generation Palomar Spectrograph on 2025 July 3. We measured colour indices g-r = 0.43$\pm$0.02 mag, r-i = 0.16$\pm$0.02 mag, and g-i = 0.59$\pm$0.03 mag and a spectral slope of 1.3$\pm$0.9 $\%$/100 nm. We calculate the dust cross-section within 10,000 km of the comet to be 230.0$\pm$5.2 km$^2$, assuming an albedo of 0.10. The FWHM of 3I\ATLAS's detection is $\sim$2.2 arcsec as measured in our r-band images and has A(0$^\circ$)f$\rho$ of 287.2$\pm$2.8 cm. Finally, we use the sunward extent of the coma to constrain the dust ejection speed, finding that \textmu m-scale to mm-scale particles have $\sim$0.01-1 m/s, implying the comet's dust mass-loss rate is $\sim$0.1 - 1.0 kg/s.

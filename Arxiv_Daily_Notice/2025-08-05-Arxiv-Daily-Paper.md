 - **Abstract**
 As humanity advances toward long-term lunar presence under NASA's Artemis program, the development of lunar-based manufacturing and construction (LBMC) capabilities has become increasingly critical. The high cost of transporting materials from Earth makes in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) essential, with lunar regolith serving as a promising local feedstock. Additive manufacturing (AM) offers a compelling platform for LBMC due to its geometric flexibility, material efficiency, and capacity for on-demand, site-specific production. This study investigates material extrusion (MEX) AM of polyether-ether-ketone (PEEK) composites containing 10 to 50 wt% lunar regolith simulant (LRS). PEEK and LMS-1D powders were melt-compounded via twin-screw extrusion, printed using a high-temperature chamber, and annealed at 300 degrees C. The samples were characterized through density measurements, thermal analysis, tensile testing, and microstructural and elemental mapping. All filaments exhibited densities above 96%, though as-printed porosity increased from less than 1% in neat PEEK to 7.5% at 50 wt% LRS due to elevated melt viscosity. Regolith incorporation enhanced crystallinity (17.4 to 20.5%) and elastic modulus (by 6-41%), while reducing delamination and warping, which improved dimensional accuracy and print success rates. Tensile strength declined gradually from 107 MPa to 90 MPa up to 40 wt% LRS, then dropped sharply to approximately 70 MPa at 50 wt%. Annealing improved density and stiffness for composites containing up to 30 wt% LRS, with marginal benefit at higher contents. Microstructural and elemental analyses confirmed a continuous PEEK matrix with uniformly dispersed regolith particles. This work establishes processing windows and trade-offs for regolith-rich PEEK composites, supporting ISRU-enabled AM of future lunar infrastructure.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent developments in AI techniques for space applications mirror the success achieved in terrestrial applications. Machine learning, which excels in data rich environments, is particularly well suited to space-based computer vision applications, such as space optical attitude sensing. Of these sensors, digital sun sensors (DSS) are one of the most common and important sensors for spacecraft attitude determination. The main challenge in using the DSS for attitude estimation are sensor errors, which limit the overall achievable estimation accuracy. However, the traditional sun sensor calibration process is costly, slow, labor-intensive and inefficient. These limitations motivate the use of AI techniques to enable more accurate and efficient DSS calibration. The objective of this work is to develop an end-to-end predictive calibration methodology for digital sun sensors to solve 2-axis state estimates utilizing a sparse submanifold convolutional neural network (SSCNN). We find that the proposed framework can achieve state-of-the-art performance on synthetic data with a mean accuracy of 0.005° for the two sun angle estimates. Furthermore, the model is highly capable of implicitly learning complex noise patterns and handling mixed noise types, thereby greatly improving the model robustness and accuracy to real-world applications. The main contributions of this work are: (1) the first application (to our knowledge) of a CNN regression model to the problem of DSS predictive calibration, (2) the introduction of a fused end-to-end training approach for DSS calibration, (3) the creation of a publicly available physics-informed synthetic dataset and simulation for DSS training images, and (4) the evaluation of the performance of the deep learning approach for various mask configurations.

 - **Abstract**
 A wide range of phenomena, from explosive transients to active galactic nuclei, exhibit variability at radio wavelengths on timescales of a few years. Characterizing the rate and scale of variability in the radio sky can provide keen insights into dynamic processes in the Universe, such as accretion mechanics, jet propagation, and stellar evolution. We use data from the first two epochs of the Very Large Array Sky Survey to conduct a census of the variable radio sky. Approximately $3,600$ objects are found to significantly vary in brightness during the $\sim2.5\,$ years between observations. For compact sources whose mean flux density across the two epochs, $\mu_{S}$, is brighter than $20\,$mJy, $\approx 5\,$% show brightness variations $>30\,$%, rising to $\approx 9\,$% at $\mu_{S}>300\,$mJy. Most of the VLASS variables have multiwavelength properties consistent with blazars and quasars, including those with the largest absolute changes in flux density. The largest fractional changes in brightness are exhibited by galactic sources. We discuss our results, including some of the more interesting and extreme examples of variable radio sources identified, as well as future research directions.

 - **Abstract**
 The fifth-generation Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-V) is conducting the first all-sky low-resolution spectroscopic survey of the Milky Way's stellar halo. We describe the stellar parameter pipeline for the SDSS-V halo survey, which simultaneously models spectra, broadband photometry, and parallaxes to derive stellar parameters, metallicities, alpha abundances, and distances. The resulting BOSS-MINESweeper catalog is validated across a wide range of stellar parameters and metallicities using star clusters and a comparison to high-resolution spectroscopic surveys. We demonstrate several scientific capabilities of this dataset: identifying the most chemically peculiar stars in our Galaxy, discovering and mapping distant halo substructures, and measuring the all--sky dynamics of the Milky Way on the largest scales. The BOSS-MINESweeper catalog for SDSS DR19 is publicly available and will be updated for future data releases.

 - **Abstract**
 We present Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging of Pegasus V and Pisces VII, along with a re-analysis of the archival imaging of Pegasus W, and Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) neutral gas (HI) observations of all three. These three ultra-faint dwarfs (UFDs) are all within the Local Group in the approximate direction of M31. The VLA observations place stringent upper limits on their HI content, with all having $M_\mathrm{HI} < 10^4\;\mathrm{M_\odot}$. As the red giant branches of these UFDs are sparsely populated, we determined distances from the HST photometry of horizontal branch (HB) stars in comparison to a fiducial HB population (from M92), with all three falling in the range 0.7-1 Mpc. Using a new Python-based star formation history (SFH) fitting code (based on StarFISH), we derive SFHs of all three UFDs. As found previously, the best fit SFH for Pegasus W includes significant star formation well beyond the end of reionization, while the SFHs calculated for Pegasus V and Pisces VII are consistent with them having quenched shortly after reionization. These findings for the latter two objects indicate that, like those in the vicinity of the Milky Way, lower mass UFDs in the vicinity of M31 likely quenched at early times.

          Viability of generalized $α$-inflation from Planck, ACT, and DESI Data

 - **Abstract**
 We study two classes of single-field inflationary models - a generalization of the alpha-attractor and the alpha-Starobinsky model - and examine their compatibility with current observational data from Planck, ACT DR6, and BAO measurements from DESI DR2. Our analysis focuses on the reheating phase that follows inflation, characterized by the equation-of-state parameter omega_re, the reheating temperature T_re, and the number of e-folds N_re. We use a semi-analytical approach based on an equation linking inflationary dynamics to reheating, allowing us to compute the inflaton value at horizon crossing phi_k and other related cosmological quantities. We consider different decay channels for the inflaton: gravitational, Yukawa, and scalar. We are particularly interested in studying these models in the r-n_s and T_re-n_s planes, especially in regions close to the P-ACT-LB2 combination, which is the area most distant from the Planck data. To do this, we explore a wide range of values for the model parameters and show the graphs where the closest approximation to the P-ACT-LB2 region occurs. Other authors have already carried out related work; where there is overlap, our results are consistent with those obtained by other means.

          Transient LoBALs at high velocities: A Case of Extreme Broad Absorption Line Variability in J115636.82+085628.9

 - **Abstract**
 We present a multi-epoch spectroscopic study of the broad absorption line (BAL) quasar J115636.82+085628.9 (z(em) = 2.1077), based on five spectra spanning nearly two decades in the observer's frame. This source exhibits remarkable variability in both low-ionization (LoBAL: Al III and Mg II) and high-ionization (HiBAL: C IV and Si IV) absorption features. For the first time, we detect the emergence and subsequent disappearance of LoBAL troughs at high velocities (~20,000 kms$^{-1}$), coinciding with the strengthening and weakening of the corresponding HiBAL absorption. The C IV BAL profile extends from ~6,700 kms$^{-1}$ to a conservative upper limit of 30,000 kms$^{-1}$ and is composed of narrow, variable absorption features embedded within a broad, smooth envelope. Both C IV and Si IV BAL troughs exhibit dramatic equivalent width (EW) changes, among the most extreme reported to date. Notably, these EW variations are strongly anti-correlated with continuum flux changes inferred from optical photometric light curves. We interpret this variability as the result of a new absorbing flow transiting into our line of sight, increasing the shielding of a more distant, pre-existing outflow and giving rise to transient LoBAL absorption. This scenario supports a unified picture in which LoBAL and HiBAL features arise from similar outflow structures, with observed differences governed primarily by line-of-sight column densities consistent with previous findings.

          Estimate of Current Mass of the Large Magellanic Cloud from the Orphan-Chenab Tidal Stream

 - **Abstract**
 By fitting the tilt in the path of the Orphan-Chenab Stream (OCS), we conclude that the current mass of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) within 30 kpc is $4.7$ - $5.1 \times 10^{10}$ M$_\odot$. We note that the tidal radius of the LMC of this mass is 16.9 kpc, indicating that our measured mass approximates the current bound mass of the LMC. Previous measurements of the LMC mass based on fitting the observed path of the OCS through the Milky Way (MW) halo reported the total mass of the LMC. We show that because the closest approach of the LMC to the OCS, where the gravitational perturbation of the stream path is the highest, is about 20 kpc, the mass of the LMC outside of 30 kpc is not constrained and depends entirely on the assumed radial profile at large radius. Our best-fit total mass varies between $4.5 \times 10^{10}$ and $2.2 \times 10^{11}$ M$_\odot$ or more, depending on the presumed radial profile of the LMC. We also show that previous measurements of the mass of the LMC that used a particle-spray method to simulate the path of the OCS suffered from systematic error because they assumed that all particles were stripped from the dwarf galaxy at the tidal radius; N-body simulations show that particles are actually released from a range of distances from the center of mass of the OCS. In contrast, the choice of MW potential has little effect on the estimated LMC mass from the OCS.

 - **Abstract**
 Cassiopeia A (Cas A) is the youngest known core-collapse supernova remnant (SNR) in the Galaxy and is perhaps the best-studied SNR in X-rays. Cas A has a line-rich spectrum dominated by thermal emission and given its high flux, it is an appealing target for high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy. Cas A was observed at two different locations during the Performance Verification phase of the XRISM mission, one location in the southeastern part (SE) of the remnant and one in the northwestern part (NW). This paper serves as an overview of these observations and discusses some of the issues relevant for the analysis of the data. We present maps of the so-called ``spatial-spectral mixing'' effect due to the fact that the XRISM point-spread function is larger than a pixel in the Resolve calorimeter array. We analyze spectra from two bright, on-axis regions such that the effects of spatial-spectral mixing are minimized. We find that it is critical to include redshifts/blueshifts and broadening of the emission lines in the two thermal components to achieve a reasonable fit given the high spectral resolution of the Resolve calorimeter. We fit the spectra with two versions of the AtomDB atomic database (3.0.9 and 3.1.0) and two versions of the SPEX (3.08.00 and 3.08.01*) spectral fitting software. Overall we find good agreement between AtomDB 3.1.0 and SPEX 3.08.01* for the spectral models considered in this paper. The most significant difference we found between AtomDB 3.0.9 and 3.1.0 and between AtomDB 3.1.0 and SPEX 3.08.01* is the Ni abundance, with the new atomic data favoring a considerably lower (up to a factor of 3) Ni abundance. Both regions exhibit significantly enhanced abundances compared to Solar values indicating that supernova ejecta dominate the emission in these regions. We find that the abundance ratios of Ti/Fe, Mn/Fe, \& Ni/Fe are significantly lower in the NW than the SE.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the 2025 release of the spectral synthesis code Cloudy, highlighting significant enhancements to the scope and accuracy of the physics which have been made since the previous release. A major part of this development involves resolving the Lyman $\alpha$ line into $j$-resolved fine-structure doublets, making Cloudy of use to the X-ray community. On this front, we have also updated inner-shell ionization line energies and incorporated the 1 keV feature commonly observed in X-ray binaries. Additionally, we update our in-house database, Stout, for the carbon isoelectronic sequence, improving Cloudy microphysical calculations for all wavelengths. We have also extended the molecular network by adding new silicon-bearing species, titanium-related reactions, and phosphorus-containing molecules, enhancing Cloudy's ability to model the complex chemistry relevant to rapidly growing field of exoplanet atmospheres. Finally, we outline future developments aimed at maximizing the scientific return from the current and upcoming generation of observatories, including XRISM, JWST, Roman, the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) and NewAthena.

          Revisiting the Proper Motions of M31 and M33 Using Massive Supergiant Stars with Gaia DR3

Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA)

 - **Abstract**
 The proper motions (PMs) of M31 and M33 are key to understanding the Local Group's dynamical evolution. However, measurement discrepancies between Gaia blue and red samples, regarding whether the transverse velocity is remarkable, introduce significant ambiguity. In this work, we remeasure the systemic PMs of M31 and M33 using massive supergiant stars from Gaia Data Release 3. Clean disk tracers are selected via color-color diagrams, with foreground contaminants removed through kinematic and astrometric cuts. We identify the discrepancy in M31's blue and red samples as arising from systematic differences between Gaia's 5-parameter (5p) and 6-parameter (6p) astrometric solutions. The 6p solution, applied to sources lacking accurate color information, relies on a pseudo-color approximation, leading to lower precision and larger uncertainties. Two key limitations of the 6p solution are: 1) degraded astrometric accuracy for very red sources (GBP - GRP > 2.6); 2) significant PM zero-point offsets. In our sample, red sources are dominated by the 6p solution, while blue sources include a substantial fraction of 5p sources; this mismatch drives the observed discrepancy. By excluding extreme red sources and calibrating PM zero-points separately for 5p and 6p sources using background quasars, we reduce the discrepancy, bringing blue and red measurements into agreement within 1 sigma. We ultimately report the most robust Gaia-based PMs using high-quality 5p sources. For M31, we obtain ({\mu}_{\alpha}*, {\mu}_{\delta})_M31 = (45.9 +/- 8.1, -20.5 +/- 6.6) {\mu}as/yr, consistent with, but more precise than, the HST result. For M33, we find ({\mu}_{\alpha}*, {\mu}_{\delta})_M33 = (45.3 +/- 9.7, 26.3 +/- 7.3) {\mu}as/yr, agreeing with VLBA measurement within 1.5 sigma. These results support a first infall scenario for M33.

          Equation vs. AI: Predict Density and Measure Width of molecular clouds by Multiscale Decomposition

 - **Abstract**
 Interstellar medium widely exists in the universe at multi-scales. In this study, we introduce the {\it Multi-scale Decomposition Reconstruction} method, an equation-based model designed to derive width maps of interstellar medium structures and predict their volume density distribution in the plane of the sky from input column density data. This approach applies the {\it Constrained Diffusion Algorithm}, based on a simple yet common physical picture: as molecular clouds evolve to form stars, the density of interstellar medium increases while their scale decreases. Extensive testing on simulations confirms that this method accurately predicts volume density with minimal error. Notably, the equation-based model performs comparably or even more accurately than the AI-based DDPM model(Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models), which relies on numerous parameters and high computational resources. Unlike the "black-box" nature of AI, our equation-based model offers full transparency, making it easier to interpret, debug, and validate. Their simplicity, interpretability, and computational efficiency make them indispensable not only for understanding complex astrophysical phenomena but also for complementing and enhancing AI-based methods.

          GW231123 Formation from Population III Stars: Isolated Binary Evolution

 - **Abstract**
 GW231123 is a merger of two black holes (BHs) whose inferred masses exceed $100\;{\rm M}_\odot$ typically; they are the most massive BHs among those discovered by gravitational wave (GW) observations. We examine if GW231123-like events can be formed from isolated Population (Pop) III binary stars by means of binary population synthesis calculations. We find that Pop III isolated binary stars can create GW231123-like events at a rate large enough to explain the discovery of GW231123, if two conditions are satisfied. First, Pop III stars evolve with inefficient convective overshooting, and second the $^{12}{\rm C}(\alpha,\gamma)^{16}{\rm O}$ rate is $2\sigma$ lower than the standard value. On the other hand, GW190521, which is the most massive BHs in Gravitational Wave Transient Catalog 3, can be formed from isolated Pop III binary stars even if the $^{12}{\rm C}(\alpha,\gamma)^{16}{\rm O}$ rate is the standard value. We reveal that the discovery of GW231123 is progressively putting constraints on possible parameter ranges of single star evolution models, assuming that all the GW events are formed through isolated binary evolution.

          A Catalog of Forty-two Heartbeat Stars Discovered in TESS Data

 - **Abstract**
 Heartbeat stars (HBSs) are ideal laboratories for studying the formation and evolution of binary stars in eccentric orbits and their internal tidal interactions. We present 42 new HBSs discovered based on TESS photometric data. Their light curves are modeled by using a corrected version of Kumar et al.'s model or the PHOEBE binary model code. Tidally excited oscillations (TEOs) are detected in ten systems, with most pulsation phases can be explained by the dominant being $l=2$, $m=0$, or $\pm2$ spherical harmonic. For TIC 156846634, the harmonic with large deviation ($>3\sigma$) can be expected to be a traveling wave or nonadiabatic. The $n$ = 16 harmonic in TIC 184413651 may not be considered as a TEO candidate due to its large deviation ($>2\sigma$) and lower amplitude. Moreover, TIC 92828790 shows no TEOs but exhibits a significant gamma Doradus pulsation. The eccentricity-period (e$-$P) relation also shows a positive correlation between eccentricity and period, as well as the existence of orbital circularization. The Hertzsprung-Russell diagram shows that TESS HBSs have higher temperatures and greater luminosities than Kepler HBSs. This significantly enhances the detectability of massive HBSs and those containing TEOs. Currently, the search for HBSs using TESS data has become a research focus, and these intriguing objects may serve as valuable additions to the TESS HBS catalog.

 - **Abstract**
 The vertical settling of dust grains in a circumstellar disk, characterized by their scale height, is a pivotal process in the formation of planets. This study offers in-depth analysis and modeling of the radial scale height profile of dust grains in the HL Tau system, leveraging high-resolution polarization observations. We resolve the inner disk's polarization, revealing a significant near-far side asymmetry, with the near side being markedly brighter than the far side in polarized intensity. This asymmetry is attributed to a geometrically thick inner dust disk, suggesting a large aspect ratio of $H/R \ge 0.15$. The first ring at 20 au exhibits an azimuthal contrast, with polarization enhanced along the minor axis, indicating a moderately thick dust ring with $H/R \approx 0.1$. The absence of the near-far side asymmetry at larger scales implies a thin dust layer, with $H/R < 0.05$. Taken together, these findings depict a disk with a turbulent inner region and a settled outer disk, requiring a variable turbulence model with $\alpha$ increasing from $10^{-5}$ at 100 au to $10^{-2.5}$ at 20 au. This research sheds light on dust settling and turbulence levels within protoplanetary disks, providing valuable insights into the mechanisms of planet formation.

 - **Abstract**
 Characterizing the atmospheres of exoplanets and brown dwarfs is crucial for understanding their atmospheric physics and chemistry, searching for biosignatures, and investigating their formation histories. Recent advances in observational techniques, combining adaptive optics with high-resolution spectrographs, have enabled detailed spectroscopic analysis for directly imaged faint companions. In this paper, we report an atmospheric retrieval on the L-type brown dwarf HR 7672 B using a near-infrared high-contrast high-resolution spectrograph, REACH (Y, J, H band, $R\sim100,000$), which combines SCExAO with IRD at the Subaru Telescope. Our model, developed based on the ExoJAX spectrum code, simultaneously accounts for several factors, including the presence of clouds in the L dwarf's atmosphere as well as contamination from the host star's light and telluric absorption lines in the observed spectra. Our analysis identified H2O and FeH as the primary absorbers in the observed J- and H-band spectra. Additionally, the observed features were reproduced with a model that includes cloud opacity, assuming an optically thick cloud at the pressure $P_\mathrm{top}$. The resulting temperature at the cloud top pressure suggests the potential formation of clouds composed of TiO2, Al2O3, or Fe. This study is the first science demonstration for faint spectra obtained by REACH, providing a foundation for future investigations into the atmospheres of exoplanets and brown dwarfs.

 - **Abstract**
 Symbiotic stars, which generally comprise a red giant and an accreting white dwarf, are excellent laboratories to understand mass transfer in wide binaries, with application to a wide family of systems. One of the fundamental questions is how mass is transferred from the red giant to the white dwarf. We use interferometric measurements made with the VLTI/PIONIER instrument, combined with Gaia data, to measure the radius of the giant in seven symbiotic systems. We further place the giants in the H-R diagramme, which allows us to estimate their mass and to show that they are all very evolved and likely on the asymptotic giant branch. We compare our measured giant radii to their Roche-lobe radius and show that, except for ZZ CMi, all giants are well within their Roche lobe and that mass transfer likely takes place via stellar wind. Our interferometric data provide further evidence that the giant in ZZ CMi (nearly) fills its Roche lobe. Our conclusions are still hampered by the poor characterisation of some of the giants or their binary orbit, and we encourage the community to make an effort to provide these.

 Dark100 is a planned array of six telescopes, using the Panoramic Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (PANOSETI) telescope system. It will operate as an imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescope array, with a telescope design and array layout optimized for accessing gamma rays with tens of TeV to PeV energies. The science goals of Dark100 include the search for ultra-heavy dark matter, observations of Galactic Pevatrons, and the search for ultra-fast optical transients. Rejection of background cosmic rays is key to the sensitivity of the array. We present a first study of gamma/hadron separation based on simulated gamma rays and protons, focusing on the impact of the hadronic background models used in CORSIKA.

 - **Abstract**
 Propagating fluctuations within accretion disks are known to induce multi-wavelength variability across diverse timescales. While these fluctuations have been widely invoked to explain rapid timing phenomena within the inner disk region in the frequency domain, observational signatures of outer-disk fluctuations propagating in the time domain remain sparse. Here, we present an analysis of observations by the Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope (HXMT) during the 2023 outburst of the newly discovered low-mass black hole X-ray binary Swift J1727.8-1613. Follow-up, high-cadence monitoring reveals intense variability in disk emission, attributable to fluctuations in the accretion rate. These disk fluctuations exhibit damped amplitudes and shortened flare periods. We interpret these features as observational evidence of fluctuations originating at and propagating from large radii, supported by fitting the disk light curves with a propagating fluctuation model. Furthermore, we propose that a plausible mechanism driving these fluctuations is the cyclical propagation of heating and cooling fronts in the context of the disk instability model. This work bridges theoretical predictions with time-domain observations, offering critical insights into the dynamic processes governing accretion disks.

 - **Abstract**
 The Tianlai Cylinder Pathfinder Array consists of three adjacent cylindrical reflectors fixed on the ground, each 40 meters long and 15 meters wide, with the cylinder axis oriented along the North-South (N-S)direction. Dual linear polarisation feeds are distributed along the focus line, parallel to the cylinder axis. Measurement of the primary beam profile of these cylindrical reflectors is difficult, as they are too large to be placed in an anechoic chamber. While the beam profile along the East-West (E-W) direction can be measured with the transit observations of bright astronomical radio sources, the beam profile along the N-S direction remains very uncertain. We present a preliminary measurement of the beam profile of the Tianlai cylindrical antenna along both the N-S direction and E-W direction in the frequency range of 700-800 MHz, using a calibrator source carried by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) flying in the far field. The beam profile of the Tianlai cylindrical antenna is determined from the analysis of the auto-correlation signals from the the cylinder array correlator, taking into account the emitter antenna beam profile, itself measured with a dipole antenna on the ground. The accuracy of the UAV-based determination of the cylinder beam profiles is validated by comparing the results with the one derived from bright astronomical source transits, and with simulated beams.

 - **Abstract**
 The analysis of precise Gaia DR3 astrometry in the LMC region has revealed asymmetric patterns in the bar quadrupole and the disc outskirts of the LMC in-plane velocity maps. We aim to quantify the asymmetries detected in the LMC radial and residual tangential velocity maps, and determine whether they are generated naturally due to the LMC's interaction with the SMC. We analyse the velocity maps of different simulations from the KRATOS suite of N-body simulations of the LMC-SMC-MW system, proposing a new methodology to quantify the kinematic asymmetry in the bar and the outskirts of the disc. We also transform the KRATOS simulations into Gaia mock catalogues to confirm that the asymmetric signature in the LMC is not an effect of observational uncertainties. In addition, we investigate the possibility of a classification bias in the neural network classifier of the Gaia optimal sample. In the KRATOS simulations of the LMC and SMC interaction, the dynamical effect of the SMC passages produces a displacement of the bar and asymmetries in the LMC velocity maps. By comparing the velocity maps of mock catalogues of the future Gaia data releases DR4, DR5 and GaiaNIR, we find that the asymmetric signature in the bar quadrupole is independent of observational errors. We thereby confirm that it is a consequence of the interaction of the LMC with the SMC. We also find a classification bias in the neural network classifier, indicating that the outer disc asymmetry observed in the optimal sample is artificial. The analysis of the KRATOS simulations reveals that the interaction of the LMC with the SMC can generate asymmetric patterns in the velocity field. In the case of the Gaia DR3 LMC velocity maps we conclude that the bar quadrupole asymmetry is directly correlated with the SMC interaction, while the outer disc asymmetry is an artefact of the classifier for the optimal sample.

 - **Abstract**
 We evaluate the reliability of CNEOS-derived ephemerides of fireball events given the absence of the underlying data. We analyzed 18 events that have both (i) sufficient satellite information to derive orbits and (ii) ground-based observational counterparts. We quantify the uncertainties on these calibrated events using the orbital similarity criterion D_D. We also examine the velocity components imbalance and identify discriminants that can indicate the accuracy of an event. We identify two groups in the CNEOS database. CNEOS data produces ephemeris determinations with D_D<0.1 for fireballs reported either (i) after late 2017 or (ii) with impact energies above 0.45 kt with 74-78% of events having D_D=0.03$\pm$0.02, while ~11% show D_D<0.008. Our statistical test confirms these two parameters as the only reliable discriminants that, when combined, explain the two accuracy groups. Daylight, z-velocity component, low altitude, long duration, and latitude might also indicate errors, although the limited dataset may obscure correlations. No clear discriminants are identified for more restrictive D_D cut-offs. We provide estimates of orbital uncertainties for calibrated events. The hyperbolic fireball subset in the CNEOS database appears as an outlier in the velocity imbalance test. Our results confirm that the fidelity of CNEOS fireball data improved significantly from 2018, likely due to the deployment of next-generation space sensors, and show a growing number of high-velocity events. Hyperbolic candidates should be interpreted with caution, as their velocities and inclinations likely reflect measurement errors. Accuracy constraints remain limited by the dataset size, as evidenced by the lack of statistically significant dependence on duration, preventing strong conclusions from being drawn.

 - **Abstract**
 This study proposes a unified framework comprising two complementary approaches to constrain three functional forms of $f(T,B)$ gravity, namely the linear, quadratic, and general power law models, by jointly utilizing early and late Universe observations. First, we impose bounds on deviations in the weak interaction freeze-out temperature, informed by the latest measurements of the primordial helium-4 mass fraction. Second, we incorporate direct Hubble parameter data, $H(\mathcal{z})$, obtained from Cosmic Chronometers in the redshift range $0.07\le\mathcal{z}\le2.0$, to trace the expansion history of the Universe. By minimizing a combined chi-square statistic across both datasets, we derive the best-fit values and confidence intervals for each model parameter. The joint analysis significantly refines the parameter constraints compared to methods based solely on Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, thereby offering a more robust test of $f(T,B)$ gravity across cosmic epochs. The results support the viability of torsion-based modifications to General Relativity and provide a consistent methodology for future evaluation using upcoming observational data.

 - **Abstract**
 Temperature programmed desorption (TPD) is a well-known technique to study gas-surface processes, and it is characterized by two main quantities: the adsorbate binding energy and the pre-exponential factor. While the former has been well addressed in recent years by both experimental and computational methods, the latter remains somewhat ill-defined, and different schemes have been proposed in the literature for its evaluation. In the astrochemistry context, binding energies and pre-exponential factors are key parameters that enter microkinetic models for studying the evolution over time of the chemical species in the universe. In this paper, we studied, by computer simulations, the effect of different pre-exponential factor models using water, ammonia, and methanol adsorbed on amorphous and crystalline ices as test cases: specifically, the one most widely used by the astrochemical community (Herbst-Hasegawa), the models provided by Tait and Campbell, and an extension of the Tait formulation including the calculation of the vibrational partition function. We suggest the methods proposed by Tait and Campbell that provide TPD temperature peaks within 30 K of each other while avoiding demanding quantum mechanical calculations, as they are based on tabulated data. Finally, when the explicit inclusion of the vibrational partition function is needed, we propose a cost-effective strategy to include all the thermal contributions in the partition functions without the need for performing a full vibrational calculation of the whole system.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a framework for the computation of effective stellar yields that accounts for a mixed population of binary and single stars under an adjustable mix of binary evolution settings: the binary fraction, the accretion efficiencies of winds, Roche-lobe overflow, and supernovae. We emphasise the critical need for more complete yield coverage of the binary nucleosynthesis and evolution, without which the ability to make accurate predictions on the true role of binarity on GCE calculations is hamstrung. We also provide clear guidelines for future stellar modelling works to ensure their results are maximally useful to the wider community. We compute effective stellar yields using detailed binary stellar yields accounting for binary induced mass-loss from a solar-metallicity donor star. We study the effect of varying the binary mixture and accretion efficiencies, and consider a range of models for the treatment of accreted material on the secondary in detail. In the absence of detailed binary yields for the secondary, we put forth a model for the composition of accreted material that preserves the signature of the primary's nuclear processing within the post-mass-transfer secondary yields. Among the binary parameters, we find that the binary fraction, which determines the ratio of binary and single star systems, has the most significant effect on the effective stellar yields, with widespread impact across most isotopes. In contrast, varying the accretion efficiencies produces comparatively minor changes. We also find that the binary fraction has a significant influence on the logarithmic elemental abundance ratios relative to H present in the effective yield; this impact is largest for the lower-mass primaries.

 - **Abstract**
 The Planck measurement of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) has established the $\Lambda$-cold-dark-matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model as the concordant model along with other observations. However, recent measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration have renewed the matter fraction $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$ tension between DESI-$\Lambda$CDM and Planck-$\Lambda$CDM. Directly reconciling this CMB-BAO tension with a dynamical DE in Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization seems to imply a crossing of the equation-of-state through $w=-1$ at low redshifts. In this letter, we will illustrate with a string-theory-motivated model that, when the DM non-minimally couples to gravity via a quintessence field, a misidentification with the $w_0w_a$CDM model would exactly fake such a crossing behavior, while the coupled quintessence never crosses $w=-1$ but behaves as a standard CDM in the early Universe and approaches a cosmological constant in the late Universe. Such a non-minimal coupling is preferred over $3\sigma$ confidence level. The worsened $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$ tension and $S_8$ tension in the $w_0w_a$CDM model are also resolved in our model.

 - **Abstract**
 Distant prograde orbits around the Moon exhibit remarkable potential for practical applications such as cislunar surveillance activities and low-energy transfers due to their instability. Previous works on transfers from circular low Earth orbit to distant prograde orbits mainly focused on construction methods based on dynamical structures, lacking a comprehensive analysis of the solution space of this transfer scenario. This paper investigates the solution space and identifies families of transfers from a 167 km circular low Earth orbit to a 1:1 distant prograde orbit. In particular, grid search and trajectory continuation are performed to construct these transfer trajectories. Initial guesses of the transfers are selected in the 1:1 distant prograde orbit through a backward propagation strategy and are then corrected to satisfy specified constraints. Based on the obtained solutions, a linear predictor is derived to predict more feasible solutions and a predictor-corrector continuation method is used to extend the solution space. Twelve transfer families are identified, most of which are new or previously underexplored. The distributions of construction parameters and transfer characteristics of these twelve families are analyzed and discussed, showing which families are applicable to which types of specific practical missions. Comparison between the obtained solution and solution developed by previous works is further performed to imply the effects of the selection of dynamical model on transfer construction.

 - **Abstract**
 Spectroscopic and photometric variability is widespread among O-type supergiants. It is linked to various phenomena affecting the star and its circumstellar environment, thereby providing direct information concerning them. To investigate such connections, we decided to revisit the prototypical O7.5 Iabf supergiant HD 192639. High-cadence spectroscopic monitoring was performed simultaneously with intensive space-borne photometric observations. The data were analysed with several methods to characterise the variability. Besides the usual stochastic, low-frequency photometric variability, our observations reveal the presence of recurrent - but transient - modulations on a timescale of about five days. The same signal is present in the spectroscopic data and was already seen two decades ago. This stability suggests that this timescale corresponds to the stellar rotation. Furthermore, our observations unveil, for the first time, an unusually strong dimming event in the light curve associated with absorption and emission changes in H I and He I lines. This unprecedented trough corresponds to an episodic ejection of a rather large amount of mass (its column density being comparable to that of the steady wind). While rare, such an event could hint at an overlooked aspect of mass loss in massive stars.

          Thermoelastic Contraction as a Suppressor of Atmospheric Escape in Close-in Exoplanets

 - **Abstract**
 The long-term retention of substantial atmospheres in close-in exoplanets presents a major challenge to classical hydrodynamic escape theory, which predicts rapid mass loss under intense stellar irradiation. In this work, we propose a fully classical, interior-driven suppression mechanism based on thermoelastic contraction of the planetary mantle. By incorporating pressure- and temperature-dependent elastic deformation into the structural evolution of the planet, we demonstrate that radial contraction can lead to measurable increases in surface escape velocity. We analytically derive a modified escape condition and introduce a dimensionless suppression index Xi that quantifies the extent to which internal mechanical response inhibits atmospheric loss. Numerical simulations across a wide parameter space show that volumetric strain values in the range 0.005 to 0.01 can enhance escape velocities by up to 10 percent, leading to a reduction in energy-limited escape rates by over 50 percent. When applied to warm mini-Neptunes such as GJ 1214b, K2-18b, and TOI-270c, the model successfully accounts for their persistent atmospheres without invoking exotic stellar conditions or chemical outliers. Our results indicate that planetary elasticity, often neglected in escape models, plays a first-order role in shaping the atmospheric evolution of close-in worlds. The theory yields specific observational predictions, including suppressed outflow signatures and radius anomalies, which may be testable with JWST, ARIEL, and future spectroscopic missions.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the clustering of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) within the framework of Excursion Set Theory (EST). The EST formalism is extended to compute the joint probability of forming PBH pairs within a clustering distance, based on two stochastic trajectories with a shared history. Our results show that an enhanced power spectrum not only increases the formation of PBHs in specific mass ranges but also enhances their clustering probability. We find a one-to-one correspondence between the blue-tilted spectral index and the mass ranges in which PBHs form and cluster. Additionally, we demonstrate that the clustering probability decreases asymptotically with increasing clustering distance, while a higher critical density threshold (barrier) leads to a suppression of clustering abundance.

 - **Abstract**
 The increasing availability of high-quality optical and near-infrared spectroscopic data, as well as advances in modelling techniques, have greatly expanded the scientific potential of spectroscopic studies. However, the software tools needed to fully exploit this potential often remain fragmented across multiple specialised packages, requiring scripting skills and manual integration to handle complex workflows. In this paper we present SPAN (SPectral ANalysis), a cross-platform, Python-based Graphical User Interface (GUI) software that unifies the essential tools for modern spectral analysis within a single, user-friendly environment. While SPAN can be used with a variety of spectroscopic targets, its primary focus is the analysis of unresolved galaxy spectra. SPAN allows users to extract 1D spectra from FITS images and datacubes, perform spectral processing (e.g. Doppler correction, continuum modelling, denoising), and carry out detailed analyses, including line-strength measurements, stellar and gas kinematics, and stellar population studies, using both built-in routines and the widely adopted pPXF algorithm for full spectral fitting. It runs natively on Windows, Linux, macOS, and Android, and is fully task-driven, requiring no prior coding experience. We validate SPAN by comparing its output with existing pipelines and literature studies. By offering a flexible, accessible, and well integrated environment, SPAN simplifies and accelerates the spectral analysis workflow, while maintaining scientific accuracy.

          The Second Stellar Spectrum: Rotating hot massive star linear spectropolarimetry with the Ohman Effect

 - **Abstract**
 To understand better the polarized radiative transfer near the surface of rotating massive stars that remain nearly spherically symmetric, we use plane-parallel stellar atmosphere models to explore the unique opportunity presented by the Ohman effect. This effect refers to the predicted variation in linear polarization across a rotationally broadened absorption line, due to the interaction of that line with the spatially varying continuum polarization across the face of a strongly scattering photosphere, such as found in hot stars. Even if the rotation is weak enough for the star to remain spherically symmetric, the Ohman effect persists because differential absorption induced by the rotational Doppler shift of the line breaks the symmetry that would otherwise cancel the continuum polarization in the absence of that line. Neglecting rotational distortion effects, the net polarization across the line vanishes, yet resolved line profiles display a telltale triple-peak polarization pattern, with one strong polarization peak at line center and two smaller ones in the line wings at a position angle that is rotated 90 degrees from the line center. The far ultraviolet (FUV) is emphasized because both the polarization amplitude and the specific luminosity are greatest there for photospheres with effective temperatures between about 15,000 and 20,000K. There is a high density of spectral lines in the FUV, leading to a rich "second stellar spectrum" in linear polarization (analogous to the "second solar spectrum") that is made observable with stellar rotation. Polarizations at the level of 0.1% to 1% are achievable across individual lines for a wide variety of B-type stars. We highlight the prospects for accessing the unique information encoded in the Ohman effect with future moderate-resolution spaceborne spectropolarimetric missions in the FUV.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent LHAASO observations hint at potential spectral hardening around 20 TeV in M87's very high energy (VHE) emission, suggesting a possible new radiation component. In this work, we construct averaged multiwavelength SEDs by combining data from Chandra and Swift-UVOT/XRT covering the same period as the LHAASO detection to investigate the origin of this feature. We test several radiation mechanisms, including the pp interaction, proton synchrotron emission, photomeson process and two-zone leptonic model. We find that only the pion decay gamma rays in pp interactions can interpret this feature in the framework of the one-zone model. With analytical analysis, we prove that proton synchrotron emission cannot generate a hard spectrum above 0.17~TeV. For photomeson model, it requires an emission zone compressed near the Schwarzschild radius of the central supermassive black hole, incompatible with broadband optical-GeV spectral constraints. In addition, the two-zone leptonic model also emerges as a viable alternative.

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of certain proton-rich isotopes in the solar system, particularly $^{92,94}{\rm Mo}$ and $^{96,98}{\rm Ru}$, has been a long-standing puzzle. A promising explanation is the $\nu p$-process, which is posited to operate in the neutrino-driven outflows that form inside core-collapse supernovae after shock revival. Recent studies have identified several relevant physical effects that influence the yields of this process. The impact of General Relativity (GR) on the $\nu p$-process yields, however, remains unexplored. In this work, we perform a comparative analysis of the time-integrated yields of the $p$ nuclei up to $A \lesssim 105$ in Newtonian and fully GR neutrino-driven outflows, using a detailed model of a time-evolving outflow profile. The two main GR effects are the gravitational shift of neutrino energies and post-Newtonian corrections to the gravitational potential. These effects together suppress the production of seed nuclei, significantly boosting the $\nu p$-process yields in our 18 $M_\odot$ progenitor model. Most of the production of the crucial $^{92,94}{\rm Mo}$ and $^{96,98}{\rm Ru}$ $p$ isotopes in this model occurs in an optimal time window, 1-3 seconds after shock revival. Interestingly, the same does not apply to the shielded isotope $^{92}{\rm Nb}$, a large fraction of which is produced in the subsequent ejecta. The impact of GR on this isotope is especially large, with its final abundance boosted by a factor of 25 compared to a Newtonian calculation. In our 12.75 $M_\odot$ model, an additional GR effect is observed: the outflow transitions to the supersonic regime several seconds into the explosion, causing the yields to drop. This study quantifies the important role GR effects play in the $\nu p$-process and provides guidance for identifying optimal conditions in future self-consistent supernova simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 Cross-correlations between a gravitational tracer of dark matter and the contribution to the unresolved gamma-ray background (UGRB) from the radiation produced by the annihilation of the particles responsible for the dark matter, have been established as a powerful tool to investigate the particle physics nature of dark matter. Cross-correlations of the UGRB with galaxy catalogs, cluster catalogs and weak lensing have indeed been measured. In this paper we study statistical techniques that could improve the sensitivity of the cross-correlation techniques on the bounds that can be set to the particle dark matter physical properties. The two methods that we investigate are the application of a Wiener filter and the exploitation of the full multi-tracer information. After identifying the optimal strategies, we show that the adoption of a Wiener filter in the cross-correlation analysis can improve the sensitivity to the dark matter annihilation rate by a factor of 2/2.5 as compared to the standard analysis where no filter is applied. The inclusion of the full multi-tracer information can improve the sensitivity up to a factor of 5 for dark matter masses below about 50 GeV, the Wiener filter remaining the best option for heavier dark matter.

 Hot subdwarf B (sdB) stars are post-main-sequence stars of high temperature and gravity. Approximately 30$\%$ of sdBs exhibit stable pressure and/or gravity-mode pulsations, which can be used via the timing method to test for companion stars and determine their orbital solutions. We used short cadence data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) to search for previously undiscovered companions to sdBs. In this paper, we focus on searching for companions with orbital periods shorter than 13.5$\,$d which are detectable within one sector of TESS data (about 27$\,d$). The timing method requires that we derive pulsation frequencies in subsets of data significantly shorter than the periods we are searching for, which we set at 0.5 to 1.5$\,$d. We investigated ten sdB stars with previously detected p-mode pulsations for which at least one p-mode pulsation remains detectable with a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) $>$ 4 within data subsets of duration 0.5 - 1.5$\,$d. We find that two (TIC$\,$202354658 and TIC$\,$69298924) of these ten sdB stars likely have white dwarf companions and set limits on companion masses for the other eight sdB stars.

 Near-Earth objects (NEOs) have the potential to cause extensive damage and loss of life on Earth. Advancements in NEO discovery, trajectory prediction, and deflection technology indicate that an impact could be prevented, with sufficient warning time. We derive an impact frequency of NEOs 140m and larger, using the NEOMOD2 NEO population model and JPL Horizons. We then place that frequency in context with other preventable causes of death; allowing for comparison between a planet-wide event and individual events that cause fatalities such as car crashes and carbon monoxide poisoning. We find that the chance of a $>140$ m asteroid hitting the Earth is more likely than the chance of an individual being struck by lightning.

 - **Abstract**
 In current cosmological simulations, the radiative transfer modules generally rely on the M_1 approximation, which has some glaring flaws related to its fluid-like behaviour, such as spurious pseudo-sources and loss of directionality when radiation fronts from different directions collide. P_n, another moment-based model used in other fields of physics, may correct these issues. We aim at testing out P_n in an astrophysical setting and compare it to M_1, in order to see if it can indeed correct M_1's flaws. Also, we want to use P_n's solutions to better pinpoint M_1 errors. We implement a P_n radiation transport method and couple it to a photo-thermo-chemistry module to account for the interaction of ionising radiation with the Hydrogen gas, and benchmark it using tests for radiative transfer models comparison in astrophysics as defined in arXiv:astro-ph/0603199. We find that high order P_n (e.g. P_9) indeed correct M_1's flaws, while faring as well or even better in some aspects in the tests, in particular when directionality is important or colliding radiation fronts occur. By comparing P_9 and M_1 radiation fields in an idealised and cosmological test case, we highlight a new, thus far unreported artefact of M_1, the 'dark sombrero'. A dark sombrero appears as a spherical photon-deficit shell around the source. The photon density in dark sombreros can be underestimated by a factor up to 2-3. They occur in regions where a source's radiation field connects with that of another source or group of sources. These basic properties (position and amplitude) of the dark sombreros may depend on the sources' relative intensities, positions, spatial resolution, although we have not been able to test this in detail in this study.

 - **Abstract**
 3I/ATLAS, also known as C/2025 N1 (ATLAS), is the third known interstellar object to pass through our Solar System. We report serendipitous Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observations of 3I/ATLAS taken between 2025-05-07 and 2025-06-02,, 55 days prior to the discovery date (2025-07-01) and 14 days prior to the current earliest observation (2025-05-21). We retrieve the TESS pixel data, perform a robust background correction and use a data-driven approach to refine the object's ephemeris. We find a statistically significant offset between the target's observed and predicted positions and we show that this is dominated by uncertainty in the TESS World Coordinate System (WCS) rather than the ephemeris. 3I/ATLAS is too faint to be detected in the individual 200\,second TESS integrations, so we perform image stacking to improve detectability. After co-adding the TESS image data, we performed aperture and Pixel Response Function (PRF) photometry to create two light curves for 3I/ATLAS. Each light curve consists of 15 measurements with $\text{SNR}>3$, collected across two different TESS cameras during the 26\,days that the object was observed, but the PRF light curve is more robust against image noise. The PRF light curve in the TESS bandpass shows a gradual increase in brightness from $T_{\text{mag}} = 20.9 \pm 0.29$ to $T_{\text{mag}} = 19.57 \pm 0.15$. This is expected as 3I/ATLAS approaches the inner Solar System. This paper highlights the power of using TESS for Solar System science; by increasing the photometric observing baseline, future studies will be able to investigate the long-term behavior of 3I/ATLAS

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze photometry, spectra, and variability of over 100 faint X-ray sources in the globular cluster Terzan 5, using 737 ks of Chandra data. X-ray colors and spectral fitting allow clear separation of foreground sources (with less extinction than the cluster), quiescent low-mass X-ray binaries (qLMXBs), and sources with harder spectra. We identify 22 candidate qLMXBs, over twice that found in any other cluster. This is consistent with Terzan 5's stellar interaction rate, the highest among Galactic globular clusters. We do not see qLMXBs dominated by thermal emission below $L_X\sim10^{32}$ erg/s, though qLMXBs with stronger nonthermal emission could be missed. We find that more than 50 % of the qLMXB sources have neutron star thermal component contributing over 80 % of the total luminosity. We report an unusual spectral feature around 1.75 keV in the combined spectrum of Ter 5 X-3. The concentration of the qLMXBs within the cluster is consistent with that of a population of mass $1.46 \pm 0.14$ M$_\odot$. We identify secure X-ray counterparts to millisecond pulsars Terzan 5 ar and Terzan 5 at, using positional coincidence and orbital X-ray light curves matching those expected for spider pulsars.

 - **Abstract**
 As part of the JWST GTO program MINDS, we analyze the mid-infrared emission of three Class II binary systems: VW Cha, WX Cha, and RW Aur, to investigate the impact of stellar multiplicity on the chemistry and physics of their inner disk. We analyze the 1D spectrum from JWST/MIRI-MRS for primary and secondary disks separately, extracted by combining forward modeling with a theoretical PSF and aperture photometry. We modeled the molecular lines with 0D slab models. We interpret the results by comparing our JWST spectra to VLT/CRIRES+, Spitzer/IRS, and ALMA. Primary and secondary disks are dramatically different in their mid-infrared emission, with primary disks showing H2O-rich spectra, and secondary disks being mostly line poor to the sensitivity of our spectra. When comparing MIRI-MRS to Spitzer/IRS, we observe large variability in the line emission of VW Cha A, as well as in the continuum of RW Aur A. The disks around VW Cha BC and RW Aur B show evidence of ionizing radiation, and a further comparison with ALMA at high angular resolution dust continuum suggest that the spectrum of RW Aur B is well explained by its ~4 au cavity. All the systems show [Ne II] jet emission, and three of them also show spatially resolved emission structures in H2, likely originated by outflows and dynamical interactions. Many of the observed features in the primary disks, such as enhanced water emission, could be linked to the increased accretion and radial drift produced by dynamical disk truncation. However, additional mechanisms are needed to explain the large differences between primary and secondary disks, potentially inner disk substructures. This work is an example of the need for combining multiple facilities to fully understand the observations from JWST.

 - **Abstract**
 EDGES-3 is the third iteration of the EDGES experiment, designed to measure the predicted global absorption feature in the radio spectrum produced by neutral hydrogen gas at cosmic dawn, a critical observation determining when and how the first stars populated the universe. The EDGES-3 instrument has been redesigned to include both the analog and digital electronics within the antenna, allowing for in-situ calibration and removal of the lossy balun found in EDGES-2. EDGES-3 has been on multiple deployments in the past 4 years; to Oregon, Devon Island, Adak Island, and is currently installed and taking data in the outback of Western Australia. This paper provides an accounting of the challenges inherent in the detection of the global, cosmological 21-cm signal, the strategies EDGES employs to mitigate each of these challenges, a description of the instrument, and a report on the Western Australia deployment along with observational data.

 - **Abstract**
 The space-based CUbesat Solar Polarimeter (CUSP) mission aims to measure the linear polarization of solar flares in the hard X-ray band by means of a Compton scattering polarimeter. CUSP is a project in the framework of the Alcor Program of the Italian Space Agency aimed at developing new CubeSat missions. As part of CUSP's Phase B study, which began in December 2024 and will last one year, we present the current development status of the design solutions adopted for the mission's most critical multi-physics design drivers. These solutions have been formulated and applied to demonstrate compliance with system requirements at both the spacecraft and platform levels. In particular, we describe the mechanical design of each structural component, the results of static, dynamic finite element analyses, and a proposal for topological optimization of the interface between the platform and payload and some fixture for test, and the preliminary environmental testing campaign (e.g., vibration, shock) that will be carried out on a mechanical demonstrator.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results of a spectroscopic investigation of two Large Magellanic Cloud globular clusters, NGC 1953 and NGC 1856. Both clusters have similar ages (250 and 300 Myr, respectively). Spectra were recorded with the Michigan/Magellan Fiber System located on the Magellan-Clay 6.5m telescope. Spectra were visually inspected to assess the presence of stellar H$\alpha$ emission lines attributed to B stars rotating close to breakup velocity (Be stars). High fractions of Be stars in the cluster typically indicate the presence of a large population of fast rotating stars, predicted by some models to explain the observed split and extended main sequence. There are numerous Be star candidates in NGC 1856, exhibiting weak but broad H$\alpha$ emission. However, only one such target was detected in NGC 1953. This stark contrast between the observed populations for NGC 1856 and NGC 1953 may suggest that cluster density plays a key role in determining the fraction of Be stars. These results provide essential constraints for the different scenarios attempting to explain the bimodal distribution of rotational velocities and the multiple populations of stars observed in globular clusters. The impact of stellar radial velocity and nebular emission on photometric measures is assessed through simulations relying on the spectra. These simulations suggest that photometric studies can under-estimate the fraction of H$\alpha$ emitters in a cluster, in particular for stars with relatively weak emission features. The results also show that nebular emission has minimal impact on the photometric H$\alpha$ excesses.

          PSR J0614-3329: A NICER case for Strange Quark Stars

 - **Abstract**
 Precise measurements of neutron star masses and radii by the NICER mission impose important constraints on the nuclear equation of state. The most recent NICER measurement of PSR J0614-3329 reported an equatorial radius of $R_{eq} = 10.29^{+1.01}_{-0.86}$ km for a mass of $M = 1.44^{+0.06}_{-0.07} M_{\odot}$. Considering all the NICER measurements to date, we demonstrate using Bayesian hypothesis ranking that strange quark stars are preferred over all the physically motivated models of neutron stars compatible with this low radius. This provides a strong case for the possible existence of strange quark stars, suggesting that they should be considered among the population of compact stars during analyses of astrophysical data. Using a wide sample of equations of state, we report the nucleonic equations of state that best fit current observations and rule out one model of strange quark matter.

          Optical and near-infrared nebular-phase spectroscopy of SN 2024ggi: constraints on the structure of the inner ejecta, progenitor mass, and dust

 - **Abstract**
 We present optical and near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopic observations of the nearby Type II supernova SN\,2024ggi from 250 and 420 days after the explosion. Comparing the evolution of the [\ion{O}{1}] at 6300, 6363 \textÅ doublet normalized to the continuum with spectral models from the literature, we estimate a progenitor star zero-age main-sequence mass ($M_{\mathrm{ZAMS}}$) of $\approx 14$ M$_\odot$. This value is consistent with $M_{\mathrm{ZAMS}}$ reported in the literature from independent methodologies. The nebular spectra are used to study the structure of the inner ejecta. The broad H$\alpha$ line has a full-width at half maximum (FWHM) of $\simeq 3900$ km s$^{-1}$, with small deviations from a symmetric Gaussian profile centred at zero velocity, and the [\ion{O}{1}] doublet is blue-shifted by $\approx -940$ km s$^{-1}$. In the NIR, the nebular spectra reveal double-peaked emission features of \ion{Mg}{1} and [\ion{Fe}{2}] lines, suggesting a bipolar distribution of intermediate mass and iron peak elements in the line-of-sight. Such a double-peaked feature in these NIR lines has not been previously reported. No corresponding asymmetries are observed in the hydrogen lines, suggesting that the asymmetry is mostly confined to intermediate mass and iron peak elements in the innermost core of the supernova ejecta. Additionally, we detect first-overtone carbon monoxide (CO) emission at $2.3$ $\mu$m from 250 to 319 days in the NIR.

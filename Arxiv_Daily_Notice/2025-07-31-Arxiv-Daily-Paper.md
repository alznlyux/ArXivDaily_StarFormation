 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we define the novel splashback depth $\mathcal{D}$ and width $\mathcal{W}$ to examine how the splashback features of dark matter haloes are affected by the physical properties of haloes themselves. We use the largest simulation run in the hydrodynamic MillenniumTNG project. By stacking haloes in bins of halo mass, redshift, mass-dependent properties such as peak height and concentration, and halo formation history, we measure the shape of the logarithmic slope of the density profile of dark matter haloes. Our results show that the splashback depth has a strong dependence on the halo mass which follows a power law $\mathcal{D}\propto\left(\log_{10}M\right)^{2.8}$. Properties with strong correlation with halo mass demonstrate similar dependence. The splashback width has the strongest dependence on halo peak height and follows a power law $\mathcal{W}\propto\nu^{-0.87}$. We provide the fitting functions of the splashback depth and width in terms of halo mass, redshift, peak height, concentrations and halo formation time. The depth and width are therefore considered to be a long term memory tracker of haloes since they depend more on accumulative physical properties, e.g., halo mass, peak height and halo formation time. They are shaped primarily by the halo's assembly history, which exerts a stronger influence on the inner density profile than short-term dynamical processes. In contrast, the splashback features have little dependence on the short term factors such as halo mass accretion rate and most recent major merger time. The splashback depth and width can therefore be used to complement information gained from quantities like the point of steepest slope or truncation radius to characterise the halo's history and inner structure.

          ABC-SN: Attention Based Classifier for Supernova Spectra

 - **Abstract**
 While significant advances have been made in photometric classification ahead of the millions of transient events and hundreds of supernovae (SNe) each night that the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will discover, classifying SNe spectroscopically remains the best way to determine most subtypes of SNe. Traditional spectrum classification tools use template matching techniques (Blondin & Tonry 2007) and require significant human supervision. Two deep learning spectral classifiers, DASH (Muthukrishna et al. 2019) and SNIascore (Fremling et al. 2021) define the state of the art, but SNIascore is a binary classifier devoted to maximizing the purity of the SN Ia-norm sample, while DASH is no longer maintained and the original work suffers from contamination of multi-epoch spectra in the training and test sets. We have explored several neural network architectures in order to create a new automated method for classifying SN subtypes, settling on an attention-based model we call ABC-SN. We benchmark our results against an updated version of DASH, thus providing the community with an up-to-date general purpose SN classifier. Our dataset includes ten different SN subtypes including subtypes of SN Ia, core collapse and interacting SNe. We find that ABC-SN outperforms DASH, and we discuss the possibility that modern SN spectra datasets contain label noise which limit the performance of all classifiers.

          Field-level constraints on cosmic birefringence from hybrid ILC maps combining $E$- and $B$-mode channels

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic birefringence, arising from a potential parity-violating interaction between cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons and evolving pseudo-scalar fields such as axion-like particles, can rotate the CMB polarization plane and induce an effective correlation between the CMB $E$- and $B$-mode polarization. In this work, we introduce a hybrid internal linear combination (ILC) method that combines both $E$- and $B$-mode frequency maps into the component separation pipeline, enabling the disentanglement of correlated and uncorrelated components of CMB polarization in the presence of cosmic birefringence and instrumental polarization angle miscalibration. We derive an analytic linear relation connecting the birefringence-induced correlated component of the CMB $E$- (or $B$-) mode field to the full CMB $B$- (or $E$-) mode field convolved with a modulating field. By performing linear regression between these fields across multiple sky patches, we directly estimate the birefringence angle at the field level. This allows us to distinguish cosmic birefringence from polarization angle miscalibration and foreground contamination, as the ILC responds differently to achromatic cosmic birefringence and chromatic systematic effects, with its weights projecting spatial or harmonic dependence only onto the latter. This non-parametric, field-level approach provides a novel way to probe cosmic birefringence directly in real space. When applied to realistic simulations of the forthcoming LiteBIRD satellite mission, our method yields constraints that are competitive with, and complementary to, existing power spectrum-based analyses. When applied to Planck Release 4 (PR4) data, we find a birefringence angle of $\beta = 0.32^\circ \pm 0.12^\circ$, a $2.7\sigma$ detection that remains robust against varying sky fractions.

          One-Loop Galaxy Bispectrum: Consistent Theory, Efficient Analysis with COBRA, and Implications for Cosmological Parameters

 - **Abstract**
 We present an efficient and accurate pipeline for the analysis of the redshift-space galaxy bispectrum multipoles at one-loop order in effective field theory (EFT). We provide a systematic theory derivation based on power counting, which features the first comprehensive treatment of stochastic EFT contributions -- these are found to significantly improve the match to data. Our computational pipeline utilizes the COBRA technique that expands the linear matter power spectrum over a basis of principal components based on a singular value decomposition, allowing the cosmology dependence to be captured to sub-permille accuracy with just eight templates. This transforms the problem of computing the one-loop EFT bispectrum to a simple tensor multiplication, reducing the computation time to around a second per cosmology with negligible loss of accuracy. Using these tools, we study the cosmological information in the bispectrum by analyzing PTChallenge simulations, whose gigantic volume provides the most powerful test of the one-loop EFT bispectrum so far. We find that the one-loop prediction provides an excellent match to the bispectrum data up to $k_{\rm max}=0.15~h$ Mpc$^{-1}$, as evidenced by the precise recovery of the dark matter density $\omega_\text{cdm}$, Hubble constant $H_0$, and mass fluctuation amplitude $\sigma_8$ parameters, and the amplitude of equilateral primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG) $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm equil}$. Combined with the power spectrum, the COBRA-based one-loop bispectrum multipoles yield tighter constraints than the tree-level bispectrum monopole, with the posteriors on $\omega_{\text{cdm}}$, $H_0$, and $\sigma_8$ shrinking by 43\%, 31\%, and 4\%, respectively. This suggests that the COBRA-based bispectrum analysis will be an important tool in the interpretation of data from ongoing redshift surveys such as DESI and Euclid.

 - **Abstract**
 What is Dark Matter, and what is its concentration in the Milky Way remains an open question in physics. We show that if a significant fraction of dark matter is composed of sub-solar mass primordial black holes (PBHs), gravitational bremsstrahlung resulting from hyperbolic encounters between unbound PBHs within the galactic halos can generate distinctive chromatic gravitational-wave (GW) emission concentrated around the galactic dark matter halo, and it provides a direct window to discover such compact objects. We find that for both generalized NFW and Einasto dark matter profiles of Milky Way, the signal-to-noise ratio can be more than five in one year of observation for the upcoming ground based GW observatories Cosmic Explorer if PBH dark matter fraction $f_{\rm PBH} = 1$ over the mass range $10^{-14} M_\odot \lesssim m_{\rm PBH} \lesssim 10^{-8} M_\odot$. Our results show that the Galactic Center could appear as a GW-bright source, enabling new insights into dark matter and its distribution.

          A Decentralized Framework for Radio-interferometric Image Reconstruction

 - **Abstract**
 The advent of large aperture arrays, such as the ones currently under construction for the SKA project, allows for observing the Universe in the radio-spectrum at unprecedented resolution and sensitivity. To process the enormous amounts of data produced by these telescopes, scalable software pipelines are required. This paper helps address this by proposing a framework that allows for decentralized radio-interferometric image reconstruction, parallelizing by spatial frequency. This is achieved by creating pseudo-full-resolution problems for each node by using the local visibilities together with previous major cycle reconstructed images from the other nodes. We apply the proposed framework to both multiscale CLEAN and sparsity regularized convex reconstruction and compare them to their serial counterparts across four different data sets of varying properties in the context of two visibility partitions. We found that the parallelization framework allows for significantly improved reconstruction times for images of similar quality. This was especially the case for our larger datasets where we were able to achieve close to the optimal $2\times$ speedup.

 - **Abstract**
 We present SLIDE, a pipeline that enables transient discovery in data from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), using archival images from the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) as templates for difference imaging. We apply this pipeline to the recently released Data Preview 1 (DP1; the first public release of Rubin commissioning data) and search for transients in the resulting difference images. The image subtraction, photometry extraction, and transient detection are all performed on the Rubin Science Platform. We demonstrate that SLIDE effectively extracts clean photometry by circumventing poor or missing LSST templates. This is especially useful for transient analysis in the early years of LSST, when template coverage will be largely incomplete or when templates may be contaminated by transients present at the time of acquisition. We present multiband light curves for a sample of known transients, along with new transient candidates identified through our search. Finally, we discuss the prospects of applying this pipeline during the main LSST survey.

 - **Abstract**
 The High-Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) observatory was designed to study gamma-ray sources in the energy range between a few hundred GeV up to few hundred TeV. It is composed of 300 Water Cherenkov Detectors (WCDs) that cover a surface of approximately 22000 m${}^2$, at 4100 m a.s.l. In this study, we use the HAWC WCDs as a very large horizontal particle tracker, searching for horizontal muon rate variations by season using 1.5 years of HAWC data. We look for a possible correlation between the effective temperature and the horizontal muon rate. In order to do this, we developed a method to calculate the effective temperature for the horizontal propagation of muons. This is the first time that a search for seasonal variations in the high-altitude horizontal muon rate is reported.

 - **Abstract**
 We report improved measurements of the all flavor astrophysical neutrino spectrum with IceCube by combining complementary neutrino samples in two independent analyses. Both analyses show evidence of a harder spectrum at energies below $\sim$30~TeV compared to higher energies where the spectrum is well characterized by a power law. The spectrum is better described by a log parabola or a broken power law, the latter being the preferred model. Both, however, reject a single power law over an energy range 5~TeV-10~PeV with a significance $>4\sigma$, providing new constraints on properties of cosmic neutrino sources.

 - **Abstract**
 The IceCube South Pole Neutrino Observatory has discovered the presence of a diffuse astrophysical neutrino flux at energies of TeV and beyond using neutrino induced muon tracks and cascade events from neutrino interactions. We present two analyses sensitive to neutrino events in the energy range \SI{1}{TeV} to \SI{10}{PeV}, using more than 10 years of IceCube data. Both analyses consistently reject a neutrino spectrum following a single power-law with significance $>4\,\sigma$ in favor of a broken power law. We describe the methods implemented in the two analyses, the spectral constraints obtained, and the validation of the robustness of the results. Additionally, we report the detection of a muon neutrino in the MESE sample with an energy of $11.4^{+2.46}_{-2.53} $\,\si{PeV}, the highest energy neutrino observed by IceCube to date. The results presented here show insights into the spectral shape of astrophysical neutrinos, which has important implications for inferring their production processes in a multi-messenger picture.

          Inferring and Interpreting the Visual Geometric Albedo and Phase Function of Earth

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding reflectance-related quantities for worlds enables effective comparative planetology and strengthens mission planning and execution. Measurements of these properties for Earth, especially its geometric albedo and phase function, have been difficult to achieve due to our Terrestrial situation -- it is challenging to obtain planetary-scale brightness measurements for the world we stand on. Using a curated dataset of visual phase-dependent, disk-averaged observations of Earth taken from the ground and spacecraft, alongside a physical-statistical model, this work arrives at a definitive value for the visual geometric albedo of our planet: 0.242 (+0.005/-0.004). This albedo constraint is up 30--40% smaller than earlier, widely-quoted values. The physical-statistical model enables retrieval-like inferences to be performed on phase curves, and includes contributions from optically thick clouds, optically thin aerosols, Rayleigh scattering, ocean glint, gas absorption, and Lambertian surface reflectance. Detailed application of this inverse model to Earth's phase curve quantifies contributions of these different processes to the phase-dependent brightness of the Pale Blue Dot. Model selection identifies a scenario where aerosol forward scattering results in a false negative for surface habitability detection. Observations of phase curves for Earth at redder-optical or near-infrared wavelengths could disentangle ocean glint effects from aerosol forward scattering and would help with understanding the utility of phase curve observations for the under-development Habitable Worlds Observatory.

 - **Abstract**
 We present primordial non-Gaussianity predictions from a new high-precision code for simulating axion-U(1) inflation on a discrete lattice. We measure the primordial scalar curvature power spectrum and bispectrum from our simulations, determining their dependence on both scale and axion-gauge coupling strength. Both the gauge-sourced power spectrum and the bispectrum exhibit a strong blue tilt due to our choice of an $\alpha$-attractor inflaton potential. We provide fitting functions for the power spectrum and bispectrum that accurately reproduce these statistics across a wide range of scales and coupling strengths. While our fitting function for the bispectrum has a separable form, results from high-resolution simulations demonstrate that the full shape is not separable. Thus, our simulations generate realizations of primordial curvature perturbations with nontrivial correlators that cannot be generated using standard techniques for primordial non-Gaussianity. We derive bounds on the axion-gauge coupling strength based on the bispectrum constraints from the cosmic microwave background, demonstrating a new method for constraining inflationary primordial non-Gaussianity by simulating the nonlinear dynamics.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we explore the generalized holographic dark energy (HDE) scenario. We relate the HDE density to the future-horizon scale via a function $f(a)$, which we reconstruct via spline-based nodal interpolation. We perform a Bayesian analysis to assess model's consistency with current observations, including baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) DR1, Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) from the Union3 and Pantheon+ compilations, and local measurements of the Hubble constant, $H_0$, from SH0ES. We show that under specific conditions, the model reduces to $\Lambda$CDM with one node. We find strong statistical evidence against the standard HDE model $\Delta \chi^2_{\rm HDE, \; 3\text{-Node}} \sim 20$, and in contrast, the reconstructed HDE model, with three nodes, provides a better fit to the data than the $\Lambda$CDM model, specifically, $\Delta \chi^2_{\Lambda \rm CDM, \; 3\text{-Node}} \sim 12$.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a novel method to differentiate stream-like and shell-like tidal remnants of stellar systems in galactic halos using the density-based approach of the clustering algorithm AstroLink. While previous studies lean on observation, phase-space, and action-space based criteria for stream and shell determination, we introduce AstroLink's ordered-density plot and cluster identification as a viable tool for classification. For a given data set, the AstroLink ordered-density plot reveals the density-based hierarchical clustering structure from which the resultant clusters are identified as being statistically significant overdensities. Using simulations of sub-halo disruptions in an external potential to generate samples of tidal structures, we find that the curvature of the ordered-density plot is positive for stream-like structures and negative for shell-like structures. Comparisons with more standard classification techniques reveal strong agreement on which structures typically fit into stream-like and shell-like categories. Furthermore, we investigate the properties of clustered stream and shell samples in radial phase space and energy-angle space. Given the sensitivity of stellar tidal structures to their host dark matter halos, the identification and subsequent classification of these structures provide exciting avenues of investigation in galactic evolution dynamics and dark matter structure formation.

 - **Abstract**
 As space traffic continues to increase in the cislunar region, accurately determining the trajectories of objects operating within this domain becomes critical. However, due to the combined gravitational influences of the Earth and Moon, orbital dynamics in this region are highly nonlinear and often exhibit chaotic behavior, posing significant challenges for trajectory determination. Many existing methods attempt to address this complexity using machine learning models, advanced optimization techniques, or sensors that directly measure distance to the target, approaches that often increase computational burden and system complexity. This work presents a novel initial orbit determination (IOD) algorithm for cislunar objects based solely on three angle-only measurements taken at three discrete times. The core methodology builds upon a differential corrections framework which iteratively refines the target's trajectory to satisfy line-of-sight constraints. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the algorithm enables accurate IOD using minimal observational data, making it particularly suited for onboard implementation in resource-constrained cislunar missions.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational-wave observations provide a unique window into the fundamental nature of massive objects. In particular, neutron star equations of state have been constrained due to the success of gravitational wave observatories. Recently, the possibility of detecting dark matter-admixed neutron stars via ground-based laser interferometry has been explored. Dark matter would impact the gravitational waveform of an inspiraling neutron star system through tidal parameters, namely the tidal deformability ($\lambda$, incurring a phase shift to the frequency evolution of the signal. This phase shift would depend both on the percentage of dark matter within the star and its particle nature, e.g., bosonic or fermionic. Indirect detection of dark matter through admixture within neutron stars can provide insight into the neutron equation of state, as well as constraints on the density of dark matter in the universe. In this work, we introduce \texttt{Darksuite}, a proposed extension of the \lal{} software framework, designed to model the gravitational wave signatures of dark-matter-admixed neutron stars. This framework employs simulations from the two-fluid, generally relativistic Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations, wherein one fluid is ordinary nuclear matter and the other is dark matter. We demonstrate interpolation of values from a bank of simulations, enabling the study of binary systems where at least one component may be a dark-matter-admixed neutron star. By leveraging existing methodologies within \lal{} for tidal phase corrections and supplementing them with dark matter effects, \texttt{Darksuite} provides a means to generate and analyze gravitational waveforms for these exotic systems.

          Stochastic-tail of the curvature perturbation in hybrid inflation

 - **Abstract**
 The exponential-tail behaviours of the probability density function (PDF) of the primordial curvature perturbation are confirmed in the mild-waterfall variants of hybrid inflation with the use of the stochastic formalism of inflation. On top of these tails, effective upper bounds on the curvature perturbation are also observed, corresponding to the exact hilltop trajectory during the waterfall phase. We find that in the model where the leading and higher-order terms in the expansion of the inflaton potential around the critical point are fine-tuned to balance, this upper bound can be significantly reduced, even smaller than the primordial black hole (PBH) threshold, as a novel perturbation-reduction mechanism than the one proposed in Ref. [1]. It makes PBH formation much difficult compared to the Gaussian or exponential-tail approximation. We also introduce Johnson's $S_U$-distribution as a useful fitting function for the PDF. It reveals a nonlinear mapping between the Gaussian field and the curvature perturbation, which enables us to apply the peak theory to estimate the PBH function.

Improving the modeling of high-energy pion interactions is essential for addressing the muon puzzle-the observed deficit of muons in simulations compared to indirect experimental estimates. As collider experiments cannot directly probe these interactions, we propose a novel measurement approach using muon bundles detected in deep-underground water Cherenkov detectors, such as IceCube and KM3NeT. This method aims to constrain the pion-air inelastic cross section, thereby reducing uncertainties in air shower simulations and advancing our understanding of cosmic ray interactions.

 - **Abstract**
 Molecular emission is a powerful tool for studying the physical and chemical structures of dense cores. The distribution and abundance of different molecules provide information on the chemical composition and physical properties in these cores. We study the chemical segregation of three molecules (c-C$_3$H$_2$, CH$_3$OH, CH$_3$CCH) in the starless cores B68 and L1521E, and the prestellar core L1544. We applied the density-based clustering algorithms DBSCAN and HDBSCAN to identify chemical and physical structures within these cores. To enable cross-core comparisons, the input samples were characterised based on their physical environment, discarding the 2D spatial information. The clustering analysis showed significant chemical differentiation across the cores, successfully reproducing the known molecular segregation of c-C$_3$H$_2$ and CH$_3$OH in all three cores. Furthermore, it identifies a segregation between c-C$_3$H$_2$ and CH$_3$CCH, which is not apparent from the emission maps. Key features driving the clustering are integrated intensity, velocity offset, H$_2$ column density, and H$_2$ column density gradient. Different environmental conditions are reflected in the variations in the feature relevance across the cores. This study shows that density-based clustering provides valuable insights into chemical and physical structures of starless cores. It demonstrates that already small datasets of two or three molecules can yield meaningful results. This new approach revealed similarities in the clustering patterns of CH$_3$OH and CH$_3$CCH relative to c-C$_3$H$_2$, suggesting that c-C$_3$H$_2$ traces regions of lower density than to the other two molecules. This allowed for insight into the CH$_3$CCH peak in L1544, which appears to trace a landing point of chemically fresh gas that is accreted to the core, highlighting the impact of accretion processes on molecular distributions.

 - **Abstract**
 During a hypervelocity impact, both the impactor and target materials evaporate, generating an impact vapor plume with temperatures reaching several thousand K. As the plume cools through adiabatic expansion, chemical reactions are predicted to quench, leading to a non-equilibrium composition. However, it is still unclear how chemical reactions proceed during the cooling impact vapor plume and lead to the synthesis of organic molecules. In this study, to investigate the evolution of chemical composition within impact vapor plumes, we conducted a Monte Carlo chemical reaction simulation for complex organic synthesis, developed in our previous work. Our model does not rely on a predefined reaction network; instead, it utilizes imposed conditions for chemical changes and an approximate method for calculating reaction rates suited to our objectives. Additionally, we developed a new approach to couple these chemical reaction calculations with the rapid temperature and pressure decay in the vapor plume. Results show diverse organic molecule production depending on the impactor materials assumed in this study. These products include important precursors to biomolecules such as amino acids, sugars, and nucleobases. On the other hand, for all impactor compositions, the abundance of biomolecules themselves remains extremely low throughout the reactions from an impact to quenching. Therefore, our results suggest that biomolecules are not directly produced in impact vapor plumes but rather synthesized through reactions of these precursor molecules in aqueous solutions, following H2O condensation as the vapor plume cools. Many of the detected organic compounds, including the precursor molecules such as imine compounds and formamide, are not included in the reaction networks of previous kinetic model simulations, and their formation has not been predicted.

 - **Abstract**
 Wavelength calibration is a key factor for high-resolution spectroscopic measurements for precision radial velocities. Hollow-cathode lamps (e.g., ThAr), absorption cells (e.g., iodine cell), dielectric coated Fabry-Pérot etalons and laser frequency combs have been implemented over the years for precise wavelength calibration and wavelength drift measurements. However, due to their various impediments as wavelength calibrators, investigations of alternative methods remain of prime interest. In this paper, we examined the feasibility of low-cost (~ $1000) commercially available solid fused silica etalon with a broadband metallic coating as a calibrator. We studied the behaviour for two cavity spacings (free spectral range of 1/cm and 0.5/cm) with temperature from theoretical derivation and experimental data. Our setup had a temperature stability of 0.8 mK for a calibrator system using an off-the-shelf dewar flask with active stabilisation. Our result from radial velocity drift measurements demonstrated that such a calibration system is capable of providing higher signal-to-noise calibration and better nightly drift measurement relative to ThAr in the wavelength range between 470 nm and 780 nm. A similar result has been previously found for Fabry-Pérot etalons, and although the metalon solution lacks the efficiency of an etalon, it does offers a cost-effective broadband solution, which should be less prone to aging relative to complex dielectric mirror coatings. Nonetheless, long-term monitoring is required to understand the metalon behaviour in detail.

 - **Abstract**
 Runaway stars are defined as stars that depart from their birth clusters at high peculiar velocities. There are two main mechanisms for the formation of runaway stars, i.e., the binary-supernova scenario (BSS) and the dynamical ejection scenario (DES). Investigating the binary fraction of runaway stars is an important step in further exploring the relative significance of the two mechanisms. We analyzed the binary fraction of 203 Galactic B-type runaway stars identified in the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope Data Release 8 database. Our analysis of radial velocity variations in the runaway star sample reveals an observed spectroscopic binary fraction of $5.4\%\pm 1.6\%$, representing the proportion of objects that exhibit statistically significant variations in radial velocity with amplitudes larger than $\rm 16~km~s^{-1}$. We employed a Monte Carlo method to correct for observational biases and determined an intrinsic binary fraction of $27\%\pm 8\%$. The period and mass ratio distributions that best reproduce the observation are $f(P)\propto P^{-5.7}$ for $1\leq P\leq 1000$ days, and $f(q)\propto q^{-3.6}$ for $0.1\leq q\leq 1.0$, indicating a preference for binaries with shorter periods and less massive companions compared to a uniform distribution. The intrinsic binary fraction, in combination with previous studies on the binary fractions of runaway stars formed by the BSS and the DES, implies that both scenarios contribute comparably to the formation of Galactic B-type runaway stars, where the ratio of the BSS to the DES is 0.86.

 - **Abstract**
 The MAGIC telescopes, located at Observatorio El Roque de los Muchachos (La Palma, Spain) are two Imaging Air Cherenkov Telescopes observing the Very High Energy (VHE) gamma rays. They are run by an international collaboration composed of over 40 institutions from 12 countries. The first telescope was inaugurated in October 2003. The commissioning of the second finished in 2008. The MAGIC telescopes were designed to lower the energies to which ground based telescopes had access as well as to be able to point to any direction in the sky in less than 25 seconds. The former required the large reflective surface of 17 meters as well as an effort to optimise the mirror reflectivity and photo sensor sensitivity. The latter was achieved by minimising the weight of the full instrument using for instance carbon fibre reinforced plastic tubes for the mirror frame. The sensitivity of the MAGIC telescopes have been improving over the years thanks to hardware upgrades as well as new analysis techniques, which allowed the collaboration to keep a rich scientific program. The discovery of VHE emission from Gamma Ray Bursts and pulsars have called for a revision of the models that explain the production of gamma rays there. Both the observation of sources in flaring state as well as a systematic monitoring of sources have provided valuable data to better understand astrophysical sources both in our Galaxy and outside it. Relevant constraints on fundamental quantities like dark matter cross-section, quantum gravity scale and density of extragalactic background light have also been extracted from the observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons are deflected by large-scale structure through gravitational lensing. This secondary effect introduces higher-order correlations in CMB anisotropies, which are used to reconstruct lensing deflections. This allows mapping of the integrated matter distribution along the line of sight, probing the growth of structure, and recovering an undistorted view of the last-scattering surface. Gravitational lensing has been measured by previous CMB experiments, with $\textit{Planck}$'s $42\,\sigma$ detection being the current best full-sky lensing map. We present an enhanced $\textit{LiteBIRD}$ lensing map by extending the CMB multipole range and including the minimum-variance estimation, leading to a $49$ to $58\,\sigma$ detection over $80\,\%$ of the sky, depending on the final complexity of polarized Galactic emission. The combination of $\textit{Planck}$ and $\textit{LiteBIRD}$ will be the best full-sky lensing map in the 2030s, providing a $72$ to $78\,\sigma$ detection over $80\,\%$ of the sky, almost doubling $\textit{Planck}$'s sensitivity. Finally, we explore different applications of the lensing map, including cosmological parameter estimation using a lensing-only likelihood and internal delensing, showing that the combination of both experiments leads to improved constraints. The combination of $\textit{Planck}$ + $\textit{LiteBIRD}$ will improve the $S_8$ constraint by a factor of 2 compared to $\textit{Planck}$, and $\textit{Planck}$ + $\textit{LiteBIRD}$ internal delensing will improve $\textit{LiteBIRD}$'s tensor-to-scalar ratio constraint by $6\,\%$. We have tested the robustness of our results against foreground models of different complexity, showing that a significant improvement remains even for the most complex foregrounds.

 - **Abstract**
 V Sge is a peculiar, highly luminous long-period (12.34h) binary star that can display a super-soft X-ray emitting component when in the faint phase of its V~ 10-13mag variability range. Apparently undergoing Eddington-limited accretion from its more massive secondary, it is in a very rare, short-lived evolutionary phase towards the double degenerate channel. Its complex and highly variable optical emission features, from Balmer and Heii to high-ionisation lines, including strong fluorescence features, have been challenging to interpret, especially given the absence of any absorption lines associated with photospheric features from either stellar component. With the detailed properties of V Sge, especially the donor, still controversial, we undertook a VLT/X-Shooter campaign over three months in 2023, obtaining high S/N, high resolution spectra that revealed multiple components in both high- and low-ionisation lines. This allows us to track V Sge's principal emitting regions via Doppler tomography, obtaining new insights into high accretion-rate dynamics. In particular, we identify a stationary, double-peaked emission core which we interpret as a circumbinary ring, analogous to SS433. This enables us to derive limits on the system masses. Furthermore, we find very broad emission-line wings whose mean velocity can vary over hundreds of kilometres per second on timescales of decades, yet ``flip'' between states in <1 week. We show that the super-soft X-ray source interpretation is able to account for these and other observational attributes significantly better than the hot binary model, concluding that V Sge could be one of the brightest known Galactic super-soft sources.

 - **Abstract**
 Primordial gravitational waves on small scales are not tightly constrained by current cosmological observations, which allows for the possibility of large amplitudes at small scales. We investigate second-order tensor induced gravitational waves (TIGWs) sourced by primordial gravitational waves and present the corresponding corrections to the total energy density spectrum of gravitational wave. We analyze primordial gravitational waves with large amplitudes generated by various models at small scales. Our results indicate that when primordial gravitational waves on small scales sufficiently dominate the current PTA observations, corrections to the total energy density spectrum from second-order TIGWs may become pronounced in certain frequency bands.

 - **Abstract**
 The Ricochet experiment aims to measure the coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering process from antineutrinos emitted by a research nuclear reactor operated by the Institut Laue-Langevin (Grenoble, France). This article presents a description of the Ricochet experimental installation and the detector performance achieved during its commissioning with a mini-CryoCube module consisting of three 42-gram germanium cryogenic calorimeters. The baseline resolutions and background levels are reported both during reactor-on and reactor-off periods, and as noise mitigation techniques were improved. A baseline resolution of 40 eV electron equivalent was achieved for the ionization channel after setup improvements, and the phonon channel resolutions ranged from 50 to 80 eV of total phonon energy. In the energy region from 2 to 7 keV, a nuclear recoil rate of 15(2) events/(kg day keV) is measured during the reactor-off period selecting events in coincidence with muon veto signals. This rate is in agreement with the cosmogenic neutron rate calculated from GEANT4 simulations. After the rejection of events in coincidence with signals in the muon veto detectors, a combined 90% C.L. limit on the nuclear recoil background of < 9 events/(kg day keV) is obtained in that energy region during the reactor-on period, which is compatible with our GEANT4 model calculation corresponding to a total rate of 5 events/(kg day keV). The sensitivity of this analysis was however found to be limited by a surface event contamination which is currently being addressed by the Ricochet Collaboration with upgraded detectors.

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a model for dust formation in Type II supernovae (SNe) interacting with confined circumstellar material (CSM), motivated by recent time-domain surveys that have revealed a substantial fraction of SN progenitors to be surrounded by CSM ejected shortly before core-collapse. We simulate the pre-SN mass eruption and the resulting confined CSM using the open-source code CHIPS, and follow the subsequent evolution of the SN ejecta and its interaction with the CSM. We show that a cold dense shell (CDS) is formed at the radiative shock under a wide range of conditions and later undergoes rapid adiabatic cooling during free expansion, leading to efficient dust condensation. The resulting dust mass ranges from $\sim10^{-3}\,M_\odot$ to $0.1\,M_\odot$, depending on the mass and spatial extent of the CSM. We further calculate the infrared (IR) emission from the newly formed dust and find broad consistency with observations of SN~1998S. Notably, the IR light curve exhibits a rapid rise within $\lesssim10\,{\rm d}$, closely resembling that of kilonovae (KNe). This suggests that dust emission powered by confined CSM interaction may be also discovered in KN searches. Moreover, the high-density environment of the CDS may allow dust grains to grow to larger sizes, enhancing their survivability against destruction by reverse shocks propagating from the interstellar medium at later times.

 - **Abstract**
 The large-scale structure (LSS) of the Universe is an important probe for deviations from the canonical cosmological constant $\Lambda$ and cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model. A statistically significant detection of any deviations would signify the presence of new physics or the breakdown of any number of the underlying assumptions of the standard cosmological model or possible systematic errors in the data. In this paper, we quantify the ability of the LSS data products of the spectroscopic survey of the Euclid mission, together with other contemporary surveys, to improve the constraints on deviations from $\Lambda$CDM in the redshift range $0<z<1.75$. We consider both currently available growth rate data and simulated data with specifications from Euclid and external surveys, based on $\Lambda$CDM and a modified gravity (MoG) model with an evolving Newton's constant (denoted $\mu$CDM), and carry out a binning method and a machine learning reconstruction, based on genetic algorithms (GAs), of several LSS null tests. Using the forecast Euclid growth data from the spectroscopic survey in the range $0.95<z<1.75$, we find that in combination with external data products (covering the range $0<z<0.95$), Euclid will be able to improve on current constraints of null tests of the LSS on average by a factor of eight when using a binning method and a factor of six when using the GAs. Our work highlights the need for synergies between Euclid and other surveys, but also the usefulness of statistical analyses, such as GAs, in order to disentangle any degeneracies in the cosmological parameters. Both are necessary to provide tight constraints over an extended redshift range and to probe for deviations from the $\Lambda$CDM model.

 - **Abstract**
 Context: SN 2024ggi is a Type II supernova (SN) discovered in the nearby galaxy NGC 3621 (D $\approx6.7\pm0.d$ Mpc) on 2024 April 03.21 UT. Its proximity enabled a detailed investigation of the SN's properties and its progenitor star. This work focuses on the optical evolution of SN 2024ggi at the nebular phase. Aims: We investigate the progenitor properties and possible asymmetries in the ejecta by studying the nebular phase evolution between days 287 and 400 after the explosion. Methods: We present optical photometry and spectroscopy of SN 2024ggi during the nebular phase, obtained with the Las Campanas and Gemini South Observatories. Four nebular spectra were taken at 287, 288, 360, and 396 days post-explosion, supplemented by late-time $uBVgri$-band photometry spanning $320-400$ days. The analysis of the nebular emission features is performed to probe ejecta asymmetries. Based on the [O I] flux and [O I]/[Ca II] ratio, and comparisons with spectra models from the literature, we arrive to an estimate of the progenitor mass. Additionally, we construct the bolometric light curve from optical photometry and near-infrared data to derive the synthesized nickel mass. Results: Our analysis suggests a progenitor zero-age-main-sequence mass between $12-15 M_\odot$. The late-time bolometric light curve is consistent with a synthesized $^{56}$Ni mass of $0.05-0.06 M_\odot$. The line profiles exhibit only minor changes over the observed period and suggest a roughly symmetrical ejecta, with a possible clump of oxygen-rich material moving towards the observer. No signatures of circumstellar material interaction are detected up to 400 days after the explosion.

 - **Abstract**
 We derive multiple constraints on dark energy and compare dynamical dark energy models with a time-varying equation of state ($w_0 w_a$CDM) versus a cosmological constant model ($\Lambda$CDM). We use Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) from DESI and DES, Cosmic Microwave Background (Planck) with and without lensing from Planck and ACT (noted CMB and CMBL, respectively), supernova (SN), and cross-correlations between galaxy positions and galaxy lensing from DES. First, we use pairs or trios of datasets where we exclude one type of datasets each time and categorize them as ``NO SN", ``NO CMB" and ``NO BAO" combinations. In all cases, we find that the combinations favor the $w_0 w_a$CDM model over $\Lambda$CDM, with significance ranging from 2.3$\sigma$ to 3.3$\sigma$. For example, DESI+DESY6BAO+CMB yields 3.2$\sigma$ without SN, DESI+DESY6BAO+DESY5SN yields 3.3$\sigma$ without CMB, and CMB+DESY5SN+DES3x2pts yields 2.6$\sigma$ without BAO. The persistence of this pattern across various dataset combinations even when any of the dataset is excluded supports an overall validation of this trending result regardless of any specific dataset. Next, we use larger combinations of these datasets after verifying their mutual consistency within the $w_0 w_a$CDM model. We find combinations that give significance levels $\sim$4$\sigma$, with DESI+DESY6BAO+CMBL+DESY5SN reaching 4.4$\sigma$. In sum, while we need to remain prudent, the combination of the first step that supports a validation of the pattern of these results beyond any single type of datasets and their associated systematics, together with the second step showing high-significance results when such datasets are combined, presents a compelling overall portrait in favor of a dynamical dark energy with a time-evolving equation of state over a cosmological constant, and constitutes a serious challenge to the $\Lambda$CDM model's reign.

 - **Abstract**
 The Vera C. Rubin Observatory will soon survey the southern sky, delivering a depth and sky coverage that is unprecedented in time domain astronomy. As part of commissioning, Data Preview 1 (DP1) has been released. It comprises a ComCam observing campaign between November and December 2024 with multi-band imaging of seven fields, covering roughly 0.4 square degree each, provides a first glimpse into the data products that will become available once the Legacy Survey of Space and Time begins. In this work, we search three fields for extragalactic transients. We identify six new extragalactic transients, and three known ones from a sample of 369,644 difference image analysis objects. Photometric classification using \texttt{Superphot+} indicates that this sample likely comprises six type Ia, two type II, two type Ibc and one type IIn supernovae. Our findings are in slight tension with supernova detection rate predictions from the literature of $12\pm3$ SN Ia and $3\pm1$ core-collapse supernovae likely due to the lack of suitable templates. Nevertheless, this work demonstrates the quality of the data products delivered in DP1 and indicates that Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey and Space and Time (LSST) is well placed to fulfill its discovery potential in time domain astronomy.

 - **Abstract**
 Accretion shocks are thought to play a crucial role in the early stages of star and planet formation, but their direct observational evidence remains elusive, particularly regarding the molecular tracers of these processes. In this work, we searched for features of accretion shocks by observing the emission of SO and SO$_2$ using ALMA in Band 6 towards nearby Class I protostars. We analyze the SO and SO$_2$ emission from Oph IRS 63, DK Cha, and L1527, which have different disk inclination angles, ranging from nearly face-on to edge-on. SO emission is found to be concentrated in rings at the centrifugal barriers of the infalling envelopes. These rings are projected onto the plane of the sky as ellipses or parallel slabs, depending on the inclination angles. Spiral-like streamers with SO emission are also common, with warm ($T_{\rm ex} > 50$ K) and even hot ($T_{\rm ex} \gtrsim 100$ K) spots or segments of SO$_2$ observed near the centrifugal barriers. Inspired by these findings, we present a model that consistently explains the accretion shock traced by SO and SO$_2$, where the shock occurs primarily in two regions: (1) the centrifugal barriers, and (2) the surface of the disk-like inner envelope outside the centrifugal barrier. The outer envelope gains angular momentum through outflows, causing it to fall onto the midplane at or outside the centrifugal barrier, leading to a disk-like inner envelope that is pressure-confined by the accretion shock and moves in a rotating-and-infalling motion. We classify the streamers into two types--those in the midplane and those off the midplane. These streamers interact with the inner envelopes in different ways, resulting in different patterns of shocked regions. We suggest that the shock-related chemistry at the surfaces of the disk and the disk-like inner envelope warrants further special attention.

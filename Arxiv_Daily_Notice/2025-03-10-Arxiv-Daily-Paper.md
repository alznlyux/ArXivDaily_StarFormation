          The effects of projection on measuring the splashback feature

 - **Abstract**
 The splashback radius $R_{\rm sp}$ is a boundary of a halo that separates infalling and accreted matter. This results in a steep drop in the density profile at $R_{\rm st}$, which is a commonly adopted proxy for $R_{\rm sp}$. Observationally, $R_{\rm st}$ can be measured through fitting the projected galaxy number density profile of the halo, but there has been some discrepancy between the observed and expected $R_{\rm st}$. Therefore, we investigate whether the projection of the density profile onto the plane of the sky could lead to any systematic bias in determining $R_{\rm st}$, by studying the true 3-dimensional and projected halo density profiles from the IllustrisTNG simulation. We investigate a range of projection lengths, and find that $R^p_{\rm st}$ obtained from projected profiles is close to the true $R^*_{\rm st}$, but has a slight decreasing trend with increasing projection length. We also quantify the prominence of the splashback feature and find how the feature shape changes with projection length.

          The Three-mm Ultimate Mopra Milky Way Survey. III. Data Release 6, An Atlas of Physical Conditions, Global Mass Conversion Laws, and 3D Physical Architecture of the Molecular ISM in the Fourth Quadrant

 - **Abstract**
 We present Data Release 6 of ThrUMMS, consisting of complete data cubes and various moments of line emission ($^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, C$^{18}$O) from molecular clouds, across 60$^{\circ}$$\times$2$^{\circ}$ of the Fourth Quadrant (4Q) of the Milky Way at a resolution of 72$''$ in (l,b) and 0.09 kms$^{-1}$ in V$_{LSR}$. From LTE radiative transfer analysis of the data cubes, we compute cubes and moments of the lines' opacity, excitation temperature, and column density $N_{12CO}$. Combining $I_{12CO}$ and $N_{12CO}$ data, we derive a global mass conversion law $N$=$N_{0}I^{p}$, where $N_{0}$$\approx$10$^{18}$mol/m$^{2}$ and $p$=2 at this resolution. We argue that the standard linear $N$=$XI$ is only approximately valid: $p$$\sim$1.5-1.0 at coarser resolutions or in atypical locations, such as Galactic Center clouds. Also, the velocity dispersion distributions are very different between $I_{12CO}$ and $N_{12CO}$, the former preferentially tracing more diffuse molecular gas. We re-evaluated Galactic rotation parameters for the 4Q, defining a new ``BGT'' model, and deprojected the (l,V) data onto (l,d) and (x,y) grids using standard kinematic procedures. To automate distance disambiguation inside the solar circle, we developed a simple $\zeta^{+}$ discriminator function and applied it to our deprojections. We discovered two previously unrecognised features of the molecular cloud population: widespread ripples in the midplane of wavelength 4kpc and amplitude 50pc, potentially generated by the last perigalactic passage of the Sgr dwarf; and three distant, massive molecular structures, the Far Ara clouds, two of which exhibit an exceptional velocity gradient, possibly arising in a massive spiral feather or a gas-rich dwarf galaxy $\sim$20--300kpc beyond the disk.
#### Title:
          Measuring photo-ionization rate and mean free path of HeII ionizing photons at $2.5 \leq z \leq 3.6$: Evidence for late and rapid HeII reionization Part-II
 - **Authors:** Prakash Gaikwad, Frederick B. Davies, Martin G. Haehnelt

 - **Abstract**
 We present measurements of the spatially averaged HeII photo-ionization rate ($\langle \Gamma_{\rm HeII} \rangle$), mean free path of HeII ionizing photons ($\lambda_{\rm mfp, HeII}$), and HeII fraction ($f_{\rm HeII}$) across seven redshift bins within the redshift range $2<z<4$. The measurements are obtained by comparing the observed effective optical depth distribution of HeII ($\tau_{\rm eff, HeII}$) with models generated by post-processing of the Sherwood simulation suite using our code EXCITE. With EXCITE, we efficiently explore a large parameter space ($\sim 15000$ models) by varying $\lambda_{\rm mfp, HeII}$ and $\langle \Gamma_{\rm HeII} \rangle$. We employ Anderson-Darling test for the cumulative distribution of $\tau_{\rm eff, HeII}$ to simultaneously measure $\lambda_{\rm mfp, HeII}$ and $\langle \Gamma_{\rm HeII} \rangle$. Our measurements account for possible observational and modeling uncertainties stemming mainly from the finite signal-to-noise ratio of the observed data and thermal parameter uncertainties. We find significant evolution, with the best-fit $\langle \Gamma_{\rm HeII} \rangle$ and $\lambda_{\rm mfp, HeII}$ decreasing by factors of $\sim 4.32$ and $ \sim 3.27$, respectively, from $z = 2.88$ to $z = 3.16$. Based on these measurements, we constrain the emissivity at the HeII ionization frequency ($\epsilon_{228}$) and HeII ionizing photon emission rate ($\dot{n}$), finding consistency with results from galaxy and QSO surveys. Comparison of our measured parameters with widely used uniform UVB models supports a scenario where HeII reionization is not completed before $z\sim2.74$. Our measured evolution is complementary and in good agreement with recent measurements of thermal parameters of the IGM, suggesting a coherent picture of rather late and rapid HeII reionization.

          The Effect of the Fast-Flavor Instability on Core-Collapse Supernova Models

 - **Abstract**
 Merging our supernova code F{\sc{ornax}} with the Box3D fast-flavor neutrino oscillation formalism, we explore the effects of fast-flavor conversion (FFC) in state-of-the-art 1D and 2D core-collapse supernova simulations. We find that after a few tens of milliseconds after bounce the FFC emerges just interior to and exterior to the stalled shock wave. It does not obtain in the PNS core nor near the average neutrinosphere radii. Interior to the shock, this results in a temporary change in the net neutrino heating rate of $\sim$10\%, due mostly to a hardening of the $\nu_e$ and $\bar{\nu}_e$ neutrino spectra, despite the decrease in their corresponding neutrino number fluxes. In 1D, the hydrodynamic effects are not large, with increases in the stalled shock radius by of order ten to twenty kilometers that abate within a few hundred milliseconds. In 2D, the hydrodynamic effect of the FFC is a bit more noticeable, resulting in slightly earlier explosions for models for lower-mass progenitors, but also potentially inhibiting explosions for some higher-mass progenitors. Fast-flavor conversion continues to operate at larger radii at later times. The net result is a shift upward in the $\nu_{\mu}$ energy and number luminosities and a shift downward in the same quantities for both the $\nu_e$ and $\bar{\nu}_e$ neutrinos. There seems to be a trend at very large radii and later times towards partial species and spectral equipartition. If this is true, it could be an interesting feature of supernova neutrino detection at later times in underground and under-ice facilities.

          Observational constraints on generalised axion-like potentials for the late Universe

 - **Abstract**
 Axions have emerged as compelling candidates for describing the dark sector of the Universe. In this work, we explore quintessence models inspired by axion-like potentials as a dynamical alternative to the cosmological constant. These models naturally exhibit a tracking behaviour, reducing the need for fine-tuned initial conditions. We perform a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis on a complete cosmological dataset of Planck PR4 cosmic microwave background (CMB), DESI DR1 baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO), Pantheon+ type Ia supernovae, low-$z$ Cepheid anchors, and DES Y1 large scale structure measurement. Unfortunately, neither the Hubble tension nor the $S_8$ tension is eased. The model does reach parity with $\Lambda$CDM model statistically according to DIC, WAIC and Bayesian ratio, suggesting that a quintessence model may still help with the cosmic tension by further extending the model we have investigated.

          oMEGACat. VI. Analysis of the overall kinematics of Omega Centauri in 3D: velocity dispersion, kinematic distance, anisotropy, and energy equipartition

 - **Abstract**
 Omega Centauri ($\omega$ Cen) is the Milky Way's most massive globular cluster and is likely the stripped nucleus of an accreted dwarf galaxy. In this paper, we analyze $\omega$ Cen's kinematics using data from oMEGACat, a comprehensive catalog of $\omega$ Cen's central regions, including 1.4 million proper motion measurements and 300,000 spectroscopic radial velocities. Our velocity dispersion profiles and kinematic maps are consistent with previous work but improve on their resolution, precision, and spatial coverage. The cluster's 3D dispersion is isotropic in the core, with increasing radial anisotropy at larger radii. The 2D kinematic maps show an elongation of the velocity dispersion field comparable to the flattening observed photometrically. We find good agreement between proper motions and line-of-sight velocity dispersion and measure a kinematic distance of 5494$\pm$61 pc, the most precise kinematic distance to $\omega$ Cen available. The subset of data with precise metallicity measurements shows no correlation between metallicity and kinematics, supporting the picture of well-mixed stellar populations within the half-light radius of $\omega$ Cen. Finally, we study the degree of energy equipartition using a large range of stellar masses. We find partial energy equipartition in the center that decreases towards large radii. The spatial dependence of the radial energy equipartition is stronger than the tangential energy equipartition. Our kinematic observations can serve as a new reference for future dynamical modeling efforts that will help to further disentangle the complex mass distribution within $\omega$ Cen.

          Discovery of a pair of very metal-poor stars enriched in neutron-capture elements: The proto-disk r-II star BPS CS 29529-0089 and the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus r-I star TYC 9219-2422-1

 - **Abstract**
 R-process enhanced metal-poor stars (\EuFe$\geq+0.3$ and \FeH$\leq-1.0$) are rare objects whose study can provide clues to the astrophysical sites of the rapid neutron capture process. In this study, we investigate the detailed chemical abundance patterns of two of these anomalous stars, originally identified among stars observed by the GALAH survey. Our aim is to obtain the detailed chemical abundance pattern of these stars with spectroscopy at higher resolution and signal-to-noise ratio. We use a calibration of the infrared flux method to determine accurate effective temperatures, and \Gaia~ parallaxes together with broadband photometry and theoretical bolometric corrections to determine surface gravity. Metallicities and chemical abundances are determined with model atmospheres and spectrum synthesis. We also integrate stellar orbits for a complete chemodynamic analysis. e determine abundances for up to 47 chemical species (44 elements), of which 27 are neutron-capture elements. Corrections because of deviations from the local thermodynamical equilibrium are applied to the metallicities and 12 elements. We find that one of the stars, BPS CS 29529-0089, is a proto-disk star of the Milky Way of r-II type, with \EuFe=+1.79~dex. The second star, TYC 9219-2422-1, is part of the halo and associated with the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus merger event. It is of r-I type with [Eu/Fe] = +0.54. Abundances of Th are also provided for both stars. BPS CS 29529-0089 is the most extreme example of r-process enhanced star known with disk-like kinematics and that is not carbon enhanced. TYC 9219-2422-1 is found to be an archetypal Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus star. Their abundances of C, Mg, Ni, Sc, Mn, and Al seem consistent with expectations for stars enriched by a single population III core collapse supernova, despite their relatively high metallicities ([Fe/H] $\sim$ $-$2.4).

 - **Abstract**
 Light pollution, a rapidly escalating anthropogenic phenomenon driven by the excessive and often inefficient use of artificial lighting, has profound implications for astronomy, ecology, and human health. This study presents the first comprehensive characterization of night sky quality in Colombia, focusing on sites of astronomical and ecological significance. The selected locations include the Astronomical Observatory of UTP, the Tatacoa Desert, the Bogotá Botanical Garden, and Cerro Guadalupe. Utilizing the Sky Quality Camera, we collected all-sky data to measure surface brightness and correlated color temperature of the night sky. Our findings reveal a significant loss of natural sky visibility in urban areas and demonstrate the detrimental effects of artificial lighting on critical astronomical sites such as La Tatacoa. This study provides a crucial foundation for future research and informs the development of public policies aimed at preserving the night sky.

 - **Abstract**
 This work introduces an advanced technique optimized for detecting photons generated by charged particles, leveraging Skipper-CCD sensors. By analyzing background sources and detection efficiencies, the technique achieves strong agreement between experimental results and Cherenkov-based simulations. It also provides a robust framework for investigating secondary photon production in environments with high fluxes of ionizing particles, such as those anticipated in space-based astronomical instruments. These secondary photons present a critical challenge as background noise for next-generation single-photon resolving imagers used to study faint celestial objects. Furthermore, the method exhibits significant potential for broader applications, including exploring photon generation in various substrate materials and examining their transport through multiple interfaces.

          SN 2024iss: Double-Peaked Light Curves and Implications for a Yellow Supergiant Progenitor

 - **Abstract**
 We report the multi-band photometric observations of the Type IIb supernova (SN) 2024iss with ultra-violet (UV), optical, and near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths starting one day after the explosion. The UV and optical light curves show the first peak two days after the explosion date. Following a first peak, a secondary maximum is observed in the optical and NIR bands, similar to SNe IIb with double-peaked light curves. The quasi-bolometric light curve shows the fast decay until a week after the explosion. From the analysis of the bolometric light curve, the ejecta mass and kinetic energy are estimated to be $M_{ej}=2.8\pm0.6~M_{\odot}$ and $E_{kin}=9.4\pm4.1\times10^{50}$ erg. The mass of the radioactive $^{56}$Ni is estimated to be $M(^{56}Ni)=0.2~M_{\odot}$. Fitting a black-body function to the spectral energy distribution reveals that the photospheric temperature exhibits a rapid exponential decline during the first week after the explosion. An analytic model describing the cooling emission after shock breakout provides a reasonable explanation for the observed temperature evolution. From these ejecta parameters, we calculated the progenitor radius to be $R_{pro}=50-340$~$R_{\odot}$. We conclude that these explosion properties are consistent with a core-collapse explosion from a yellow supergiant (YSG) progenitor.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a population-level view of volatile gas species (H$_2$, He, H$_2$O, O$_2$, CO, CO$_2$, CH$_4$) distribution during the sub-Neptune to rocky planet transition, revealing in detail the dynamic nature of small planet atmospheric compositions. Our novel model couples the atmospheric escape model $\texttt{IsoFATE}$ with the magma ocean-atmosphere equilibrium chemistry model $\texttt{Atmodeller}$ to simulate interior-atmosphere evolution over time for sub-Neptunes around G, K and M stars. Chiefly, our simulations reveal that atmospheric mass fractionation driven by escape and interior-atmosphere exchange conspire to create a distinct oxidation gradient straddling the small-planet radius valley. We discover a key mechanism in shaping the oxidation landscape is the dissolution of water into the molten mantle, which shields oxygen from early escape, buffers the escape rate, and leads to oxidized secondary atmospheres following mantle outgassing. Our simulations reproduce a prominent population of He-rich worlds along the upper edge of the radius valley, revealing that they are stable on shorter timescales than previously predicted. Our simulations also robustly predict a broad population of O$_2$-dominated atmospheres on close-in planets around low mass stars, posing a potential source of false positive biosignature detection and marking a high-priority opportunity for the first-ever atmospheric O$_2$ detection. We motivate future atmospheric characterization surveys by providing a target list of planet candidates predicted to have O$_2$-, He-, and deuterium-rich atmospheres.

          Digging into the Interior of Hot Cores with ALMA (DIHCA). V. Deuterium Fractionation of Methanol

 - **Abstract**
 We have observed the $^{13}$CH$_3$OH $5_1-4_1$ A$^+$, $^{13}$CH$_3$OH $14_1-13_2$ A$^-$, and CH$_2$DOH $8_{2,6}-8_{1,7}$ $e_0$ lines toward 24 high-mass star-forming regions by using Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) with an angular resolution of about 0$^{\prime\prime}$.3. This resolution corresponds to a linear scale of 400-1600 au, allowing us to resolve individual cores properly. We detected the $^{13}$CH$_3$OH and CH$_2$DOH emission near the continuum peaks in many of these regions. From the two $^{13}$CH$_3$OH lines, we calculated the temperature toward the $^{13}$CH$_3$OH peaks, and confirm that the emission traces hot ($>$100 K) regions. The $N$(CH$_2$DOH)/$N$($^{12}$CH$_3$OH) ratio in the observed high-mass star-forming regions is found to be lower than that in low-mass star-forming regions. We have found no correlation between the $N$(CH$_2$DOH)/$N$($^{13}$CH$_3$OH) or $N$(CH$_2$DOH)/$N$($^{12}$CH$_3$OH) ratios and either temperatures or distance to the sources, and have also found a source-to-source variation in these ratios. Our model calculations predict that the $N$(CH$_2$DOH)/$N$($^{12}$CH$_3$OH) ratio in hot cores depends on the duration of the cold phase; the shorter the cold phase, the lower the deuterium fractionation in the hot cores. We have suggested that the lower $N$(CH$_2$DOH)/$N$($^{12}$CH$_3$OH) ratio in high-mass star-forming regions compared to that in low-mass star-forming regions is due to the shorter duration of the cold phase and that the diversity in the $N$(CH$_2$DOH)/$N$($^{12}$CH$_3$OH) ratio in high-mass star-forming regions is due to the diversity in the length of the cold prestellar phase, and not the time that the objects have been in the hot core phase.

 - **Abstract**
 As the intermediate-mass siblings of stars and planets, brown dwarfs (BDs) are vital to study for a better understanding of how objects change across the planet-to-star mass range. Here, we report two low-mass transiting BD systems discovered by TESS, TOI-4776 (TIC 196286578) and TOI-5422 (TIC 80611440), located in an under-populated region of the BD mass-period space. These two systems have comparable masses but different ages. The younger and larger BD is TOI-4776b with $32.0^{+1.9}_{-1.8}M_{Jup}$ and $1.018^{+0.048}_{-0.043}R_{Jup}$, orbiting a late-F star about $5.4^{+2.8}_{-2.2}$ Gyr old in a 10.4138$\pm$0.000014 day period. The older TOI-5422b has $27.7^{+1.4}_{-1.1}M_{Jup}$ and $0.815^{+0.031}_{-0.026}R_{Jup}$ in a 5.3772$\pm$0.00001 day orbit around a subgiant star about $8.2\pm2.4$ Gyr old. Compared with substellar mass-radius (M-R) evolution models, TOI-4776b has an inflated radii. In contrast, TOI-5422b is slightly "underluminous" with respect to model predictions, which is not commonly seen in the BD population. In addition, TOI-5422 shows apparent photometric modulations with a rotation period of 10.75$\pm$0.54 day found by rotation analysis, and the stellar inclination angle is obtained to be $I_{\star}=75.52^{+9.96}_{-11.79}$$^{\circ}$. Therefore, it is likely that TOI-5422b is spinning up the host star and its orbit is aligned with the stellar spin axis.

 - **Abstract**
 Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are key contributors to interstellar infrared emission bands (AIBs). However, current spectral databases for AIB analysis face limitations because of the neglect of anharmonicity in vibrations and of temperature effects, which result from the high computational cost of traditional quantum chemical calculations (QCCs). In this work, we present a machine-learning-based molecular dynamics (MLMD) approach that efficiently computes anharmonic infrared (IR) spectra while accounting for temperature effects. MLMD achieves predictive accuracy comparable to that of QCCs but with significantly reduced computational cost, scaling linearly with the number of atoms in the system. We apply MLMD to calculate the anharmonic spectra of 1\,704 PAHs in the NASA Ames PAH IR Spectroscopic Database with up to 216 carbon atoms, demonstrating its ability to handle large molecular systems. Our results suggest that MLMD can facilitate the creation of extensive molecular spectral databases, advancing AI-assisted analyses of astronomical IR spectra, particularly with upcoming data from the James Webb Space Telescope.

          The growth of linear perturbations in the interacting dark energy models and observational constraints

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we investigate the influence of interaction between dark matter and dark energy on the growth rate $f$ of matter density perturbations within the framework of an interacting $w$CDM model. The coupling term is assumed to be proportional to the dark energy density, and the growth rate $f$ is parameterized using the form $\Omega_{\rm m}^\gamma$. By considering the effect of this interaction on the growth index $\gamma$ and assuming that $\gamma$ varies with redshift $z$, we derive the $\gamma$ up to its second-order approximation. Our analysis demonstrates that the parameterized form $\Omega_{\rm m}^\gamma$ closely approximates the actual growth rate $f$. We utilize this parameterized form, along with the astronomic observations from Type Ia Supernovae, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, Cosmic Microwave Background, Hubble parameter $H(z)$ measurements, and the growth rate data from theredshift space distortion (RSD) measurement, to make constraints on the free parameters of the interacting $w$CDM model. Our findings indicate that incorporating RSD measurement data into cosmic background observations can significantly tighten the constraints on the coupling constant, suggesting a preference for a weak interaction between dark matter and dark energy.

 - **Abstract**
 We present 12 observations of the accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar Aql X-1, taken from August 2022 to October 2023 using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope at 1250 MHz. These observations covered both the quiescence and X-ray outburst states, as determined by analyzing the X-ray data from the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer and the Monitor of All-sky X-ray Image. Periodicity and single-pulse searches were conducted for each observation, but no pulsed signals were detected. The obtained upper limit flux densities are in the range of 2.86-5.73 uJy, which provide the lowest limits to date. We discuss several mechanisms that may prevent detection, suggesting that Aql X-1 may be in the radio-ejection state during quiescence, where the radio pulsed emissions are absorbed by the matter surrounding the system.

 We achieved the first VLBI detections of the ground vibrational state ($v=0$) $^{28}$SiO (hereafter, SiO) and $^{29}$SiO masers of the $J=1\rightarrow 0$ rotational transitions, towards the 25 \Msun ~red supergiant (RSG) star, VY Canis Majoris (VY CMa), taking advantage of the high sensitivity of the VLBI Exploration of Radio Astrometry (VERA) telescopes that coordinate with the Nobeyama 45 m telescope. In addition, we successfully detected the SiO $J=1\rightarrow 0$ transition in the $v=3$ state towards VY CMa for the first time with VLBI. The SiO $J=1\rightarrow 0$ maser spot in $v=0$ state was detected in the cross-power spectra taken with the baselines involving the Nobeyama 45-m telescope. The combination of previously reported absolute astrometry and the relative astrometry technique allowed us to derive the location of the SiO $v=0$ maser spot, {(RA, DEC) = ( 7${\rm ^h}$ 22${\rm ^m}$ 58.$^{\rm s}$32, $-$25$^{\circ}$ 46$^{\prime}$ 3.$^{\prime\prime}$4) in J2000 at an absolute positional accuracy of $\sim$100 milliarcseconds (mas). The SiO $v=0$ maser spot is offset by the amount of ($\Delta$RA, $\Delta$DEC)=($-$150, $-$300) (mas) to the southwest of the stellar position, suggesting that the $v = 0$ maser spot is associated with its outflow activity.} This observational study demonstrates that the brightest SiO $v=0$ maser spot is compact (3 mas), producing an extremely high brightness of $\sim$ 10$^7$ K. This indicates that the SiO $v=0$ maser action may originate from strong shocks in the stellar wind emanating from this extreme RSG that leads to its intense mass ejection.

 - **Abstract**
 The most complete sample of galactic maser sources and radio stars with trigonometric parallaxes, proper motions and radial velocities measured by the VLBI method has been compiled based on literature data. These sources are associated with young stars located in high mass star forming regions. The rotation parameters of the Galaxy have been determined based on 156 masers with relative parallax errors less than 10\%, located further than 3 kpc from the galactic center. The linear rotation velocity of the Galaxy at the solar distance $R_0$ is $V_0=243.9\pm3.9$ km s$^{-1}$. A very narrow chain of masers 3-4 kpc long, elongated in the $\sim40^\circ$ direction, passing from a segment of the Carina-Sagittarius spiral arm to the Scutum arm, has been studied. A number of authors have hypothesized that this is a possible analogue of the Radcliffe wave. In the present work, no noticeable periodic perturbations of vertical coordinates and velocities were found in this structure. On the other hand, on the diagram ``$\ln(R/R_0)-\theta$'' this chain of masers has the form of a segment of a logarithmic spiral with a pitch angle of $-48^\circ$. Perhaps this chain of masers belongs to a jet extending from the end of the bar, rotating rigidly with the angular velocity of the bar.

          A Possible Common Physic Picture Reflected by the Gamma Ray Emission of the Galactic Center

 - **Abstract**
 Long-term observations of the Galactic center by Fermi and HESS have revealed a novel phenomenon: the high-energy gamma-ray spectrum from the Galactic center exhibits a double power-law structure. In this study, we propose a new explanation for this phenomenon. We suggest that the low-energy (GeV) power-law spectrum originates from interactions between trapped background ``sea" cosmic ray particles and the dense gaseous environment near the Galactic center. In contrast, the bubble-like structure in the high-energy (TeV) spectrum is produced by protons accelerated during active phases of the Galactic center, through the same physical process. Based on this framework, we first calculate the gamma-ray emission generated by cosmic ray protons accelerated in the Galactic center. Then, using a spatially-dependent cosmic ray propagation model, we compute the energy spectrum of background ``sea" cosmic ray protons and their associated diffuse gamma-ray emission in the Galactic center region. The results closely reproduce the observations from Fermi-LAT and HESS, suggesting that their long-term data support this picture: high-energy cosmic rays in the local region originate from nearby cosmic ray sources, while low-energy cosmic rays are a unified contribution from distant cosmic ray sources. We predict that some extended Galactic sources, which remain undetectable in the GeV energy range, may become observable in the TeV range. We hope that future observations will detect more such sources, allowing us to further test and validate our model.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. We present the COMetary dust TAIL Simulator (COMTAILS), a numerical Monte Carlo code to generate images of dust tail brightness from comets and active asteroids in the Solar System. Aims. We describe a numerical code, available to interested users, capable of generating simulated images of dust tail brightness for comparison with observations, to retrieve key dust parameters including size distribution, ejection velocities, and dust loss rates. An optional stellar field can be included in the background allowing for the assessment of stellar extinction by the tail, which can be compared with observational data. Methods. A Monte Carlo procedure was used to obtain the simulated images. The orbital parameters of the targets and their helio-centric positions and velocities were obtained from the JPL Horizons on-line ephemeris system. Results. Earlier versions of this code have been used to characterize the dust environment of various targets. In this study we present recent examples that demonstrate its ability to fit observed images of the long-period comets C/2024 N3 (NEOWISE) and C/2023 A3 (Tsuchinshan-ATLAS). The code is readily applicable to future targets that may be identified for the upcoming European Space Agency Comet Interceptor mission.

 - **Abstract**
 We present Keck High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer (HIRES) observations and model atmosphere analysis for two nearby, cool, helium-dominated atmosphere white dwarfs that have been polluted by accretion: WD J1927-0355 and WD J2141-3300. Detected elements common to both white dwarfs are Mg, Ca, Ti, Cr, Fe, and Ni, with additional detections of Na, Al, Si and Sr in WD J2141-3300. We present an approach for inferring the composition of the accreted material, by adopting a physically motivated model in which the mass accretion rate decays exponentially with time, which provides constraints on the time since the start of the accretion event. The accretion events were most likely to have began at least 1 Myr ago, however the characteristic disc lifetime could not be constrained due to degeneracies. Both white dwarfs were found to have accreted bulk planetary material with compositions similar to that of both bulk Earth and chondritic meteorites. The parent bodies causing pollution in both cases were inferred to be the mass of a small moon or dwarf planet.

 - **Abstract**
 Comets are the most pristine planetesimals left from the formation of the Solar System. They carry unique information on the materials and the physical processes which led to the presence of planets and moons. Many important questions about cometary physics, such as origin, constituents and mechanism of cometary activity, remain unanswered. The next perihelion of comet 1P/Halley, in 2061, is an excellent opportunity to revisit this object of outstanding scientific and cultural relevance. In 1986, during its latest approach to the Sun, several flyby targeted Halley's comet to observe its nucleus and shed light on its properties, origin, and evolution. However, due to its retrograde orbit and high ecliptic inclination, the quality of data was limited by the large relative velocity and short time spent by the spacecraft inside the coma of the comet. A rendezvous mission like ESA/Rosetta would overcome such limitations, but the trajectory design is extremely challenging due to the shortcomings of current propulsion technology. Given the considerable lead times of spacecraft development and the long duration of the interplanetary transfer required to reach the comet, it is imperative to start mission planning several decades in advance. This study presents a low-thrust rendezvous strategy to reach the comet before the phase of intense activity during the close approach to the Sun. The trajectory design combines a gravity-assist maneuver with electric propulsion arcs to maximize scientific payload mass while constraining transfer duration. A propulsive plane change maneuver would be prohibitive. To keep the propellant budget within reasonable limits, most of the plane change maneuver is achieved via either a Jupiter or a Saturn flyby. The interplanetary low-thrust gravity-assisted trajectory design strategy is described, followed by the presentation of multiple proof-of-concept solutions.

          Spectral analysis of the X-ray flares in the 2023 outburst of the new black binary transient Swift J1727.8--1613 observed with Insight-HXMT

 - **Abstract**
 The new black hole transient Swift J1727.8--1613 exhibited a series of X-ray flares during its 2023 outburst extensively observed with Insight-HXMT. We analyze the spectra of the flaring period using a series of models consisting of a multi-color disk and several different non-thermal components, and several consistent conclusions are obtained among these models. First, Swift J1727.8--1613 was in the transition process from the hard intermediate state (HIMS) to the very high state (VHS) during the first flaring period (MJD 60197--60204), and afterwards it exhibited typical VHS parameter characteristics, such as high temperature of the disk inner radius and a steep power-law spectrum with a photon index of 2.6. Second, the flares in the VHS are characterized by a rapid increase in the flux of accretion disk, accompanied by a simultaneous rapid expansion of the inner radius, which could be apparent if the accretion disk hardening factor varies significantly. The strong power-law component during the VHS is likely produced by synchrotron self-Compton process in the relativistic jets, in agreement with the observed weak reflection component and lack of correlation with the disk component.

 - **Abstract**
 We determined phase curves for 301,272 asteroids in the orange filter and 280,953 in the cyan filter from the latest ATLAS Solar System Catalog V2 (SSCAT-2). Among them, 3,345 and 492 asteroids in the orange and cyan filters, respectively, have uncertainties below 15%. Our simple model, which considers only the apparition effect, showed good consistency with more sophisticated methods requiring much less computational time. Database cross-matching allowed us to analyze G1 and G2 distributions according to taxonomy. We conducted two-dimensional Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests to investigate two distinct aspects: similarities in paired G1, G2 distributions across different taxa and wavelength dependency within the same taxa. When comparing different taxa, we couldn't reject the null hypothesis for 11% of the orange sample and 31% of the cyan sample, indicating more disparities in the orange filter. For wavelength dependency, paired distributions of G1, G2 (o) vs. G1, G2 (c) showed statistically significant differences across all complexes, except for the A class. Our analysis suggests that while phase coloring behaviors are observed without a clear preference for reddening or bluening at phase angles below 5 degrees, reddening predominates in the 10 - 30 degrees range. We also observed smaller uncertainties in G2 than in G1. Simulations showed that G2 is less sensitive to lack of data at small phase angles. This is related to the definition of the H,G1,G2 function, where G1 contributes more to the opposition effect and G2 the linear part of the phase curve. Our catalog-independent algorithms are adaptable to new data sets, including future LSST data.

 - **Abstract**
 The IRAC camera on the Spitzer Space Telescope observed 2175 Near Earth Objects (NEOs) during its Warm Mission phase, primarily in three large surveys, and also in a small number of a dedicated projects. In this paper we present the final reprocessing of the NEO data and determine fluxes at 3.6 microns (where available) and 4.5 microns. The observing windows range from minutes to nearly ten hours, which means that for 39 NEOs we observe a complete lightcurve, and for these objects we present period and amplitude estimates and derive minimum cohesive strengths for the objects with well-determined periods. For an additional 128 objects we detect a significant fraction of a complete lightcurve, and present estimated lower limits to their rotation periods. This paper presents the final and definitive Spitzer/IRAC NEO flux catalog.

 - **Abstract**
 We formulate the statistics of peaks of non-Gaussian random fields and implement it to study the sphericity of peaks. For non-Gaussianity of the local type, we present a general formalism valid regardless of how large the deviation from Gaussian statistics is. For general types of non-Gaussianity, we provide a framework that applies to any system with a given power spectrum and the corresponding bispectrum in the regime in which contributions from higher-order correlators can be neglected. We present an explicit expression for the most probable values of the sphericity parameters, including the effect of non-Gaussianity on the profile. We show that the effects of small perturbative non-Gaussianity on the sphericity parameters are negligible, as they are even smaller than the subleading Gaussian corrections. In contrast, we find that large non-Gaussianity can significantly distort the peak configurations, making them much less spherical.

 - **Abstract**
 We report results from an $AstroSat$ Target-of-Opportunity (ToO) observation of 4U 1626$-$67, performed on 2023 May 18, soon after the discovery of torque reversal to spin-down in the source. The X-ray emission exhibited significant dependence on both energy and torque state. This work highlights the comparison of timing features of 4U 1626$-$67 with a previous $AstroSat$ observation from 2018, when the neutron star was in the spin-up state. The power density spectrum (PDS) of the 2023 observation comprised a sharp peak corresponding to $\nu_{\rm NS}\sim$130 mHz X-ray pulsations along with a prominent quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) feature at $\nu_{\rm QPO}\sim$46 mHz with $\sim$20\% rms amplitude, which was positively correlated with energy. We also report the detection of sidebands to QPO occurring at a beat frequency ($\nu_{\rm NS}-\nu_{\rm QPO}$) of $\sim$83 mHz with $\sim$8\% rms amplitude, having $>3\sigma$ detection significance. Additionally, we utilized $Nuclear ~Spectroscopic ~Telescope ~ARray$ ($NuSTAR$) observations from the same torque state (2023 May-July) to analogize the presence and energy dependence of sidebands. The source retains timing properties in this spin-down torque state, similar to those seen in the previous spin-down phase. In sharp contrast, PDS from the 2018 observation was dominated by red noise, an absence of QPOs and a broadening in the wings of the pulse frequency peak, indicating a coupling between periodic and low-frequency aperiodic variability. Furthermore, we detected the known cyclotron resonance scattering feature (CRSF) at 37 keV in the Large Area X-ray Proportional Counter (LAXPC) spectrum. We explore various mechanisms that could possibly explain the presence of QPOs exclusively during the spin-down state.

 - **Abstract**
 Coronal oscillations offer insight into energy transport and driving in the solar atmosphere. Knowing its polarisation state helps constrain a wave's displacement and velocity amplitude, improving estimates of wave energy flux and deposition rate. We demonstrate a method to combine imaging and spectral data to infer the polarisation of a coronal loop's standing kink wave, without the need for multiple instruments or multiple lines of sight. We use the unique capabilities of the Coronal Multi-channel Polarimeter (CoMP) to observe the standing kink mode of an off-limb coronal loop perturbed by an eruption. The full off-disk corona is observed using the 1074 nm Fe XIII spectral line, providing Doppler velocity, intensity and line width. By tracking the oscillatory motion of a loop apex in a time-distance map, we extract the line-of-sight (Doppler) velocity of the inhomogeneity as it sways and compare it with the derivative of its plane-of-sky displacement. This analysis provides the loop's velocity in two perpendicular planes as it oscillates with a period of $8.9^{+0.5}_{-0.5}$ minutes. Through detailed analysis of the phase relation between the transverse velocities we infer the kink oscillation to be horizontally polarised, oscillating in a plane tilted $-13.6^{+2.9}_{-3.0}$ degrees away from the plane of sky. The line widths show a periodic enhancement during the kink oscillation, exhibiting both the kink period and its double. This study is the first to combine direct imaging and spectral data to infer the polarisation of a coronal loop oscillation from a single viewpoint.

 - **Abstract**
 PSR J0514$-$4002A is a binary millisecond pulsar located in the globular cluster NGC 1851. The pulsar has a spin period of 4.99 ms, an orbital period of 18.8 days, and is in a very eccentric ($e = 0.89$) orbit around a massive companion. In this work, we present the updated timing analysis of this system, obtained with an additional 1 yr of monthly observations using the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope and 2.5 yrs of observations using the MeerKAT telescope. This has allowed for a precise measurement of the proper motion of the system, implying a transverse velocity of $30\,\pm\,7\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ relative to the cluster. This is smaller than the cluster's escape velocity and consistent with the pulsar's association to NGC 1851. We have confirmed a large second spin frequency derivative and large associated jerk, which has increased the spin frequency derivative by a factor of 27 since the mid-2000s. The third spin frequency derivative showed that the strength of this jerk has increased by $\sim 65\%$ in the same time period. We take the effect of the changing acceleration into account and this allows for much improved estimates of the orbital period derivative. The large and fast-increasing jerk implies the presence of a third body in the vicinity of the pulsar (no counterpart is detectable within distance limit in HST images). Based on our measured parameters, we constrain the mass, distance and orbital parameters for this third body. The induced tidal contributions to the post-Keplerian parameters are small, and the precise measurement of these parameters allowed us to obtain precise mass measurements for the system: $M_\mathrm{tot} = 2.4734(3)$ M$_{\odot}$, $M_\mathrm{p} = 1.39(3)$ M$_{\odot}$, $M_\mathrm{c} = 1.08(3)$ M$_{\odot}$. This indicates that the pulsar's companion is a massive white dwarf and resolves the earlier ambiguity regarding its nature.

 - **Abstract**
 The Axelrod approximation is widely used in astrophysical modelling codes to evaluate electron-impact excitation effective collision strengths for forbidden transitions. Approximate methods such as this are a necessity for many heavy elements with open shells where collisional data is either non existent or sparse as the use of more robust methods prove prohibitively expensive. Atomic data for such forbidden transitions are essential for producing full collisional radiative models that do not assume Local-Thermodynamic-Equilibrium (LTE). In this short work we repeat the optimization of the simple Axelrod formula for a large number of $R$-matrix data sets, ranging from Fe and Ni to the first r-process peak elements of Sr, Y and Zr, to higher Z systems Te, W, Pt and Au. We show that the approximate treatment of forbidden transitions can be a significant source of inaccuracy in such collisional radiative models. We find a large variance of the optimized coefficients for differing systems and charge states, although some general trends can be seen based on the orbital structure of the ground-state-configurations. These trends could potentially inform better estimates for future calculations for elements where $R$-matrix data is not available.

 CARMENES stands for Calar Alto high-Resolution search for M dwarfs with Exoearths with Near-infrared and optical Échelle Spectrographs. CARMENES took six years from a concept to the start of operations, and a couple more years of initial data collection until the first science publication, but now is revolutionising our knowledge on exoplanets and their stars in our immediate vicinity. Here we describe what CARMENES is: (i) an ultra-stabilised two-channel spectrograph at an almost dedicated 3.5 m telescope in southern Spain that covers in high spectral resolution and without big gaps from 0.52 mum to 1.71 mum; (ii) a science project aimed at comprehensively searching for and studying planetary systems with nearby, bright, M-dwarf hosts, but that also investigates transiting planets around other stars; and (iii) the German-Spanish consortium that designed and built the instrument and that has operated it under guaranteed and legacy time observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Fundamental questions about the physics responsible for fragmenting molecular parsec-scale clumps into cores of ~1000 au are still open, that only a statistically significant investigation with ALMA is able to address: what are the dominant agents that determine the core demographics, mass, and spatial distribution as a function of the physical properties of the hosting clumps, their evolutionary stage and the different Galactic environments in which they reside? To what extent extent is fragmentation driven by clumps dynamics or mass transport in filaments? With ALMAGAL we observed the 1.38 mm continuum and lines toward more than 1000 dense clumps in our Galaxy, with M>500M_sun, surface density > 0.1 g/cm2 and d<7.5 kpc. The ACA and two 12-m array setups were used to deliver a minimum resolution of ~1000 au over the entire sample distance range. The sample covers all evolutionary stages from infrared dark clouds (IRDCs) to HII regions from the tip of the Galactic bar to the outskirts of the Galaxy. The spectral setup includes several molecular lines to trace the multiscale physics and dynamics of gas, notably CH3CN, H2CO, SiO, CH3OH, DCN, HC3N, SO etc. We present an initial overview of the observations and the early science product and results, with a first characterization of the morphological properties of the continuum emission. We use "perimeter-versus-area" and convex hull-versus-area metrics to classify the different morphologies. More extended and morphologically complex shapes are found toward clumps that are relatively more evolved and have higher surface densities.

 - **Abstract**
 Several space missions are proposed or planned for the coming two decades dedicated or including mid- to high-resolution spectropolarimetry on a wide UV band. This includes the European instrument Pollux for the NASA HWO flagship mission, the NASA SMEX candidate Polstar, and the French nanosatellite demonstrator CASSTOR. We are developing UV polarimeters for these missions thanks to a R&D program funded by CNES. For the mid- and near-UV, i.e. above 120 nm, birefringent material (MgF2) can be used to produce a polarimeter. This is the baseline for Polstar, CASSTOR, and the MUV and NUV channels of Pollux. Prototypes have been built and tested with excellent results, and further tests are ongoing to fully characterize them. For the FUV channel of Pollux however, it is not possible to use this technology and we have instead studied a design based on mirrors only. We will present the various missions and instruments, their technical challenges, as well as the R&D work performed on UV polarimeters and the proposed design solutions.

 - **Abstract**
 The ALMAGAL Large Program has observed 1017 high-mass star-forming regions distributed throughout the Galaxy, sampling different evolutionary stages and environmental conditions. In this work, we present the acquisition and processing of the ALMAGAL data. The main goal is to set up a robust pipeline that generates science-ready products, with a good and uniform quality across the whole sample. ALMAGAL observations were performed with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). Each field was observed in three different telescope arrays, being sensitive to spatial scales ranging from 1000 au up to 0.1 pc. The spectral setup allows sensitive imaging of the continuum emission at 219 GHz, and it covers multiple molecular spectral lines observed in four different spectral windows that span about 4 GHz in frequency coverage. We have designed a Python-based processing workflow to calibrate and image these observational data. This ALMAGAL pipeline includes an improved continuum determination, suited for line-rich sources; an automatic self-calibration process that improves the dynamical range of the final images; and the combination of data from different telescope arrays to produce science-ready, fully combined images. The fully combined products have spatial resolutions in the range 800-2000 au, and mass sensitivities in the range 0.02-0.07 Mo. We also present a first analysis of the spectral line information included in the ALMAGAL setup, and its potential for future scientific studies. As an example, specific spectral lines at 1000 au scales resolve the presence of multiple outflows in clusters and will help us to search for disk candidates around massive protostars. Moreover, the broad frequency bands provide information on the chemical richness of the different cluster members, which can be used to study the chemical evolution during the formation process of star clusters.

 - **Abstract**
 We present new upper limits on the 21-cm signal power spectrum from the Epoch of Reionization (EoR), at redshifts $z \approx 10.1, 9.1, \text{ and } 8.3$, based on reprocessed observations from the Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR). The analysis incorporates significant enhancements in calibration methods, sky model subtraction, radio-frequency interference (RFI) mitigation, and an improved signal separation technique using machine learning to develop a physically motivated covariance model for the 21-cm signal. These advancements have markedly reduced previously observed excess power due to residual systematics, bringing the measurements closer to the theoretical thermal noise limit across the entire $k$-space. Using comparable observational data, we achieve a 2 to 4-fold improvement over our previous LOFAR limits, with best upper limits of $\Delta_{21}^2 < (68.7\,\mathrm{mK})^2$ at $k = 0.076\,h\,\mathrm{cMpc}^{-1}$, $\Delta_{21}^2 < (54.3\,\mathrm{mK})^2$ at $k = 0.076\,h\,\mathrm{cMpc}^{-1}$ and $\Delta_{21}^2 < (65.5\,\mathrm{mK})^2$ at $k = 0.083\,h\,\mathrm{cMpc}^{-1}$ at redshifts $z \approx 10.1, 9.1$, and $8.3$, respectively. These new multi-redshift upper limits provide new constraints that can be used to refine our understanding of the astrophysical processes during the EoR. Comprehensive validation tests, including signal injection, were performed to ensure the robustness of our methods. The remaining excess power is attributed to residual foreground emissions from distant sources, beam model inaccuracies, and low-level RFI. We discuss ongoing and future improvements to the data processing pipeline aimed at further reducing these residuals, thereby enhancing the sensitivity of LOFAR observations in the quest to detect the 21-cm signal from the EoR.

 - **Abstract**
 A planet's albedo is a fundamental property that sets its energy budget by dictating the fraction of incident radiation absorbed versus reflected back to space. Generally, optical eclipse observations have revealed the majority of hot, giant planets to have low albedos, indicating dayside atmospheres dominated by absorption instead of reflection. However, there are several exceptions to this rule, including the ultra-hot-Neptune LTT 9779b, which have been found to have high geometric albedos. We observed four eclipses of LTT 9779b with the G280 grism of the Hubble Space Telescope's WFC3 UVIS mode; targeting the scattering signatures of the cloud condensate species causing the planet's elevated reflectivity. However, we do not definitively detect the planet's eclipse in our observations, with injection-recovery tests yielding a 3-$\sigma$ upper limit of 113 ppm on the eclipse depth of LTT 9779b in the 0.2-0.8$\mu$m waveband. We create reflectance spectrum grids for LTT 9779b's dayside using VIRGA/PICASO and compare to our UVIS limit, as well as previously published CHEOPS and TESS eclipse photometry. We find that silicate condensates are best able to explain LTT 9779b's highly-reflective dayside. Our forward model grids only enable weak constraints on vertical mixing efficiency, and suggest that, regardless of their particular composition, the clouds are likely composed of smaller and more reflective particles. Our work facilitates a deeper understanding of the reflectance properties of LTT 9779b as well as the UVIS spectroscopic mode itself, which will remain the community's primary access to UV wavelengths until next-generation telescopes like the Habitable Worlds Observatory.

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of chondrules, and the chondritic sedimentary rocks that dominate the meteoritic record, is a long-standing problem in planetary science. Here, we develop a physical model for the formation of chondritic mixtures as an outcome of vaporizing collisions between planetesimals that were dynamically excited by the growth and migration of planets. We present calculations of nebular shock waves generated by impact vapor plumes and focus on aspects of the plume interaction with the nebular gas and dust that have been neglected in previous studies of impact ejecta. We find that, when water dominates the vapor, the plumes are relatively cool. However, the plume expansion is supersonic and can drive strong shock waves in the dusty nebular gas. Portions of these nebular shock fronts initially melt nebular dust, forming chondrules that are coupled to the moving front. As the shock front expands and cools, the chondrules solidify while the shock front entrains additional dust. Eventually, the plume expansion stalls and then hydrodynamically collapses, turbulently mixing variably processed dust and size-sorted chondrules. For probable impact parameters and nebular conditions during giant planet growth and migration, the impact-generated mixtures have characteristics that span the range observed in chondritic meteorites, providing an environment for rapid formation of chondritic assemblages after chondrule formation. Our impact vapor and nebular shocks (IVANS) model links chondrule formation to the overall context of planet formation and provides a framework for interpreting the detailed chronological and geochemical record contained in chondritic meteorites.

 - **Abstract**
 The mechanisms behind the fragmentation of high-mass dense clumps into compact star-forming cores are fundamental topics in current astrophysical research. The ALMAGAL survey provides the opportunity to study this process at an unprecedented level of detail and statistical significance, featuring high-angular resolution $1.38$ mm ALMA observations of $1013$ massive dense clumps at various Galactic locations. These clumps cover a wide range of distances, masses, surface densities, and evolutionary stages. Here, we present the catalog of compact sources obtained with the CuTEx algorithm from continuum images of the full ALMAGAL clump sample combining ACA-$7$m and $12$m ALMA arrays, reaching a uniform high median spatial resolution of $\sim1400$ au. We discuss the fragmentation properties and the estimated physical parameters of the core population. The ALMAGAL compact source catalog includes $6348$ cores detected in $844$ clumps ($83\%$ of the total), with a number of cores per clump between $1$ and $49$ (median of $5$). The estimated core diameters are mostly within $\sim800-3000$ au (median of $1700$ au). We obtained core masses from $0.002$ to $345\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$. We evaluated the variation in the core mass function (CMF) with evolution as traced by the clump $L/M$, finding a clear, robust shift and change in slope among CMFs within subsamples at different stages. This finding suggests that the CMF shape is not constant throughout the star formation process, but rather it builds (and flattens) with evolution, with higher core masses reached at later stages. We found that all cores within a clump grow in mass on average with evolution, and the number of cores increases with the core masses. Our results favor a clump-fed scenario for high-mass star formation, in which cores form as low-mass seeds, and then gain mass while further fragmentation occurs in the clump.

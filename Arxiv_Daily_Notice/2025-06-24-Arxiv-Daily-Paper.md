 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the spiral arms of the Milky Way (MW) remains a key open question in galactic dynamics. Tidal perturbations, such as the recent passage of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy (Sgr), could play a significant role in exciting them. We aim to analytically characterize the dynamics of tidally induced spiral arms, including their phase-space signatures. We ran idealized test-particle simulations resembling impulsive satellite impacts, and used the Sparse Identification of Non-linear Dynamics (SINDy) method to infer their governing Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). We validated the method with analytical derivations and a realistic $N$-body simulation of a MW-Sgr encounter analogue. For small perturbations, a linear system of equations was recovered with SINDy, consistent with predictions from linearised collisionless dynamics. In this case, two distinct waves wrapping at pattern speeds $\Omega \pm \kappa/m$ emerge. For large impacts, we empirically discovered a non-linear system of equations, representing a novel formulation for the dynamics of tidally induced spiral arms. For both cases, these equations describe wave properties like amplitude and pattern speed, and their shape and temporal evolution in different phase-space projections. We fit the Gaia $L_Z-V_R$ waves with the linear model, providing a reasonable fit and plausible parameters for the Sgr passage. However, the predicted amplitude ratio of the two waves is inconsistent with observations, supporting a more complex origin for this feature (e.g. multiple passages, bar, spiral arms). We merge data-driven discovery with theory to create simple, accurate models of tidal spiral arms that match simulations and provide a simple tool to fit Gaia and external galaxy data. This methodology could be extended to model complex phenomena like self-gravity and dynamical friction. (ABR)

          JWST reveals cosmic ray dominated chemistry in the local ULIRG IRAS 07251$-$0248

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze the ro-vibrational absorption bands of various molecular cations (HCO$^+$, HCNH$^+$, and N$_2$H$^+$) and neutral species (HCN, HNC, and HC$_3$N) detected in the JWST/MIRI MRS spectrum (4.9-27.9 $\mu$m) of the local ultra luminous infrared galaxy (ULIRG) IRAS~07251$-$0248. We find that the molecular absorptions are blueshifted by 160 km s$^{-1}$ relative to the systemic velocity of the target. Using local thermal equilibrium (LTE) excitation models, we derive rotational temperatures ($T_{\rm rot}$) from 42 to 185 K for these absorption bands. This range of measured $T_{\rm rot}$ can be explained by infrared (IR) radiative pumping as a byproduct of the strength, effective critical density, and opacity of each molecular band. Thus, these results suggest that these absorptions originate in a warm expanding gas shell ($\dot{M}$$\sim$90-330 $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$), which might be the base of the larger scale cold molecular outflow detected in this source. Finally, the elevated abundance of molecular cations (H$_3^+$, HCO$^+$, HCNH$^+$, and N$_2$H$^+$) can be explained by a high cosmic ray ionization rate, with log($\zeta_{\text{H}_2}$/n$_{\rm H}\, [\text{cm}^3 \text{s}^{-1}])$ in the range of -19.1 to -18.2, consistent with a cosmic ray dominated chemistry as predicted by chemical models.

          Detection of positron in-flight annihilation from the Galaxy

 - **Abstract**
 Although the annihilation of positrons towards the Galactic centre was established more than 50 years ago through the detection of a 511 keV gamma-ray line, the origin of the positrons remains unknown. The gamma-ray line should be accompanied by continuum emission from positron in-flight annihilation, which has not until now been detected. We aim to detect positron in-flight annihilation emission as it provides information on the kinetic energy of the positrons that is key in determining the origin of Galactic positrons. We analysed archival data obtained by the COMPTEL instrument on the Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory satellite to search for positron in-flight annihilation emission at MeV energies. Our analysis revealed extended MeV emission towards the bulge of the Galaxy, which we attribute to in-flight annihilation of positrons produced with kinetic energies of $\sim2$ MeV. The observed spectrum suggests that positrons are produced quasi mono-energetically, which could occur by the annihilation of dark matter particles with masses of $\sim3$ MeV or through bulk motion in the jet of the microquasar 1E 1740.7-2942. We furthermore detected a point-like MeV emission component towards the Galactic centre that is the plausible low-energy counterpart of the Fermi/LAT source 4FGL J1745.6-2859. The broad band spectrum of the source may be explained by the injection of pair plasma from the supermassive black hole Sgr A* into the interstellar medium, which would also explain the point-like 511 keV line emission component that was discovered by INTEGRAL/SPI at the Galactic centre. The observed positron in-flight annihilation spectrum towards the Galactic bulge excludes $\beta^+$ decays from radioactivities as well as any mechanism producing highly relativistic positrons as origin of the Galactic bulge positrons.

 - **Abstract**
 Aims: In this work, we aim to confirm the high albedo of the benchmark ultrahot Neptune LTT9779b using 20 secondary eclipse measurements of the planet observed with CHEOPS. In addition, we perform a search for variability in the reflected light intensity of the planet as a function of time. Methods: First, we used the TESS follow-up data of LTT9779b from three sectors (2, 29, and 69) to remodel the transit signature and estimate an updated set of transit and ephemeris parameters, which were directly used in the modeling of the secondary eclipse lightcurves. This involved a critical noise-treatment algorithm, including sophisticated techniques such as wavelet denoising and Gaussian Process (GP) regression, to constrain noise levels from various sources. In addition to using the officially released reduced aperture photometry data from CHEOPS DRP, we also reduced the raw data using an independent PSF photometry pipeline, known as PIPE, to verify the robustness of our analysis. The extracted secondary eclipse lightcurves were modeled using the PYCHEOPS package, where we have detrended the background noise correlated with the spacecraft roll angle, originating from the inhomogeneous and asymmetric shape of the CHEOPS point spread function, using an N-order glint function. Results: Our independent lightcurve analyses have resulted in consistent estimations of the eclipse depths, with values of 89.9$\pm$13.7 ppm for the DRP analysis and 85.2$\pm$13.1 ppm from PIPE, indicating a high degree of statistical agreement. Adopting the DRP value yields a highly constrained geometric albedo of 0.73$\pm$0.11. No significant eclipse depth variability is detected down to a level of $\sim$37 ppm. Conclusions: Our results confirm that LTT9779b exhibits a strikingly high optical albedo, which substantially reduces the internal energy budget of the planet compared to more opaque...

 - **Abstract**
 The cold, dense matter equation of state (EoS) determines crucial global properties of neutron stars (NSs), including the mass, radius and tidal deformability. However, a one-dimensional (1D), cold, and $\beta$-equilibrated EoS is insufficient to fully describe the interactions or capture the dynamical processes of dense matter as realized in binary neutron star (BNS) mergers or core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), where thermal and out-of-equilibrium effects play important roles. We develop a method to self-consistently extend a 1D cold and $\beta$-equilibrated EoS of quark matter to a full three-dimensional (3D) version, accounting for density, temperature, and electron fraction dependencies, within the framework of Fermi-liquid theory (FLT), incorporating both thermal and out-of-equilibrium contributions. We compare our FLT-extended EoS with the original bag model and find that our approach successfully reproduces the contributions of thermal and compositional dependencies of the 3D EoS. Furthermore, we construct a 3D EoS with a first-order phase transition (PT) by matching our 3D FLT-extended quark matter EoS to the hadronic DD2 EoS under Maxwell construction, and test it through the GRHD simulations of the TOV-star and CCSN explosion. Both simulations produce consistent results with previous studies, demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of our 3D EoS construction with PT.

 - **Abstract**
 The gravothermal core collapse of self-interacting dark matter halos provides a compelling mechanism for seeding supermassive black holes in the early Universe. In this scenario, a small fraction of a halo, approximately $1\%$ of its mass, collapses into a dense core, which could further evolve into a black hole. We demonstrate that this process can account for the origin of JWST little red dots (LRDs) observed at redshifts $z\sim4-11$, where black holes with masses of $10^7{\rm\,M_\odot}$ can form within $500{\rm\,Myr}$ after the formation of host halos with masses of $10^{9}{\rm\,M_\odot}$. Even if the initial collapse region triggering general-relativistic instability has a mass on the order of one solar mass, the resulting seed can grow into an intermediate-mass black hole via Eddington accretion of baryonic gas. Subsequently, it can continue to grow into a supermassive black hole through dark Bondi accretion of dark matter particles. In this scenario, the majority of the black hole's mass originates from dark matter accretion rather than baryonic matter, naturally explaining the overmassive feature of LRDs.

 - **Abstract**
 Research into light curves from stars (temporal variation of brightness) has completely changed how exoplanets are discovered or characterised. This study including star light curves from the Kepler dataset as a way to discover exoplanets (planetary transits) and derive some estimate of their physical characteristics by the light curve and machine learning methods. The dataset consists of measured flux (recordings) for many individual stars and we will examine the light curve of each star and look for periodic dips in brightness due to an astronomical body making a transit. We will apply variables derived from an established method for deriving measurements from light curve data to derive key parameters related to the planet we observed during the transit, such as distance to the host star, orbital period, radius. The orbital period will typically be measured based on the time between transit of the subsequent timelines and the radius will be measured based on the depth of transit. The density of the star and planet can also be estimated from the transit event, as well as very limited information on the albedo (reflectivity) and atmosphere of the planet based on transmission spectroscopy and/or the analysis of phase curve for levels of flux. In addition to these methods, we will employ some machine learning classification of the stars (i.e. likely have an exoplanet or likely do not have an exoplanet) based on flux change. This could help fulfil both the process of looking for exoplanets more efficient as well as providing important parameters for the planet. This will provide a much quicker means of searching the vast astronomical datasets for the likelihood of exoplanets.

 - **Abstract**
 Based on optical and infrared survey data spanning $\approx 20$ years of observations, the long-term variability of the polar V379 Vir with a brown dwarf secondary has been studied. By modeling the spectral energy distribution, we constrain the white dwarf's mass to $M_1 = 0.61 \pm 0.05~M_{\odot}$ and its effective temperature to $T_{eff} = 10930 \pm 350~K$. Near-infrared photometry yields a donor radius of $R_2 = 0.095 \pm 0.018 R_{\odot}$ and temperature $T_{eff} = 1600 \pm 180 K$. Modeling of the cyclotron emission from the accretion spot, detected with the Spitzer infrared telescope, gives an accretion rate of $\dot{M} \approx 3 \times 10^{-13} M_{\odot}/yr$. This rate is consistent with polars in a low accretion state, but significantly higher than expected from wind-driven mass transfer.

 - **Abstract**
 This study analyzes an 11-year cosmic ray dataset of positrons and antiprotons for planetary dependencies related to gravitationally focused dark matter streams. By projecting event timestamps onto planetary heliocentric longitudes, structured flux modulations are found. The results resemble previously reported planetary relationships in solar and terrestrial observables. This supports the possibility that streaming dark matter particles are focused toward Earth by solar system bodies, including the Moon. The findings suggest further searches using other cosmic ray channels, including existing very high-energy gamma ray data.

 - **Abstract**
 This work is the continuation of a series attempting to characterize the local warm ionized medium through both static and time dependent simulations. We build upon our three dimensional, observationally-derived simulation of the local photoionized interstellar medium - based on static photoionization simulations constrained by 3D dust maps - to include metals required to predict collisionally excited optical and infrared emission lines, providing the first all-sky prediction of a series of lines including [SII] 6716$\mathring{A}$, [NII] 6584$\mathring{A}$ and [OIII] 5007$\mathring{A}$. While these predictions only include O-star photoionization under ionization equilibrium, we also carry out a suite of radiation-hydrodynamics simulations including time-dependent metal ionization and the effects of supernova feedback to highlight missing features in our predicted skies. We use the simulations to estimate the very local (1 $\rm kpc^{2}$) Galactic star formation rate, finding a rate of 370 $\rm M_{\odot}~Myr^{-1}~kpc^{-2}$ provides the best match between the observationally-derived and ab-initio simulations. This is approximately a factor of four lower than previous estimates for the star formation rate required to support an observed layer of high-altitude diffuse ionized gas, possibly suggesting a `bursty' star formation history in the region surrounding the Sun. We also investigate the effects of O-star environments on their ability to ionize large volumes of diffuse ionized gas, and find it is likely ionized by a small number of luminous O-stars located in regions where the leakage of their Lyman continuum photons can produce the vast volumes of ionized gas observed in the midplane and at high galactic altitudes.

 We recently identified an upturn in [Na/Fe] for the population of Solar-type stars in the Galactic thick disc ($-0.3 < [\mathrm{Fe/H}] < +0.3$ dex) at super-Solar metallicity in GALactic Archaeology with HERMES (GALAH) data. Here, we investigate the cause of this unexplained Na enrichment between ([Fe/H] $\sim 0 - 0.6$ dex) using the OMEGA$+$ galactic chemical evolution code. We investigate the increase of [Na/Fe] with four combinations of nucleosynthetic yields from the literature, with source contributions from core-collapse supernovae, asymptotic giant branch stars, and Type Ia supernovae. We focus on two possible causes for the Na-enhancement: the "metallicity effect" resulting from core-collapse supernovae at super-Solar metallicity and the contribution of metal-rich AGB stars. We adopt two sets of Type Ia supernova yields with one model assuming only Chandrasekhar-mass explosions, and another assuming only sub-Chandrasekhar-mass explosions. We find that the assumed Type Ia explosion has little effect on the [Na/Fe] Galactic chemical evolution modelling, and all Galactic chemical evolution models tested fail to reproduce the observed [\mathrm{Na/Fe}] enrichment in the young thick disc population at super-Solar metallicities. Our study indicates a possible "under-pollution effect" by SNe Ia, which are the dominant producers of iron, in the Galactic disc's Solar-type star population. These findings provide a step forward toward understanding the origin of the unexplained sodium enrichment at super-Solar metallicities in the Galactic disc.

          Feasibility study of a mission to Sedna -- Nuclear propulsion and advanced solar sailing concepts

 - **Abstract**
 Exploring the outer reaches of the Solar System presents significant propulsion and mission design challenges. This study assesses the feasibility of a mission to Sedna using two advanced propulsion concepts: the Direct Fusion Drive (DFD) rocket engine, based on D-$^{3}$He thermonuclear fusion, and a solar sail utilizing thermal desorption of its coating for propulsion. Both are evaluated for a one-way Earth-to-Sedna mission; however, due to the different performances the DFD would enable orbit insertion, whereas for the solar sail a flyby is envisioned. The analysis evaluates key mission parameters, including delivered payload capacity, travel time, and potential science return. For the DFD, we assume a 1.6 MW system with constant thrust and specific impulse, while for the solar sail, we consider acceleration via thermal desorption and a gravity-assist maneuver around Jupiter. The mission analysis incorporates four key phases: departure, interplanetary acceleration, interplanetary coasting, and rendezvous. Sedna is expected to pass through the perihelion of its orbit in 2075--2076 and then move again away from the Sun. Considering the distances involved, a mission targeting the object would need to be launched "relatively" soon, especially if using conventional propulsion systems, which could require up to 30 years of deep-space travel. In our study, results indicate that the DFD could reach Sedna in approximately 10 years, with 1.5 years of thrusting, while the solar sail, assisted by Jupiter's gravity, could complete the journey in 7 years. The feasibility of science payload accommodation, power availability, and communication constraints is also considered. These findings provide a comparative foundation for future deep-space mission planning.

          Planetary Obliquity Excitation Through Pre-Main Sequence Stellar Evolution

 - **Abstract**
 A planet's axial tilt ("obliquity") substantially affects its atmosphere and habitability. It is thus essential to comprehend the various mechanisms that can excite planetary obliquities, particularly at the primordial stage. Here, we explore planetary obliquity excitation induced by the early evolution of the host star. A young, distended star spins rapidly, resulting in a large gravitational quadrupole moment that induces nodal recession of the planet's orbit. As the star contracts and spins down, the nodal recession frequency decreases and can cross the planet's spin axis precession frequency. An adiabatic encounter results in the planet's capture into a secular spin-orbit resonance and excites the obliquity to large values. We find planets within $a \lesssim 1 \ \mathrm{AU}$ are most affected, but adiabatic capture depends on the initial stellar radius and spin rate. The overall picture is complicated by other sources of perturbation, including the disk, multiple planets, and tidal dissipation. Tides make it such that stellar oblateness-induced obliquity excitation is transient since tidal perturbations cause the resonance to break once high obliquities are reached. However, this early transient excitation is important because it can prime planets for long-term capture in a secular spin-orbit resonance induced by planet-planet interactions. Thus, although stellar oblateness-induced resonances are short-lived, they facilitate the prevalence of long-lived non-zero obliquities in exoplanets.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we propose a new model that combines holographic dark energy with modified gravity $f(Q,T)$ to explore a possible explanation for the accelerated expansion of the universe. We incorporate the holographic principle into non-metric gravity with non-minimal matter coupling and introduce the Barrow holographic dark energy model to account for a tighter corrections, allowing for a more generalized discussion. Furthermore, we perform parameter estimation using the latest observational data, including Type Ia supernova, BAO and Hubble parameter direct measurements. Our results show that the model provides a theoretical framework to describe late-time cosmic evolution and the universe's accelerated expansion. Despite the additional complexity introduced, the model offers a viable approach for investigating dark energy within modified gravity theories.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the origin of low-energy solar neutrons flux is crucial for probing solar energetic processes and neutron transport mechanisms in interplanetary space. This study investigates the role of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) in modulating the low-energy solar neutrons. The neutron flux is modeled by incorporating a CME-width scaling factor into existing neutron fluence models. Our analysis, based on CME data from the SECHHI COR2 database during the DANSON experiment (2016-10-27 to 2017-03-17), identified narrow-width (20$^\circ$ $<$ $\alpha$ $<$ 80$^\circ$) and fast (v $>$ 800 km/s) CMEs as key contributors to neutron production. The revised model predicts a neutron flux of 5 - 49 neutrons cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ at 1 AU for a neutron travel time of 1.66 hours, aligning with previous reports. Additionally, the estimated total flux of 2.45 MeV neutrons over a 4-hour period accounts for 10.23\% of DANSON's total flux. These findings suggest that CME-driven mechanisms may significantly influence the low-energy solar neutron flux. More observational efforts are needed to refine neutron flux estimates and improve background subtraction techniques for spaceborne neutron detectors.

 - **Abstract**
 Nonminimal coupling between the inflaton and the Ricci scalar plays a crucial role in shaping the predictions of single-field inflationary models. While a quartic potential with such coupling represents one of the simplest realizations compatible with cosmological observations, it generically receives important radiative corrections when the inflaton interacts with other fields, particularly those involved in the reheating process. In this work, we focus on radiative corrections arising from bosonic scalar couplings and study their impact on inflationary dynamics within the nonminimally coupled quartic potential framework. We demonstrate that bosonic corrections, unlike fermionic ones, yield predictions more compatible with the latest constraints from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) Data Release 6, especially when combined with Planck and BICEP/Keck data. We begin with a general model involving a gauge-singlet real scalar inflaton coupled to a complex scalar field, which could be the Standard Model Higgs or a GUT Higgs. As a concrete realization, we also investigate the case where the inflaton serves as a dark matter candidate through a Higgs portal interaction while highlighting its potential to generate observable levels of primordial gravitational waves. Notably, the nonminimally coupled inflation model studied here is field-theoretically equivalent to the Starobinsky model, and the inclusion of quantum corrections from scalar fields leads to characteristic imprints in the $(n_s, r)$ plane, allowing for refined constraints on scalar couplings from current and future observations.

          Co-evolution of cosmic ray energy spectra, composition, and anisotropies

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of cosmic rays remains an unresolved fundamental problem in astrophysics. The synergy of multiple observational probes, including the energy spectra, the mass composition, and anisotropy is a viable way to jointly uncover this mystery. In this work, we propose that the energy-dependent of those observables in a wide energy range, from $O(10)$ GeV to ultrahigh energies of $10^{11}$ GeV, share quite a few correlated features, indicating a strong co-evolution which could be a consequence of the underlying origin of different source populations. We decipher these structures with a four-component model, i.e., the ensemble of Galactic sources, a local source close to the solar system, and the ensemble of two extra-galactic source populations. In this scenario, the $O(10^2)$ GV hardening and $O(10)$ TV bump is due to the contribution of the local source, the knee is due to the maximum acceleration energy of protons by the Galactic source population, the second knee is due to the maximum acceleration energy of iron nuclei by Galactic sources, the dip feature between the two knees is due to the appearance of the extra-galactic component, the ankle comes from the transition from one extra-galactic component to the other, and the spectral suppression at the highest energies arises from the acceleration limit of the second extra-galactic component. The transition from Galactic to extra-galactic origin of cosmic rays occurs around $O(10^8)$ GeV, which is smaller than the ankle energy.

 We report the discovery of high-energy $\gamma$-ray emission in the vicinity of G213.0-0.6, which is debated as a supernova remnant (SNR) or an ionized hydrogen (H$_{\rm{II}}$) region. Using 16-yr Pass 8 data from Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT), we found three extended sources with different photon spectra in this region, which will label as SrcA, SrcB and SrcC. Among them, the $\gamma$-ray source SrcA with a log-parabola spectrum is spatially coincident with a star-forming region and several OB stars. The power-law spectra source SrcB is spatially coincident with a SNR radio shell. SrcC with a harder power-law photon spectrum is located outside of the radio shell structure. All of them are spatially coincident with a dense molecular cloud (MC) in the velocity range of 35 - 54 km s$^{-1}$. In this scenario, SrcB can be interpreted as the GeV counterpart of the SNR, and its $\gamma$-ray emission originates from the shock-cloud interaction. SrcA and SrcC originate from the escaped CRs illuminating nearby MC. For SrcA, another possibility is that the $\gamma$-ray emission originates from a young stellar cluster (YSC) associated with a star-forming region (SFR), however, the supporting evidence remains insufficient to draw a definitive conclusion.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent discoveries of long gamma-ray bursts accompanied by kilonova emission prompted interest in understanding their progenitors. If these long-duration bursts arise from neutron star mergers, similar to short gamma-ray bursts, it raises the question of which physical properties govern burst duration. The mass of the merger stands out as a key factor, strongly influencing the lifetime of the merger remnant, which in turn determines the burst duration: lighter mergers that form long-lived remnants produce short bursts, whereas more massive mergers result in short-lived remnants that collapse into black holes, powering longer bursts. In this paper, we compare merger rates from gravitational-wave observations of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA with the rates of kilonova-associated long and short gamma-ray bursts, to identify a characteristic total neutron star mass that separates the two burst classes at $1.36^{+0.08}_{-0.09}$ (median and 68\% confidence interval) times of the neutron star Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff mass. This result suggests that massive neutron stars could survive an extended period after merger. Our findings are robust against substantial observational uncertainties and model assumptions. Moreover, we uncover correlations among various characteristic masses tied to dense nuclear matter, introducing a novel and independent approach to constrain neutron star nuclear properties through separated and combined gravitational-wave and gamma-ray burst observations.

 - **Abstract**
 A self-interacting dark-matter (SIDM) density spike around merging supermassive black holes (SMBHs) may be able to supply the dynamical friction needed to shrink binaries from $\sim 1\, \mathrm{pc}$ to $\sim 10^{-2} \,\mathrm{pc}$, thereby resolving the long-standing ``final-parsec problem.'' Embedding the binary-halo system in a cosmological population model, we evolve the inspiral under the combined influence of gravitational-wave (GW) emission and SIDM drag, compute the resulting nanohertz GW background, and confront it with the NANOGrav 15 year pulsar-timing data. A six-parameter Bayesian analysis, performed with a Gaussian-process-accelerated Markov chain Monte Carlo, yields posterior constraints on the cross-section per unit mass and maximum circular velocity values that were consistent with independent galaxy-rotation and cluster-lensing limits. Within this parameter space, the SIDM spike remains intact, supplies sufficient friction to overcome the stellar depletion barrier, and produces a characteristic-strain spectrum that matches the NANOGrav signal as well as phenomenological astrophysical models.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive multivariate statistical analysis of 517 exoplanets from the NASA Exoplanet Archive to identify potentially habitable worlds and quantify detection bias in current surveys. Using eight key parameters (planetary radius, equilibrium temperature, insolation flux, density, and stellar effective temperature, radius, mass, metallicity), we developed a classification framework that successfully identifies Earth as an "Excellent Candidate" for habitability. Our analysis reveals that only 0.6% (3 planets including Earth) meet all habitability criteria under relaxed thresholds, while 75.0% exhibit "Good Star, Poor Planet" characteristics, indicating significant observational bias toward unsuitable planetary systems. Hotelling's T2 test demonstrates that potentially habitable planets are statistically significantly different from the general exoplanet population (p = 0.015). Mahalanobis distance analysis places Earth in the 69.4th percentile for statistical unusualness, confirming that Earth-like planets are genuine outliers in parameter space. We identify Kepler-22 b as a compelling Earth analog with remarkable parameter similarity, and reveal that 1.2% of planets represent "edge cases" orbiting M-dwarf stars with suitable planetary but marginal stellar conditions. These findings demonstrate systematic detection bias in exoplanet surveys and provide quantitative evidence for the rarity of Earth-like worlds while identifying high-priority targets for atmospheric characterization with JWST.

          Unveiling the Pitfalls of CPL Parametrization at High Redshifts: A Critical Assessment of the $ω_{0}$$ω_a$CDM Model with DESI DR2 BAO Data

 - **Abstract**
 We critically assess the w0waCDM model, employing the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization, w(z) = w0 + wa * z / (1 + z), using Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements from DESI Data Release 2 (DR2). While DESI BAO data broadly align with the standard LambdaCDM model, giving Omega_m = 0.3, our Markov Chain Monte Carlo fits show notable variation in best-fit values and degeneracy directions for w0waCDM across combinations of BAO observables (DV/rd, DM/rd, DH/rd, and DM/DH). When constrained solely by DESI BAO data, the w0waCDM model shows internal inconsistencies. Unlike LambdaCDM and wCDM, which fit all observables consistently, w0waCDM predicts lower values for rd-dependent observables and higher values for DM/DH. This conflict, including unphysical parameter compensation at high redshift, reflects limitations of the CPL form, especially its behavior at high redshift. The model compensates for poor individual fits by inflating Omega_m and driving wa to large negative values. Our findings suggest that DESI DR2 BAO data alone do not robustly constrain w0waCDM due to degeneracies and CPL limitations. These issues affect both rd-based and ratio observables like DM/DH. We recommend applying dynamical dark energy parametrizations directly to DV, DM, and DH measurements to better constrain wa across redshifts.

 - **Abstract**
 Improving gamma-hadron separation is one of the most effective ways to enhance the performance of ground-based gamma-ray observatories. With over a decade of continuous operation, the High-Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) Observatory has contributed significantly to high-energy astrophysics. To further leverage its rich dataset, we introduce a machine learning approach for gamma-hadron separation. A Multilayer Perceptron shows the best performance, surpassing traditional and other Machine Learning based methods. This approach shows a notable improvement in the detector's sensitivity, supported by results from both simulated and real HAWC data. In particular, it achieves a 19\% increase in significance for the Crab Nebula, commonly used as a benchmark. These improvements highlight the potential of machine learning to significantly enhance the performance of HAWC and provide a valuable reference for ground-based observatories, such as Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) and the upcoming Southern Wide-field Gamma-ray Observatory (SWGO).

 We present the analysis of four new extremely metal poor turn-off stars thanks to high-resolution spectra obtained with the Subaru/HDS spectrograph. We determined the abundances and upper limits of Li, C, Mg, Ca, Sr, and Ba. Metallicities range from [Fe/H] = -3.3 to -4.4 dex. For one of the stars, we measure the lithium abundance Log(Li/H) = 2.1 {\pm} 0.2. Two stars of the sample have low [{\alpha}/Fe] abundances. The most metal-poor star of the sample with [Fe/H] = -4.42 dex has a high [Sr/Fe] abundance ratio [Sr/Fe] = 0.9 dex, a high value also found in HE 1327-2326. This star is the second-most iron-poor star observed with Subaru telescope, suggesting that more ultra metal-poor stars could be discovered using high-resolution spectrographs in the Northern Hemisphere.

 - **Abstract**
 Sunspot engravings made in the Maunder minimum are used to evaluate the fine structure of sunspots. Based on 78 images of the full solar disk and 77 images of individual sunspots, we have evaluated the ratio of penumbral-to-umbral area (P/U) to be 4.2 $\pm$ 2.5 and 3.8 $\pm$ 2.3, respectively. These results are consistent with previous estimates before, during, and after the Maunder minimum, as well as with the P/U ratio observed in the largest sunspot groups in solar cycle 24. This suggests that the near-surface convection mode has most likely remained unchanged since the early seventeenth century. We also found that schematic sunspot drawings tend to underestimate the P/U ratio.

          Comparison of $R_h=ct$ and $Λ$CDM using DESI DR1 measurements

 - **Abstract**
 We use DESI DR1 BAO measurements of the ratio of tranvserse comoving distance to Hubble distance in order to test the compatibility of $R_h=ct$ over flat $\Lambda$CDM. For this purpose, we used Bayesian model selection to evaluate the efficacy of these models given the observed data. When we consider the BAO measurements up to redshift of 1.3, both models are equally favored. However, when we consider the Lyman-$\alpha$ QSO measurement at redshift of 2.33, we find Bayes factors of greater than 100 for flat $\Lambda$CDM over $R_h=ct$ using two different priors for $\Omega_m$, indicating that $\Lambda$CDM is decisively favored over $R_h=ct$. The same is the case when we combine all the measurements. Therefore, the DESI DRI measurements rule out $R_h=ct$ cosmology, albeit this is driven by the Lyman-$\alpha$ QSO measurement at $z=2.33$.

 - **Abstract**
 A direct interaction between dark energy and dark matter provides a natural and important extension to the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. We perform a non-parametric reconstruction of the vacuum energy ($w=-1$) interacting with cold dark matter using the cosmological data from DESI DR2, Planck CMB, and three SNIa samples (PP, DESY5, and Union3). By discretizing the coupling function $\beta(z)$ into 20 redshift bins and assuming a Gaussian smoothness prior, we reconstruct $\beta(z)$ without assuming any specific parameterization. The mean reconstructed $\beta(z)$ changes sign during cosmic evolution, indicating an energy transfer from cold dark matter to dark energy at early times and a reverse flow at late times. At high redshifts, $\beta(z)$ shows a $\sim 2\sigma$ deviation from $\Lambda$CDM. At low redshifts, the results depend on the SNIa sample: CMB+DESI and CMB+DESI+PP yield $\beta(z)$ consistent with zero within $2\sigma$, while CMB+DESI+DESY5 and CMB+DESI+Union3 prefer negative $\beta$ at $\sim2\sigma$. Both $\chi^2$ tests and Bayesian analyses favor the $\beta(z)$ model, with CMB+DESI DR2+DESY5 showing the most significant support through the largest improvement in goodness of fit ($\Delta\chi^2_{\rm MAP}=-17.76$) and strongest Bayesian evidence ($\ln\mathcal{B} = 5.98 \pm 0.69$). Principal component analysis reveals that the data effectively constrain three additional degrees of freedom in the $\beta(z)$ model, accounting for most of the improvement in goodness of fit. Our results demonstrate that the dynamical dark energy preference in current data can be equally well explained by such a sign-reversal interacting dark energy, highlighting the need for future observations to break this degeneracy.

          Flash Ionization of the Early Universe by Pop III.1 Supermassive Stars

 - **Abstract**
 The Pop III.1 theory for supermassive black hole (SMBH) formation predicts that a substantial fraction of the early universe was ionized by supermassive stars at redshifts $z\sim20-30$, an era we refer to as ``The Flash''. This is followed by recombination to a mainly neutral state within a few tens of Myr. Here we discuss the implication of this ionization for the scattering optical depth of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), $\tau$. We find a fiducial contribution of $\tau_{\rm PopIII.1}\sim0.04$. Combining this with the contribution to reionization by standard galaxy populations at $z\lesssim 10$ with $\tau_{\rm gal}\simeq0.06$, yields a total of $\tau\simeq0.10$. As noted recently by several authors, such a value can help resolve apparent ``problems'' faced by $\Lambda$CDM of negative neutrino masses and dynamical dark energy that have been implied by recent Baryonic Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) results from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI).

 - **Abstract**
 Blazars, a highly energetic subclass of jetted active galactic nuclei, show a broad band spectral energy distribution (SED) with two bumps, resulting from non-thermal jet emission. In 1998, an anticorrelation between the SED luminosity and the peaks frequency was found, later confirmed in 2017, called the blazar sequence. Its origin is still unclear. This work is part of a broader effort aiming at giving a physical interpretation to the blazar sequence, by modeling the sources emission in a Synchrotron Self Compton framework, concentrating only on TeV-detected blazars of BL Lac type. Unlike the original sequence, sources were binned by synchrotron peak frequency. The SED of one representative source is modeled for each bin, using data from average activity state to ensure consistency. Here, we focus on the study of one of the selected representative sources, PKS 2155-304, a high-energy-peaked BL Lac, showing the performed data selection and preliminary modeling results.

 We present the discovery and validation of a super-Earth planet orbiting the M dwarf star TOI-1846 (TIC 198385543). The host star(Kmag = 9.6)is located 47 pc away and has a radius of Rs=0.41+/-0.01R_Sun,a mass of Ms=0.40+/-0.02M_Sun and an effective temperature of Teff=3568+/-44K. Our analyses are based on joint modelling of TESS photometry and ground-based multi-color photometric data. We also use high-resolution imaging and archival images, as well as statistical validation techniques to support the planetary system nature. We find that TOI-1846b is a super-Earth sized planet with radius of Rp=1.79+/-0.07R_Earth and a predicted mass of Mp=4.4+1.6-1.0M_Earth (from the Chen & Kipping relation) on a 3.9 d orbit, with an equilibrium temperature of Teq=589+/-20K (assuming a null Bond Albedo) and an incident flux of Sp=17.6+/-2.0S_Earth. Based on the two RV measurements obtained with the TRES spectrograph and high-resolution imaging, a non-planetary transiting companion is excluded. With a radius of ~1.8R_Earth, TOI-1846b is within the sparsely populated radius range around 2R_Earth known as the radius gap (or radius valley). This discovery can contribute to refining the precise location of the radius valley for small planets orbiting bright M dwarfs, thereby enhancing our understanding of planetary formation and evolution processes.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of J1218+1813, a circular diffuse radio source detected in the Very Large Array (VLA) FIRST survey at 1400 MHz. The source has an angular diameter of approximately one arcminute, corresponding to a physical size of ~180 kpc, and is associated with an elliptical galaxy with a redshift of z = 0.139635. To investigate its nature, we conducted a comprehensive multiwavelength analysis spanning both high and low radio frequencies, utilizing the VLA in C-configuration at L, C and X bands, along with the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) at bands 3 (250-500 MHz), 4 (550-850 MHz), and 5 (1000-1460 MHz). A spectral study based on these multiwavelength observations reveals that the core of J1218+1813 exhibits a steep spectral index of 0.8, indicating that the emission is dominated by optically thin synchrotron radiation. The spectral index varies between 1.1 and 1.8, from the inner to the outer structure, with the steepest values observed at the periphery of the diffuse emission. An optical analysis of the central host galaxy using spectroscopic data is also performed. The estimated black hole mass is $2.8 \pm 0.8 \times 10^{8}$ M${_\odot}$, while the host galaxy has a stellar mass of 2.9 $\times$ 10$^{11}$ M${_\odot}$ and a stellar age of 8.58 Gyr. The identification of J1218+1813 is particularly significant because it provides insight into the mechanisms responsible for the formation of circular diffuse radio structures surrounded by an elliptical galaxy. Potential formation scenarios for J1218+1813 are discussed in this paper.

 - **Abstract**
 IceTop is the cosmic-ray detector located on the surface of the IceCube Neutrino Observatory at the South Pole, consisting of 81 pairs of ice-Cherenkov tanks. The rise in the energy threshold of air-shower measurements in IceTop due to accumulating snow emphasized the need for the next generation of IceCube surface detectors. For this purpose, the Surface Array Enhancement (SAE) is set to comprise elevated scintillator panels and radio antennas controlled by hybrid DAQ systems. The detectors of the SAE are also expected to extend to the planned IceCube-Gen2 Surface Array. An initial study with a prototype station is already conducted. We briefly review the SAE and the deployment as well as the calibration status of the upcoming stations of the planned array of 32 stations. The focus of this contribution is on the radio detection of extensive air showers. A preliminary estimation of the position of the shower maximum ($X_\mathrm{max}$), that is sensitive to the primary mass, with data from the 3 antennas of the prototype station was carried out. An extension of the method from previous analyses is also briefly discussed.

          A Systematic Search for MeV-GeV Pulsar Wind Nebulae without Gamma-ray Detected Pulsars

 - **Abstract**
 An increasing number of pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) are being identified in the TeV band by ground-based Imaging Air Cherenkov Telescopes such that they constitute the dominant source class of Galactic TeV emitters. However, MeV-GeV PWN counterparts are still largely lacking. To date, only a dozen PWNe are identified by the Fermi-Large Area Telescope (LAT) in the MeV-GeV band. Most PWNe are located along the Galactic plane embedded within the prominent, diffuse Galactic gamma-ray emission, which makes these sources difficult to disentangle from the bright diffuse background. We present a systematic search for gamma-ray counterparts to known PWNe in the 300MeV-2TeV energy band using the Fermi-LAT. We target locations of previously identified PWNe that lack detected Fermi-LAT pulsars to minimize associated pulsar contamination. The sample includes 6 previously identified Fermi-LAT PWNe and 8 Fermi-LAT sources associated with PWNe. We report the analysis of 58 regions of interest and classify detected sources as either a likely PWN or a candidate PWN counterpart based on their morphological and spectral characteristics across the broadband spectrum. There are 9 unidentified Fermi-LAT sources that we consider as likely PWN counterparts, which, if confirmed to be PWNe, would greatly increase the PWN population detected by the Fermi-LAT from 12 to 21. The remaining Fermi-LAT detected sources are considered weaker PWN candidates. A second approach in the systematic search for gamma-ray emitting PWNe will involve studying the off-pulse phases of Fermi-LAT pulsars for the presence of an obscured PWN and will be reported in a subsequent paper.

 - **Abstract**
 JWST NIRCam images provide low-resolution spectra of the rings and inner moons orbiting Uranus and Neptune. These data reveal systematic variations in spectral parameters like the strength of the strong OH absorption band around 3 microns and the spectral slopes at continuum wavelengths. Neptune's rings show an extremely weak 3-micron band, which is likely due to the small particle sizes in these dusty rings. Neptune's small inner moons also have weaker 3-micron bands and redder continua than Uranus' small inner moons, indicating that Neptune's moons have a lower water-ice fraction. There are also clear spectral trends across the inner Uranian system. The strength of the 3-micron band clearly increases with distance from Uranus, with the rings having a noticeably weaker 3-micron band than most of the small inner moons, which have a weaker 3-micron band than the larger moons like Miranda. While the rings and most of the small moons have neutral spectra between 1.4 microns and 2.1 microns, the outermost small moon Mab exhibits a blue spectral slope comparable to Miranda, indicating that Mab's surface may also be relatively water-ice rich. The next moon interior to Mab, Puck, exhibits a stronger 3-micron band and bluer continuum slope than any of the moons orbiting interior to it, perhaps indicating that it is being covered by water-ice-rich material derived from Mab via the mu ring. Finally, the small moon Rosalind has a redder spectral slope than its neighbors, possibly due to being coated with material from the dusty nu ring.

 - **Abstract**
 The angular resolution measure (ARM) is widely used in Compton camera analyses to characterize angular uncertainty and to define event selection criteria. However, the ARM distribution is fundamentally different from the point spread function (PSF), which represents the true spatial imaging response of the system on the celestial sphere. In this study, motivated by applications in gamma-ray astrophysics, we investigated the consequences of using ARM-based definitions in sensitivity estimation and image reconstruction. Through Monte Carlo simulations of 662 keV gamma-rays, we demonstrated that the background rejection power of ARM-based region-of-interest selections with the ARM resolution of 7.0$^{\circ}$ is equivalent to that of a PSF resolution of 33$^{\circ}$. As a result, treating the ARM resolution as a surrogate for the PSF resolution leads to significant overestimation of the signal-to-noise ratio, particularly in analyses assuming isotropic backgrounds. We further show that image reconstructions at pixel scales finer than the PSF resolution introduce substantial statistical uncertainties, reducing the effective number of independent spatial degrees of freedom. These findings underscore the necessity of PSF-based analysis for accurate sensitivity evaluation and statistically robust imaging in Compton cameras, particularly in applications where the background discrimination is critical.

 - **Abstract**
 The existence of nearby discrete cosmic-ray sources can lead to many interesting effects on the observed properties of cosmic rays. Recent measurements of cosmic rays with the CALET and the DAMPE experiments have revealed a bump-like new feature in the proton and helium spectra in the energy range of ~ (1-100) TeV/nucleon. The origin of the feature is not clearly understood. In this paper, considering an improved and more detailed analysis than previous works, and using an updated age and distance estimates of nearby supernova remnants along with an energy-dependent escape process for cosmic rays from the remnants, we show that the spectral bump can be explained by the contribution of cosmic rays from the nearby supernova remnants, in particular, the Vela remnant. We also show that the contribution from the nearby remnants agrees well with the observed spectra of the heavier cosmic-ray elements from carbon to iron as well as with the measured all-particle cosmic-ray spectrum beyond the knee region when combined with a background flux of cosmic rays originating from distant supernova remnants.

 - **Abstract**
 Open clusters have long been used as tracers of Galactic structure. However, without a selection function to describe the completeness of the cluster census, it is difficult to quantitatively interpret their distribution. We create a method to empirically determine the selection function of a Galactic cluster catalogue. We test it by investigating the completeness of the cluster census in the outer Milky Way, where old and young clusters exhibit different spatial distributions. We develop a method to generate realistic mock clusters as a function of their parameters, in addition to accounting for Gaia's selection function and astrometric errors. We then inject mock clusters into Gaia DR3 data, and attempt to recover them in a blind search using HDBSCAN. We find that the main parameters influencing cluster detectability are mass, extinction, and distance. Age also plays an important role, making older clusters harder to detect due to their fainter luminosity function. High proper motions also improve detectability. After correcting for these selection effects, we find that old clusters are $2.97\pm0.11$ times more common at a Galactocentric radius of 13~kpc than in the solar neighbourhood -- despite positive detection biases in their favour, such as hotter orbits or a higher scale height. The larger fraction of older clusters in the outer Galaxy cannot be explained by an observational bias, and must be a physical property of the Milky Way: young outer-disc clusters are not forming in the outer Galaxy, or at least not with sufficient masses to be identified as clusters in Gaia DR3. We predict that in this region, more old clusters than young ones remain to be discovered. The current presence of old, massive outer-disc clusters could be explained by radial heating and migration, or alternatively by a lower cluster destruction rate in the anticentre.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the melt production of planetary impacts as a function of planet size ($R/R_\mathrm{Earth}$=0.1-1.5), impactor size ($L$=1-1000 km), and core size ratio ($R_\mathrm{core}/R$=0.2-0.8) using a combination of parameterized convection models and fully dynamical 2D impact simulations. To this end, we introduce a new method to determine impact-induced melt volumes which we normalize by the impactor volume for better comparability. We find that this normalized melt production, or melting efficiency, is enhanced for large planets when struck by smaller impactors, while for small planets, melting efficiency is elevated when impacted by larger impactors. This diverging behavior can be explained by the thickness of the planets' thermal boundary layer and the shapes of their thermal and lithostatic pressure profiles. We also find that melting efficiency maxima are usually highest on Earth-size planets. We show that the melting efficiency is only affected by core size ratio for large cores and older planets, where melt production is decreased significantly compared to smaller core size ratios. Projecting the lunar impactor flux on the generic planets, we find that Moon-sized planets produce the most melt throughout their evolution, relative to planet volume. Contrary to previous scaling laws, our method accounts for melt production by decompression or plastic work in addition to shock melting. We find that traditional scaling laws underestimate melt production on length scales where variations in the target planets' lithology, temperature, and lithostatic pressure become significant. We propose empirical formulas to predict melt generation as a function of radial structure and thermal age.

 - **Abstract**
 HCl was detected in the Martian atmosphere by the NOMAD and ACS spectrometers aboard the ExoMars TGO. Photochemical models show that using gas-phase chemistry alone is insufficient to reproduce these data. Recent work has developed a heterogeneous chemical network within a 1D photochemistry model, guided by the seasonal variability in HCl. The aim of this work is to show that incorporating heterogeneous chlorine chemistry into a global 3D model of Martian photochemistry with conventional gas-phase chemistry can reproduce spatial and temporal changes in hydrogen chloride on Mars. We incorporated this heterogeneous chlorine scheme into the MPCM to model chlorine photochemistry during MYs 34 and 35. These two years provide contrasting dust scenarios, with MY 34 featuring a global dust storm. We also examined correlations in the model results between HCl and other key atmospheric quantities, as well as production and loss processes, to understand the impact of different factors driving changes in HCl. We find that this 3D model of Martian is consistent with the changes in HCl observed by ACS in MY 34 and MY 35, including detections and 70% of non-detections. For the remaining 30%, model HCl is higher than the ACS detection limit due to biases associated with water vapour, dust, or water ice content at these locations. As with previous 1D model calculations, we find that heterogeneous chemistry is required to describe the loss of HCl, resulting in a lifetime of a few sols that is consistent with the observed seasonal variation in HCl. As a result of this proposed chemistry, modelled HCl is correlated with water vapour, airborne dust, and temperature, and anticorrelated with water ice. Our work shows that this chemical scheme enables the reproduction of aphelion detections in MY 35.

 - **Abstract**
 Estimating the effect binarity can have on planet-formation is of crucial importance, as almost half of field stars reside in multiple systems. One effective way to assess this effect is to get an accurate picture of the population of planet-hosting binaries and compare its characteristics to that of field star binaries. We construct an extensive database, collected from intensive literature exploration, to achieve a complete census of all planet-hosting binaries known to date. Despite the heterogeneous character of the different surveys this database is built on, and the biases and selection effects that unavoidably affect any sample of planet-hosting binaries, we look for statistically significant trends and correlations within our sample. Our database provides the characteristics for 759 systems (among which 31 circumbinaries), which is an increase by a factor of 9 with respect to the previous complete census of planet-hosting binaries. Of the 728 S-type systems, 651 are binaries, 73 are triples and 4 are quadruples. The raw distribution of planet-hosting binary separations peaks around 500\,au instead of 50\,au for field binaries. By analyzing the distribution of on-sky angular separations as a function of distance $d_b$ to the systems we argue that the observed deficit of planet-hosting close-in binaries cannot be explained solely by observational biases. Likewise, by exploring how multiplicity fractions among planet-hosts vary with $d_b$ we suggest that the subsample of known planet-hosting binaries at $<500\,$pc is not bias-dominated (but not bias-free). In this $<500\,$pc domain, the multiplicity fraction of planet-hosting stars is $\sim22.5\%$, approximately half of the value for field stars, and the deficit of planet-hosting binaries extends to separations of $\sim500\,$au, giving an approximate estimate of the detrimental effect binarity has on planet-formation

 - **Abstract**
 We observed a newly-discovered Galactic black hole X-ray binary Swift J1727.8$-$1613 with the European Very Long Baseline Interferometry Network (EVN) at 5 GHz. The observation was conducted immediately following a radio quenching event detected by the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA). The visibility amplitude evolution over time reveals a large-amplitude radio flare and is consistent with an ejection event. The data can be interpreted either as a stationary component (i.e., the radio core) and a moving blob, or as two blobs moving away from the core symmetrically in opposite directions. The initial angular separation speed of the two components was estimated to 30 mas d^{-1}. We respectively fitted a single circular Gaussian model component to each of 14 sliced visibility datasets. For the case of including only European baselines, during the final hour of the EVN observation, the fitted sizes exhibited linear expansion, indicating that the measured sizes were dominated by the angular separation of the two components. The 6-h EVN observation took place in a rising phase of an even larger 4-day-long radio flare, implying that the ejection events were quite frequent and therefore continuous radio monitoring is necessary to correctly estimate the power of the transient jet. Combined with X-ray monitoring data, the radio quenching and subsequent flares/ejections were likely driven by instabilities in the inner hot accretion disk.

 - **Abstract**
 Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration radio transients of extragalactic origin, exhibiting a wide range of physical and observational properties. Distinguishing between repeating and non-repeating FRBs remains a key challenge in understanding their nature. In this work, we apply unsupervised machine learning techniques to classify FRBs based on both primary observables from the CHIME catalog and physically motivated derived features. We evaluate three hybrid pipelines combining dimensionality reduction with clustering: PCA + k-means, t-SNE + HDBSCAN, and t-SNE + Spectral Clustering. To identify optimal hyperparameters, we implement a comprehensive grid search using a custom scoring function that prioritizes recall while penalizing excessive cluster fragmentation and noise. Feature relevance is assessed using principal component loadings, mutual information with the known repeater label, and permutation-based F\textsubscript{2} score sensitivity. Our results demonstrate that the derived features including redshift, luminosity, and spectral properties, such as the spectral index and the spectral running, significantly enhance the classification performance. Finally, we identify a set of FRBs currently labeled as non-repeaters that consistently cluster with known repeaters across all methods, highlighting promising candidates for future follow-up observations and reinforcing the utility of unsupervised approaches in FRB population studies.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive spectral and timing analysis of the newly discovered black hole transient Swift J1727.8$-$1613, based on broadband (2$-$150 keV) observations from $Insight$-HXMT during its 2023 outburst. We use the flexible, energy-conserving SSsed model to model both the outer disc and inner, complex Comptonisation, using the expected disc emissivity to constrain the inner disc radius, $r_{cor}$. This decreases from 45 $R_{\rm g}$ to 9 $R_{\rm g}$ duing the transition from the hard to hard intermediate and then soft intermediate state. We plot $r_{cor}$ versus the centroid frequency of the strong quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs; $\nu_{\rm c}$) seen in these data to test the inner hot flow Lense-Thirring (LT) precession model. The overall slope of the observed trend is in strong agreement with the predictions of LT precession, despite the complexities of accretion behavior, though there is an offset in absolute value which may indicate that the system parameters are still not well determined. The inner radius of the hot flow is consistent with a constant value throughout most of the outburst, indicating that changes in the jet (e.g. the discrete ejections) do not strongly affect the radiated power. Either the jet kinetic power is not a large fraction of the accretion power or the jet is instead mostly powered by the spin energy of the black hole.

          Analytical transit light curves for power-law limb darkening: a comprehensive framework via fractional calculus and differential equations

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first complete analytical framework for computing exoplanetary transit light curves with arbitrary power-law limb darkening profiles $I(\mu) \propto \mu^\alpha$, where $\alpha$ can be any real number greater than $-1/2$, including the physically important non-integer cases. While the groundbreaking work of Agol et al. (2020) provided exact analytical solutions for polynomial limb darkening through recursion relations, stellar atmosphere models often favor power-law forms with fractional exponents (particularly $\alpha = 1/2$) that remained analytically intractable until now. We solve this fundamental limitation through two complementary mathematical approaches: (1) Riemann-Liouville fractional calculus operators that naturally handle non-integer powers through exact integral representations, and (2) a continuous differential equation framework that generalizes discrete polynomial recursions to arbitrary real exponents. Our method provides exact analytical expressions for all half-integer powers ($\alpha = k/2$) essential for 4-term limb darkening law by Claret (2000), maintains machine precision even at geometric contact points where numerical methods fail, and preserves the computational speed advantages crucial for parameter fitting. We demonstrate that the square-root limb darkening ($\alpha = 1/2$) favored by recent stellar atmosphere studies can now be computed analytically with the same efficiency as traditional quadratic models, achieving 10--100$\times$ speed improvements over numerical integration while providing exact analytical derivatives.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a field-level reaction framework to emulate the nonlinear effects of screened modified gravity on the cosmic web. This approach is designed to enable field-level inference with data from Stage IV cosmological surveys. Building on the reaction method, which models the nonlinear matter power spectrum in modified gravity as corrections to a "pseudo" $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, we extend the method to full field-level predictions by applying it to the output of $N$-body simulations, including both positions and velocities. We focus on modifications to gravity that are scale-independent at the linear level, allowing us to isolate and emulate nonlinear deviations, particularly screening effects. Our neural network predicts the field-level correction ("reaction") to a pseudo$\Lambda$CDM simulation whose linear clustering matches that of the target. The emulator achieves sub-percent accuracy across a broad range of summary statistics, including 0.4\% agreement in the matter power spectrum at scales $k < 1$ Mpc$/h$, and 2\% accuracy in redshift-space distortion multipoles at $k < 0.3$ Mpc$/h$. We also validate the emulator against $N$-body simulations with increased force resolution and time steps, confirming the robustness of its performance. These results demonstrate that our framework is a practical and reliable tool for incorporating screened modified gravity models into field-level cosmological inference, enabling stringent tests of extra fundamental forces at cosmological scales.

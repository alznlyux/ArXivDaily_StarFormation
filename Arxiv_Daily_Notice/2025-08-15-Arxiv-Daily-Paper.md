 - **Abstract**
 White dwarfs (WDs) can be used as laboratories to test strong gravity and high-density regimes, once their equation of state is not so uncertain as the one of neutron stars. This makes them also a useful tool to constrain dark-matter models. In this work, we study dark matter white dwarfs (DMWD) composed of white dwarf matter admixed with fermionic dark matter in a two-fluid general relativistic framework. Dark matter particles are considered to have masses between $0.1-10$ GeV. The equilibrium configurations and stability are derived, showing that the DMWD can be more compact, with masses around 1.3 $M\odot$ and radii around 500 km. The increasing compactness leads to changes in the fundamental modes of radial oscillations ($\sim20\%$ for 0.1 GeV DM), which produce detectable shifts in GW frequencies. The interplay between dark matter and normal matter thus provides a compelling avenue for interpreting deviations in observed WD properties and for placing constraints on DM characteristics through astrophysical observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized text processing, yet adapting Transformer-based neural networks to non-textual scientific modalities typically requires specialized architectures and extensive computational resources. We demonstrate that LLaMA-3.1-8B can be efficiently repurposed to predict galaxy redshifts from spectroscopic data through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), achieving competitive performance while preserving its linguistic capabilities. Using only 16 GPU-hours and adapting 0.04% of model parameters, our approach achieves a mean absolute error of 0.04 in redshift prediction while retaining over 85% of performance on AstroBench and 89% on general QA tasks from eval-harness. This minimal-effort adaptation--requiring only simple standard fine-tuning APIs--lowers barriers to entry for domain scientists and enables integrated agentic workflows where a single model handles both spectroscopic data for quantitative analysis and natural language for reasoning.

          Can stellar physics explain GW231123?

 - **Abstract**
 The gravitational wave event GW231123 detected by the LIGO interferometers during their fourth observing run features two black holes with source-frame masses of $137^{+22}_{-17} M_\odot$ and $103^{+20}_{-52} M_\odot $ -- well within or above the pair-instability black hole mass gap predicted by standard stellar evolution theory. Both black holes are also inferred to be rapidly spinning ($\chi_1 \simeq 0.9$, $\chi_2 \simeq 0.8$). The primary object in GW231123 is the heaviest stellar mass black hole detected to date, which, together with its extreme rotation, raises questions about its astrophysical origin. Accounting for the unusually large spin of $\sim 0.9$ with hierarchical mergers requires some degree of fine tuning. We investigate whether such a massive, highly spinning object could plausibly form from the collapse of a single rotating massive star. We simulate stars with an initial core mass of $160 \rm M_\odot$ -- sufficient to produce BH masses at the upper edge of the 90% credible interval for $m_1$ in GW231123 -- across a range of rotation rates and $^{12}\mathrm{C}(\alpha,\gamma)^{16}\mathrm{O}$ reaction rates. We find that: (i) rotation shifts the pair-instability mass gap to higher masses, introducing a significant ingredient that correlates masses and spins in gravitational wave predictions; and (ii) highly spinning BHs with masses $\gtrsim 150 \rm M_\odot$ can form above the mass gap, implying that stellar evolution alone is sufficient to explain GW231123. Our results suggest that the primary object of GW231123 may be the first directly observed black hole that formed via direct core collapse following the photodisintegration instability.

 - **Abstract**
 Modern machine learning techniques can unlock the vast cosmological information encoded in forthcoming Square Kilometre Array (SKA) observations. We show that tomographic 21 cm data from the reionisation era can yield stringent tests of inflationary models - here illustrated with Starobinsky $R+R^2$ inflation. Using a simulation-based inference (SBI) framework, we compare neural summaries (convolutional network and vision transformer) with a traditional power spectrum summary and perform a fully joint SBI analysis combining 21 cm data with data of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Forecasts based on realistic mock observations indicate that SKA alone will achieve constraints competitive with Planck, and that the combined SKA + CMB dataset will tighten bounds on both inflationary and $\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}$ parameters considerably while improving precision on key astrophysical quantities.

          The X-ray Source Population of the Metal-Rich Globular Cluster NGC 6528

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first study of the X-ray sources in one of the most metal-rich globular clusters in the Galaxy, NGC 6528. Using relatively deep (66 ksec) archival imaging from the Chandra X-ray Observatory, we identify 18 sources within the half-light radius of the cluster, all in the range $L_X \sim 10^{31}$-$10^{32}$erg s$^{-1}$ (0.5-7 keV). By combining these data with photometry from the Hubble Space Telescope and other sources, we classify the X-ray sources as a likely mix of cataclysmic variables and active binaries, though one or more of the brighter objects could be a quiescent low-mass X-ray binary. For this cluster, it appears that the X-ray binary-enhancing effects of high metallicity are outweighed by the cluster's advanced dynamical evolution, leading to a relatively modest X-ray source population.

          A constraint on the density of Jupiter's moon Thebe from primordial dynamics

 - **Abstract**
 Of the 97 known satellites in the Jovian system, the individual masses and densities of each moon have only been determined for six of them: the four Galileans, Amalthea, and Himalia. In this letter, we derive a prediction for the mean density (and mass) of Thebe, Jupiter's sixth largest regular moon, obtaining a lower limit of $\rho_\text{T}\gtrsim1.0$ g/cm$^3$ ($m_\text{T}\gtrsim 5\times 10^{20}$ g). In particular, this value emerges as a key constraint within the context of the resonant transport model for the origins of Jupiter's interior satellites. Expanding on this theory, here we carry out simulations of the simultaneous gravitational shepherding of Amalthea and Thebe via the resonant influence of inward-migrating Io during Jupiter's disk-bearing epoch. We find that owing to overstability of resonant dynamics facilitated by the circumjovian disk's aerodynamic drag, Thebe's smaller radius (compared to that of Amalthea's) requires a higher density to ensure its terminal orbital distance exceeds that of Amalthea's, as it does today. With multiple current and upcoming space missions devoted to in situ exploration of the Jovian system, a proper measurement of Thebe's mass provides an avenue towards empirical falsification or confirmation of our theoretical model for the dynamical evolution of Jupiter's inner moons.

          The Perturbation Theory Approach to Stability in the Scattered Disk

 - **Abstract**
 Scattered disk objects (SDOs) are distant minor bodies that orbit the sun on highly eccentric orbits, frequently with perhelia near Neptune's orbit. Gravitational perturbations due to Neptune frequently lead to chaotic dynamics, with the degree of chaotic diffusion set by an object's perihelion distance. Batygin et al. (2021) developed a perturbative approach for scattered disk dynamics, finding that, to leading order in semi-major axis ratio, an infinite series of $2:j$ resonances drives the dynamics of the distant scattered disk, with overlaps between resonances driving chaotic motion. In this work we extend this model by taking the spherical harmonic expansion for Neptune's gravitational potential to octupole order and beyond. In continuing the expansion out to smaller semi-major axis limits, we find that the $1:j$ and $3:j$ resonances that emerge in the octupole expansion do not individually set new limits on the stability boundary. Instead, we find that for increasingly Neptune-proximate orbits, resonances of progressively higher index are dominant in explaining the emergence of chaotic behavior. In this picture, the mutual intersections between series of $2:j$, $3:j$, $4:j \dots,$ resonant chains explain local chaotic evolution of SDOs and shape the dynamical distribution of the population at large.

 - **Abstract**
 Difference image analysis (DIA) is a powerful tool for studying time-variable phenomena, and has been used by many time-domain surveys. Most DIA algorithms involve matching the spatially-varying PSF shape between science and template images, and then convolving that shape in one image to match the other. The wrong choice of which image to convolve can introduce one of the largest sources of artifacts in the final difference image. We introduce a quantitative metric to determine the optimal convolution direction that depends not only on the sharpness of the images measured by their FWHM, but also on their exposure depths. With this metric, the optimal convolution direction can be determined a priori, depending only on the FWHM and depth of the images. This not only simplifies the process, but also makes it more robust and less prone to creating sub-optimal difference images due to the wrong choice of the convolution direction. As an additional benefit, for a large set of images, we define a Figure-of-Merit based on this metric, which allows us to rank a list of images and determine the ones best suited to be used as templates, thus streamlining and automating the data reduction process.

 - **Abstract**
 The Europa Clipper mission will arrive at the Jovian system in 2030 and analyze ice grains sourced from the icy material on its surface using impact mass spectrometry, which will provide key constraints on Europa's chemical composition and habitability. However, deriving quantitative compositional information from spaceborne impact mass spectra of ice grains has historically proven difficult due to the confounding effects of composition and impact velocity, coupled with difficulties in accelerating ice grains to spacecraft velocities under analogous sampling conditions. Using a novel hypervelocity ice grain acceleration and impact mass spectrometry method, we quantify the degree to which the mass spectra of NaCl-rich ice grains are influenced by chemical composition and impact velocity variations within the flyby velocity ranges planned for the Europa Clipper mission. These results suggest that high-fidelity studies quantifying composition and velocity-related effects in impact mass spectra may be necessary to accurately interpret data collected at Europa and other ocean worlds in the future.

 - **Abstract**
 The Compton Spectrometer and Imager is an upcoming NASA space telescope in the MeV range. COSI's primary science goals include precisely mapping nuclear line and positron annihilation emission in the Milky Way galaxy through Compton imaging. This relies on our ability to maintain COSI's spectral performance over its mission lifetime. Changes to the detectors' gain characteristics over time will result in a non-linear stretching of the entire energy range. Moreover, observations from past MeV telescopes and proton-beam experiments have shown that radiation damage in space causes photopeak shifts and spectral line broadening. These necessitate a plan for regular, in-orbit calibration. In this study, we demonstrate a method to monitor and recalibrate the COSI detectors using background line emissions produced by the space radiation environment. We employ Monte Carlo simulations of particle background and show that strong background lines arise from nuclear excitation of COSI's detectors (germanium) and cryostat (aluminum) materials. These span COSI's entire bandwidth for single-site interactions and can be used to monitor the effects of radiation damage and gain shifts every eight hours at the full instrument level and every 24 days at the individual detector level. Methods developed by Pike et al. to correct the effects of hole trapping and gain characteristics can then be applied to recover the original spectral performance. These results inform COSI's telemetry requirements for calibration and housekeeping data, and rule out the need for an on-board radioactive calibration source which would have increased the complexity of the spacecraft.

          Constraining fuzzy dark matter with the 21-cm power spectrum from Cosmic Dawn and Reionization

 - **Abstract**
 The 21-cm signals from Cosmic Dawn and the Epoch of Reionization contain valuable information on cosmological structure formation dominated by dark matter. Measurements of the 21-cm power spectrum can thus probe certain dark matter candidates. Here we investigate the impacts of fuzzy dark matter (FDM) on the 21-cm signals, taking into account both the linear matter power spectrum and the halo mass function (HMF) in FDM cosmologies. The full FDM dynamics are implemented in reionization simulations, along with a new ansatz on modulation of the FDM HMF by the linear overdensity. Not only does the suppression of FDM halos on small scales give rise to delay of the signature epochs during cosmic reionization, but these epochs are also shortened relative to the cold dark matter cosmology. In addition, we find that while the FDM effects on the 21-cm power spectrum are dominated by its linear dynamics early in Cosmic Dawn, a correct FDM HMF resulting from nonlinear wave dynamics must be considered when X-ray heating begins. We forecast the constraints on the FDM model parameters from upcoming 21-cm power spectrum measurements by SKA1-Low (central area). In FDM cosmologies with $m_\mathrm{FDM}=10^{-21}$ eV, SKA1-Low will be able to constrain the boson mass to within $\sim10$% at 2$\sigma$ confidence with a mock 1080-hour observation, if the ionizing efficiency is mass independent. However, our results show that realistic astrophysical processes are degenerate with the FDM effects, which shall severely loosen the constraints on the boson mass from 21-cm power spectrum data alone.

          Revisiting G29.862-0.0044: a jet cavity disrupted by an outflow in a likely young stellar object wide binary system

 - **Abstract**
 A few years ago, we investigated MYSO G29.862-0.0044 (YSO-G29), an intriguing star-forming region at a distance of 6.2 kpc. Although the typical disc-jet scenario was proposed to explain the observations, it remained far from conclusive. YSO-G29 was analysed using new observations at near-IR from Gemini-NIFS, at radio continuum (10 GHz) from Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA), and new continuum (1.3 mm) and molecular line data from the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA). The near-IR observations allowed us to detect emission of H2 1-0 S(1) and Br-gamma lines in YSO-G29, which are compatible with excitation and ionization from UV radiation propagating in a highly perturbed ambient. In addition, some evidence of H2 excitation by collisions were found. The ALMA data show the presence of a conspicuous and collimated molecular outflow propagating southwards, while to the north, an extended molecular feature perfectly surrounded by the Ks near-IR emission appears. The continuum emission at 1.3 mm allowed us to better resolve the molecular cores, one of which stands out due to its high temperatures and rich chemical composition. From the JVLA observations, we discovered a compact radio continuum source, a likely compact Hii region or an ionised jet of a massive protostar, located at ~0.7 arcsec (~ 0.02 pc) from the main millimetre core. In this way, we propose a YSO wide binary system. {We can explain the nature of the intriguing near-IR features previously observed: cone-like structures produced by jets/winds of one of the components of the binary system that cleared out the surroundings were disrupted by a molecular outflow probably from the other component. These results complete the picture of what is happening in YSO-G29, and reveal a phenomenon that should be considered when investigating massive star-forming regions.

 - **Abstract**
 A new dataset of atomic oxygen and molecular nitrogen number density profiles, along with thermospheric temperature profiles between 180 and 500 km, has been developed. These profiles are derived from solar occultation measurements made by SUVI on the GOES-R satellites, using the 17.1, 19.5, and 30.4 nm channels. Discussed is the novel approach and methods for using EUV solar occultation images to measuring the thermospheric state. Measurement uncertainties are presented as a function of tangent altitude. At 250 km, number density random uncertainties are found to be 8% and 17% for O and N2, respectively, and the random uncertainty for neutral temperature at 250 km was found to be 3%. The impact of effective cross section uncertainty on retrieval bias was assessed, revealing that, as expected, the largest effects occur where O and N2 are minor absorbers. In contrast, total mass density and O/N2 ratios exhibit substantially lower sensitivity, with biases that remain small or nearly constant with altitude. Total mass density comparisons with the MSIS model show good agreement at the dusk terminator, with an average difference of -2%, but larger discrepancies at dawn, with an average difference of -26%. These discrepancies are more prominent during quiet solar conditions, suggesting an overestimation of densities by MSIS during these conditions. Density comparisons with the IDEA and Dragster assimilative models show dawn/dusk percent differences of -24%/-2% and +2%/+13%, respectively. The dataset is available through the NOAA GOES-R L2 pipeline for eclipse seasons from Sept. 2018 onward and is expected to continue through 2035. As this measurement relies only on real-time NOAA space weather SUVI images, these profiles could be produced in real-time, supporting critical space weather monitoring and prediction, and filling in a current measurement gap of thermospheric temperature and density.

          Toward High-Precision Astrometry with CSST Using Multi-Gaussian Fitting of PSF

 - **Abstract**
 The Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST) presents significant potential for high-precision astrometry. In this study, we show that the point spread function (PSF) modeled by the discrete PSF with Multi-Gaussian function can effectively enhance the astrometric accuracy. We determine that the PSF profile can be accurately modeled by three Gaussians, which takes advantage of reduced computational complexity in PSF convolution. In sparse star fields, the lowest centering accuracy we obtain after aberration correction can be below 1 mas. We find that the proper motion errors remain below 1.0 mas/yr for point sources with five observations and approximately 0.8 mas/yr for seven observations with a time baseline of around 3.5 years. We finally demonstrate that the precision of our position measurements for stars fainter than 21 mag in the simulated CSST crowded field is better than the results from both SExtractor and DOLPHOT.

 - **Abstract**
 The Twinkle Space Telescope is a satellite designed for spectroscopic observations of a wide range of extrasolar and solar system objects. Equipped with a 0.45 m diameter telescope and a spectrometer covering from 0.5 to 4.5 microns simultaneously, Twinkle will be launched in a sun-synchronous, low-Earth orbit, and it is expected to operate for seven years. Twinkle is developed, managed and operated by Blue Skies Space (BSSL), a space science data company whose vision is to accelerate and expand the availability of new, high-quality datasets to researchers worldwide, complementing the space observatories delivered by government space agencies. Over its lifetime, Twinkle will conduct large-scale survey programs. The scientific objectives and observational strategy of these surveys are defined by researchers who join the Science Team. Leveraging advances made possible by recent observations with the James Webb Space Telescope, we present here updated simulations evaluating Twinkle's observational capabilities in the context of exoplanet atmospheres. Through retrieval analyses of HD 209458 b, WASP-107 b, GJ 3470 b, and 55 Cnc e, we demonstrate how increasing observational investment enhances the retrieval of atmospheric parameters and molecular abundances. Our sensitivity study highlights Twinkle's capability to detect less abundant or less detectable molecules depending on the observing strategies adopted. This work provides practical guidance for developing targeted observational strategies to maximise Twinkle's scientific return.

          Foreground and internal free-free absorption in particle-accelerating colliding-wind binaries : Insights from the radio emission of WR 147

 - **Abstract**
 Radio emission from massive binary systems is generally of composite nature, showing both a thermal emission component from the winds and a non-thermal component from relativistic electrons accelerated in the colliding-wind region. Understanding the processes ruling their radio spectrum is essential to investigate the role of these objects in the production of non-thermal particle populations in our galaxy. Our objective is to explore how the processes at work in particle-accelerating colliding-wind binaries (PACWBs) alter their spectral energy distribution, following a simple phenomenological description. We focus mainly on the role of free-free absorption (FFA) at low frequencies. Our intention is to use WR 147 as a test case, before tentatively extrapolating to a more generic behaviour. We processed recent Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array data, optimised for spectral analysis, combined with older measurements published in the literature at other frequencies. We analysed the radio spectrum considering both a more classical foreground free-free absorption (f-FFA) model and, for the first time, an internal free--free absorption (i-FFA) model. Our results show that the f-FFA model does not reproduce the spectral energy distribution of WR 147 at low frequencies. The i-FFA model is more efficient in providing a more complete description of the SED down to 610 MHz. This model is the only one to account for a change in the spectral index at low frequencies without any exponential drop in flux, as predicted by the f-FFA model. In addition, the upper limit at 150 MHz shows that two turnovers occur in the radio spectrum of WR 147, suggesting the effect of both i-FFA and f-FFA is seen in two regions of the spectrum.

          Evidence for Evolving Dark Energy from LRG1 and Low-$z$ SNe Ia Data

 - **Abstract**
 We present observational evidences indicating that dark energy may be evolving with time, thereby challenging the core assumptions of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Our investigation extends beyond the standard $\Lambda$CDM model by exploring a range of dynamical dark energy models. The analysis reveals that the matter density parameter, $\Omega_m$, changes with redshift, and this change is significantly influenced by the LRG1 datapoint from the DESI DR2 survey. We find that including LRG1 strongly affects the predictions of these models, especially for $\Omega_m$ and $\omega_0$, with the latter shifting from $-1$ to slightly higher values. This suggests that the evidence of evolving dark energy in the DESI DR2 data is driven by the LRG1 datapoint. When we exclude low-redshift supernovae data, particularly from the DES-SN5YR compilation, the model predictions are restored to the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. This effect is particularly evident in the GEDE model, where removing low-redshift supernovae data leads to $\Delta = 0$, effectively recovering $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. Our analysis confirms that the evidence for dynamical dark energy is substantial, particularly at low redshift ($z \lesssim 0.3$). The reconstruction of $\omega(z)$ and $f_{DE}(z)$, using a combination of DESI DR2 BAO measurements, CMB distance priors, and supernovae datasets, further supports the evolving nature dark energy. These results favor a dynamical dark-energy scenario characterized by $\omega_0>-1$, $\omega_a<0$, and $\omega_0+\omega_a<-1$ (Quintom-B). Bayesian analysis of model evidence reveals that the inclusion of low-redshift supernovae data significantly strengthens the support for evolving dark energy models such as JBP and Mirage, while models revert to inconclusive or weak support when low-redshift data are excluded.

 - **Abstract**
 The latest observational data of Planck satellite shows nontrivial value of polarization rotation angle caused by cosmic birefringence in the early universe. Moreover, the asymmetry of baryons versus anti-baryons still remains mysterious. Both of them indicates that there should be hidden new physics such as fundamental symmetry breaking. In this paper, we try to interpret these two events in framework of nonmetricity modified gravity. We introduce an interaction term between nonmetricity-based function and matter current, and calculate both the rotation angle and baryon-to-photon ratio. We also constrain the model parameters using the current observational data. With some specific examples, we demonstrate that in nonmetricity gravity theory, these two events can be interpreted in a unified way.

 The peculiar long gamma-ray burst (GRB) event, GRB 211211A, is known for it is association with a kilonova feature. Whereas most long GRBs are thought to originate in the core collapse of massive stars, the presence of kilonova suggests GRB 211211A was instead produced by a merger of a compact object binary. Building on the interpretation put forward by \citet{Yang2022Natur.612..232Y}--who argue that GRB 211211A was powered by a massive white-dwarf + neutron-star (WD-NS) merger--we adopt this WD-NS scenario as our observationally supported starting point. If the burst truly originates from that channel, its rarity must mirror the formation and merger rate of WD-NS binaries--a rate still largely unexplored in conventional massive-binary population studies. In this letter, we present a qualitative analysis based on binary evolution physics in order to understand the fraction of GRB 211211A in short GRBs (NS-WD/NS-NS fraction). Since the progenitors of massive WD-NS binaries occupy the initial mass function-preferred regime, where the zero-age main-sequence mass range of the assumed WD mass range (1.2-1.4$\,M_\odot$) is comparable to that of NSs, the NS-WD/NS-NS fraction emerging from our standard evolutionary path is expected to be $\sim$14--37\%, far higher than the observed fraction ($\sim5$\%). This discrepancy might imply a large, still-unidentified population of GRB 211211A-like events or an unusual origin of the NS-such as being hypernova-born or accretion-induced-collapse-born. Placing these results in a broader compact-binary context, implications for black-hole systems are also discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 Supernova (SN) 2024ggi is a nearby Type II SN discovered by ATLAS, showing early flash-ionization features. The pre-explosion images reveal a red supergiant (RSG) progenitor with an initial mass of 10-17 M$_\odot$. In the present work, we perform detailed hydrodynamic modeling to refine and put robust constraints on the progenitor and explosion parameters of SN 2024ggi. Among the progenitor models in our study, the pre-SN properties of the 11 M$_{\odot}$ match the pre-explosion detected progenitor well. However, we find it difficult to completely rule out the 10 M$_{\odot}$ and 12 M$_{\odot}$ models. Thus, we provide a constraint of 11$^{+1}_{-1}$ M$_{\odot}$ on the initial mass of the progenitor. To match the observed bolometric light curve and velocity evolution of SN 2024ggi, the favored model with an initial mass of 11 M$_{\odot}$ has a pre-SN radius of 800 R$_{\odot}$ and requires an explosion energy of [0.7-0.8]$\times$10$^{51}$ erg, nickel mass of $\lesssim$0.055 M$_{\odot}$, ejecta mass of 9.1 M$_{\odot}$, and an amount of $\sim$ 0.5 M$_{\odot}$ of steady-wind CSM extended up to $\sim1.2\times10^{14}$ cm resulting from an eruptive mass-loss rate of 1.0 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. We also incorporate the accelerated-wind CSM scenario which suggests a mass-loss rate of 1.0$\times10^{-2}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ and a CSM mass of $\sim$ 0.7 M$_{\odot}$ extended up to $\sim1.1\times10^{14}$ cm. This mass-loss rate falls within the range constrained observationally. Additionally, due to the constraint of 11$^{+1}_{-1}$ M$_{\odot}$ on the initial mass, the range of pre-SN radius and ejecta mass would be [690-900] R$_{\odot}$, and [8.2-9.6] M$_{\odot}$, respectively.

 - **Abstract**
 As an archetypal M-dwarf rocky exoplanet, GJ 1132 b has a varied history of atmospheric measurements. At 1.13 $\rm R_{\oplus}$, 1.66 $\rm M_{\oplus}$, and 580 K, it orbits a bright, slowly rotating M dwarf in a 1.6-day period, making it a prime target for characterization. In this study, we combine two JWST NIRSpec/G395H transits previously reported by May and MacDonald et al. 2023 with two new NIRSpec/G395M transits to constrain the presence of an atmosphere. This marks the first time the G395H and G395M modes have been combined for a single target, and we report no difference in the quality of data between the two modes. For rocky M-dwarf studies, G395H may still be preferred if stacking transits to utilize the high-resolution flux-calibrated stellar spectra and assess evolving stellar heterogeneity. GJ 1132 b's co-added transmission spectrum is best-fit with a flat line. A thin steam atmosphere is also consistent with the data, but this interpretation is driven almost entirely by the first transit, which suggests an increase in cool spot coverage-fraction derived from the flux-calibrated stellar spectra. This demonstrates the importance of always considering stellar heterogeneity evolution in multi-visit transits, and also the importance of a "leave-one-transit-out" approach in modeling efforts of co-added transits. We combine these results with MIRI/LRS emission data (Xue et al. 2024) to show that together, transmission and emission are consistent with only the thinnest of atmospheres. Given GJ 1132 b's age and distance from the star, a thin atmosphere is not likely stable. Therefore, the simplest explanation is that GJ 1132 b is indeed a bare rock.

 - **Abstract**
 We study frequentist confidence intervals based on graphical profile likelihoods (Wilks' theorem, likelihood integration), and the Feldman-Cousins (FC) prescription, a generalisation of the Neyman belt construction, in a setting with non-Gaussian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) posteriors. Our simplified setting allows us to recycle the MCMC chain as an input in all methods, including mock simulations underlying the FC approach. We find all methods agree to within $10 \%$ in the close to Gaussian regime, but extending methods beyond their regime of validity leads to greater discrepancies. Importantly, we recover a $\sim 2 \sigma$ shift in cosmological parameters between low and high redshift cosmic chronometer data with the FC method, but only when one fits all parameters back to the mocks. We observe that fixing parameters, a common approach in the literature, risks underestimating confidence intervals.

 - **Abstract**
 The Wow! Signal, detected in 1977 by the Ohio State University SETI project, remains one of the most intriguing unexplained radio transients. The most recent significant revision of its properties took place in the late 1990s; however, further advances were limited by readily available data from this event. Here we retrieved and analyzed decades of previously unpublished Ohio SETI observations, enabling the most comprehensive re-evaluation of the properties of the Wow! Signal to date with modern methods. Our results reveal significant revisions to its parameters that may help explain why its source has been so difficult to identify. We refine its potential origin to two adjacent fields centered on the right ascension $\alpha=19^{\mathrm h}25^{\mathrm m}02^{\mathrm s} \pm 3^{\mathrm s}$ or $19^{\mathrm h}27^{\mathrm m}55^{\mathrm s} \pm 3^{\mathrm s}$, and the declination $\delta=-26^°57' \pm 20'$ (J2000), a location both narrower and slightly displaced from earlier estimates. We measure a higher peak flux density exceeding 250 Jy and a frequency of $1420.726 \pm 0.005$ MHz, implying a galactic source with a substantially higher radial velocity than previously assumed. Our analysis provides additional support for the hypothesis that the Wow! Signal most likely had an astrophysical origin rather than being attributed to radio interference. In particular, we confirm that small, cold HI clouds can produce narrowband signals similar to its detection, which might suggest a common origin. These findings provide the most precise constraints to date on the location, intensity, and frequency of the Wow! Signal and offer a new path to identify its origin.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper we investigate quark deconfinement in neutrons stars and their mergers, focusing on the effects of higher orders for the phase transition between hadronic and quark matter. The different descriptions we use to describe matter microscopically contain varying particle degrees of freedom, including nucleons, hyperons, Delta baryons, and light and strange quarks. We use tabulated equations of state from the CompOSE database in which the quark deconfinement phase transition is described as being first-order, and then smooth it out by introducing a percolation, replacing the single first-order phase transition with two transitions of second or third order. We then perform binary neutron-star merger simulations using these new equations of st ate, focusing on groups of binaries with the same single-star mass, radius, and tidal deformability, but different equations of state. We go on to discuss differences in their evolution, and the ramifications for interpreting future gravitational wave observations and the potential to learn about dense matter.

 - **Abstract**
 The macroscopic model for a neutron star (NS) as a perfect liquid drop at equilibrium is extended to rotating systems with a small frequency $\omega $ within the effective-surface (ES) approach. The gradient surface terms of the NS energy density $\cal{E}(\rho)$ [Equation of State] are taken into account along with the volume ones at the leading order of the leptodermic parameter $a/R << 1$, where $a$ is the ES crust thickness and $R$ is the mean NS radius. The macroscopic NS angular momentum at small frequencies $\omega$ is specified for calculations of the adiabatic moment of inertia (MI) within the Kerr metric coordinate approach in the outer Boyer-Lindquist and inner Hogan forms. The NS MI, $\Theta=\tilde{\Theta}/(1-\cal{G}_{t\varphi})$, was obtained in terms of the statistically averaged MI, $\tilde{\Theta}$, and its time and azimuthal-angle correlation, $\cal{G}_{t\varphi}$, as sums of the volume and surface components. The MI $\Theta$ depends dramatically on its effective radius $R$ because of strong gravitation and surface effects. We found the significant shift of the Schwarzschild radius due to the correlation term $\cal{G}_{t\varphi}$. With this term, the adiabaticity condition fails for the NS J0740+6620, with the mass about $M_\odot$ for a strong gravitation, in contrast to the NS J0030+0451 for smaller mass, and many other NSs.

          Inside-Out Planet Formation. VIII. Onset of Planet Formation and the Transition Disk Phase

 - **Abstract**
 Inside-Out Planet Formation (IOPF) is a theory of {\it in situ} formation via pebble accretion of close-in Earth to Super-Earth mass planets at the pressure maximum associated with the dead zone inner boundary (DZIB), whose location is set initially by thermal ionization of alkali metals at $\sim1,200\:$K. With midplane disk temperatures determined by viscous accretional heating, the radial location of the DZIB depends on the accretion rate of the disk. Here, we investigate the ability of pebbles to be trapped at the DZIB as a function of the accretion rate and pebble size. We discuss the conditions that are needed for pebble trapping to become efficient when the accretion rate drops to $\sim10^{-9}\:M_\odot\:{\rm yr}^{-1}$ and the resulting DZIB is at $\sim 0.1\:$au, which is the expected evolutionary phase of the disk at the onset of IOPF. This provides an important boundary condition for IOPF theory, i.e., the properties of pebbles when planet formation begins. We find for our fiducial model that typical pebble sizes of $\sim0.5\:$mm are needed for pebble trapping to first become efficient at DZIBs near 0.1~au. This model may also provide an explanation for the first emergence of the transition disk phase in protoplanetary disks with accretion rates of $\sim10^{-9}\:M_\odot\:{\rm yr}^{-1}$.

 - **Abstract**
 (Abridged) The Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of the Milky Way exhibits extreme conditions, including high gas densities, elevated temperatures, enhanced cosmic-ray ionization rates, and large-scale dynamics. Large-scale molecular surveys reveal increasing chemical and physical complexity in the CMZ. A key step to interpreting the molecular richness found in the CMZ is to build chemical templates tailored to its diverse conditions. The combined impact of high ionization, elevated temperatures, and dense gas remains insufficiently explored for observable tracers. In this study, we utilized UCLCHEM, a gas-grain time-dependent chemical model, to link physical conditions with their corresponding molecular signatures and identify key tracers of temperature, density, ionization, and shock activity. We ran a grid of models of shocks and protostellar objects representative of typical CMZ conditions, focusing on twenty-four species, including complex organic molecules. Shocked and protostellar environments show distinct evolutionary timescales ($\lesssim 10^4$ vs. $\gtrsim 10^4$ years), with 300 K emerging as a key temperature threshold for chemical differentiation. We find that cosmic-ray ionization and temperature are the main drivers of chemical trends. HCO$^+$, H$_2$CO, and CH$_3$SH trace ionization, while HCO, HCO$^+$, CH$_3$SH, CH$_3$NCO, and HCOOCH$_3$ show consistent abundance contrasts between shocks and protostellar regions over similar temperature ranges. While our models underpredict some complex organics in shocks, they reproduce observed trends for most species, supporting scenarios involving recurring shocks in Galactic Center clouds and enhanced ionization towards Sgr B2(N2). Future work should assess the role of shock recurrence and metallicity in shaping chemistry.

 - **Abstract**
 Scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) are ubiquitous in many early-Universe processes accompanied by non-Gaussianity; hence, precise calculations of SIGWs involve a full understanding of non-Gaussianity. In this Letter, we propose to use the lattice simulations to directly calculate the energy density spectra of SIGWs with non-Gaussianity up to all orders. Our proposal has been first verified to match the existing semi-analytical results with non-Gaussianity, and then applied to more general cases, including high-order primordial non-Gaussianities, the logarithmic dependence in curvature perturbations, the curvaton model, and the ultra slow-roll model. We find that even a modest non-Gaussianity can significantly alter ultraviolet behaviors in SIGW spectra, necessitating special cautions in future detections as well as mutual constraints on/from primordial black holes.

          Accelerating exoplanet climate modelling: A machine learning approach to complement 3D GCM grid simulations

 - **Abstract**
 With the development of ever-improving telescopes capable of observing exoplanet atmospheres in greater detail and number, there is a growing demand for enhanced 3D climate models to support and help interpret observational data from space missions like CHEOPS, TESS, JWST, PLATO, and Ariel. However, the computationally intensive and time-consuming nature of general circulation models (GCMs) poses significant challenges in simulating a wide range of exoplanetary atmospheres. This study aims to determine whether machine learning (ML) algorithms can be used to predict the 3D temperature and wind structure of arbitrary tidally-locked gaseous exoplanets in a range of planetary parameters. A new 3D GCM grid with 60 inflated hot Jupiters orbiting A, F, G, K, and M-type host stars modelled with Exorad has been introduced. A dense neural network (DNN) and a decision tree algorithm (XGBoost) are trained on this grid to predict local gas temperatures along with horizontal and vertical winds. To ensure the reliability and quality of the ML model predictions, WASP-121 b, HATS-42 b, NGTS-17 b, WASP-23 b, and NGTS-1 b-like planets, which are all targets for PLATO observation, are selected and modelled with ExoRad and the two ML methods as test cases. The DNN predictions for the gas temperatures are to such a degree that the calculated spectra agree within 32 ppm for all but one planet, for which only one single HCN feature reaches a 100 ppm difference. The developed ML emulators can reliably predict the complete 3D temperature field of an inflated warm to ultra-hot tidally locked Jupiter around A to M-type host stars. It provides a fast tool to complement and extend traditional GCM grids for exoplanet ensemble studies. The quality of the predictions is such that no or minimal effects on the gas phase chemistry, hence on the cloud formation and transmission spectra, are to be expected.

          The explosion jets of the core-collapse supernova remnant Circinus X-1

 - **Abstract**
 We propose that the recently analyzed opposite rings in the Circinus X-1 (Cir X-1) core collapse supernova (CCSN) remnant resulted from a pair of opposite jets at the final phases of the jet-driven explosion process of the progenitor of Cir X-1. We point out the similarity of the rings in the Cir X-1 CCSN remnant to a ring in the Cygnus Loop CCSN remnant. While the X-ray binary system Cir X-1 actively launches jets, no such activity exists in the Cygnus Loop. In both CCSN remnants, we attribute the rings to jets that are part of the explosion process in the framework of the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM). We also identify such a ring in the CCSN remnant 107.7-5.1, which we also attribute to exploding jets. We conduct three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of late jets inside an exploding massive stellar core, and demonstrate the feasibility of this scenario for ring formation. The Cir X-1 CCSN remnant has a large blowout, similar to that of the Cygnus Loop and to a large protrusion in the CCSN remnant G0.9+0.1 . Based on these similarities, we suggest that other exploding jets inflated the blowout of the Cir X-1 nebula, identical to an earlier claim on the formation of the blowout of the Cygnus Loop. We identify a point-symmetric structure in the Cir X-1 CCSN remnant, strengthening the JJEM. This study further demonstrates that the JJEM is a successful explosion mechanism to analyze CCSNe and CCSN remnants.

 - **Abstract**
 The present thesis aims to tackle two critical aspects of present and future cosmological analysis of Large-Scale Structure (LSS): accurate modelling of the nonlinear matter power spectrum beyond $\Lambda$CDM, and efficient computational techniques for Bayesian parameter estimation. Both are crucial for testing alternative cosmologies and avoiding spurious results. We focus on the Dark Scattering (DS) model, describing pure momentum transfer between dark matter -- dark energy through the parameter $A_{\rm ds}$. To capture DS effects, we adopt the halo model reaction framework within $\tt{ReACT}$, compute the nonlinear DS spectrum, and validate it against $N$-body simulations. We further include baryonic feedback and massive neutrinos, finding degeneracies between DS and baryonic effects but not with neutrinos. We then constrain DS using cosmic shear from KiDS-1000, accelerated by neural emulators from $\tt{CosmoPower}$, which speed up predictions by $\mathcal{O}(10^4)$. Our DS emulator, trained on halo model reaction outputs, preserves percent-level accuracy and incorporates baryonic feedback. Analysing KiDS shear statistics, we obtain $\vert A_{\rm ds}\vert \lesssim 20$ b/GeV at $68 \%$ C.L. Combining KiDS with Planck CMB and BAO data, we find $A_{\rm ds}=10.6^{+4.5}_{-7.3}$ b/GeV at $68 \%$ C.L., suggesting the DS model as a promising resolution to the $S_8$ tension. Finally, we present weak lensing forecasts for Stage IV surveys using an automatically differentiable pipeline with $\tt{jax-cosmo}$ and gradient-based samplers in $\tt{NumPyro}$, reducing computational cost from months on CPUs to days on GPUs. Model evidence is evaluated with $\tt{harmonic}$ under multiple scale cuts. To put things into perspective, the modelling strategies and machine learning accelerations developed here provide powerful tools for the next generation of LSS cosmology.

 - **Abstract**
 Precise measurements of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) at low redshifts ($z$) serve as one of the most viable keys to unlocking our understanding of cosmic expansion, isotropy, and growth of structure. The Dark Energy Bedrock All-Sky Supernovae (DEBASS) program will deliver the largest uniformly calibrated low-$z$ SN Ia data set in the southern hemisphere to date. DEBASS utilizes the Dark Energy Camera to image supernovae in conjunction with the Wide-Field Spectrograph (WiFeS) to gather comprehensive host galaxy information. By using the same photometric instrument as both the Dark Energy Survey (DES) and the DECam Local Volume Exploration Survey, DEBASS not only benefits from a robust photometric pipeline and well-calibrated images across the southern sky, but can replace the historic and external low-$z$ samples that were used in the final DES supernova analysis. DEBASS has accumulated more than 400 spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia in the redshift range of $0.01<z<0.08$ from 2021 to mid-2025, and, in this paper along with a companion paper Acevedo et al. submitted, we present an early data release of 77 SNe within the DES footprint to demonstrate the merit and constraining power of the data set. Here, we introduce the DEBASS program, discuss its scientific goals and the advantages it offers for supernova cosmology, and present our initial results. With this early data release, we find a robust median absolute standard deviation of Hubble diagram residuals of $\sim$0.10 mag and an initial measurement of the host-galaxy mass step of $0.06\pm0.04$ mag, both before performing bias corrections. This low scatter shows the promise of a low-$z$ SN Ia program with a well-calibrated telescope and high signal-to-noise ratio across multiple bands.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a parameter-free variant of the halo model that significantly improves the precision of matter clustering predictions, particularly in the challenging 1-halo to 2-halo transition regime, where standard halo models often fail. Unlike HMcode-2020, which relies on 12 phenomenological parameters, our approach achieves comparable or superior accuracy without any free fitting parameters. This new web-halo model (WHM) extends the traditional halo model by incorporating structures that have collapsed along two dimensions (filaments) and one dimension (sheets), in addition to haloes, and combines these with 1-loop Lagrangian Perturbation Theory (1$\ell$-LPT) in a consistent framework. We show that WHM matches N-body simulation power spectra within the precision of state-of-the-art emulators at the 2-halo to 1-halo transition regime at all redshifts. Specifically, the WHM achieves better than 2\% accuracy up to scales of $k = 0.4\, h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, $0.7\, h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, and $1.3\, h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ at redshifts $z = 0.0$, $0.8$, and $1.5$, respectively, for both the baccoemu and EuclidEmu2 emulators, across their full $w_0w_a\mathrm{CDM} + \sum m_\nu$ cosmological parameter space. This marks a substantial improvement over 1$\ell$-LPT and HMcode-2020, the latter of which performs similarly at low redshift but deteriorates at higher redshifts despite its 12 tuned parameters. We publicly release WHM as WHMcode, integrated into existing HMcode implementations for CAMB and CLASS.

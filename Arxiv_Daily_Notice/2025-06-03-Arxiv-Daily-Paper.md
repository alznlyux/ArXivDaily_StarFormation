          Simulating High-Velocity Clouds in the Observational Plane: An Initial Study with the Smith Cloud

 - **Abstract**
 High-velocity clouds (HVCs) may fuel future star formation in the Milky Way, but they must first survive their passage through the hot halo. While recent work has improved our understanding of the survival criterion for cloud-wind interactions, few observational comparisons exist that test this criterion. We therefore present an initial comparison of simulations with the Smith Cloud (SC; $d=$ 12.4 kpc, $l, b = 40^{\circ}, -13^{\circ}$) as mapped with the GALFA-HI survey. We use the Smith Cloud's observed properties to motivate simulations of comparable clouds in wind tunnel simulations with Enzo-E, an MHD code. For both observations and simulations, we generate moment maps, characterize turbulence through a projected first-order velocity structure function (VSF), and do the same for HI column density with a normalized autocovariance function. We explore how initial cloud conditions (such as radius, metallicity, thermal pressure, viewing angle, and distance) affect these statistics, demonstrating that the small-scale VSF is sensitive to cloud turbulence while large scales depend on cloud bulk velocity and viewing angle. We find that some simulations reproduce key observational features (particularly the correlation between column density and velocity dispersion) but none match all observational probes at the same time (the large scales of the column density autocovariance is particularly challenging). We find that the simulated cloud (cloud C) showing growth via a turbulent radiative mixing layer (TRML) is the best match, implying the importance of TRML-mediated cooling for Milky Way HVCs. We conclude by suggesting improvements for simulations to better match observed HVCs.

          Binarity at LOw Metallicity (BLOeM): Pipeline-Determined Physical Properties of OB Stars

 - **Abstract**
 We aim to determine the physical properties of OB stars from the multi-epoch VLT/FLAMES BLOeM spectroscopic survey of the Small Magellanic Cloud. We apply a pipeline designed to analyse large spectroscopic samples of OB stars to the co-added, initial 9 epochs of the BLOeM survey, utilising grids of synthetic model spectra computed with the stellar atmosphere code FASTWIND. 69 OB stars are excluded from the analysis owing to disk emission or significant contamination by secondaries in SB2 binaries. We determine physical properties of 778 OB stars, including Teff, log g, log L/Lsun and v_e sin i. There appears to be a bimodality in v_e sin i of single O stars, while v_e sin i distributions of OB stars are strikingly different for single (median 78 km/s) and binary (median 200 km/s) systems. Inferred temperatures are broadly in agreement with literature results for stars in common, plus results from a grid-based automization tool for a subset of O and early B stars, although uncertainties are larger for surface gravities. Rotational velocities are broadly in line with an independent tool applied to the same subset. We recover the anticipated lower mass cutoff at 8 Msun from the survey design using a Bayesian inference method coupled with SMC metallicity evolutionary models, with median masses of 12.6 Msun (19.8 Msun) for B-type (O-type) stars. Spectroscopic masses exceed evolutionary masses, albeit with large uncertainties in surface gravities. We also provide an updated catalogue of O stars in the SMC since half of the 159 BLOeM O stars are newly classified as O-type stars.

 - **Abstract**
 The upcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) conducted by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory will detect millions of supernovae (SNe) and generate millions of nightly alerts, far outpacing available spectroscopic resources. Rapid, scalable photometric classification methods are therefore essential for identifying young SNe for follow-up and enabling large-scale population studies. We present SPLASH, a host-based classification pipeline that infers supernova classes using only host galaxy photometry. SPLASH first associates SNe with their hosts (yielding a redshift estimate), then infers host galaxy stellar mass and star formation rate using deep learning, and finally classifies SNe using a random forest trained on these inferred properties, along with host-SN angular separation and redshift. SPLASH achieves a binary (Type Ia vs. core-collapse) classification accuracy of $76\%$ and an F1-score of $69\%$, comparable to other state-of-the-art methods. By selecting only the most confident predictions, SPLASH can return highly pure subsets of all major SN types, making it well-suited for targeted follow-up. Its efficient design allows classification of $\sim 500$ SNe per second, making it ideal for next-generation surveys. Moreover, its intermediate inference step enables selection of transients by host environment, providing a tool not only for classification but also for probing the demographics of stellar death.

 - **Abstract**
 Scientific investigation of Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) is limited by poor data quality and a lack of transparency. Existing data are often fragmented, uncalibrated, and missing critical metadata. To address these limitations, the authors present the Observatory Class Integrated Computing Platform (OCICP), a system designed for the systematic and scientific study of UAPs. OCICP employs multiple sensors to collect and analyze data on aerial phenomena. The OCICP system consists of two subsystems. The first is the Edge Computing Subsystem which is located within the observatory site. This subsystem performs real-time data acquisition, sensor optimization, and data provenance management. The second is the Post-Processing Subsystem which resides outside the observatory. This subsystem supports data analysis workflows, including commissioning, census operations, science operations, and system effectiveness monitoring. This design and implementation paper describes the system lifecycle, associated processes, design, implementation, and preliminary results of OCICP, emphasizing the ability of the system to collect comprehensive, calibrated, and scientifically sound data.

 - **Abstract**
 Hilda asteroids, which orbit in a 3:2 resonance with Jupiter, serve as key indicators of dynamical processes in the early solar system. Their spin rates, an important probe of these mechanisms, can constrain their density and collisional evolution, offering valuable insights into their origin. In this paper, we report on the identification of three fast-rotating Hilda asteroids with spin periods in the 3.2--3.7 h range using data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite. These rotation periods are significantly shorter than the previous $\sim$5.0 h shortest rotation periods obtained from ground-based observations in the $\sim$10 km size range, and are comparable with the $\sim$3.0 h breakup limit of Hildas a few km in size, derived from the FOSSIL survey. These fast-rotating asteroids require either considerable cohesion (in the order of a few kPa), or densities $\rho$ $\gtrsim$1.5 $gm^{-3}$, in contrast to the typically assumed $\rho$ $\lesssim$1 $gm^{-3}$, to prevent rotational break-up. C-type asteroids, which are common in the outer main belt, have densities of $\rho$ $\approx$1.5 $gm^{-3}$ and are known to comprise a small but notable fraction of Hildas. The observed occurrence rate of the $\leq$4 h rotation periods may be explained by the 10-15% fraction of C-type asteroids, likely mixed into these populations from the outer main belt during giant planet dynamical interactions in the early solar system.

          Spectroscopic Mapping of Callisto with HST/STIS and Implications for its Surface Composition

 - **Abstract**
 We present global, spatially resolved ultraviolet-visible spectra of Callisto obtained with HST/STIS and explore possible compositions of Callisto's surface material. We map the strength of a widespread downturn toward the near-UV and the NIR spectral slope from 700 to 1000 nm, which varies from slightly blue (reflectance decreasing from 700 to 1000 nm) to red (reflectance increasing) across Callisto's surface. Globally, bright water-ice-rich regions tend to have neutral or blue NIR slopes and a shallower near-UV downturn, while darker material is associated with red NIR slopes and stronger near-UV absorption. Broad absorptions near 820 and 930 nm are spatially correlated with the Asgard and Valhalla impact basins and may be associated with iron-bearing silicates. An absorption edge near 275 nm maps primarily to Callisto's trailing hemisphere, and a 320 nm absorption most prevalent within and surrounding Asgard and Valhalla may be related to organics. We report two new absorption features near 230 and 450 nm which might be attributed to irradiated NaCl. We find little evidence for sulfur-bearing species at UV-visible wavelengths and suggest that a 280 nm band seen only in leading/trailing hemisphere ratio spectra and previously attributed to SO2 is better explained as a consequence of dividing the unrelated 320 nm leading hemisphere band by the trailing hemisphere 275 nm absorption edge. Spatial variations in spectral features suggest that Callisto's dark material composition varies regionally, reflecting a mix of endogenic and exogenic sources and radiolytic alteration.

 - **Abstract**
 HelioIndex is a directory of authors who are active in solar and heliospheric physics (SHP). It is available at the webpage this http URL, and it includes several derived products such as publication lists, country and institute data, journal data, and lists of the most cited articles in the field. HelioIndex is built from ORCID identifiers and publication data obtained from the Astrophysics Data System and ORCID. Selection criteria have been chosen to approximately correspond to a researcher having completed a PhD and published original research in a refereed journal. HelioIndex is intended to be a comprehensive directory of SHP authors that is generated and maintained through software procedures, with minimal human intervention. At the time of writing, 1910 SHP researchers are listed in HelioIndex and they belong to 55 countries. The countries with the largest numbers of researchers are the US, China and the UK, with 29%, 15%, and 8% of the total, respectively. HelioIndex authors average 0.69 first author papers per year over their careers, and the median citations for a paper is 15. Based on journal keyword data, it is estimated that 57% and 28% of HelioIndex authors belong to solar physics and heliospheric physics, respectively, with the remainder overlapping both disciplines.

 - **Abstract**
 Pluto's surface displays a wide variety of geologic units from smooth plains to extremely rugged mountainous expanses. These terrains range in age from young, actively resurfaced regions (no observable craters even in the highest-resolution New Horizons images) to old, heavily cratered, eroded regions. Here we expand upon the crater data analysis and the independent crater data set used in the production of a 1:7M scale geologic map of Pluto that is to be published by the United States Geologic Survey (USGS). We present both relative ages based on crater spatial density (number of craters in a given size bin per km^2) and also quantitative ages (e.g., 2 Ga) using the estimated impactor flux onto Pluto. The techniques presented here were developed specifically for the information available from a USGS geologic map, where smaller craters are mapped as points only (no specific diameter information per crater). We developed a new type of visualization, called a distributed R-plot, to understand the relative ages of the geologic units. The uncertainties in the current knowledge of the Kuiper belt populations and impactor flux at Pluto propagate to large uncertainties in the estimated quantitative ages (~a factor of two). However, both relative and quantitative ages from crater analysis were still valuable tools in developing the sequence of geologic events. Pluto has large areas of crater-free young terrains (13 units making up ~27% of mapped higher-resolution surface area), with widely varying morphologies, indicating a variety of resurfacing mechanisms, both exogenic and endogenic, likely active into Pluto's recent past or present.

          Applying Vision Transformers on Spectral Analysis of Astronomical Objects

 - **Abstract**
 We apply pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs), originally developed for image recognition, to the analysis of astronomical spectral data. By converting traditional one-dimensional spectra into two-dimensional image representations, we enable ViTs to capture both local and global spectral features through spatial self-attention. We fine-tune a ViT pretrained on ImageNet using millions of spectra from the SDSS and LAMOST surveys, represented as spectral plots. Our model is evaluated on key tasks including stellar object classification and redshift ($z$) estimation, where it demonstrates strong performance and scalability. We achieve classification accuracy higher than Support Vector Machines and Random Forests, and attain $R^2$ values comparable to AstroCLIP's spectrum encoder, even when generalizing across diverse object types. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of using pretrained vision models for spectroscopic data analysis. To our knowledge, this is the first application of ViTs to large-scale, which also leverages real spectroscopic data and does not rely on synthetic inputs.

          Asteroseismology and Universal Relations in Neutron Stars with Gravitationally Bound Dark Matter

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the structural, dynamical, and oscillatory properties of neutron stars admixed with dark matter, modeled via a single-fluid formalism where dark matter interacts with nuclear matter through an effective Higgs-portal coupling. Employing three relativistic mean-field nuclear matter equations of state-IOPB-I, BigApple, and NL3- we incorporate a physically motivated dark matter number density profile that scales with baryon density and is controlled by two parameters: a scaling factor $\alpha M_\chi$ ($M_{\chi}$ being the mass of dark matter particle) and a steepness index $\beta$. We construct equilibrium configurations and analyze their stability via radial oscillations, finding that dark matter-induced gravitational compression lowers the maximum mass and alters the radial mode spectrum in a nontrivial, $\beta$-dependent fashion. We also compute the frequencies of non-radial fluid oscillations under the relativistic Cowling approximation and analyze the persistence of universal relations in the presence of dark matter. While deviations appear under extreme configurations, the overall structure of these relations remains robust. Our findings offer a consistent framework to probe dark matter effects on neutron star dynamics across a range of realistic models.

          Evidence of Gaia Enceladus experiencing at least two passages around the Milky Way

 - **Abstract**
 One of the major recent breakthroughs has been the discovery of the last Major Merger to happen in the history of the Milky Way. Around 10 Gyr ago the galaxy Gaia Enceladus, with estimated ~10% of the Milky Way mass, fell into its potential, bringing a large amount of stars which can be identified through their unique chemical and kinematic signatures. Simulations have long predicted that a galaxy of this size should experience several passages through the disk of the Milky Way before eventually being fully dispersed. For the first time, we present observational evidence to support this. We identify two subpopulations accreted from Gaia Enceladus: 1) stars which today have large kinematic energy, which originate from the outskirts of Gaia Enceladus and were accreted during early passages; 2) stars with low kinetic energy accreted at later passages, originating from the inner parts of Gaia Enceladus. Through the use of high-precision chemical abundances, crucially including new aluminum measurements, we show that in all observed abundance ratios ([Fe/H], [Al/Fe], [Mg/Fe] and [Mg/Ba]), stars with high energy show evidence of coming from a less chemically evolved outer region of Gaia Enceladus, compared to the stars with low energy. We therefore conclude that Gaia Enceladus experienced several passages before merging with the main body of our Galaxy. This discovery has wide implications for our understanding of this event, and consolidates Gaia Enceladus as a benchmark for studying galaxy mergers and hierarchical galaxy formation in extraordinary details.

 - **Abstract**
 The prompt emission and afterglow phases of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have been extensively studied, yet the transition between these two phases remains inadequately characterized due to limited multiwavelength observational coverage. Among the recent growing samples of fast X-ray transients observed by Einstein Probe (EP), a subgroup of gamma-ray bursts are captured with long-duration X-ray emission, potentially containing featured evolution from prompt emission to the afterglow phase. In this Letter, we present a detailed analysis of GRB 250404A/EP250404a, a bright fast X-ray transient detected simultaneously by EP and Fermi/GBM in X-rays and gamma-rays. Its continuous X-ray emission reveals a long-duration tail, accompanied by distinct spectral evolution manifested by the spectral index $\alpha_{\rm X}$ with an initial softening, followed by an evident hardening, eventually reaching a plateau at the value of $\sim$ -2. Early optical and near-infrared observations enable broadband modeling with forward- and reverse-shock components, confirming that the X-ray hardening signals the emergence of the external-shock afterglow. From this spectral hardening we infer that the prompt phase in soft X-rays lasted $\sim300$ s, which is more than three times longer than the gamma-ray $T_{90}$. This well-tracked soft-hard-flat spectral pattern provides a clear indication of afterglow emergence from the fading prompt emission and offers a practical criterion for identifying a distinct population of GRBs among fast X-ray transients, even when the detection of the gamma-ray counterpart or obvious temporal break is absent.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents the design and validation of a digital receiver system developed for the next-generation radio interferometer projects. The receiver supports 8 analog inputs with 12-bit, 4GHz sampling and performs real-time signal processing using FPGA-based channelization. Field experiments were conducted to observe the Sun, a satellite beacon, and Cassiopeia A. Interference fringes were analyzed and modeled. Time delay compensation was implemented in two ways: theoretical calculation and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) fitting. Results show sub-nanosecond consistency between the two methods. The field experiments demonstrate the receiver's suitability for future radio telescopes such as the BINGO-ABDUS project.

          Asteroseismology of the G8 subgiant beta Aquilae with SONG-Tenerife, SONG-Australia and TESS

 - **Abstract**
 We present radial velocities of the G8 subgiant star beta Aql obtained in 2022 and 2023 using SONG-Tenerife and SONG-Australia. We also analysed a sector of TESS photometry that overlapped with the 2022 SONG data. We processed the time series to assign weights and to remove bad data points. The power spectrum clearly shows solar-like oscillations centred at 430 muHz. The TESS data show the oscillations at lower signal-to-noise because photometric measurements are much more affected by the granulation background than are radial velocities. The simultaneous observations in velocity and photometry represent the best such measurements for any star apart from the Sun. They allowed us to measure the ratio between the two to be 26.6+/-3.1 ppm/(m/s). We measured this ratio for the Sun from published SOHO data to be 19.5+/-0.7 ppm/(m/s) and, after accounting for the difference in effective temperatures of the beta Aql and the Sun, these values align with expectations. In both the Sun and beta Aql, the photometry-to-velocity ratio appears to be a function of frequency. We also measured the phase shift of the oscillations in beta Aql between SONG velocities and TESS photometry to be -113+/-7 deg, which agrees within uncertainties with the value for the Sun and also with a 3-D simulation of a star with similar properties to beta Aql. Importantly for exoplanet searches, we argue that simultaneous photometry can be used to predict the contribution of oscillations to radial velocities. We identified and measured frequencies for 22 oscillation modes in beta Aql with angular degrees of l=0, 1 and 2. Asteroseismic modelling yielded an excellent fit to the frequencies, giving accurate values for mass and age, placing quite strong constraints on the mixing-length parameter. Finally, the oscillation properties of beta Aql are very similar to subgiants and low-luminosity RGB stars in the open cluster M67.

 - **Abstract**
 We obtain two-infall galactic chemical evolution (GCE) models simulating the chemical evolution of the Milky Way as constrained by a golden sample of $394,000$ stellar abundances of the Milky Way Mapper survey from the 19th data release of SDSS-V. The separation between the chemical thin and thick disks is defined using [Mg/M]. We use the chemical evolution environment $\texttt{OMEGA+}$, combined with Levenberg-Marquardt and bootstrapping. We simulate the entire Galactic disk and six galactocentric regions for a more detailed analysis of the formation of the inner, middle, and outer Galaxy. We investigate the evolution of $\alpha$, odd-Z, and iron-peak elements: 15 species altogether. The chemical thin and thick disks are separated by Mg observations, which the other $\alpha$-elements show similar trends with, while odd-Z species demonstrate different patterns as functions of metallicity. In the inward Galactic disk regions the locus of the low-Mg sequence is gradually shifted toward higher metallicity, while the high-Mg phase is less populated. The best-fit GCE models show a well-defined peak in the rate of the infalling matter as a function of the Galactic age, confirming a merger event about $10$ Gyr ago. We show that the timescale of gas accretion, the time of the second infall as well as the ratio between the surface mass densities associated to the second infall and the formation event vary with the distance from the Galactic center. The disk is assembled within a timescale of $(0.32\pm0.02)~$Gyr during a primary formation phase, then a $(0.55\pm0.06)~$Gyr-timescale, increasing accretion rate was followed by a relaxation that lasted $(2.86\pm0.70)~$Gyr, with a second peak of the infall rate at $(4.13\pm0.19)~$Gyr. Our best Galaxy evolution models are consistent with an inside-out formation scenario of the Milky Way disk, in agreement with recent chemo-dynamical simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 The two most powerful extensive air showers (EAS) with energies of about $10^{20}$ eV, registered at the Yakutsk EAS array during the entire observation period of 1974-2024, are considered. Both showers hit the array near the center and triggered all surface detectors and underground muon detectors with a threshold energy of $E_{\mu} = 1.0 \times \cos \theta$ GeV. These events have an abnormally high fraction of muons, which is beyond current model predictions. This may change our understanding of hadron interactions at ultra-high energy, but there is also a possibility that these showers were initiated by some exotic primary particles.

          Huntsman may need to be irradiated

 - **Abstract**
 Millisecond pulsars are rapidly rotating neutron stars, and it is now widely accepted that their extremely short rotation periods result from the accretion of material from a companion star. Binary evolution theory predicts that millisecond pulsars can have various types of companion stars. However, in observations, binary pulsars with giant companions, referred to as ``huntsman pulsars'', are extremely rare. Following the initial discovery of the first huntsman pulsar, 1FGL J1417.7-4407, a second huntsman millisecond pulsar binary, PSR J1947-1120, has been recently reported approximately a decade later. In this paper, we model the formation and evolution of two huntsman pulsars. Our model with the irradiation effect can explain the observed properties of huntsman pulsar binaries and suggests that if the irradiation effect is considered, the companion star may be a normal red giant star, rather than just a red bump star.

 - **Abstract**
 We present HYDE, a new one-dimensional hydrodynamical code, and use it to construct a grid of supernova (SN) models based on solar-metallicity bare helium-core models evolved to the verge of core-collapse with MESA STAR. This grid is suited to model Type IIb SNe, which progenitor stars are thought to have lost all but a tiny fraction of their hydrogen envelopes. Using an automated procedure we fit the bolometric lightcurves and photospheric velocities for a large sample of (17) Type IIb SNe to the grid of SN models. We find that the distribution of initial masses for the sample can be reasonably well described by a standard Salpeter IMF, although there is an under-population in the >25 M$_\odot$ range. The fractions of SNe with initial masses <15 M$_\odot$ and <20 M$_\odot$ are 56 and 81 percent, respectively, suggesting either the binary channel to dominate the production of Type IIb SNe or a flaw in our understanding of single-star mass-loss. We find correlations between the explosion energy, initial mass and mass of $^{56}$Ni; the explosion energy increases with initial mass and the mass of $^{56}$Ni increases with explosion energy. The method used allows us to determine the errors in the model parameters arising from the observed quantities and the degeneracy of the solution. We find that an error in the distance and extinction propagates mainly to the derived mass of $^{56}$Ni, whereas an error in the photospheric velocity propagates mainly to the derived helium-core mass and explosion energy. Fits using the bolometric lightcurve alone are completely degenerate along the M$_{\mathrm{ej}}^{2}$/E$_{\mathrm{ej}}$=const curve, whereas fits using also the photospheric velocities are quite robust for well-sampled SNe. Finally, we provide a description and tests of the HYDE code, and a discussion of the limitations of the method used.

          Spins of Black Holes in X-ray Binaries and the Tension with the Gravitational Wave Measurements

 - **Abstract**
 We review current challenges in understanding the values and origin of the spins of black holes in binaries. A key finding of the gravitational-wave observatories is that premerger black holes in binaries have low spin values, with an average dimensionless spin parameter of $a_*\sim$0.1-0.2. Furthermore, the spins in the first-born black holes appear lower than in the second-born ones. This implies that the natal spins of black holes are generally low, and the angular momentum transport in massive stars is efficient. On the other hand, most of the published spins in X-ray binaries are very high, $a_*\gtrsim 0.7$. This is the case, in particular, for binaries with high-mass donors (potential progenitors of mergers), where their published spins range from 0.8 to 1.0, while their short lifetimes prevent significant spin-up by accretion. Those with low-mass donors could be spun-up to $a_*\gtrsim 0.7$ by accretion, but only if the donor initial masses were more than several solar masses, which remains unproven. However, we find the existing methods of spin measurements suffer from significant systematic errors. The method relying on relativistic X-ray line broadening is based on the separation of the observed spectra into the incident and reflected ones, which is intrinsically highly uncertain. The method of spectral fitting accretion disk continua uses models that predict the disk to be highly unstable, while stability is observed. Improved stable models give the disk temperatures higher than the standard models, and consequently predict lower spins. We postulate that the published spin measurements in X-ray binaries are uncertain. We hypothesize that the spins of the binaries with high-mass donors are low, while those with low-mass donors have a broader spin distribution, ranging from low to high, including high spins as required to power relativistic jets.

          Phase-space distortion as a key to unraveling galactic bar buckling

 - **Abstract**
 For the first time, we investigate the resonant structure of $N$-body galactic bar at the stage of buckling using action-angle variables. We studied the evolution of vertical actions ($J_z$) and angles associated with vertical resonance ($\theta_\mathrm{res}=\theta_z - \theta_R$) for all orbits in the bar. For this purpose, we divide the orbits into types according to the behavior (libration or circulation) of their resonant angle with respect to fixed points $\theta_\mathrm{res}=0$ and $\pi$ (vertical resonance). We show that during buckling, flat bar orbits circulating with increasing $\theta_\mathrm{res}$ transformed into banana-shaped librating orbits (resonant capture) or circulating orbits with decreasing $\theta_\mathrm{res}$ (resonant heating). The orbital transformation is accompanied by an increase in $J_z$ and the formation of a boxy/peanut-shaped (B/PS) bulge. During buckling, the phase space $J_z - \theta_\mathrm{res}$ undergoes a distortion creating an asymmetry in the position of the fixed points $\theta_\mathrm{res}=0$ and $\pi$ and in banana-shaped orbits near these points. The fixed point $\theta_\mathrm{res}=0$ may disappear completely. This also breaks the symmetry between the orbits, which are captured into resonance or go into circulation with decreasing $\theta_\mathrm{res}$ near $\theta_\mathrm{res}=0$ and $\pi$. At the same time, near $\theta_\mathrm{res}=0$, banana-shaped orbits with low vertical action $J_z$ appear. This reopens the path of orbital transformation through the fixed point $\theta_\mathrm{res}=0$. The phase space transformation and orbit transformation occur in a coordinated manner and lead to smoothing of phase space perturbations and restoration of symmetry between orbits.

 - **Abstract**
 Measuring a single elemental ratio (e.g., carbon-to-oxygen) provides insufficient information for understanding the formation mechanisms and evolution that affect our observations of gas giant planet atmospheres. Although the fields of planet formation, protoplanetary disks, and exoplanets are well established and interconnected, our understanding of how to self-consistently and accurately link the theoretical and observational aspects of these fields together is lacking. To foster interdisciplinary conversations, the Max-Planck Institut für Astronomie (MPIA) hosted a week-long workshop called, "Challenge Accepted: Linking Planet Formation with Present-Day Atmospheres." Here, we summarize the latest theories and results in planet formation modeling, protoplanetary disk observations, and atmospheric observations of gas giant atmospheres to address one of the challenges of hosting interdisciplinary conferences: ensuring everyone is aware of the state-of-the-art results and technical language from each discipline represented. Additionally, we highlight key discussions held at the workshop. Our main conclusion is that it is unclear what the ideal observable is to make this link between formation scenarios and exoplanet atmospheres, whether it be multiple elemental abundance ratios, measuring refractory budgets, or something else. Based on discussions held throughout the workshop, we provide several key takeaways of what the workshop attendees feel need the most improvement and exploration within each discipline.

 - **Abstract**
 The first detection of gravitational waves, recognized by the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics, has opened up a new research field: gravitational-wave paleontology. When massive stars evolve into black holes and collide, they create gravitational waves that propagate through space and time. These gravitational-waves, now detectable on Earth, act as fossils tracing the histories of the massive stars that created them. Estimating physics parameters of these massive stars from detected gravitational-waves is a parameter estimation task, with the primary difficulty being the extreme rarity of collisions in simulated binary black holes. This rarity forces researchers to choose between prohibitively expensive simulations or accepting substantial statistical variance. In this work, we present RESOLVE, a rare event surrogate model that leverages polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) and Bayesian MCMC to emulate this rare formation efficiency. Our experimental results demonstrate that RESOLVE is the only surrogate model that achieves proper statistical coverage, while effectively learning the underlying distribution of each physics parameter. We construct a likelihood function incorporating both the emulated formation efficiency and LIGO's gravitational wave observations, which we then minimize to produce community-standard credible intervals for each physics parameter. These results enable astronomers to gain deeper insights into how the universe transformed from simple gases into the complex chemical environment that eventually made life possible.

 - **Abstract**
 Even 50 years after the discovery of a positron annihilation line from the inner Galaxy, no class of astrophysical sources has emerged as a definitive explanation for both the emission morphology and flux. Positrons produced by dark matter annihilation or decay have been proposed, but the mass of any such candidate is constrained by continuum $\gamma$-ray emission at energies $>511$ keV. Earlier analyses have claimed that this emission requires that the positrons have kinetic energies less than a few MeV at injection, disfavoring both much of the dark matter parameter space and many potential compact astrophysical source classes such as pulsars. However, these constraints were not based on a full forward model of the $\gamma$-ray line and continuum data, and did not marginalize over uncertainties about the relative angular distributions of the line and continuum. Here we describe an improved analysis that overcomes these limitations, and show that constraints on the injection energy are much weaker than previously claimed; even under conservative assumptions the data are consistent with initial energies up to $\sim 50$ MeV.

 - **Abstract**
 Type Ibn supernovae (SNe) are a class of SN explosions whose progenitors are surrounded by dense helium-rich circumstellar matter (CSM). Some models have been proposed for how to form the dense CSM, with promising scenarios involving either binaries with a low-mass ($\lesssim 3~M_\odot$) helium (He) star, or mergers following common envelope phases between a He star and a compact object. Using rapid binary population synthesis calculations, we estimate the event rate of these channels and compare it with the observed SN Ibn rate. We find that exploding low-mass He stars in close binaries (of separations $\lesssim$ a few 100 $R_\odot$) can be sufficiently produced to account for the observed event rate of SN Ibn, while the merger scenario can likely account for only a fraction of these SNe. We discuss the types of companions expected in the low-mass He star scenario, finding massive main sequence stars ($10$--$20\ M_\odot$) to be typical, with a potentially non-negligible fraction ($<10\%$) of binaries with WD companions that have long delay times of up to $100$ Myrs.

          Evidence of oscillating `compact' Comptonized corona in GRS 1915+105: Insights into HFQPOs with AstroSat

 - **Abstract**
 We present, for the first time, an in-depth dynamical analysis of the spectro-temporal properties of the soft variability classes ($\delta$, $\kappa$, $\omega$, and $\gamma$) of GRS 1915+105 during the detection of $\sim$70 Hz High-Frequency Quasi-periodic Oscillations (HFQPOs) using AstroSat data. The wide-band spectra ($0.7-50$ keV) are well described by thermal Comptonization along with an extended power-law component. Additionally, power spectra ($0.01-500$ Hz) indicate that Comptonized photons ($6-25$ keV) primarily contribute to the HFQPOs. Our findings reveal that high (low) count rates referred to as `non-dips' (`dips') in the light curves of the variability classes correspond to the detection (non-detection) of HFQPOs. Accumulated `non-dips' (`dips') spectra are modelled separately using thermal Comptonization (\texttt{nthComp}) as well as \texttt{kerrd} which indicates harder spectra and smaller inner disc radius during the detection of HFQPOs. We conduct dynamical analyses (every 32 s) to trace the presence of HFQPOs, and variations in thermal Comptonization parameters ($\Gamma_{\rm nth}$ and ${\rm N}_{\rm nth}$). Moreover, we observe a positive correlation of `non-dips' with QPO strength, ${\rm HR}1$, and ${\rm N}_{\rm nth}$, while $\Gamma_{\rm nth}$ shows an anti-correlation, suggesting that high-energy photons from the Comptonized corona are responsible for the HFQPOs. Furthermore, we estimate the size of the Comptonized corona using \texttt{kerrd} and \texttt{diskpn} to be $\sim 2.8 - 16$ $r_{\rm g}$. Thus, we infer that a `compact' oscillating corona likely modulates the high-energy radiation, exhibiting the $70$ Hz HFQPOs in GRS 1915$+$105.

 - **Abstract**
 The reflection spectrum produced by a cold medium illuminated by X-ray photons is not isotropic and its shape depends on the emission angle. In the reflection spectrum of an accretion disk of a black hole, the value of the emission angle changes over the disk and, in general, is different from the value of the inclination angle of the disk because of the light bending in the strong gravitational field of the black hole. Current reflection models make some approximations, as calculating a reflection spectrum taking the correct emission angle at every point of the disk into account would be too time-consuming and make the model too slow to analyze observations. In a recent paper, we showed that these approximations are unsuitable to fit high-quality black hole spectra expected from the next generation of X-ray missions. Here, we present a reflection model with improved calculations of the emission angle that solves this problem.

 - **Abstract**
 We analyzed high-resolution mid-infrared spectra of 78 well-known Herbig Ae/Be (HAeBe) stars using Spitzer InfraRed Spectrograph data, focusing on the detection of [Ne {\sc II}] and [Ne {\sc III}] emission lines as indicators of ionized outflows or disk winds. Emission from [Ne {\sc II}] at 12.81 $\mu$m or [Ne {\sc III}] at 15.55 $\mu$m was identified in 25 sources, constituting the largest sample of HAeBe stars with these detected lines. Our analysis revealed a higher detection frequency of [Ne {\sc II}] in sources with lower relative accretion luminosity (L$_{acc}$/L$_*$ $<$ 0.1), suggesting a connection to the disk dispersal phase. We examined correlations between neon lines and various spectral features and investigated [Ne {\sc III}]-to-[Ne {\sc II}] line flux ratios to explore potential emission mechanisms. Neon emission is predominantly observed in Group I sources (75\%), where their flared disk geometry likely contributes to the observed emission, potentially originating from the irradiated disk atmosphere. Interestingly, we also find that Group II sources exhibit a higher median relative [Ne\,\textsc{ii}] line luminosity (L$_\mathrm{[Ne\,II]}$/L$_*$), suggesting enhanced photoevaporation rates possibly associated with their more settled disk structures. However, larger samples and higher-resolution spectra are required to confirm this trend definitively. The high detection rate of the [Fe {\sc II}] and [S {\sc III}] lines, commonly associated with EUV-dominated regions, alongside a [Ne {\sc III}]-to-[Ne {\sc II}] emission ratio greater than 0.1 in sources where both lines detected, suggests that EUV radiation is the primary driver of neon emission in our sample.

          Unique microquasar SS433: new results, new issues

 - **Abstract**
 The unique microquasar SS433 is a massive X-ray binary system at an advanced evolutionary stage. The optical star overflows its Roche lobe and transfers mass at a very high rate onto a black hole surrounded by a supercritical accretion disk with relativistic jets inclined to the orbital plane. Both disk and jets precess with a period of 162.3 days. In the outer parts of the precessing jets, emission lines of hydrogen and neutral helium are formed, moving periodically across the spectrum of SS433 with an enormous amplitude of $\sim 1000$\,Å or, on the $\sim 50000$ km/s velocity scale. A 30-year spectral and photometric monitoring of SS433 has been carried out at Sternberg Astronomical Institute. Using all published data for 45 years of observations, we obtained a number of important results concerning the nature of this unique microquasar. We discovered a secular evolutionary increase in the orbital period of SS433 at a rate of $(1.14 \pm 0.25)\times 10^{-7}$ seconds per second, suggesting that the relativistic object in SS433 is a black hole with mass exceeding 8\,${\rm M}_\odot$. It is shown that the distance between the components of SS433 increases with time, which prevents the formation of a common envelope in the system. The size of the Roche lobe of the optical donor star is on average constant in time, which ensures a stable secondary mass exchange in the system. The orbital ellipticity of SS433 was discovered, strongly supporting the model of a slaved accretion disk tracking the precession of the rotation axis of the optical star, which is inclined to the orbital plane due to an asymmetric supernova explosion. Parameters of the kinematic model of SS433, except for the precession period, keep on average constant for 45 years. Phase jumps of the precession period were detected, but on average the precession period remains constant for 45 years. (Abridged)

 - **Abstract**
 We model the atmosphere of the ultra-hot Jupiter (UHJ) WASP-178b accounting for NLTE effects and compare synthetic transmission spectra with NUV and optical observations. We use the HELIOS code (LTE) in the lower and the Cloudy code (LTE or NLTE) in the middle and upper atmosphere to compute the temperature-pressure (TP) and abundance profiles. We further use Cloudy to compute the theoretical planetary transmission spectrum both in LTE and NLTE for comparison with observations. We find an isothermal TP profile at pressures higher than 10 mbar and lower than 10$^{-8}$ bar, with an almost linear increase from about 2200 K to about 8100 K in between. The temperature structure is driven by NLTE effects, particularly in the form of increased heating resulting from the overpopulation of long-lived FeII levels with strong transitions in the NUV band, where the stellar emission is strong, and of decreased cooling due to the underpopulation of MgI and MgII levels that dominate the cooling. The planetary atmosphere is hydrostatic up to pressures of about 1 nbar, and thus accurately modelling spectral lines forming at pressures lower than about 1 nbar requires accounting for both hydrodynamics and NLTE effects. The NLTE synthetic transmission spectrum overestimates the observed H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ absorption, while the LTE model is in good agreement, which is surprising as the opposite has been found for the other UHJs for which NLTE modelling has been performed. Instead, in the NUV we find an excellent match between the NLTE transmission spectrum and the HST/UVIS data, contrary to the LTE model. This contrasts previous LTE results requiring SiO absorption to fit the observations. The accurate characterisation of the atmosphere of UHJs is possible only accounting for NLTE effects, and particularly for the level population of Fe and Mg, which dominate heating and cooling, respectively.

 - **Abstract**
 This is the second of two papers exploring the effects of metallicity on the multi-wavelength properties of Cepheids in terms of their multi-wavelength period-luminosity (PL) relations, impacting their use as extragalactic distance indicators, underpinning one of the most popular paths to estimating of the expansion rate of the Universe, Ho. In Paper I (Madore & Freedman 2024) we presented five tests for the influence of metallicity on galactic and extragalactic Cepheid PL relations, spanning nearly 2 dex in metallicity, and inspecting PL relations from the optical (BVI), through the near-infrared (JHK) and into mid-infrared (at 3.4 and 4.5 microns). And,in no case were any statistically significant results forthcoming. Here we interrogate published spectral energy distributions constructed from theoretical (static) stellar atmospheres, cov- ering the surface gravity and temperature ranges attributed to classical (supergiant, F and K spectral type) Cepheid variables, and explore the differential effects of changing the atmospheric metallicity, down by 2 dex from solar (a factor of 100 below the average Milky Way value) and then up from solar by 0.5 dex (i.e., factor of 3x above the Milky Way value). The theoretical models clearly show that metallicity systematically impacts each of the bandpasses differentially: the level of this effect is largest in the ultraviolet (where line blanketing is most intense), reversing sign in the optical (due to flux redistribution from the UV), and then asymptotically falling back to zero from the red to the far infrared. The discovered effects of metallicity are systematic, but they are small; and as such they do not contradict the findings of Paper I, but they do explain why the problem has been so hard to resolve given the low level of precision of the photometry for all but the very nearest and apparently brightest Cepheids.

 Modern time-domain astronomy will benefit from the vast data collected by survey telescopes. The 2.5 m Wide Field Survey Telescope (WFST), with its powerful capabilities, is promising to make significant contributions in the era of large sky surveys. To harness the full potential of the enormous amount of unlabeled light curve data that the WFST will collect, we have developed a semisupervised light curve classification framework. This framework showcases several unique features. First, it is optimized for classifying events based on the early phase of the light curve (three days after trigger), which can help identify interesting events early and enable efficient follow-up observations. Second, the semisupervised nature of our framework allows it to leverage valuable information from large volumes of unlabeled data, potentially bridging the gap between simulations and real observations and achieving better generalization in practical scenarios. Compared to the commonly used Recurrent Neural Network models, our framework has shown a 5.59% improvement in accuracy for early classification tasks, as well as improvements in precision and recall in almost all subclasses. Moreover, our approach provides a reconstructed light curve, along with a compact latent representation, offering a different perspective that can be used for further downstream tasks beyond classification. The code and model weights used in this work are maintained and publicly available on our GitHub repository.

 Context: The young massive cluster R136 at the center of 30 Doradus (30 Dor) in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) generates a cavity in the surrounding molecular cloud. However, there is molecular gas between 2 and 10 pc in projection from R136's center. The region, known as the Stapler nebula, hosts the closest known molecular gas clouds to R136. Aims: We investigated the properties of molecular gas in the Stapler nebula to better understand why these clouds survive so close in projection to R136. Methods: We used Atacama Large Millimeter/Sub-millimeter Array 7m observations in Band 7 (345 GHz) of continuum emission, $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO, together with dense gas tracers CS, HCO$^+$, and HCN. Our observations resolve the molecular clouds in the nebula into individual, parsec-sized clumps. We determined the physical properties of the clumps using both dust and molecular emission, and compared the emission properties observed close to R136 to other clouds in the LMC. Results: The densest clumps in our sample, where we observe CS, HCO$^+$, and HCN, are concentrated in a northwest-southeast diagonal seen as a dark dust lane in HST images. Resolved clumps have masses between $\sim 200-2500$ \Msun, and the values obtained using the virial theorem are larger than the masses obtained through $^{12}$CO and $^{12}$CO luminosity. The velocity dispersion of the clumps is due both to self-gravity and the external pressure of the gas. Clumps at the center of our map, which have detections of dense gas tracers ($n_{crit}\sim10^6$ cm$^{-3}$ and above), are spatially coincident with young stellar objects. Conclusions: The clumps' physical and chemical properties are consistent with other clumps in 30 Dor. We suggest that these clumps are the densest regions of a Molecular Cloud carved by the radiation of R136.

          Binding energies of small interstellar molecules on neutral and charged amorphous solid water surfaces

 - **Abstract**
 The interstellar medium (ISM) is all but empty. To date, more than 300 molecules have already been discovered. Because of the extremely low temperature, the gas-phase chemistry is dominated by barrierless exothermic reactions of radicals and ions. However, several abundant molecules and organic molecules cannot be produced efficiently by gas-phase reactions. To explain the existence of such molecules in the ISM, gas-surface interactions between small molecules and dust particles covered with amorphous solid water (ASW) mantles must be considered. In general, surface processes such as adsorption, diffusion, desorption, and chemical reactions can be linked to the binding energy of molecules to the surface. Hence, a lot of studies have been performed to identify the binding energies of interstellar molecules on ASW surfaces. Cosmic radiation and free electrons may induce a negative charge on the dust particles, and the binding energies may be affected by this charge. In this study, we calculate the binding energies of CO, CH4, and NH3, on neutral and charged ASW surfaces using DFT calculations. Our results indicate that CO can interact with the surface charge, increasing its binding energy. In contrast, the binding energy of CH4 remains unchanged in the presence of surface charge, and that of NH3 typically decreases.

 - **Abstract**
 The spatial curvature of the Universe remains a central question in modern cosmology. In this work, we explore the potential of localized Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) as a novel tool to constrain the cosmic curvature parameter $\Omega_k$ in a cosmological model-independent way. Using a sample of 80 FRBs with known redshifts and dispersion measures, we reconstruct the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ via artificial neural networks, which is then used to obtain angular diameter distances $D_A(z)$ through two complementary approaches. First, we derive the comoving distance $D_C(z)$ and $D_A(z)$ from FRBs without assuming a fiducial cosmological model. Then, the $H(z)$ reconstruction is combined with Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements to infer $D_A(z)$. By comparing the FRB-derived and BAO+FRB-derived $D_A(z)$ values, we extract constraints on $\Omega_k$ under the Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker metric. Our results show consistency with a spatially flat Universe within $1\sigma$ uncertainties, although a mild preference for negative curvature is observed across both covariance-based and Gaussian analyses. This study highlights the growing relevance of FRBs in precision cosmology and demonstrates their synergy with BAO data as a powerful probe of the large-scale geometry of the Universe.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an analysis of high-resolution (R ~ 48000) spectroscopic and photometric data of RS Sgr, a short-period Algol-type binary system. For the first time, precise spectroscopic and absolute parameters of the system have been determined. The primary component is identified as a B3 main-sequence star with an effective temperature of 19000K, while the secondary is classified as an A0-type star with a temperature of 9700 K. The secondary appears to have recently evolved off the main sequence and currently fills its Roche lobe, transferring material through the inner Lagrangian point (L1) to the hotter primary component. The H{\alpha} emission and absorption features observed in the spectra are attributed to a combination of a low-density circumprimary disk, a gas stream originating from the secondary, and a hot spot formed at the impact site on the primary. The combined analysis of spectroscopic and photometric data yields a system distance of approximately 418 pc, which is consistent with the value derived from GAIA DR3 within the uncertainty limits.

 We present results from an extensive optical observation campaign that monitored the Geostationary satellites Intelsat 10-02, Mission Extension Vehicle 2, Thor 5, Thor 6, Thor 7, and Meteosat 11 over a 14 week period that covered the proximity operations and docking of Mission Extension Vehicle 2 with Intelsat 10-02. High-cadence single-color photometric observations are supplemented with targeted multi-color observations, high resolution imaging, and passive radio frequency positioning obtained using complementary facilities. The photometric signatures of the six targets are presented in the form of two-dimensional color maps. A selection of interesting features are investigated in further detail, including a rapid glinting behavior in Thor 6; a brightening event from Meteosat 11; using glints to constrain the unresolved positions of Intelsat 10-02 and MEV-2; changes in the photometric signature of Intelsat 10-02 before and after docking; and signatures of attitude changes and maneuvering in the light curves of MEV-2. A detailed description of the photometric data reduction pipeline is also presented, with a focus on details that must be considered when aiming for sub-percent photometric precision.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we describe a general relativistic hydrodynamics simulation code which is developed to simulate advective accretion flow onto black holes. We are particularly interested in the accretion simulations of sub-Keplerian matter in the close vicinity of black holes. Due to the presence of centrifugal barrier, a nearly free-falling sub-Keplerian accretion flow slows down close to a black hole and can even pass through shocks before accelerating again to the black hole. We design our simulation code using the high resolution shock capturing scheme so that such shock structures can be captured and analyzed for relevance. In this paper, we describe our implementation and validation of the code against a few known analytical and numerical results of sub-Keplerian matter accretion.

 - **Abstract**
 We perform axisymmetric general relativistic radiation-viscous hydrodynamics simulations of black hole (BH)-torus systems with full Boltzmann Monte-Carlo neutrino transport to investigate the role of neutrino-antineutrino pair annihilation in launching relativistic outflows. Our models span a wide range of BH spins, torus masses, and viscosity parameters. We find that the pair annihilation leads to the formation of relativistic fireballs in most cases, except for those with low black-hole spin and high viscosity. The isotropic-equivalent energies of these outflows reach $\lesssim 10^{51}\,{\rm erg}$ with durations $\lesssim 0.2\,{\rm s}$. While this is insufficient to explain the brightest short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs), our results suggest that the pair annihilation may account for some low-luminosity sGRBs and GRB precursors. We also provide updated scaling relations for the pair annihilation energy deposition rate as a function of accretion rate, and discuss the sensitivity of outflow properties to numerical resolution and floor density.

 - **Abstract**
 We measured the angular diameters of six stars using the 6-element observing mode of the Navy Precision Optical Interferometer (NPOI) for the first time since the early 2000s. Four of the diameters ranged from 1.2 mas to 1.9 mas, while the two others were much smaller at approximately 0.5 mas to 0.7 mas, which are the two smallest angular diameters measured to date with the NPOI. There is a larger spread in the measurements than data obtained with 3- or 4- or 5-element modes, which can be attributed in part to the flux imbalance due to the combination of more than 2 siderostats in a single spectrograph, and also to cross talk between multiple baselines related to non-linearities in the fast delay line dither strokes. We plan to address this in the future by using the VISION beam combiner.

 - **Abstract**
 The Single-Mirror Small-Size Telescope (SST-1M) stereoscopic system is composed of two Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs) designed for optimal performance for gamma-ray astronomy in the multi-TeV energy range. It features a 4-meter-diameter tessellated mirror dish and an innovative SiPM-based camera. Its optical system features a 4-m diameter spherical mirror dish based on the Davies-Cotton design, maintaining a good image quality over a large FoV while minimizing optical aberrations. In 2022, two SST-1M telescopes were installed at the Ondřejov Observatory, Czech Republic, at an altitude of 510 meters above sea level, and have been collecting data for commissioning and astronomical observations since then. We present the first SST-1M observations of the Crab Nebula, conducted between September 2023 and March 2024 in both mono and stereoscopic modes. During this observation period, 46 hours for the SST-1M-1 and 52 hours for the SST-1M-2 were collected for which 33 hours are in stereoscopic mode. We use the Crab Nebula observation to validate the expected performance of the instrument, as evaluated by Monte Carlo simulations carefully tuned to account for instrumental and atmospheric effects. We determined that the energy threshold at the analysis level for the zenith angles below $30^\circ$ is 1 TeV for mono mode and 1.3 TeV for stereo mode. The energy and angular resolutions are approximately 20\% and $0.18^\circ$ for mono mode and 10\% and $0.10^\circ$ for stereo mode, respectively. We present the off-axis performance of the instrument and a detailed study of systematic uncertainties. The results of a full simulation of the telescope and its camera is compared to the data for the first time, allowing a deep understanding of the SST-1M array performance.

          Power density spectra morphologies of seismically unresolved red-giant asteroseismic binaries

 - **Abstract**
 Asteroseismic binaries are two oscillating stars detected in a single light curve. These systems provide robust constraints on stellar models from the combination of dynamical and asteroseismical stellar parameters. Predictions suggested that approximately 200 asteroseismic binaries may exist among the Kepler long-cadence data, and the majority of them consist of two red-clump stars. However, detecting these systems is challenging when the binary components exhibit oscillations at similar frequencies that are indistinguishable. In this study, we predict the morphologies of power density spectra (PDS) of seismically unresolved red-giant asteroseismic binaries to provide examples that can be used to identify among observed stars. We created 5,000 artificial asteroseismic binary (AAB) systems by combining the KASOC light curves of red giants with oscillations at similar frequency ranges. To quantify the complexity of the oscillation patterns, we used the maximum signal-to-noise ratio of the background-normalized PDS and Shannon entropy. Additionally, we identified the radial and quadrupole mode pairs for the individual binary components and determined their impact on the PDS morphologies of AABs. Our results reveal that the majority of AABs consist of the two red-clump stars. The PDS of AABs generally exhibits increased entropy and decreased oscillation power compared to individual components. We focused on the AABs whose stellar components have similar brightness and classified them into four distinct morphologies: single star-like PDS, aligned, partially aligned, and misaligned. Most AABs with detectable oscillations from both components show complex oscillation patterns. Therefore, unresolved asteroseismic binaries with low oscillation power and complex oscillation patterns as characterized by high entropy offer a potential explanation to understand the observed stars with complex PDS.

 - **Abstract**
 This study investigates the physical origin of the critical metallicity ($Z_{\rm c}\sim 0.001$) required for the formation of cool supergiants, as revealed by stellar evolution models. Using model grids that vary in mass, metallicity, opacity, and nuclear reaction rates, we identify a threshold terminal-age main-sequence (TAMS) radius ($R_{\rm T}$) that determines whether a star of a given mass can evolve into the red supergiant (RSG) phase. Through stellar models and homology relations, we show that metallicity affects the TAMS radius via its influence on opacity and nuclear energy generation. By classifying the evolutionary pathways of supergiants, we demonstrate how TAMS radius, shaped by metallicity, decisively governs the post-main-sequence outcome: Stars with metallicities $Z < Z_{\rm c}$ exhibit TAMS radii smaller than $R_{\rm T}$ and proceed to advanced core helium or carbon burning while retaining compact envelopes, thereby preventing further expansion into the RSG regime. In contrast, stars with $Z > Z_{\rm c}$ have TAMS radii larger than $R_{\rm T}$ and expand into the stable RSG phase during core helium burning. The envelope radius at the onset of core helium burning is the key factor determining whether a star becomes a red or blue supergiant. Our results explain the origin of the critical metallicity and offer insight into the evolution of metal-poor massive stars in the early universe.

 The gravitational wave event GW200105 was the first confident neutron star-black hole (NSBH) merger identified by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration. A recent analysis by Morras et al. with an eccentric precessing waveform model that describes the inspiral phase of the $l=2$ and $m=\{0,\pm 2\}$ modes has identified this event as the first NSBH merger with strong evidence of orbital eccentricity. In this paper we perform the first analysis of this event with an aligned-spin eccentric waveform model that describes the full inspiral, merger, and ringdown, includes subdominant harmonics, and is partially calibrated to numerical relativity simulations. This analysis confirms the results and finds evidence in favor of eccentricity even with a log-uniform prior in eccentricity. We also analyze the NSBH events GW200115 and GW230529, completing the analysis of all NSBHs with IMRPhenomTEHM, and find that these signal are consistent with vanishing eccentricity. Finally, we briefly discuss computational challenges when performing the analysis with time-domain eccentric waveform models.

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce a novel extension of the volume-averaged correlation function (VACF) framework by replacing the traditional spherical smoothing kernels with anisotropic, ellipsoidal windows. This generalized approach enables the study of shape-dependent clustering statistics and captures directional information encoded in large-scale structure, particularly in redshift space where galaxy distribution is distorted by peculiar velocities. We define and compute ellipsoidal VACFs $\bar{\xi}_J (r_{\parallel}, r_{\perp})$ and the corresponding reduced cumulants $s_J (r_{\parallel}, r_{\perp})$, allowing for joint sensitivity to both scale and anisotropy across arbitrary statistical order J. Using a suite of COLA N-body simulations spanning a grid of cosmologies with varying $\Omega_M$ and $\sigma_8$, we analyze the behavior of ellipsoidal VACFs and cumulants in both real and redshift space. We find that the shape of the smoothing kernel that maximizes the clustering signal depends strongly on the redshift-space distortion regime: spherical in real space, prolate in the Fingers-of-God-dominated regime, and oblate in the Kaiser squashing-dominated regime. While the standard VACF amplitude is mainly sensitive to ${\sigma}_8$, the shape-dependence of redshift-space skewness shows a coherent response to the combined growth parameter $f \sigma_8$, with a typical sensitivity at the 1-3 $\sigma$ level between neighboring models. Our results demonstrate that ellipsoidal VACFs offer a computationally efficient and information-rich generalization of counts-in-cells analysis, with promising applications to galaxy survey data, halo catalogs, and cosmological tests of gravity beyond $\Lambda CDM$.

 - **Abstract**
 Ground-based gamma-ray astronomy is now well established as a key observational approach to address critical topics at the frontiers of astroparticle physics and high-energy astrophysics. Whilst the field of TeV astronomy was once dominated by arrays of atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes, ground-level particle detection has now been demonstrated to be an equally viable and strongly complementary approach. Ground-level particle detection provides continuous monitoring of the overhead sky, critical for the mapping of extended structures and capturing transient phenomena. As demonstrated by HAWC and LHAASO, the technique provides the best available sensitivity above a few tens of TeV, and for the first time access to the PeV energy range. Despite the success of this approach, there is so far no major ground-level particle-based observatory with access to the Southern sky. HESS, located in Namibia, is the only major gamma-ray instrument in the Southern Hemisphere, and has shown the extraordinary richness of the inner galaxy in the TeV band, but is limited in terms of field of view and energy reach. SWGO is an international effort to construct the first wide-field instrument in the south with deep sensitivity from 100s of GeV into the PeV domain. The project is now close to the end of its development phase and planning for construction of the array in Chile has begun. Here we describe the baseline design, expected sensitivity and resolution, and describe in detail the main scientific topics that will be addressed by this new facility and its initial phase SWGO-A. We show that SWGO will have a transformational impact on a wide range of topics from cosmic-ray acceleration and transport to the nature of dark matter. SWGO represents a key piece of infrastructure for multi-messenger astronomy in the next decade, with strong scientific synergies with the nearby CTA Observatory.

 - **Abstract**
 Motivated by the success of the IXPE mission, we elucidate what can be inferred about 3D matter structures forming around the equatorial plane of accreting compact objects from 0.1-100 keV linear polarization induced by non-relativistic large-scale reflection. We construct a model of an optically thick elevated axially symmetric reflecting medium with arbitrary ionization profile, representing the known diverse scattering environments: from thick winds and super-Eddington funnel structures formed around black holes and neutron stars, to Compton-thick dusty tori of active galactic nuclei and their broad line regions. We assume a central X-ray power-law source with an isotropic, cosine, and slab-corona emission distribution, including intrinsic polarization. The reprocessing is based on constant-density local reflection tables produced with a Monte Carlo method combined with detailed non-LTE radiative transfer, although we also show examples with classical (semi-)analytical reflection prescriptions. We conclude that varying ionization has a similarly strong impact on observed polarization as the observer's inclination and the skew and opening angle of the reflector's inner walls, altogether producing up to tens of % of reflected polarization both parallelly or perpendicularly to the projected axis, depending on the parameter values combination. After testing 3 different ad-hoc shapes of the reflector: a cone, an elliptical torus, and a bowl, we conclude that while in some configurations, their altered curvature produces more than 30% absolute difference in observed total polarization, in others, the adopted shape has a marginal impact. Lastly, we discuss the change of the observed polarization due to releasing the optically thick assumption on equatorial winds and accreted matter, providing a continuous range of energy-dependent examples between the optically thick and thin scenarios.

 WASP-80 b, a warm sub-Jovian (equilibrium temperature ~820 K, 0.5 Jupiter masses), presents an opportunity to characterize a rare gas giant exoplanet around a low-mass star. In addition, its moderate temperature enables its atmosphere to host a range of carbon and oxygen species (H$_2$O, CH$_4$, CO, CO$_2$, NH$_3$). In this paper, we present a panchromatic emission spectrum of WASP-80 b, the first gas giant around a late K/early M-dwarf star and the coolest planet for which the James Webb Space Telescope has obtained a complete emission spectrum spanning 2.4-12 $\mu$m, including NIRCam F322W2 (2.4-4 $\mu$m) and F444W (4-5 $\mu$m), and MIRI LRS (5-12 $\mu$m). We report confident detections of H$_2$O, CH$_4$, CO, and CO$_2$, and a tentative detection of NH$_3$. We estimate WASP-80 b's atmospheric metallicity and carbon-to-oxygen ratio and compare them with estimates for other gas giants. Despite the relative rarity of giant planets around low-mass stars, we find that WASP-80 b's composition is consistent with other hot gas giants, suggesting that the formation pathway of WASP-80 b may not be dissimilar from hot gas giants around higher-mass stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Organics, if they do exist on Europa, may only be present in trace amounts on the surface. NASA's upcoming mission Europa Clipper is going to provide global, high quality data of the surface of Europa in the near-infrared (NIR), specifically the 3-5~$\mu$m region, where organics are rich in spectroscopic features. In this work we investigate Europa Clipper's ability to constrain the abundance of selected trace species of interest that span different chemical bonds found in organics, such as C-H, C=C, C$\equiv$C, C=O and C$\equiv$N, via NIR spectroscopy in the 3-5~$\mu$m wavelength region. We simulate reflectance spectra of these trace species mixed with water ice, at varying SNR and abundance fractions. The evidence for the trace species in a mixture is evaluated using two approaches: 1) calculating average strength of absorption feature(s), and 2) Bayesian model comparison (BMC) analysis. Our simulations show that sharp and strong spectroscopic features of trace ($\sim 5\%$ abundance by number) organic species should be detectable at $> 3\sigma$ significance in Europa Clipper quality data. A BMC analysis pushes the $3\sigma$ detection threshold of trace species even lower to $<1 \%$ abundance. We also consider an example with all trace species mixed together, with overlapping features, and BMC is able to retrieve strong evidence for all of them and also provide constraints on their abundance. These results are promising for Europa Clipper's capability to detect trace organic species, which would allow correlations to be drawn between the composition and geological regions with possibly endogenic material.

          Rapid and accurate numerical evolution of linear cosmological perturbations with non-cold relics

 - **Abstract**
 We describe the implementation of a new approach to the numerical evaluation of the effects of non-cold relics on the evolution of cosmological perturbations. The Boltzmann hierarchies used to compute the contributions of these relics to the stress-energy tensor are replaced with a set of integral equations. These integral equations take the form of convolutions and are solved iteratively with the rest of the system. We develop efficient algorithms for evaluating these convolutions using non-uniform fast Fourier transforms (NUFFTs). This approach enables efficient and accurate evaluation of the cosmic microwave background anisotropies and matter power spectra, all the way through the history of the Universe, without relying on semi-analytic approximations at late times. We implement this method in the Boltzmann solver CLASS, resulting in a new code called CLASSIER (for CLASS Integral Equation Revision), and apply it to massive-neutrino perturbations as a demonstration. The implementation is optimized to accurately capture the distinct behaviors of perturbations in both super-/near-horizon and sub-horizon regimes. Our results match the accuracy of a fully converged Boltzmann hierarchy solution while avoiding numerical artifacts from truncation of the Boltzmann hierarchy at finite multipole and offering substantial speedups depending on the required precision and the range of scales of interest. This new framework provides a practical and robust alternative for the truncated Boltzmann hierarchy approach, especially for studying beyond $\Lambda$CDM non-cold relics with signatures on small scales. CLASSIER is publicly available at this https URL.

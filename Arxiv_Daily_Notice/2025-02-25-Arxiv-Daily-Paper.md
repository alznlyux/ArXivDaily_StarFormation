 - **Abstract**
 This research studies the impact of high-quality training datasets on the performance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in detecting strong gravitational lenses. We stress the importance of data diversity and representativeness, demonstrating how variations in sample populations influence CNN performance. In addition to the quality of training data, our results highlight the effectiveness of various techniques, such as data augmentation and ensemble learning, in reducing false positives while maintaining model completeness at an acceptable level. This enhances the robustness of gravitational lens detection models and advancing capabilities in this field. Our experiments, employing variations of DenseNet and EfficientNet, achieved a best false positive rate (FP rate) of $10^{-4}$, while successfully identifying over 88 per cent of genuine gravitational lenses in the test dataset. This represents an 11-fold reduction in the FP rate compared to the original training dataset. Notably, this substantial enhancement in the FP rate is accompanied by only a 2.3 per cent decrease in the number of true positive samples. Validated on the KiDS dataset, our findings offer insights applicable to ongoing missions, like Euclid.

 - **Abstract**
 We perform fully relativistic simulations of the head-on collisions between intermediate-mass black holes and very massive stars. Such collisions are expected to occur in dense stellar clusters and may play an important role in growing the mass of the seed black hole. For the cases considered here, for which the masses of the black holes and stars are comparable, the vast majority of the stellar material is accreted onto the black hole within a stellar dynamical timescale, as expected from analytical estimates, and leads to a rapid growth of the black hole. A small amount of mass, which is shock-heated in the wake of the black hole, is ejected from the collision and will contribute to the interstellar material in the cluster.

 - **Abstract**
 Very massive stars with masses over 100 Msun are key objects in the Universe for our understanding of chemical and energetic feedback in the Universe, but their evolution and fate are almost entirely determined by their wind mass loss. We aim to determine the mass of the most massive star known in the Local Group R136a1. For this we compute the first hydrodynamically consistent non-local thermodynamical equilibrium atmosphere models for both R136a1 (WN5h) as well as the binary system R144 (WN5/6h+WN6/7h) in the Tarantula nebula. Using the Potsdam Wolf-Rayet code, we simultaneously empirically derive and theoretically predict mass-loss rates and wind velocities. By fitting synthetic spectra derived from these models to multi-wavelength observations, we constrain the stellar and wind properties of R144 and R136a1. We first determine the clumping stratification required by our hydro-models to fit the spectra of R144 by using the available dynamical mass estimates for the two components. We then utilise this clumping stratification in hydrodynamic models of R136a1 and estimate a mass of $M_\mathrm{Hydro}$ of 233 Msun. Remarkably, the estimated mass is close to and entirely consistent with chemical homogeneous mass relations. This present-day mass of 233 Msun provides a lower limit to the initial stellar mass, that could be far higher due to previous wind mass loss.

          A Universal Analytic Model for Gravitational Lensing by Self-Interacting Dark Matter Halos

 - **Abstract**
 We present a model for analytically calculating gravitational lensing by self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) halos. Leveraging the universal behavior of SIDM halos during gravothermal evolution, we calibrate the lensing potential using a fluid simulation, normalizing the evolution time to align with established scenarios. From this potential, we derive explicit equations for the deflection angle and surface density profile, quantifying their deviations from numerical results. Our model builds on the parametric approach of arXiv:2305.16176, providing refinements in the deep core-collapse regime and enabling more comprehensive lensing studies. We explore characteristic lensing features, including critical curves and caustics, for SIDM halos in isolation and within a main halo, tracking their evolution through the gravothermal phase. We also examine signatures in the self-similar regime of core collapsed halos and highlight the role of baryonic effects in realistic halos. The efficiency of our model enables large-scale lensing studies, and we make our implementation publicly available on GitHub to support further research.

          Morphology and kinematics of the gas in M51: How interaction with NGC5195 has moulded the structure of its arms

 - **Abstract**
 The Whirlpool Galaxy is a well studied grand design galaxy with two major spiral arms, and a large satellite NGC 5195. The arms both show long uniform sections with perturbations ('kinks' or sharp turns) in specific regions. Comparing the two arms shows a small radial offset between the main kinked regions. We analysed the morphology and also the velocity field in the disk of M51 using kinematic maps based on H$\alpha$ and CO line emission. These sample complementary radial ranges, with the CO map covering the central zone and the H$\alpha$ map extending to cover the outer zone. We looked for indicators of density wave resonance, zones where radial flows of gas in the disk plane reverse their sign. These were present in both velocity maps; their two-dimensional localization placed them along or closely parallel to the spiral arms, at a set of well defined galactocentric radii, and notably more concentrated along the southern, stronger arm. The results can be well interpreted quantitatively, using a numerical model of the interaction of M51 and NGC5195 in which the satellite has made two relatively recent passes through the disk plane of M51. During the first pass the pair of dominant spiral arms was stimulated, and during the second pass the strong kinks in both arms were formed at about the same time. The second interaction is particularly well characterised, because the timescale corresponding to the production of the kinks and the recovery of the original pitch angle is identical for the two arms.

 - **Abstract**
 NASA's Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) spacecraft impacted Dimorphos, the natural satellite of (65803) Didymos, on 2022 September 26, as a first successful test of kinetic impactor technology for deflecting a potentially hazardous object in space. The experiment resulted in a small change to the dynamical state of the Didymos system consistent with expectations and Level 1 mission requirements. In the pre-encounter paper Richardson (2022), predictions were put forward regarding the pre- and post-impact dynamical state of the Didymos system. Here we assess these predictions, update preliminary findings published after the impact, report on new findings related to dynamics, and provide implications for ESA's Hera mission to Didymos, scheduled for launch in 2024 with arrival in late December 2026. Pre-encounter predictions tested to date are largely in line with observations, despite the unexpected, flattened appearance of Didymos compared to the radar model and the apparent pre-impact oblate shape of Dimorphos (with implications for the origin of the system that remain under investigation). New findings include that Dimorphos likely became prolate due to the impact and may have entered a tumbling rotation state. A possible detection of a post-impact transient secular decrease in the binary orbital period suggests possible dynamical coupling with persistent ejecta. Timescales for damping of any tumbling and clearing of any debris are uncertain. The largest uncertainty in the momentum transfer enhancement factor of the DART impact remains the mass of Dimorphos, which will be resolved by the Hera mission.

 - **Abstract**
 In 1777 Ruđer Bošković observed sunspots, determined their positions and the solar rotation elements by his own methods briefly described here. We repeat his calculations of the mean solar time, sunspot positions, and solar rotation elements using both the Bošković's original equations and equations adapted for modern computers. We repeat the calculations using two values of the obliquity of the ecliptic, Bošković's, and an interpolated one. Using his 1777 observations, Bošković obtained the solar equator's inclination, ecliptic longitude of the ascending node, and sidereal and synodic rotation periods. We analyzed and compared these original Bošković results with our repeated calculations. Our results confirm the validity of Bošković's methods and the precision of his calculations. Additionally, the paper presents the solar differential rotation determination using all 1777 observations by Ruđer Bošković.

 - **Abstract**
 Solar energetic particles such as electrons can be accelerated to mildly-relativistic velocities in the solar corona. These electrons travel through the turbulent corona generating radio waves, which are then severely affected by scattering. The physical interpretation of the discrepancies between the actual and observed radio sources is still subject to debate. Here, we use radio emission observed by an unprecedented total of five spacecraft, to track the path of radio sources from the low corona to the inner heliosphere (15-75 R$_{\odot}$) generated during a solar event on 4 December 2021. In this study we use the Bayesian multilateration technique known as BELLA to track the apparent path of radio sources observed by Parker Solar Probe, STEREO A, Wind, Solar Orbiter and Mars Express. To validate the accuracy of the tracked path, we used Nançay Radioheliograph interferometric imaging at 150 MHz, which was found to agree with the estimated footpoints predicted by BELLA. We also further validated our results using ACE in-situ measurements. We found that the apparent radio sources followed the path of a Parker Spiral, with an associated solar wind velocity of approximately 493 km s-1 (consistent with the corresponding speed observed at 1 au at the relevant longitude) and connected to 75$^\circ$ longitude East at the solar surface. Finally, we made quantitative estimates of the scattering of radio waves that were found to be in good agreement with contemporary models of scattering. This work shows conclusive evidence that the disputed cause of the widely observed `higher than expected' electron densities at interplanetary distances is due to radio wave scattering, and provides a more detailed understanding of the propagation of radio waves emitted near the local plasma frequency in turbulent plasmas.

 - **Abstract**
 The star-forming region Cepheus A hosts a very young star, called HW2, that is the second closest to us growing a dozen times more massive than our Sun. The circumstellar environment surrounding HW2 has long been the subject of much debate about the presence or not of an accretion disk, whose existence is at the basis of our current paradigm of star formation. Here, we answer this long standing question by resolving the gaseous disk component, and its kinematics, through sensitive observations at cm wavelengths of hot ammonia (NH$_3$) with the Jansky Very Large Array. We map the accretion disk surrounding HW2 at radii between 200 and 700 au, showing how fast circumstellar gas collapses and slowly orbits to pile up near the young star at very high rates of $2\times10^{-3}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. These results, corroborated by state-of-the-art simulations, show that an accretion disk is still efficient in focusing huge mass infall rates near the young star, even when this star has already reached a large mass of 16 M$_{\odot}$.

          Calibrating the Instrumental Drift in MAROON-X using an Ensemble Analysis

 - **Abstract**
 MAROON-X is a state-of-the-art extreme precision radial velocity spectrograph deployed on the 8.1-meter Gemini-N telescope on Maunakea, Hawai'i. Using a stabilized Fabry-Pérot etalon for wavelength and drift calibration, MAROON-X has achieved a short-term precision of $\sim$\,30\,cm\,s$^{-1}$. However, due to a long-term drift in the etalon (2.2\,cm\,s$^{-1}$ per day) and various interruptions of the instrument baseline over the first few years of operation, MAROON-X experiences RV offsets between observing runs several times larger than the short-term precision during any individual run, which hinders the detection of longer-period signals. In this study, we analyze RV measurements of 11 targets that either exhibit small RV scatter or have signals that can be precisely constrained using Keplerian or Gaussian Process models. Leveraging this ensemble, we calibrate MAROON-X's run offsets for data collected between September 2020 and early January 2024 to a precision of $\sim$0.5\,m\,s$^{-1}$. When applying these calibrated offsets to HD 3651, a quiet star, we obtain residual velocities with an RMS of $<$70\,cm\,s$^{-1}$ in both the Red and Blue channels of MAROON-X over a baseline of 29 months. We also demonstrate the sensitivity of MAROON-X data calibrated with these offsets through a series of injection-recovery tests. Based on our findings, MAROON-X is capable of detecting sub m\,s$^{-1}$ signals out to periods of more than 1,000 days.

 - **Abstract**
 Planets are thought to form from dust and gas in protoplanetary disks, and debris disks are the remnants of planet formation. Aged a few Myr up to a few Gyr, debris disks have lost their primordial gas, and their dust is produced by steady-state collisions between larger, rocky bodies. Tens of debris disks, with sizes of tens, sometimes hundreds of au, have been resolved with high spatial resolution, high contrast imagers at optical/near-IR or (sub)-millimeter interferometers. They commonly show cavities, ring-like structures, and gaps, which are often regarded as indirect signatures of the presence of planets that gravitationally interact with unseen planetesimals. However, no planet responsible for these features has been detected yet, probably because of the limited sensitivity (typically 2-10 MJ) of high contrast imaging instruments prior to JWST. We have used the unprecedented sensitivity of JWST/MIRI in the thermal IR to search for such planets in the disk of the ~ 6.4 Myr old star TWA 7. With its pole-on orientation, this three-ring debris disk is indeed ideally suited for such a detection. We unambiguously detected a source 1.5 arsec from the star, that is best interpreted as a cold, sub-Jupiter mass planet. Its estimated mass (~ 0.3 MJ) and position (~ 52 au, de-projected) can thoroughly account for the main disk structures.

 Context. Large-scale surveys across wavelengths, aided by machine learning, have improved the detection of old open clusters in high-extinction Milky Way regions. Aims. We aim to confirm or reject automatically detected open clusters in poorly studied, contaminated regions, refining samples for Galactic disk formation studies. Methods. Using VVVX, 2MASS, and Gaia DR3, we analyzed nine cluster candidates: BH118, BH144, Schuster-MWSC 1756, Saurer 3, FSR 1521, Saurer 2, Haffner 10-FSR 1231, Juchert 12, and Pismis 3. We examined density maps, proper motion diagrams, and photometry to derive physical parameters. Results. We identified star clusters via overdensities in 2MASS, WISE, and DECaPS, confirmed with VVVX and Gaussian Kernel Density Estimation. Using Gaia proper motions, we refined memberships, building a high-likelihood cluster catalog. We derived extinction ($A_{Ks} = 0.07$-$0.50$), color excess ($E(J-Ks) = 0.16$-$0.60$), distances ($D = 2.06$-$8.64$ kpc), and Galactocentric distances ($R_G = 7.69$-$14.81$ kpc). Ages range from 20 Myr to 5 Gyr, metallicity from [Fe/H] = -0.5 to 0.5. Structural parameters include core radii ($r_c = 0.71'$-$5.21'$) and tidal radii ($r_t = 3.4'$-$12.0'$). Conclusions. We confirm the open cluster nature of nine targets, updating their physical parameters.

          A Critical Examination of the Nested Leaky Box Model for Galactic Cosmic Ray Transport

 - **Abstract**
 We revisit the predictions of the nested leaky box model in detail, in terms of both primary cosmic-ray spectra, spectra of stable and unstable nuclei and antimatter production (positrons and antiprotons). We conclude that the model is in direct conflict with several observational facts and at least in its vanilla version should be considered as ruled out by current data. We also speculate on some possibly interesting implications of the idea that at least a fraction of Galactic grammage may not be accumulated in the journey of cosmic rays in the interstellar medium but rather inside the sources or in regions around them. These speculations will become increasingly more relevant with the higher precision data becoming available at high energies.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The sources of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos remain largely unknown. Multi-wavelength observational campaignshave identified a few plausible candidates, but their numbers are limited. Aims. We search for an excess of high-energy neutrino events originating from the directions of blazar sources, compared to the expected background. Additionally, we investigate blazars located within a small angular distance from the arrival directions of high-energy neutrinos, analyzing their characteristics to assess their plausibility as neutrino sources. Methods. We generate random samples of events following the right ascension and the declination distributions of the high-energy neutrino events detected by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory and count the coincidences of generated samples as well as the true observations with the Fermi-LAT blazar sources. Furthermore, we conduct temporal analysis of gamma-ray light curves and spectral analysis of blazar sources with the highest clustering of neutrino events. Results. We find an excess of high-energy neutrino events from the directions of Fermi blazars beyond random coincidence, with a significance of 2.42$\sigma$. Among the nine blazars which have a maximum number of neutrino events (four) arriving from within 3 degrees from them, 4FGL J1012.3+0629 exhibits the most significant variability around the neutrino detection time. Our study identifies 4FGL J1012.3+0629, 4FGL J2118.0+0019, 4FGL J2226.8+0051 and 4FGL J2227.9+0036 as plausible high-energy neutrino source candidates. The neutrino events IC110726A, IC170308A, IC190415A, IC141210A, IC150102A, IC230524A, IC140114A, IC110807A, and IC200523A likely originate from these sources. Additionally, we find that the spectral index tends to harden when these high-energy neutrino events are detected.

 In this chapter we first describe the early history of primordial black hole (PBH) research. We then discuss their possible formation mechanisms, including critical collapse from inflationary fluctuations and various types of phase transition. We next describe the numerous constraints on the number density of PBHs from various quantum and astrophysical processes. This was the main focus of research until recently but there is currently a shift of emphasis to the search for evidence for PBHs. We end by discussing this evidence, with particular emphasis on their role as dark matter candidates, sources of gravitational waves and seeds for supermassive black holes and early cosmic structures.

 - **Abstract**
 Machine learning (ML) has become a key tool in astronomy, driving advancements in the analysis and interpretation of complex datasets from observations. This article reviews the application of ML techniques in the identification and classification of stellar objects, alongside the inference of their key astrophysical properties. We highlight the role of both supervised and unsupervised ML algorithms, particularly deep learning models, in classifying stars and enhancing our understanding of essential stellar parameters, such as mass, age, and chemical composition. We discuss ML applications in the study of various stellar objects, including binaries, supernovae, dwarfs, young stellar objects, variables, metal-poor, and chemically peculiar stars. Additionally, we examine the role of ML in investigating star-related interstellar medium objects, such as protoplanetary disks, planetary nebulae, cold neutral medium, feedback bubbles, and molecular clouds.

          Discovery of a Pulsar Wind Nebula Candidate Associated with the Galactic PeVatron 1LHAASO J0343+5254u

 - **Abstract**
 The astronomical origin of the most energetic galactic cosmic rays and gamma rays is still uncertain. X-ray followup of candidate "PeVatrons", systems producing cosmic rays with energies exceeding 1 PeV, can constrain their spatial origin, identify likely counterparts, and test particle emission models. Using 120 ks of XMM-Newton observations, we report the discovery of a candidate pulsar wind nebula, a possible counterpart for the LHAASO PeVatron J0343+5254u. This extended source has a power law X-ray spectrum with spectral index of 1.9 - softer at greater distance from the center - and asymmetric spatial extension out to 2'. We conduct leptonic modeling of the X-ray and gamma ray radiation from this complex system, showing that a fully leptonic model with elevated IR photon fields can explain the multiwavelength emission from this source, similar to other VHE pulsar wind nebulae; excess gamma ray emissivity not explained by a leptonic model may be due to hadronic interactions in nearby molecular cloud regions, which might also produce detectable astroparticle flux.

          Detection of molecular clouds in the PeVatron candidate source LHAASO J0341$+$5258 by the Nobeyama 45-m radio telescope

 - **Abstract**
 We report a new CO observation survey of LHAASO J0341$+$5258 using the Nobeyama Radio Observatory (NRO) 45-m telescope. LHAASO J0341$+$5258 is one of the unidentified ultra-high-energy (UHE; E $>$100 TeV) gamma-ray sources detected by LHAASO. Our CO observations were conducted in February and March 2024, with a total observation time of 36 hours, covering the LHAASO source ($\sim$0.3-0.5 degrees in radius) and its surrounding area (1$\times$1.5 degrees). Within the LHAASO source extent, we identified five compact ($<$ 2 pc) molecular clouds at nearby distances ($<$ 1-4 kpc). These clouds can serve as proton-proton collision targets, producing hadronic gamma rays via neutral pion decays. Based on the hydrogen densities (700-5000 cm$^{-3}$) estimated from our CO observations and archived HI data from the DRAO survey, we derived the total proton energy of $W_p$ (E $>$ 1 TeV) $\sim$ 10$^{45}$ erg to account for the gamma-ray flux. One of the molecular clouds appears to be likely associated with an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star with an extended CO tail, which may indicate some particle acceleration activities. However, the estimated maximum particle energy below 100 TeV makes the AGB-like star unlikely to be a PeVatron site. We conclude that the UHE emission observed in LHAASO J0341$+$5258 could be due to hadronic interactions between the newly discovered molecular clouds and TeV-PeV protons originating from a distant SNR or due to leptonic emission from a pulsar wind nebula candidate, which is reported in our companion X-ray observation paper (DiKerby et al. 2025).

 - **Abstract**
 Customized digital backends for Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) are critical components for radio astronomy observatories. There are several serialized products such as the Digital Baseband Converter (DBBC), Reconfigurable Open Architecture Computing Hardware (ROACH) Digital BackEnd (RDBE), and Chinese Data Acquisition System (CDAS). However, the reliance on high-speed analog-to-digital converters (ADC) and Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) often necessitates dedicated hardware platforms with long development cycles and prohibitive cost, limiting scalability and adaptability to evolving observational needs. To address these challenges, we propose a design leveraging the versatile and cost-effective ROACH2 hardware platform, developed by CASPER (Collaboration for Astronomy Signal Processing and Electronics Research). ROACH2's mature technology and streamlined firmware development capabilities significantly reduce the hardware platform's development cycle and cost, making it ideal for modern astronomical applications. This VLBI digital backend, based on the ROACH2 platform, incorporates key technologies such as Polyphase Filter Banks (PFB) algorithm implementation, digital complex-to-real baseband signal conversion, Mark5B data formatter design and two-bit optimal threshold quantization. These features ensure compatibility with existing systems while providing enhanced performance. The backend's performance was validated through multi-station VLBI experiments, demonstrating its ability to achieve good correlation fringes compared to the customized CDAS2-D system. Furthermore, this platform offers flexibility for rapid deployment of additional digital backends, such as those for spectral line observations, showcasing its potential for broader astronomical applications.

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we present a comprehensive analysis of an unidentified point-like ultra-high-energy (UHE) $\gamma$-ray source, designated as 1LHAASO J1740+0948u, situated in the vicinity of the middle-aged pulsar PSR J1740+1000. The detection significance reached 17.1$\sigma$ (9.4$\sigma$) above 25$\,$TeV (100$\,$TeV). The source energy spectrum extended up to 300$\,$TeV, which was well fitted by a log-parabola function with $N0 = (1.93\pm0.23) \times 10^{-16} \rm{TeV^{-1}\,cm^{-2}\,s^{-2}}$, $\alpha = 2.14\pm0.27$, and $\beta = 1.20\pm0.41$ at E0 = 30$\,$TeV. The associated pulsar, PSR J1740+1000, resides at a high galactic latitude and powers a bow-shock pulsar wind nebula (BSPWN) with an extended X-ray tail. The best-fit position of the gamma-ray source appeared to be shifted by $0.2^{\circ}$ with respect to the pulsar position. As the (i) currently identified pulsar halos do not demonstrate such offsets, and (ii) centroid of the gamma-ray emission is approximately located at the extension of the X-ray tail, we speculate that the UHE $\gamma$-ray emission may originate from re-accelerated electron/positron pairs that are advected away in the bow-shock tail.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the inspiral of a high mass-ratio black hole binary located in the nucleus of a galaxy, where the primary central black hole is surrounded by a dense dark matter spike formed through accretion during the black hole growth phase. Within this spike, dark matter undergoes strong self-annihilation, producing a compact source of $\gamma$-ray radiation that is highly sensitive to spike density, while the binary emits gravitational waves at frequencies detectable by LISA. As the inspiralling binary interacts with the surrounding dark matter particles, it alters the density of the spike, thereby influencing the $\gamma$-ray flux from dark matter annihilation. We demonstrate that the spike self-annihilation luminosity decreases by $10\%$ to $90\%$ of its initial value, depending on the initial density profile and binary mass ratio, as the binary sweeps through the LISA band. This presents a new opportunity to indirectly probe dark matter through multi-messenger observations of galactic nuclei.

 - **Abstract**
 Measuring shock velocities is crucial for understanding the energy transfer processes at the shock fronts of supernova remnants (SNRs), including acceleration of cosmic rays. Here we present shock velocity measurements on the SNR N132D, based on the thermal properties of the shock-heated interstellar medium. We apply a self-consistent model developed in our previous work to X-ray data from deep Chandra observations with an effective exposure of $\sim$ 900 ks. In our model, both temperature and ionization relaxation processes in post-shock plasmas are simultaneously calculated, so that we can trace back to the initial condition of the shock-heated plasma to constrain the shock velocity. We reveal that the shock velocity ranges from 800 to 1500 $\rm{km~s^{-1}}$ with moderate azimuthal dependence. Although our measurement is consistent with the velocity determined by independent proper motion measurements in the south rim regions, a large discrepancy between the two measurements (up to a factor of 4) is found in the north rim regions. This implies that a substantial amount of the kinetic energy has been transferred to the nonthermal component through highly efficient particle acceleration. Our results are qualitatively consistent with the $\gamma$-ray observations of this SNR.

          Forecasting the performance of the Minimally Informed foreground cleaning method for CMB polarization observations

 - **Abstract**
 Astrophysical foreground substraction is crucial to retrieve the cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization out of the observed data. Recent efforts have been carried out towards the development of a minimally informed component separation method to handle a priori unknown foreground spectral energy distributions (SEDs), while being able to estimate both cosmological, foreground, and potentially instrumental parameters, jointly. In this paper, we develop a semi-analytical performance forecasting framework for the minimally informed method and we validate it by comparing its results against direct sampling of the harmonic-based likelihood and the pixel domain implementation MICMAC. We then use the forecasting tool to demonstrate the robustness of the bias correction procedure introduced in the minimally informed approach. We find that a data-driven approach based on the currently available observational data is enough to efficiently regularize the bias of the method.

          Status of early dark energy after DESI: the role of $Ω_m$ and $r_s H_0$

 - **Abstract**
 The EDE model is one of the promising solutions to the long-standing Hubble tension. This paper investigates the status of several EDE models in light of recent BAO observations from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and their implications for resolving the Hubble tension. The DESI Y1 BAO results deviate from the CMB and Type Ia supernova (SNeIa) observations in their constraints on the matter density $\Omega_m$ and the product of the sound horizon and the Hubble constant $r_s H_0$. Meanwhile, these EDE models happen to tend towards this deviation. Therefore, in this work, it is found that DESI Y1 BAO results strengthen the preference for EDE models and help to obtain a higher $H_0$. Even considering the Pantheon+ observations for SNeIa, which have an opposite tendency, DESI still dominates the preference for EDE. This was unforeseen in past SDSS BAO measurements and therefore emphasizes the role of BAO and SNeIa measurements in Hubble tension.

 - **Abstract**
 Solar Energetic Particle (SEPs) with energies ranging from tens of keV to a few GeV, are a significant component in the description of the space environment. In this work, the HESPERIA REleASE product is emphasized, which, based on the Relativistic Electron Alert System for Exploration (REleASE) forecasting scheme, generates real-time predictions of the proton flux (30-50 MeV) at L1, making use of relativistic and near-relativistic electron measurements by the SOHO/EPHIN and ACE/EPAM experiments, respectively. The HESPERIA REleASE Alert is a notification system based on the forecasts produced by the HESPERIA REleASE product and informs about the expected radiation impact in real-time using an illustration and a distribution system for registered users. We also present and discuss the Advance Warning Times derived for the compiled list of major SEP events successfully forecasted over the last 2.5 years dur-ing solar cycle 25 by HESPERIA REleASE and recent developments.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a catalogue of extended radio sources from the SARAO MeerKAT Galactic Plane Survey (SMGPS). Compiled from 56 survey tiles and covering approximately 500 deg$^2$ across the first, third, and fourth Galactic quadrants, the catalogue includes 16534 extended and diffuse sources with areas larger than 5 synthesised beams. Of them, 3891 (24\% of the total) are confidently associated with known Galactic radio-emitting objects in the literature, such as HII regions, supernova remnants, planetary nebulae, luminous blue variables, and Wolf-Rayet stars. A significant fraction of the remaining sources, 5462 (33\%), are candidate extragalactic sources, while 7181 (43\%) remain unclassified. Isolated radio filaments are excluded from the catalogue. The diversity of extended sources underscores MeerKAT's contribution to the completeness of censuses of Galactic radio emitters, and its potential for new scientific discoveries. For the catalogued sources, we derived basic positional and morphological parameters, as well as flux density estimates, using standard aperture photometry. This paper describes the methods followed to generate the catalogue from the original SMGPS tiles, detailing the source extraction, characterisation, and crossmatching procedures. Additionally, we analyse the statistical properties of the catalogued populations

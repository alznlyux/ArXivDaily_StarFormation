 - **Abstract**
 As the field of exoplanetary astronomy has matured, there has been growing demand for precise stellar abundances to probe subtle correlations between stellar compositions and planetary demographics. However, drawing population-level conclusions from the disparate measurements in the literature is challenging, with various groups measuring metallicities using bespoke codes with differing line lists, radiative transfer models, and other assumptions. Here we use the neural-net framework uberMS to measure iron abundances and alpha enchriments from high-resolution optical spectra observed by the Tillinghast Reflector Echelle Spectrograph (TRES), a key resource used for the follow-up of candidate exoplanet hosts. To contextualize these measurements and benchmark the performance of our method, we compare to external constraints on metallicity using the Hyades cluster, wide binaries, and asteroids, to external constraints on $T_{\rm eff}$ and $\log g$ using stars with interferometric radii, and to the results of other abundance measurement methods using overlap samples with the APOGEE and SPOCS catalogs, as well as by applying the SPC method directly to TRES spectra. We find that TRES-uberMS provides parameter estimates with errors of roughly 100K in $T_{\rm eff}$, 0.09dex in $\log g$, and 0.04dex in [Fe/H] for nearby dwarf stars. However, [Fe/H] performance is significantly poorer for mid-to-late K dwarfs, with the bias worsening with decreasing $T_{\rm eff}$. Performance is also worse for evolved stars. Our [$\alpha$/Fe] error may be as good as 0.03dex for dwarfs based on external benchmarks, although there are large systematic differences when comparing with specific alpha-element abundances from other catalogs.

 - **Abstract**
 We present new analysis of the CWW 89 system as part of the Orbital Architectures of Transiting Massive Exoplanets And Low-mass stars (OATMEAL) survey. The CWW 89 system is a member of the 2.8 Gyr old Ruprecht 147 (NGC 6774) cluster and features two stars, CWW 89A (EPIC 219388192) and CWW 89B, with the primary hosting a transiting brown dwarf. We use in-transit, highly precise radial velocity measurements with the Keck Planet Finder (KPF) to characterize the Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect and measure the projected spin-orbit obliquity $|\lambda|=1.4\pm2.5^\circ$ and the full 3D spin-orbit obliquity of the brown dwarf to be $\psi=15.1^{+15.0^\circ}_{-10.9}$. This value of $\lambda$ implies that the brown dwarf's orbit is prograde and well-aligned with the equator of the host star, continuing the trend of transiting brown dwarfs showing a preference for alignment ($\lambda \approx 0^\circ$) regardless of the stellar effective temperature. We find that this contrast with the transiting giant planet population, whose spin-orbit alignments depend on host $T_{\rm eff}$, shows an increasingly clear distinction in the formation and orbital migration mechanisms between transiting giant planets and transiting brown dwarfs like CWW 89Ab. For this system in particular, we find it plausible that the brown dwarf may have undergone coplanar high-eccentricity migration influence by CWW 89B.

 - **Abstract**
 Nested sampling (NS) is the preferred stochastic sampling algorithm for gravitational-wave inference for compact binary coalenscences (CBCs). It can handle the complex nature of the gravitational-wave likelihood surface and provides an estimate of the Bayesian model evidence. However, there is another class of algorithms that meets the same requirements but has not been used for gravitational-wave analyses: Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC), an extension of importance sampling that maps samples from an initial density to a target density via a series of intermediate densities. In this work, we validate a type of SMC algorithm, called persistent sampling (PS), for gravitational-wave inference. We consider a range of different scenarios including binary black holes (BBHs) and binary neutron stars (BNSs) and real and simulated data and show that PS produces results that are consistent with NS whilst being, on average, 2 times more efficient and 2.74 times faster. This demonstrates that PS is a viable alternative to NS that should be considered for future gravitational-wave analyses.

 - **Abstract**
 Quasar spectra carry the imprint of foreground intergalactic medium (IGM) through absorption features. In particular, absorption caused by neutral hydrogen gas, the ``Ly$\alpha$ forest,'' is a key spectroscopic tracer for cosmological analyses used to measure cosmic expansion and test physics beyond the standard model. Despite their importance, current methods for measuring LyA absorption cannot directly derive the intrinsic quasar continuum and make strong assumptions on its shape, thus distorting the measured LyA clustering. We present SpenderQ, a ML-based approach for directly reconstructing the intrinsic quasar spectra and measuring the LyA forest from observations. SpenderQ uses the Spender spectrum autoencoder to learn a compact and redshift-invariant latent encoding of quasar spectra, combined with an iterative procedure to identify and mask absorption regions. To demonstrate its performance, we apply SpenderQ to 400,000 synthetic quasar spectra created to validate the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Year 1 LyA cosmological analyses. SpenderQ accurately reconstructs the true intrinsic quasar spectra, including the broad LyB, LyA, SiIV, CIV, and CIII emission lines. Redward of LyA, SpenderQ provides percent-level reconstructions of the true quasar spectra. Blueward of LyA, SpenderQ reconstructs the true spectra to < 5\%. SpenderQ reproduces the shapes of individual quasar spectra more robustly than the current state-of-the-art. We, thus, expect it will significantly reduce biases in LyA clustering measurements and enable studies of quasars and their physical properties. SpenderQ also provides informative latent variable encodings that can be used to, e.g., classify quasars with Broad Absorption Lines. Overall, SpenderQ provides a new data-driven approach for unbiased LyA forest measurements in cosmological, quasar, and IGM studies.

 - **Abstract**
 The Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) Extreme-ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT) has been taking images of the Solar disk and corona in four narrow EUV bandpasses (171Å, 195Å, 284Å, and 304Å) at a minimum cadence of once per day since early 1996. The time series of fully-calibrated EIT images now spans approximately 28 years, from early 1996 to early 2024, covering solar cycles 23, 24, and the beginning of cycle 25. We convert this extensive EIT image archive into a time series of `Sun-as-a-star' light curves in EIT's four bandpasses, providing a long-term record of solar EUV variability. These Sun-as-a-star light curves, available for download from this https URL, trace the Sun as if it were a distant point source, viewed from a fixed perspective. We find that our EUV light curves trace the $\sim$ 11-year solar activity cycle and the $\sim$ 27-day rotation period much better than comparable optical observations. In particular, we can accurately recover the solar rotation period from our 284Ålight curve for 26 out of 28 calendar years of EIT observations (93% of the time), compared to only 3 out of 29 calendar years (10% of the time) of the VIRGO total solar irradiance time series, which is dominated by optical light. Our EIT light curves, in conjunction with Sun-as-a-star light curves at optical wavelengths, will be valuable to those interested in inferring the EUV/UV character of stars with long optical light curves but no intensive UV observations, as well as to those interested in long-term records of solar and space weather.

 - **Abstract**
 Precise localizations of a small number of repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs) using very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) have enabled multiwavelength follow-up observations revealing diverse local environments. However, the 2--3\% of FRB sources that are observed to repeat may not be representative of the full population. Here we use the VLBI capabilities of the full CHIME Outriggers array for the first time to localize a nearby (40 Mpc), bright (kJy), and apparently one-off FRB source, FRB 20250316A, to its environment on 13-pc scales. We use optical and radio observations to place deep constraints on associated transient emission and the properties of its local environment. We place a $5\sigma$ upper limit of $L_{\mathrm{9.9~\mathrm{GHz}}} < 2.1\times10^{25}~\mathrm{erg~s^{-1}~Hz^{-1}}$ on spatially coincident radio emission, a factor of 100 lower than any known compact persistent radio source associated with an FRB. Our KCWI observations allow us to characterize the gas density, metallicity, nature of gas ionization, dust extinction and star-formation rate through emission line fluxes. We leverage the exceptional brightness and proximity of this source to place deep constraints on the repetition of FRB 20250316A, and find it is inconsistent with all well-studied repeaters given the non-detection of bursts at lower spectral energies. We explore the implications of a measured offset of 190$\pm20$ pc from the center of the nearest star-formation region, in the context of progenitor channels. FRB 20250316A marks the beginning of an era of routine localizations for one-off FRBs on tens of mas-scales, enabling large-scale studies of their local environments.

 - **Abstract**
 Water ice is a fundamental building material of comets and other bodies in the outer solar system. Yet, the properties of cometary water ice are challenging to study, due to its volatility and the typical distances at which comets are observed. Cometary outbursts, impulsive mass-loss events that can liberate large amounts of material, offer opportunities to directly observe and characterize cometary water ice. We present a study of comet 243P/NEAT, instigated by a $-3$ mag outburst that occurred in December 2018. Optical images and a 251-day lightcurve were examined to characterize the outburst and the comet's quiescent activity. Variations in the quiescent lightcurve appear to be dominated by coma asymmetries, rather than changing activity levels as the comet approached and receded from the Sun. Furthermore, the lightcurve shows evidence for 1 to 2 additional small outbursts ($-0.3$ mag) occurring in September 2018. The large December 2018 outburst likely ejected water ice grains, yet no signatures of ice were found in color photometry, a color map, nor a near-infrared spectrum. We discuss possible dynamical and thermal reasons for this non-detection. In this context, we examined the comae of comets 103P/Hartley 2 and C/2013 US$_{10}$ (Catalina), and show that a one-to-one mapping between continuum color and the presence of water ice cannot be supported. We also discuss possible causes for the large outburst, and find that there is an apparent grouping in the kinetic energy per mass estimates for the outbursts of 5 comets.

          The Evolution of Jupiter and Saturn as a function of the Semi-convective Parameter R$_ρ$

 - **Abstract**
 Computed using the APPLE planetary evolution code, we present updated evolutionary models for Jupiter and Saturn that incorporate helium rain, non-adiabatic thermal structures, and "fuzzy" extended heavy-element cores. Building on our previous Ledoux-stable models, we implement improved atmospheric boundary conditions that account for composition-dependent effective temperatures and systematically explore the impact of varying the density ratio parameter R$_{\rho}$, which governs in an approximate way the efficiency of semi-convection. For both Jupiter and Saturn, we construct models spanning R$_{\rho}$=1 (Ledoux) to R$_{\rho}$=0 (Schwarzschild), and identify best-fit solutions that match each planet's effective temperature, equatorial radius, lower-order gravitational moments, and atmospheric composition at 4.56 Gyr. We find that lower R$_{\rho}$ values lead to stronger convective mixing, resulting in higher surface metallicities and lower deep interior temperatures, while requiring reduced heavy-element masses and lower initial entropies to stabilize the dilute inner cores. Our Saturn models also agree with the observed Brunt-Vaisala frequency profile inferred from Cassini ring seismology, with stable layers arising from both the helium rain region and the dilute core. These findings support the presence of complex, compositionally stratified interiors in both gas giants.

          Dark Energy Crosses the Line: Quantifying and Testing the Evidence for Phantom Crossing

 - **Abstract**
 Combinations of the most recent CMB, BAO, and SNeIa datasets, when analyzed using the CPL parametrization, $w(a) = w_0 + (1 - a) w_a$, exclude $\Lambda$CDM at $\gtrsim\!3\sigma$ in favor of a dark energy equation of state (EoS) parameter that crosses the phantom divide. We confirm this behavior and show that it persists when DESI BAO data are replaced by SH0ES $H_0$ measurements, despite the known tension between these probes in the presence of CMB data. In both cases, the constraints favor a transition from an early-time phantom-like phase to a late-time quintessence-like phase, with the crossing occurring at different redshifts depending on the dataset combination. The probability that a phantom divide line (PDL) crossing does not occur within the expansion history is excluded at significance levels ranging between $3.1\sigma$-$5.2\sigma$. To investigate whether the apparent PDL crossing is a genuine feature preferred by the data or an artifact of the linear form of the CPL parametrization, we isolate the PDL crossing feature by introducing two modified versions of CPL that explicitly forbid it: CPL${}_{>a_\mathrm{c}}$ and CPL${}_{<a_\mathrm{c}}$. These models are physically motivated in that they phenomenologically capture the behavior of thawing and freezing scalar field scenarios. While previous studies have primarily considered thawing quintessence as a non-crossing alternative, we find that a freezing phantom-like model is the only one capable of performing comparably to CPL -- and only in a few cases. Nevertheless, across all dataset combinations considered, the standard CPL model consistently provides the best fit, strongly indicating that the data genuinely favor a PDL crossing.

 - **Abstract**
 21 cm intensity mapping (HI IM) can efficiently map large cosmic volumes with good redshift resolution, but systematics and foreground contamination pose major challenges for extracting accurate cosmological information. Cross-correlation with galaxy surveys offers an efficient mitigation strategy, as both datasets have largely uncorrelated systematics. We evaluate the detectability of the 21 cm signal from the BINGO radio telescope by cross-correlating with the LSST photometric survey, given their strong overlap in area and redshift. Using lognormal simulations, we model the cosmological signal in the BINGO frequency range (980 - 1260 MHz), incorporating thermal noise, foregrounds, and cleanup. The LSST simulations include uncertainties in photometric redshift (photo-z) and galaxy number density in the first three redshift intervals (mean redshift approximately equal to 0.25, 0.35, 0.45), corresponding to the expected performance after 10 years of the survey. We show that photo-z errors significantly increase the noise in the cross-correlation, reducing its statistical significance to levels comparable to those of the autocorrelation. Still, the HI signal remains detectable through the cross-correlation, even with photo-z uncertainties similar to those of the LSST. Our results corroborate the feasibility of this approach under realistic conditions and motivate further refinement of the current analysis methods.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we derive systemic velocities and subsequently orbits for 8456 RR~Lyrae stars. We identify interlopers from other Milky Way (MW) structures, which amount to 22 percent of the total sample. Most interlopers are associated with the halo, with the remainder linked to the Galactic disk. We confirm the previously reported lag in the rotation curve of bulge RR~Lyrae stars regardless of the removal of interlopers. Metal-rich RR~Lyrae stars' rotation patterns are consistent with that of non-variable metal-rich giants, following the MW bar, while metal-poor stars exhibit slower rotation. The analysis of orbital parameter space is used to distinguish bulge stars that, in the bar reference frame, have prograde orbits from those in retrograde orbits. We classify the prograde stars into orbital families and estimate the chaoticity (in the form of frequency drift) of their orbits. RR~Lyrae stars with banana-like orbits have a bimodal distance distribution, similar to the distance distribution seen in the metal-rich red clump stars. The fraction of stars with banana-like orbits decreases linearly with metallicity, as does the fraction of stars on prograde orbits (in the bar reference frame). The retrograde moving stars (in the bar reference frame) form a centrally concentrated nearly spherical distribution. Analyzing an $N$-body+SPH simulation, we find that some stellar particles in the central parts oscillate between retrograde and prograde orbits and only a minority stays prograde over a long period of time. Based on the simulation, the ratio between prograde and retrograde stellar particles seems to stabilize within a couple of gigayears after bar formation. The non-chaoticity of retrograde orbits and their high numbers can explain some of the spatial and kinematical features of the MW bulge that have been often associated with a classical bulge.

 - **Abstract**
 The large-angle polarization anisotropies observed in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) are generated by Thomson scattering of CMB photons off free electrons in the post-recombination Universe. In the standard $\Lambda$ cold dark matter cosmological model, the free electron density becomes large at redshifts $z \lesssim 10$ due to the formation of the first stars, leading to reionization of the intergalactic medium. In this work, we use \emph{Gaussian processes} to give a model-independent reconstruction of the reionization history of the Universe constrained by the \textit{Planck} CMB measurements. This method gives a consistent reconstruction of the standard reionization at $z \lesssim 10$, and strongly constrains any additional high-$z$ reionization. We use our results to construct a new derived parameter expressing the high-$z$ contribution to the CMB optical depth, $\tau_{\mathrm{highz}}$. The posterior distribution on $\tau_{\mathrm{highz}}$ can be used to set accurate constraints on models for exotic energy injection, which we demonstrate for the case of decaying dark matter with particle mass in the range $\mathcal{O}(1\,\text{MeV})$. A companion paper demonstrates the use of this methodology to test ensembles of multi-axion models. Our results can be recast to different models using the provided data and code: \href{this https URL}{this http URL\_reio\_gpr}.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we present high-resolution spectroscopic observations for six metal-poor stars with [Fe/H]<-3 (including one with [Fe/H]<-4), selected using narrow-band Ca II HK photometry from the DECam MAGIC Survey. The spectroscopic data confirms the accuracy of the photometric metallicities and allows for the determination of chemical abundances for 16 elements, from carbon to barium. The program stars have chemical abundances consistent with this metallicity range. A kinematic/dynamical analysis suggests that all program stars belong to the distant Milky Way halo population (heliocentric distances 35 < dhelio/kpc < 55), including three with high-energy orbits that might have been associated with the Magellanic system and one, J0026-5445, having parameters consistent with being a member of the Sagittarius stream. The remaining two stars show kinematics consistent with the Gaia-Sausage/Enceladus dwarf galaxy merger. J0433-5548, with [Fe/H]=-4.12, is a carbon-enhanced ultra metal-poor star, with [C/Fe]=+1.73. This star is believed to be a bona fide second-generation star, and its chemical abundance pattern was compared with yields from metal-free supernova models. Results suggest that J0433-5548 could have been formed from a gas cloud enriched by a single supernova explosion from a ~11Mo star in the early universe. The successful identification of such objects demonstrates the reliability of photometric metallicity estimates, which can be used for target selection and statistical studies of faint targets in the Milky Way and its satellite population. These discoveries illustrate the power of measuring chemical abundances of metal-poor Milky Way halo stars to learn more about early galaxy formation and evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 OVz stars are identified by their optical spectra, in which the He II 4686 absorption line is stronger than any other He line. This spectral characteristic suggests that these stars may be less luminous, less evolved, and located closer to the zero-age main sequence (ZAMS). Although their evolutionary status is still debated, OVz stars are key candidates for understanding the earliest stages of massive star evolution. In this study, we analyze OVz stars in the star-forming regions NGC 346 in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) and 30 Doradus in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), aiming to determine their physical properties and investigate the role of low metallicity in the emergence of the Vz peculiarity. We identified a sample of OVz and OV stars in NGC 346 using spectra obtained with the Magellan Echellette (MagE) spectrograph at Las Campanas Observatory. Spectral classification was based on the equivalent width ratios of key He lines. Quantitative spectroscopic analyses were carried out using the IACOB-BROAD and IACOB-GBAT/FASTWIND tools. For consistency, previously identified OV and OVz stars in 30 Doradus were reclassified following the same criteria.

 - **Abstract**
 The ultraviolet and optical wavelength ranges have proven to be a key addition to infrared observations of exoplanet atmospheres, as they offer unique insights into the properties of clouds and hazes and are sensitive to signatures of disequilibrium chemistry. Here we present the 0.2-0.8 $\mu$m transmission spectrum of the Teq = 2000 K Jupiter KELT-7b, acquired with HST WFC3/UVIS G280 as part of the HUSTLE Treasury program. We combined this new spectrum with the previously published HST WFC3/IR G141 (1.1-1.7 $\mu$m) spectrum and Spitzer photometric points at 3.6$\mu$m and 4.5$\mu$m, to reveal a generally featureless transmission spectrum between 0.2 and 1.7 $\mu$m, with a slight downward slope towards bluer wavelengths, and a asymmetric water feature in the 1.1-1.7 $\mu$m band. Retrieval models conclude that the 0.2 - 1.7$\mu$m spectrum is primarily explained by a high H- abundance ($\sim 10^{-5}$), significantly above the equilibrium chemistry prediction ($\sim 10^{-12}$), suggesting disequilibrium in KELT-7b's upper atmosphere. Our retrievals also suggest the presence of bright inhomogeneities in the stellar surface, and tentative evidence of CO2 at the Spitzer wavelengths. We demonstrate that with the UV-optical coverage provided by WFC3 UVIS/G280, we are able to confirm the presence and constrain the abundance of H-, and obtain evidence for bright stellar inhomogeneities that would have been overlooked using infrared data alone. Observations redward of 1$\mu$m with JWST should be able to further constrain the abundance of H-, as well as confirm the presence of CO2 inferred by the two Spitzer datapoints.

 We present the numerical lunar time ephemeris LTE440 based on the definition of Lunar Coordinate Time (TCL) given by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) in IAU 2024 Resolution II. LTE440 can be used to obtain the numerical transformation between TCL and Solar System Barycentric Dynamical Time (TCL-TDB) or Solar System Barycentric Coordinate Time (TCL-TCB). The theoretical model, numerical method, and performance of LTE440 are discussed. The secular drifts between TCL and TDB and between TCL and TCB are respectively estimated as $\left< d\mathrm{TCL}/d\mathrm{TDB}\right>=1-6.798\,355\,238\times10^{-10}$, and $\left< d\mathrm{TCL}/d\mathrm{TCB}\right>=1-1.482\,536\,216\,67\times10^{-8}$. The most significant periodic terms have amplitudes of about 1651 microseconds for the annual term and 126 microseconds for the monthly term. The precision of LTE440 is estimated to be at the level of several picoseconds. LTE440 is freely available at this https URL.

 - **Abstract**
 Motivated by the discovery of a pulsar in the direction of the old open cluster NGC 6791, we conducted a search for radio pulsars in archival Parkes observations targeting similar old open clusters. We reprocessed 224 observations totalling 75.02 hours from four clusters: Theia 1661, NGC 6259, Pismis 3, and Trumpler 20. Our analysis identified five known pulsars and three new rotating radio transient (RRAT) candidates. By comparing the measured dispersion measures (DMs) with the expected DM values for each cluster derived from YMW16 and NE2001 models, we conclude that most detected sources are likely background pulsars. However, RRAT J1749-25 in Theia 1661 and RRAT J1237-60 in Trumpler 20 have DMs reasonably close to their respective clusters, suggesting possible membership. The association between PSR J1750-2536 and Theia 1661 remains ambiguous due to its intermediate DM. These candidate cluster-associated neutron stars warrant follow-up with more sensitive telescopes such as MeerKAT or the SKA, potentially offering valuable insights into neutron star retention mechanisms and evolution in open cluster environments.

 - **Abstract**
 The Galactic black hole (BH) X-ray binary 4U 1630-47 went into a new outburst in 2021 after $\sim$ 600 days from its 2020 outburst. We perform a detailed analysis of quasi-periodic oscillations and spectral evolutions during its 2021 outburst based on \textit{Insight}-HXMT observations. The main science aims to study the reflection features evolution of this accreting black hole using the observations of detecting quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) and quasi-regular modulations (QRMs). The QPOs frequencies evolve from $\sim 1.6 - 3.6$ Hz, and QRMs have low frequencies around 0.05 - 0.07 Hz. The reflection fraction varies during the outburst and has a positive correlation with the hardness ratio when QPOs are detected. The centroid frequency of QPOs is anti-correlated to the reflection fraction. This is consistent with the prediction of precessing inner flow model and provides evidence for a geometrical origin of QPOs. The centroid frequency of QRMs also shows an anti-correlation to the reflection fraction, but the hardness ratio shows no relation to the reflection fraction during the period. We suggest that QRMs may have a different origin from QPOs and be caused by instabilities in the corona.

 - **Abstract**
 The fundamental nature of dark matter (DM) remains unknown, with significant uncertainties in its density profile. DM environments surrounding massive binary black holes (BBHs) modify their orbital dynamics, thereby altering gravitational wave (GW) emissions. For BBH systems at the Galactic Center, dynamical friction induced by DM spikes could produce detectable deviations in GW spectra, potentially observable by future space-based detectors. To address the uncertainties in the Galactic Center's DM profile, we systematically examine two scenarios: the generalized Navarro-Frenk-White (gNFW) profile and its post-spike modification. We investigate the evolutionary effects of DM dynamical friction and accretion on the eccentricity and semi-latus rectum of secondary black holes (BHs) in elliptical orbits. By constructing orbital models with varying initial eccentricities across the mass-semi-latus rectum parameter space and utilizing 30 years of simulated pulsar timing array data from the Square Kilometer Array (SKA), we identify detectable parameter regimes of DM effects and employ these GW observational signatures to constrain different DM density profiles. Our analysis reveals that among gNFW profiles ($\gamma=2,1.5,1,0.5$), only $\gamma=2$ produces significant detectable signatures. The formation of DM spikes further enhances these observable waveform deviations for all gNFW slopes.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the formation of X-ray emission lines in the wind of the Wolf-Rayet (WR) companion in Cyg X-3 by analyzing their orbital dynamics using Chandra High Energy Transmission Grating (HEG) observations during a hypersoft state. Our goal is to constrain the X-ray transparency of the recently discovered funnel-like structure surrounding the compact star, as revealed by X-ray polarimetry. All lines exhibit sinusoidal orbital modulation, with the velocity amplitude generally increasing and the orbital phase with the highest blueshift generally decreasing for ions with a higher ionisation potential. The {Fe}{xxvi}-line displays velocity extremes at phase 0.25 (blueshift) and 0.75 (redshift), indicating that the line-emitting region is close to the compact component (disc or corona) and thus reflects the orbital motion. The {Fe}{xxv}-line shows a complex behaviour that cannot be fully resolved with the Chandra/HEG resolution. Other lines display velocity extremes scattered around phase 0.5 (blueshift) and 0.0 (redshift), with velocity amplitudes of 100--300 km/s, suggesting their origin in the WR stellar wind between the two components along 3D \xi-surfaces. Parts of the emission lines of {Ar}{xviii} and {Ca}{xx} originated around the compact star (disc or corona). The recent polarisation funnel-modelling is consistent with the present results during the hypersoft state.

 - **Abstract**
 AI-enhanced approaches are becoming common in astronomical data analysis, including in the galaxy morphological classification. In this study we develop an approach that enhances galaxy classification by incorporating an image denoising pre-processing step, utilizing the U-Net Variational Autoencoder (VAE) architecture and effectively mitigating noise in galaxy images and leading to improved classification performance. Our methodology involves training U-Net VAEs on the EFIGI dataset. To simulate realistic observational conditions, we introduce artifacts such as projected stars, satellite trails, and diffraction patterns into clean galaxy images. The denoised images generated are evaluated using Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), to quantify the quality improvements. We utilize the denoised images for galaxy classification tasks using models such as DenseNet-201, ResNet50, VGG16 and GCNN. Simulations do reveal that, the models trained on denoised images consistently outperform those trained on noisy images, thus demonstrating the efficiency of the used denoising procedure. The developed approach can be used for other astronomical datasets, via refining the VAE architecture and integrating additional pre-processing strategies, e.g. in revealing of gravitational lenses, cosmic web structures.

 - **Abstract**
 Line resolved X-ray spectra of outflows from X-ray binaries are interesting since they provide quantifiable measures of the accreted material on to the compact object (black hole or neutron star), which can not be observed directly in the accretion disk. One such measurement that has been largely overlooked is that of the elemental abundances, which potentially provide insights into the origin of the ejected material. Using the Chandra/HETG grating spectrometer we measure and present elemental abundances in four low-mass X-ray binaries. We compare two measurement methods. One is by fitting line series of individual ions and reconstructing the absorption measure distribution (AMD), and the other is a global fit with one or two individual ionization components. All outflows feature a steep AMD strongly favoring high ionization degrees. The present abundances are consistent with previous works suggesting the abundances in the outflows are non-solar. We find a tentative trend of increasing abundances with atomic number, which fits some core-collapse supernova models, but no exact match to a specific one.

 - **Abstract**
 We present International LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) Telescope (ILT) observations of the Crab Nebula, the remnant of a core-collapse supernova explosion observed by astronomers in 1054. The field of the Crab Nebula was observed between 120 and 168 MHz as part of the LOFAR Two Meter Sky Survey (LoTSS), and the data were re-processed to include the LOFAR international stations to create a high angular resolution ($0.43'' \times 0.28''$) map at a central frequency of 145 MHz. Combining the ILT map with archival centimeter-range observations of the Nebula with the Very Large Array (VLA) and LOFAR data at 54 MHz, we become sensitive to the effects of free-free absorption against the synchrotron emission of the pulsar wind nebula. This absorption is caused by the ionised filaments visible in optical and infrared data of the Crab Nebula, which are the result of the pulsar wind nebula expanding into the denser stellar ejecta that surrounds it and forming Rayleigh-Taylor fingers. The LOFAR observations are sensitive to two components of these filaments: their dense cores, which show electron densities of $\gtrsim1,000$ cm$^{-3}$, and the diffuse envelopes, with electron densities of $\sim50-250$ cm$^{-3}$. The denser structures have widths of $\sim0.03$ pc, whereas the diffuse component is at one point as large as $0.2$ pc. The morphology of the two components is not always the same. These finding suggests that the layered temperature, density, and ionisation structure of the Crab optical filaments extends to larger scales than previously considered.

 Context. Cosmic voids are vast underdense regions in the cosmic web that encode crucial information about structure formation, the composition of the Universe, and its expansion history. Due to their lower density, these regions are less affected by non-linear gravitational dynamics, making them suitable candidates for analysis using semi-analytic methods. Aims. We assess the accuracy of the PINOCCHIO code, a fast tool for generating dark matter halo catalogs based on Lagrangian Perturbation Theory, in modeling the statistical properties of cosmic voids. We validate this approach by comparing the resulting void statistics measured from PINOCCHIO to those obtained from N-body simulations. Methods. We generate a set of simulations using PINOCCHIO and OpenGADGET3, assuming a fiducial cosmology and varying the resolution. For a given resolution, the simulations share the same initial conditions between the different simulation codes. Snapshots are saved at multiple redshifts for each simulation and post-processed using the watershed void finder VIDE to identify cosmic voids. For each simulation code, we measure the following statistics: void size function, void ellipticity function, core density function, and the void radial density profile. We use these statistics to quantify the accuracy of PINOCCHIO relative to OpenGADGET3 in the context of cosmic voids. Results. We find agreement for all void statistics at better than 2{\sigma} between PINOCCHIO and OpenGADGET3, with no systematic difference in redshift trends. This demonstrates that the PINOCCHIO code can reliably produce void statistics with high computational efficiency compared to full N-body simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 Common envelope (CE) evolution is largely governed by the drag torque applied on the inspiralling stellar components by the envelope. Previous work has shown that idealized models of the torque based on a single body moving in rectilinear motion through an unperturbed atmosphere can be highly inaccurate. Progress requires new models for the torque that account for binarity. Toward this end we perform a new 3D global hydrodynamic CE simulation with the mass of the companion point particle set equal to the mass of the asymptotic giant branch star core particle to maximize symmetry and facilitate interpretation. First, we find that a region around the particles of a scale comparable to their separation contributes essentially all of the torque. Second, the density pattern of the torque-dominating gas and, to an extent, this gas itself, is roughly in corotation with the binary. Third, approximating the spatial distribution of the torquing gas as a uniform-density prolate spheroid whose major axis resides in the orbital plane and lags the line joining the binary components by a constant phase angle reproduces the torque evolution remarkably well, analogous to studies of binary supermassive black holes. Fourth, we compare the torque measured in the simulation with the predictions of a model that assumes two weak point-mass perturbers undergoing circular motion in a uniform background without gas self-gravity, and find remarkable agreement with our results if the background density is taken to be equal to a fixed fraction ($\approx0.44$) of the density at the spheroid surface. Overall, this work makes progress toward developing simple time-dependent models of the CE phase.

 - **Abstract**
 We self-consistently determine the 3D density distribution of NGC 551's stellar disk and study observational signatures of two-component stellar disks. Assuming baryonic disks are in hydrostatic equilibrium, we solved the Poisson-Boltzmann equation to estimate 3D density distribution. We used integral-field spectroscopic observations to estimate stellar velocity dispersion and built a 3D dynamical model using these density solutions and the observed rotation curve. We generated simulated surface brightness maps and compared them with observations to verify modeling consistency. The dynamical model was inclined to 90° to produce an edge-on surface density map, which we investigated by fitting different 2D functions and plotting vertical cuts in logarithmic scale. We estimated vertical stellar velocity dispersion using an iterative method, obtaining results consistent with the Disk Mass Survey formalism. Through dynamical modeling, we produced moment maps that reasonably matched observations. We examined the simulated edge-on model by taking vertical cuts and decomposing them into multiple Gaussian components. We find that artificial double Gaussian components arise due to line-of-sight integration effects, even for single-component disks. This indicates that decomposing vertical intensity cuts into multiple Gaussian components is unreliable for multicomponent disks. Instead, an up-bending break visible in logarithmic-scale vertical cuts serves as a more reliable indicator for two-component disks. We performed 2D fitting on the edge-on surface density map using the product of a scaled modified Bessel function and $sech^2$ function to estimate structural parameters. These traditional methods systematically underestimate the scale length and flattening ratio. Therefore, we suggest using detailed modeling to accurately deduce stellar disk structural parameters.

 - **Abstract**
 Dynamical interactions between stars and the super massive black hole Sgr A* at the Galactic Centre (GC) may eject stars into the Galactic halo. While recent fast ejections by Sgr A* have been identified in the form of hypervelocity stars (hundreds to thousands km/s), it is also expected that the stellar halo contains slower stars, ejected over the last few billion years. In this study, we use the first data release of DESI to search for these slower GC ejecta, which are expected to stand out from the stellar halo population for their combined high metallicity (${\rm [Fe/H]}\gtrsim0$) and small values of their vertical angular momentum ($L_Z$), whose distribution should peak at zero. Our search does not yield a detection, but allows us to place an upper limit on the ejection rate of stars from the GC of $\sim2.8\times10^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ over the past ~5 Gyr, which is ejection model independent. This implies that our result can be used to put constraints on different ejection models, including that invoking mergers of Sgr A* with other massive black holes in the last last few billion years.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first broad-band spectral and timing study of the Be/X-ray pulsar XTE J0111.2$-$7317 (SXP31.0) during its first major outburst since its discovery in 1998. This giant Type II outburst, observed in April-June 2025, marks the source's return to activity after nearly three decades of quiescence. Utilizing our NuSTAR observations together with Swift/XRT and SRG/ART-XC ones, we trace the evolution of the outburst to a peak bolometric luminosity of $L_{\rm bol} = 3.6 \times 10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$. The broadband spectra are well described by an absorbed cutoff power law, two blackbody components (hot and soft), and a narrow Fe K$\alpha$ line. No cyclotron absorption features are detected in either the phase-averaged or phase-resolved spectra in the 5-50 keV band. Most notably, we report the discovery of a previously undetected quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) at $0.8 \pm 0.1$ mHz, characterized by a fractional root-mean-square amplitude of 18% at a super-Eddington bolometric luminosity of $L_{\rm bol} = 2.5 \times 10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$. In contrast, the previously reported 1.27 Hz QPO is not detected. While the sub-mHz QPO is present, the pulsed fraction (PF) is low in soft X-rays, consistent with other super-Eddington pulsars exhibiting mHz QPOs, but rises above 20 keV reaching 35%. The QPO vanishes in subsequent observations coinciding with a sharp increase in the PF and a distinct change in pulse profile morphology. It is not observed in any follow-up observations at luminosities above or below its initial detection, suggesting it is a transient phenomenon.

 Increasing resolution and coverage of astrophysical and climate data necessitates increasingly sophisticated models, often pushing the limits of computational feasibility. While emulation methods can reduce calculation costs, the neural architectures typically used--optimised via gradient descent--are themselves computationally expensive to train, particularly in terms of data generation requirements. This paper investigates the utility of the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) as a lightweight, non-gradient-based machine learning algorithm for accelerating complex physical models. We evaluate ELM surrogate models in two test cases with different data structures: (i) sequentially-structured data, and (ii) image-structured data. For test case (i), where the number of samples $N$ >> the dimensionality of input data $d$, ELMs achieve remarkable efficiency, offering a 100,000$\times$ faster training time and a 40$\times$ faster prediction speed compared to a Bi-Directional Recurrent Neural Network (BIRNN), whilst improving upon BIRNN test performance. For test case (ii), characterised by $d >> N$ and image-based inputs, a single ELM was insufficient, but an ensemble of 50 individual ELM predictors achieves comparable accuracy to a benchmark Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), with a 16.4$\times$ reduction in training time, though costing a 6.9$\times$ increase in prediction time. We find different sample efficiency characteristics between the test cases: in test case (i) individual ELMs demonstrate superior sample efficiency, requiring only 0.28% of the training dataset compared to the benchmark BIRNN, while in test case (ii) the ensemble approach requires 78% of the data used by the CNN to achieve comparable results--representing a trade-off between sample efficiency and model complexity.

 - **Abstract**
 The existence of high galactic latitude molecular clouds has been known for several decades, and studies of their dust and gas distributions reveal complicated morphological structures. Their dynamics involve turbulence even in the absence of internal energy sources such as stars. We study in detail two such clouds, MBM 3 and MBM 16, trying to recover the geometric structure and topology of the gas distribution. In particular, we address the evidence of superthermal asymmetric atomic and molecular line profiles as a result of filament superposition combined with turbulent motions. We use a variety of spectroscopic and imaging archival observations of the gas and dust components. The spectroscopic data set comprises HI 21 cm, 12CO, 13CO, and CH line profiles. We also use archival infrared images to study the dust distribution and temperature. To understand the topology of MBM 3 and MBM 16 we compare molecular and atomic spectra, along with profile decomposition of the HI 21 cm line. Standard tools such as Structure Functions of velocity centroids are used to characterise the turbulence in MBM 3, and channel maps and position-velocity diagrams are employed for elucidating the filament topology of both clouds. The unusually large linewidths previously reported for MBM 3 are due to superposition of individual filaments whose superthermal linewidths are about 1 km/s. In MBM 16, the cloud appears to decompose into two adjacent structures with similar properties. The filaments have a high aspect ratio, with lengths of about 1 pc and widths of about 0.1 pc. In general, the molecular gas is embedded within more extended neutral hydrogen structures. Velocity gradients found within these structures are not necessarily dynamical, convergent flows. Projection effects and topology of the driving flows produce signatures that mimic velocity shears even if they are simply distortions of ordered gas.

 Millimeter (mm) emission from F - M dwarfs (cool stars) primarily traces chromospheric activity, with thermal emission thought to dominate in quiescence. Despite the high chromospheric activity, the quiescent mm spectral fluence (mm-S($\nu$)) of young (< 1 Gyr) M dwarfs (dMs) remain largely unexplored. We present the quiescent mm-S($\nu$) of a young dM, ADLeo, observed around 94 GHz using the Northern Extended Millimetre Array (NOEMA). The observed quiescent mm-S($\nu$) exceeds the thermal flux density from a 1D chromospheric model, constrained by optical-UV spectroscopic data, by up to a factor of 7. This indicates a quasi-steady non-thermal emission powered by supra-thermal electrons unlike in old (> 1 Gyr) cool stars, whose quiescent mm-S($\nu$) generally agree with 1D thermal models. The mm-brightness temperature spectral index ($\alpha_{mm}$; $T_B(\nu)\propto \nu^{- \alpha_{mm}}$) of AD Leo deviates by a factor of 3 from the $\alpha_{mm}$ - $T_{eff}$ scaling law for old sun-like stars (Mohan, A., et al., 2022), while UV Ceti, an older M6V star, follows the trend. Also, we report a double-hump flare with second-scale variability in flux density and spectral index, and a frequency-rising nature with brightness increasing with frequency. The flare resemble certain solar events, but is unlike the second-scale events reported in dMs. The non-thermal flare humps suggest multiple injections of accelerated electrons. The mean flare luminosity (2 - 5 $\times 10^{15} erg s^{-1} Hz^{-1}$) and duration ($18\pm 2$ s) are comparable to flares reported in AU Mic and Proxima Cen, but 100 - 1000 times weaker than the minutes-long dM flares observed by the South Pole Telescope.

 Building on previous developments of a harmonic decomposition framework for computing the three-point correlation function (3PCF) of projected scalar fields over the sky, this work investigates how much cosmological information is contained in these higher-order statistics. We perform a forecast to determine the number of harmonic multipoles required to capture the full information content of the 3PCF in the context of galaxy weak lensing, finding that only the first few multipoles are sufficient to capture the additional cosmological information provided by the 3PCF. This study addresses a critical practical question: to what extent can the high-dimensional 3PCF signal be compressed without significant loss of cosmological information? Since the different multipoles contain highly redundant information, we apply a principal component analysis (PCA) which further reduces its dimensionality and preserving information. We also account for non-linear parameter degeneracies using the DALI method, an extension of Fisher forecasting that includes higher-order likelihood information. Under optimistic settings, we find that the 3PCF improves considerably the constraining power of the 2PCF for the matter abundance $\Omega_m$ and fluctuations amplitude $\sigma_8$ by about 18% for galaxy maps at redshift $z=0.5$. However, for the amplitude $S_8$ and the equation of state parameter of dark energy, $w_0$, the improvements are very modest. Thanks to the harmonic basis and PCA, the method can be implemented with relatively low computational cost, providing a practical tool for current and future photometric surveys.

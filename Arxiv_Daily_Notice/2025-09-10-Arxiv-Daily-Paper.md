          What is the maximum radius of cold planets?

 - **Abstract**
 Planets have maximum radii close to that of Jupiter. Qualitatively, the reason for this maximum size is that, as one adds mass, the force of gravity becomes sufficiently strong to cause the radius to decrease. We show that this effect can be understood quantitatively using a simple variational principle very similar to that used to compute the size of the hydrogen atom.

 - **Abstract**
 The next generation of Extremely Large Telescopes (ELTs), with their wide apertures and advanced Multi-Conjugate Adaptive Optics (MCAO) systems, will provide unprecedented sharp and deep observations, even surpassing the capabilities of James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). SHARP, a near-infrared (0.95-2.45 {\mu}m) spectrograph, is designed to optimally exploit the collecting area and angular resolution of these forthcoming ELTs, and specifically optimized for the MCAO unit MORFEO at the ELT. SHARP includes two main units: NEXUS, a Multi-Object Spectrograph (MOS), and VESPER, a multi-Integral Field Unit. This paper outlines the opto-mechanical design of SHARP based on the scientific requirements of the project. The optical design is engineered to meet project specifications, featuring a compact mechanical structure that minimizes the required cryogenic power while ensuring ease of access for maintenance and straightforward assembly procedures.

 - **Abstract**
 The James Webb Space Telescope (\textit{JWST}) opened a new observational window on the primordial Universe. Here we present new JWST NIRSpec integral field spectroscopy (IFS) observations of the $z=7.54$ quasar ULAS J1342+0928 obtained as part of the Galaxy Assembly with NIRSpec IFS (GA-NIFS) GTO programme. The new data-set obtained with both the prism ($R\sim100$) and the high-resolution grating ($R\sim2700$) allow for a complete description of the quasar emission from the rest-frame UV to optical bands. The low-resolution data reveal the presence of [\ion{O}{iii}] emission on $\sim$7 kpc scales, well above the typical galaxy size at this redshift, likely associated with a past outflow event. Additionally, the high-resolution observations show a more energetic ionised outflow on nuclear scales ($\lesssim 0.6$ kpc). The total ionised mass outflow rate ranges between 50 and 300 $\rm M_{\odot} \, yr^{-1}$ where the significant spread is mostly due to the lack of tight constraints on the electron density. This range overlaps in part with the star formation rate range (85--545 $\rm M_{\odot} \, yr^{-1}$), implying that the nuclear outflow could ultimately lead to an early star formation quenching. By employing an accretion disc modelling, for the first time on \textit{JWST} data, we manage to robustly estimate the black hole mass and the bolometric luminosity, $\rm \log(M_{BH}/(M_{\odot}))=9.2\pm 0.2$ and $\rm \log(L_{bol}/(erg \, s^{-1}))=46.8\pm 0.1$, respectively. We derive an Eddington ratio of $\rm \lambda_{Edd}\sim 0.4$, challenging the paradigm of widespread super-Eddington accretion in quasars at the epoch of reionisation.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent imaging of supermassive black holes by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) has relied on exhaustive parameter-space searches, matching observations to large, precomputed libraries of theoretical models. As observational data become increasingly precise, the limitations of this computationally expensive approach grow more acute, creating a pressing need for more efficient methods. In this work, we present $\texttt{Jipole}$, an automatically differentiable (AD), $\texttt{ipole}$-based code for radiative transfer in curved spacetimes, designed to compute image gradients with respect to underlying model parameters. These gradients quantify how parameter changes-such as the black hole's spin or the observer's inclination-affect the image, enabling more efficient parameter estimation and reducing the number of required images. We validate $\texttt{Jipole}$ against $\texttt{ipole}$ in two analytical tests and then compare pixel-wise intensity derivatives from AD with those from finite-difference methods. We then demonstrate the utility of these gradients by performing parameter recovery for an analytical model using a conjugate gradient optimizer in three increasingly complex cases for the injected image: ideal, blurred, and blurred with added noise. In most cases, high-accuracy fits are obtained in only a few optimization steps, failing only in cases with extremely low signal-to-noise ratios and large blurring size kernels. These results highlight the potential of AD-based methods to accelerate robust, high-fidelity model-data comparisons in current and future black hole imaging efforts.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent findings from several Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) collaborations point to the existence of a Gravitational Wave Background (GWB) at nanohertz frequencies. A key next step towards characterizing this signal and identifying its origin is to map the sky distribution of its power. Several strategies have been proposed to reconstruct this distribution using PTA data. In this work, we compare these different strategies to determine which one is best suited to detect GWB anisotropies of different topologies. We find that, for both localized and large-scale anisotropies, reconstruction methods based on pixel and radiometer maps are the most promising. However, in both scenarios, even the optimistically large anisotropic signals discussed in this work remain challenging to detect with near-future PTA sensitivities. For example, we find that for a GWB hotspot contributing to $80\%$ of the GWB power in the second frequency bin, detection probabilities reach at most $\mathcal{O}(10\%)$ for a PTA with noise properties comparable with the ones of the upcoming IPTA third data release. Finally, we consider the fundamental limitations that cosmic variance poses to these kinds of searches by deriving the smallest deviations from isotropy that could be detected by an idealized PTA with no experimental or pulsar noise.

 - **Abstract**
 Supernovae that interact with hydrogen-poor, helium-rich circumstellar material (CSM), known as Type Ibn supernovae (SNe Ibn), present a unique opportunity to probe mass-loss processes in massive stars. In this work, we report the first radio detection of a SN Ibn, SN 2023fyq, and characterize the mass-loss history of its stellar progenitor using the radio and X-ray observations obtained over 18 months post-explosion. We find that the radio emission from 58--185 days is best modeled by synchrotron radiation attenuated by free-free absorption from a CSM of density $\sim$ $10^{-18}$ g/$\rm{cm^{3}}$ ($\sim 10^{6} \mathrm{\rho_{ISM}}$) at a radius of $10^{16}$ cm, corresponding to a mass-loss rate of $\sim$ $4 \times 10^{-3} \ \mathrm{M_{\odot} \ yr^{-1}}$ (for a wind velocity of 1700 km/s from optical spectroscopy) from 0.7 to 3 years before the explosion. This timescale is consistent with the time frame over which pre-explosion optical outbursts were observed. However, our late-time observations at 525 days post-explosion yield non-detections, and the 3$\sigma$ upper limits (along with an X-ray non-detection) allow us to infer lower-density CSM at $2\times 10^{16}$ cm with $\rm{\dot{M}}$ $< 2.5\times 10^{-3} \ \mathrm{M_{\odot} \ yr^{-1}}$. These results suggest a shell-like CSM from at most $4 \times 10^{15}$ to $2 \times 10^{16}$ cm ($\sim 10^{5} R_{\rm{\odot}}$) with an elevated CSM density (0.004 $\mathrm{M_{\odot} \ yr^{-1}}$) that is roughly consistent with predictions from a merger model for this object. Future radio observations of a larger sample of SNe Ibn will provide key details on the extent and density of their helium-rich CSM.

          Prestellar Cores in Turbulent Clouds: Observational Perspectives on Structure, Kinematics, and Lifetime

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze an ensemble of simulated prestellar cores to facilitate interpretation of structure, kinematics, and lifetime of observed cores. While our theory predicts a "characteristic" density for star formation, it also predicts that the individual critical density varies among cores; any observed sample thus contains cores at various evolutionary stages within a given density bin. By analyzing the remaining lifetime, we find cores undergoing quasi-equilibrium collapse evolve on a timescale of twice the freefall time throughout most of their life. Our analysis shows that the central column density and the associated full-width half maximum provide a reasonably accurate observational estimator of the central volume density, and therefore the freefall time; this does, however require resolving the central column density plateau. Observations with a finite beam size tend to underestimate densities of evolved cores, and this makes observed lifetimes appear to decrease more steeply than the apparent freefall time. We measure from our simulations the ratio of prestellar duration to envelope infall time, and find this is consistent with the observed relative number of prestellar cores and embedded protostars. Yet, the absolute core lifetime in our simulations is significantly shorter than would be expected from empirical measurements of the relative numbers of prestellar cores and Class II sources; we discuss several possible reasons for this discrepancy. Finally, our simulated cores have nearly constant line-of-sight velocity dispersion within the emitting region in the sky plane, resembling observed "coherent cores." We show that this "coherence" is a consequence of projection effects, which mask the intrinsic power-law velocity structure function. We discuss possible ways to estimate line-of-sight path lengths.

 - **Abstract**
 With pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) having observed a gravitational wave background (GWB) at nanohertz frequencies, the focus of the field is shifting towards determining and characterizing its origin. While the primary candidate is a population of GW-emitting supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs), many other cosmological processes could produce a GWB with similar spectral properties as have been measured. One key argument to help differentiate an SMBHB GWB from a cosmologically sourced one is its level of anisotropy; a GWB sourced by a finite population will likely exhibit greater anisotropy than a cosmological GWB through finite source effects (``shot noise'') and potentially large-scale structure. Current PTA GWB anisotropy detection methods often use the frequentist PTA optimal statistic for its fast estimation of pulsar pair correlations and relatively low computational overhead compared to spatially-correlated Bayesian analyses. However, there are critical limitations with the status quo approach. In this paper, we improve this technique by incorporating three recent advancements: accounting for covariance between pulsar pairwise estimates of correlated GWB power; the per-frequency optimal statistic to dissect the GWB across the spectrum; and constructing null-hypothesis statistical distributions that include cosmic variance. By combining these methods, our new pipeline can localize GWB anisotropies to specific frequencies, through which anisotropy detection prospects -- while impacted by cosmic variance -- are shown to improve in our simulations from a $p$-value of $\sim0.2$ in a broadband search to $\sim0.01$ in the per-frequency search. Our methods are already incorporated in community-available code and ready to deploy on forthcoming PTA datasets.

          HE2159-0551: a very metal-poor peculiar low Ba giant -- a candidate from the LMS-1/Wukong

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive spectroscopic and kinematic analysis of the very metal-poor ([Fe/H] = -2.60 $\pm$ 0.20 dex) giant star HE2159-0551. By investigating the star's chemodynamic characteristics, we seek to address its formation, evolution, and role in the chemical enrichment of the early cosmos and the possible connection to known merger events. From high-resolution data we perform a one dimension, local thermodynamic equilibrium analysis using PyMoogi. We conduct a detailed abundance analysis of 23 elements (C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, K, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Zn, Sr, Y, Zr, Ba, and Eu), allowing us to derive abundances or place limits. Finally, we compute orbital parameters to investigate the kinematics and thus the nucleosynthetic origin of HE2159-0551. The analysis yields significant insights into the chemical composition of HE2159-0551, highlighting its peculiarities among very metal-poor stars. The star shows signs of internal mixing and a peculiar abundance pattern, particular regarding the heavy elements. We find a low Ba abundance (s-process element) and a suppressed contamination of r-process elements, even though r-process enrichment may be expected in very metal-poor stars. The orbital parameters and kinematic properties indicate that HE2159-0551 is a thick disc star, connected to the old and metal-poor LMS-1/Wukong progenitor resulting from an early merger. Our kinematic analysis suggests a potential connection of HE2159-0551 to the merger LMS-1/Wukong. We conclude that the nucleosynthesis processes responsible for the star's enrichment in heavy elements are different from those observed in many other metal-poor stars as neither the main r- nor s-process can explain the derived abundance pattern. A possible weak-r or $\nu$p-process forming Sr-Zr but not Ba might have mixed into a low level of underlying r-process material in the low-mass LMS-1/Wukong system.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding how shocks interact with coronal structures is crucial for understanding the mechanisms of particle acceleration in the solar corona and inner heliosphere. Using simultaneous radio and white-light observations, we investigate the interaction between a CME-driven shock and a plasmoid. LASCO and STEREO-A COR-2 white-light images are analyzed to track the evolution of the plasmoid, CME and its associated shock, while the Wind/WAVES and STEREO/WAVES dynamic spectra provide complementary radio signatures of the shock-plasmoid interaction at $\approx$7 R$_\odot$. An interplanetary Type II radio burst was detected as the shock propagated through the plasmoid. The merging of the plasmoid into the CME was accompanied by interplanetary Type III radio bursts, suggesting escaping electron beams during the reconnection process. These observations clearly demonstrate that shock-plasmoid interactions can enhance the efficiency of particle acceleration associated with CMEs, with implications for electron acceleration in flare and heliospheric current sheets as well.

 - **Abstract**
 When directly imaging a cold giant exoplanet hosting a ring system, the reflected light from the rings can outshine the planet's thermal emission and reflected-light in the near-infrared. Consequently, an exoring may be detectable at a significantly lower contrasts than is required to image the exoplanet itself. Here we investigate the detectability of exorings in near-infrared reflected light using NIRCam coronagraphy PanCAKE simulations of two nearby mature stars, Proxima Centauri and Tau Ceti. Under the most favorable assumptions, we find JWST 2$\mu$m NIRCam coronagraphy (F200W + MASK335R) is capable of detecting an exoring system with a radius of 2.8 times that of Saturn's A-ring for planets on an orbit with a = 1.3-1.9 AU. Broader simulations indicate that NIRCam can probe large planetary ring systems around mature exoplanets comparable in size to circumplanetary disks, which can reach up to 1000 times the radius of Saturn's A-ring. These results suggest that NIRCam F200W coronagraphy could serendipitously detect large exorings in reflected light under the right conditions. A combined analysis of F200W coronagraphic observations of confirmed exoplanets could provide the first empirical constraints on the occurrence rate of large exorings. Confirming the existence and frequency of exorings spanning the scale between circumplanetary disks and the rings of the Solar System giant planet could offer new insight into the formation, evolution, and architecture of planetary systems.

 - **Abstract**
 The most common instrument used by the exoplanet/brown dwarf direct imaging community at the W.M. Keck Observatory is currently the NIRC2 near-infrared imager. We performed on-sky testing to investigate three effects which may be limiting the performance of NIRC2 when conducting high-contrast imaging observations from $3-5\mu$m. First, we report the measurements of an on-sky test of the throughput of the L/M vector vortex coronagraph. We quantify the throughput and additional background flux penalties, noting that the performance effects of using the vector vortex coronagraph in the Ms-filter are greater than in the Lp-filter. Second, we utilize the recently commissioned NIRC2 electronics upgrade to measure the sky variability at sub-second speeds. We find that the background varies at timescales of less than 30s, indicating that the electronics upgrade may open an opportunity to improve the sky-background subtraction of future surveys. Third, we document the contribution of the image derotator to the spatial non-uniformity in the background flux. We conclude by giving a set of recommendations of how the Keck-NIRC2 high-contrast imaging community can adapt their observing strategies to improve the sensitivity of future surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 The launch of the \textit{Einstein Probe} unleashed a new era of high-energy transient discovery in the largely unexplored soft X-ray band. The \textit{Einstein Probe} has detected a significant number of fast X-ray transients that display no gamma-ray emission, complicating their robust association to more common gamma-ray bursts. To explore their possible connection, we analyzed the redshift distribution of both \textit{Einstein Probe} fast X-ray transients and long duration gamma-ray bursts. A comparative analysis of their cumulative redshift distributions using non-parametric two-sample tests, namely the Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Anderson-Darling tests, finds no statistically significant difference. These tests favor that their redshifts are drawn from the same underlying distribution. This empirical connection between \textit{Einstein Probe} transients and long gamma-ray bursts is further supported by their agreement with the so-called ``Amati relation'' between the spectral peak energy and the isotropic-equivalent energy. Together, these results indicate that most extragalactic \textit{Einstein Probe} fast X-ray transients are closely related to long gamma-ray bursts and originate from a massive star (collapsar) progenitor channel. Our findings highlight the role of the \textit{Einstein Probe} in uncovering the missing population of failed jets and dirty fireballs that emit primarily at soft X-ray wavelengths.

 - **Abstract**
 CLEAN is a well-established deconvolution approach to Fourier imaging at both radio wavelwengths and hard X-ray energies. However, specifically for hard X-ray imaging, CLEAN suffers two significant drawbacks: a rather limited degree of automation, and a tendency to under-resolution. This paper introduces a multi-scale version of CLEAN specifically tailored to the reconstruction of images from measurements observed by the Spectrometer/Telescope for Imaging X-rays (STIX) on-board Solar Orbiter. Using synthetic STIX data, this study shows that multi-scale CLEAN may represent a reliable solution to the two previously mentioned CLEAN limitations. Further, this paper shows the performances of CLEAN and its multi-scale release in reconstructing experimental real scenarios characterized by complex emission morphologies.

 - **Abstract**
 The coming years of gravitational wave astrophysics promises thousands of new detections, which can unlock fundamental scientific insights if the information in each observation can be properly synthesized into a coherent picture. State-of-the-art approaches often accomplish this with hierarchical Bayesian inference. However, this typically relies on Monte Carlo approximations that are already very expensive in current data, and may become prohibitively so in the future. In this paper we show how this process can be understood from a first-principles statistical approach. We derive an error estimator $\hat{E}$ for quantifying the amount of information that is lost due to the Monte Carlo approximation and recommend that this error is limited to no more than $\hat{E} \lesssim 0.2$ bits for reliable inference. We also show that the hierarchical likelihood estimator is biased but may be corrected. Finally, we show some practical examples for inference on synthetic gravitational-wave population inference, demonstrating that simple models with strong assumptions can be much more stable to Monte Carlo uncertainty than those with weaker assumptions. We also provide a \texttt{pip}-installable package \texttt{population-error} with which analysts can calculate the error statistics $\hat{E}$.

 - **Abstract**
 Numerical calculations of planetary system formation are very demanding in terms of computing power. These synthetic planetary systems can however provide access to correlations, as predicted in a given numerical framework, between the properties of planets in the same system. Such correlations can, in return, be used in order to guide and prioritize observational campaigns aiming at discovering some types of planets, as Earth-like planets. Our goal is to develop a generative model which is capable of capturing correlations and statistical relationships between planets in the same system. Such a model, trained on the Bern model, offers the possibility to generate large number of synthetic planetary systems with little computational cost, that can be used, for example, to guide observational campaigns. Our generative model is based on the transformer architecture which is well-known to efficiently capture correlations in sequences and is at the basis of all modern Large Language Models. To assess the validity of the generative model, we perform visual and statistical comparisons, as well as a machine learning driven tests. Finally, as a use case example, we consider the TOI-469 system, in which we aim at predicting the possible properties of planets c and d, based on the properties of planet b (the first that has been detected). We show using different comparison methods that the properties of systems generated by our model are very similar to the ones of the systems computed directly by the Bern model. We also show in the case of the TOI-469 system, that using the generative model allows to predict the properties of planets not yet observed, based on the properties of the already observed planet. We provide our model to the community on our website this http URL.

 - **Abstract**
 High-Mass X-ray Binaries (HMXBs) serve as useful laboratories for exploring the behaviour of accreted matter onto compact objects and for probing the complex wind environments of massive stars. These investigations are essential for understanding stellar life cycles and the dynamics of the Milky Way, and they are prominent topics in the science cases for XRISM and NewAthena. We report, for the first time, a XRISM observation of the HMXB Vela X-1, conducted during the first cycle of the XRISM general observer programme and complemented by simultaneous XMM-Newton and NuSTAR coverage. This campaign targeted a critical orbital phase -- when the neutron star is in inferior conjunction -- during which significant changes in absorption are expected. We performed absorption-resolved spectral analyses during two time intervals of interest: the soft and hard hardness ratio (HR) intervals, as it is strongly correlated with absorption variability. We observed a sudden transition in the HR from a soft to a hard state, coinciding with an increase in the absorption column density. This is likely attributed to the onset of the accretion structure crossing our line of sight. With XRISM/Resolve, we also investigated the Fe K region, and we report for the first time the presence of a Fe K$\alpha$ doublet in the spectrum of Vela X-1, together with the presence of already known Fe K$\beta$ and Ni K$\alpha$ lines that are produced in cold clumps embedded in the hot ionised wind. The measured line velocities of the order of $10^2 \ \mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$ are consistent with production sites in the vicinity of the neutron star. This precursor study with Vela X-1 shows the potential of XRISM in studying in unprecedented details the spectral evolution of wind-accreting X-ray binaries.

          Probing the Cosmological Principle with CMB lensing and cosmic shear

 - **Abstract**
 The standard cosmological model assumes the Cosmological Principle. However, recent observations hint at possible violations of isotropy on large scales, possibly through late-time anisotropic expansion. Here we investigate the potential of cross-correlations between CMB lensing convergence $\kappa$ and galaxy cosmic shear $B$-modes as a novel probe of such late-time anisotropies. Our signal-to-noise forecasts reveal that information from the $\kappa$-$B$ cross-correlation is primarily contained on large angular scales ($\ell \lesssim 200$). We find that this cross-correlation for a Euclid-like galaxy survey is sensitive to anisotropy at the percent level. Making use of tomography yields a modest improvement of $\sim 20\%$ in detection power. Incorporating the galaxy $E$-$B$ cross-correlations would further enhance these constraints.

 - **Abstract**
 Dual-phase xenon time projection chambers achieve optimal sensitivity for dark matter in the $10$--$1000~\mathrm{GeV}/c^2$ mass range, but sub-GeV dark matter particles lack sufficient energy to produce nuclear recoils above detection thresholds in these detectors. Blazar-boosted dark matter offers a way to overcome this limitation: relativistic jets in active galactic nuclei can accelerate light dark matter in their host-galaxy halos to energies capable of producing detectable nuclear recoil signals in xenon-based detectors on Earth. We present the first blazar-boosted dark matter search incorporating detector response modeling, using public data from XENON1T and LZ for the blazar TXS~0506+056. We model dark matter--proton scattering in the jet environment, covering the full process from jet acceleration to detector response. We explore how the host-galaxy dark matter density profile impacts our analysis. Using XENON1T data, we exclude dark matter--nucleon cross sections for $m_\chi \sim 1~\mathrm{MeV}$ in the range $5.8\times 10^{-31}~\mathrm{cm^2} \lesssim \sigma_{\chi n} \lesssim 6.3\times 10^{-29}~\mathrm{cm^2}$, and using LZ EFT searches we constrain $9.9\times 10^{-32}~\mathrm{cm^2} \lesssim \sigma_{\chi n} \lesssim 2.5\times 10^{-28}~\mathrm{cm^2}$. Our results show that astrophysical uncertainties, especially the dark matter density profile near the supermassive black hole, set the primary limitation on the sensitivity rather than detector systematics. These findings highlight blazar-boosted dark matter as a promising probe of light dark matter and motivate further astrophysical modeling.

 - **Abstract**
 Will future direct imaging missions such as NASA's upcoming Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) be able to understand Earth-sized planets as a population? In this study, we simulate the ability of space-based coronagraphy missions to uncover trends in planetary albedo as a function of instellation, and potentially constrain the boundaries of the habitable zone. We adapt the Bioverse statistical comparative planetology framework to simulate the scientific output of possible designs for HWO. With this tool, we generate a synthetic planetary population with injected population-level trends in albedo and simulate the observability of planets. We then determine the statistical power to which these trends can be recovered as a function of the strength of the injected trend and the sample size of Earth-sized planets in the habitable zone (exoEarths). The strongest trends in albedo require a sample size of roughly 25-30 exoEarths to recover with high confidence. However, for weaker albedo trends, the required number of planets increases rapidly. If a mission is designed to meet the Decadal Survey's requirement of 25 exoEarths, it would be able to recover very strong trends in albedo associated with the habitable zone, but would struggle to confidently detect weaker trends. We explore multiple strategies to increase one's ability to recover weak trends, such as reducing the uncertainties in observables, incorporating additional observables such as planet colors, and obtaining direct constraints on planetary albedo from full spectral retrievals.

 - **Abstract**
 The Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will provide a windfall of new transients and variable sources. Here we have performed mock observation simulations to understand LSST's expected detection rates for cataclysmic variables (CVs) with known large amplitude variations. Under the thin-disk approximation for the distribution of CVs in our Galaxy, we found that only 20% of WZ Sge-type dwarf novae systems, representing the most energetic disk-driven outbursts in CVs, will be detected during outbursts by the LSST. Given their large amplitude (7-9 mag), {only those} brighter than $17.5$ mag at outburst maximum are expected to have an r-band quiescence counterpart in individual scans. Thanks to the planned cadence of the LSST towards the Galactic center, ~70% of the simulated outbursts will be detected twice or more on the discovery night, and two-thirds will be observed in different bands. CVs of the Polar class, which display luminosity changes up to 4 mag, can be unbiasedly recovered to 22.5 mag with more than 100 detections over 10 years of the LSST operation. Finally, we attempt to characterize the detection rate of micronovae bursts, and find that about 2.6%} of the simulated sample will be observed as a >= 0.4 mag-amplitude and <= 1-d duration spike in the long-term light curve. Overall, our results consolidate LSST's capability to studying time-domain phenomena in CVs, and inform on how to plan and organize follow-up observation strategies on transients discovered by LSST.

 - **Abstract**
 The sources of turbulence in our Galaxy may be diverse, but core-collapse supernovae (SNe) alone provide enough energy to sustain a steady-state galactic turbulence cascade. By localizing and analyzing supernova remnants (SNRs) in high-resolution SNe-driven galactic disk cut-out simulations from Beattie et al. (2025), I show that SNRs radiate incompressible turbulence through baroclinic vorticity generation, localized at the interface where the hot and warm plasma phases mix near the cooling radius. I provide evidence that this process is seeded by a Vishniac (1994)-type instability, which corrugates and folds the interface. I present an analytical relation for a baroclinicity-fed incompressible mode spectrum, which matches that observed in the simulated SNRs. The unstable layer produces a spectrum of incompressible modes $\propto k^{-3/2}$ locally within the SNRs. Through the inverse cascade mechanism described and measured in Beattie et al. (2025), this opens the possibility that the $\propto k^{-3/2}$ spectrum, arising from corrugated folds in the unstable SNR layer, can imprint itself on kiloparsec scales, thereby connecting small-scale instabilities in the layer to the large-scale incompressible turbulence cascade.

 - **Abstract**
 One of the primary mission goals of the Kepler space telescope is to detect Earth-like terrestrial planets in the habitable zone around Sun-like stars. Unfortunately, such planets are at the detection limit. Estimating their statistical significance via false alarm probability (FAP) is crucial for their validation, and has a large impact on the estimate of their occurrence rate, which is of central importance for future spectroscopic missions searching for life signatures. Current methods estimate FAP by light curve inverting or scrambling, but we show that both of these approaches are unsatisfactory. Here we propose to modify the planet transit template by randomly shifting the transit times by small amounts. We show that the exoplanet search with the resulting Null Signal Template (NST) has the same statistical properties as with the true periodic template, which enables assigning a reliable star-specific FAP to every candidate. We show on simulations and on the real data that the method is robust to unmodeled noise contamination. We reevaluate the statistical significance of all 47 previously proposed habitable Earth-like and super Earth Kepler candidates and assign them star-specific NST based FAP. We identify 29 candidates with FAP below 1%, 7 of whom are currently not considered confirmed. Among these are Kepler 452b with radius $1.5 R{\oplus}$, a period of 384 days, and KOI 2194.03 with radius $1.8 R{\oplus}$ and a period of 445 days, both around Sun-like G stars. Several well-known candidates should be considered marginal or likely false alarms, including Kepler 186f with 20% FAP.

 - **Abstract**
 Diffuse $\gamma$-ray emission is a key probe of cosmic rays (CRs) distribution within the Galaxy. However, the discrepancies between observations and theoretical model expectations highlight the need for refined uncertainty estimates. In the literature, spatial and temporal variability of lepton flux has been discussed as an uncertainty in diffuse $\gamma$-ray estimation. In the present work, we demonstrate that variability in the high energy CR hadron flux is an important, yet previously underappreciated, source of uncertainty in diffuse $\gamma$-ray estimates. To assess this effect, we perform fully three-dimensional, time-dependent GALPROP simulations of CR protons injected from discrete Galactic sources. Our results reveal that the uncertainty in the hadronic component of diffuse $\gamma$ rays is non-negligible and can be comparable to, or even exceed, current experimental uncertainties at very high energies. This finding challenges the conventional assumption that only leptonic fluctuations are relevant to diffuse $\gamma$-ray modeling.

 - **Abstract**
 Optical transient surveys continue to generate increasingly large datasets, prompting the introduction of machine-learning algorithms to search for quality transient candidates efficiently. Existing machine-learning infrastructure can be leveraged in novel ways to search these datasets for new classes of transients. We present a machine-learning accelerated search pipeline for the Deeper, Wider, Faster (DWF) programme designed to identify high-quality astrophysical transient candidates that contain a single detection. Given the rapid observing cadence of the DWF programme, these single-detection transient candidates have durations on sub-minute timescales. This work marks the first time optical transients have been systematically explored on these timescales, to a depth of m$\sim$23. We report the discovery of two high-quality sub-minute transient candidates from a pilot study of 671,761 light curves and investigate their potential origins with multiwavelength data. We discuss, in detail, possible non-astrophysical false positives, confidently reject electronic artefacts and asteroids, ruling out glints from satellites below 800 km and strongly disfavouring those at higher altitudes. We calculate a rate on the sky of $4.72^{+6.39}_{-3.28}\times10^5$ per day for these sub-minute transient candidates.

 - **Abstract**
 While C IV is the most common absorption line in Broad Absorption Line Quasar spectra, Balmer absorption lines are among the rarest. We present analysis of Balmer absorption in a sample of fourteen iron low-ionization BAL quasars (FeLoBALQs); eight are new identifications. We measured velocity offset, width, and apparent optical depth. The partial covering ubiquitous in BAL quasar spectra alters the measured Balmer optical depth ratios; taking that into account, we estimated the true H(n= 2) column density. We found the anticipated correlation between Eddington ratio and outflow speed, but it is weak in this sample because nearly all of the objects have the low outflow speeds characterizing loitering outflow FeLoBAL quasars (H. Choi et al. 2022b), objects that are also found to have low accretion rates (K. M. Leighly et al. 2022; H. Choi et al. 2022a). Measures of dN/dv, the differential column density with respect to the outflow speed, are anticorrelated with the luminosity and Eddington ratio: the strongest absorption is observed at the lowest speeds in the lowest luminosity objects. The absorption line width is correlated with {\alpha}oi, the F{\lambda} point-to-point slope between 5100A and 3 microns. This parameter is strongly correlated with the Eddington ratio among low-redshift quasars (K. M. Leighly et al. 2024). Balmer absorption lines have been recently found in the spectra of Little Red Dots (LRDs), a class of high-redshift objects discovered by JWST. We note suggestive similarities between LRDs and FeLoBAL quasars in the emission line shape, the presence of steep reddening and a scattered blue continuum, the lack of hot dust emission, and X-ray weakness.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive 3D dust reddening map covering the entire Milky Way, constructed by combining reddening estimates based on LAMOST low-resolution spectra (E(B$-$V)$_{\rm LAMOST}$) with those derived from $Gaia$ XP spectra (E(B$-$V)$_{\rm XP}$), along with revised $Gaia$ distances. E(B$-$V)$_{\rm LAMOST}$ values of $\sim$ 4.6 million unique sources were obtained with the standard-pair analysis using LAMOST DR11 stellar parameters and synthesized $B/V$-band photometry from $Gaia$ XP spectra, showing a typical precision of $\sim$ 0.01 mag. The E(B$-$V)$_{\rm XP}$ from the catalog of \citet{zhang2023}, which was derived using forward modeling of $Gaia$ XP spectra, were cross-validated with E(B$-$V)$_{\rm LAMOST}$, leading to the selection of $\sim$ 150 million high-reliability measurements. The combined dataset achieves a median precision of $\sim$ 0.03 mag for E(B$-$V). To model the reddening -- distance relationship along various lines-of-sight, we implemented a parametric approach that accounts for contributions from the local bubble, diffuse interstellar-medium, and multiple potential molecular clouds. The sky was adaptively partitioned based on stellar density, resulting in angular resolutions ranging from 3.4$^{\prime}$ to 58$^{\prime}$, with about half of the sky having a resolution better than 6.9$^{\prime}$. The reddening precision of our 3D map for individual stars reaches $\sim$ 0.01 mag in most regions at $|b| > 20^\circ$, but degrades to 0.01-0.05 mag at $|b| < 20^\circ$. The map reaches a maximum distance of 3-5 kpc in high-extinction regions with $|b| < 5^\circ$, and extends to 10-15 kpc elsewhere. An interactive platform and Python package have been developed for utilization of the 3D dust map. Available online: this https URL.

 - **Abstract**
 The characterization of exoplanet atmospheres is one of the key topics in modern astrophysics. To date, transmission spectroscopy has been the primary method used, but upcoming instruments will lay the foundation for advancing reflected-light spectroscopy. The main challenge in this area of research is the high contrast ratio between the planet and its star. RISTRETTO, a high-resolution integral-field spectrograph designed for ESO's VLT, aims to address these limitations through a combination of extreme AO, coronagraphy, and high-resolution spectroscopy. The goal of this paper is to demonstrate the detectability of the temperate rocky planet Proxima b with RISTRETTO, using realistic end-to-end simulations and a specifically developed data analysis methodology. We created high-resolution star and planet spectra, selecting realistic observational epochs and incorporating the predicted performance of the AO and coronagraphic systems. We implemented noise and spectrograph effects through the Pyechelle spectrograph simulator. We then applied a new methodology to isolate the signal of the planet from the stellar one and proceeded to fit several planetary models in order of increasing complexity. We also introduced a method to determine the sky orientation of the stellar spin axis, which constrains the orientation of the planetary orbit for aligned systems. Assuming an Earth-like atmosphere, our results show that RISTRETTO can detect Proxima b in reflected light in about 55 hours of observing time, offering the ability to characterize the planet orbital inclination, true mass, and broadband albedo. In addition, molecular absorption by O$_2$ and H$_2$O can be detected in about 85 hours of observations. These findings highlight the potential of RISTRETTO to significantly advance the field of exoplanetary science by enabling reflected-light spectroscopy of a sample of nearby exoplanets.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the distribution and properties of molecular clouds is crucial for tracing the structure and evolution of the interstellar medium and the large-scale morphology of the Milky Way. Here we present an all-sky catalog of 3,345 molecular clouds identified from our previous three-dimensional dust reddening map using a dendrogram-based clustering method with distance-adaptive parameters. The catalog spans heliocentric distances from 90 pc to 4.3 kpc and includes key physical properties for each cloud, including position, size, mass, surface density, and dust density. Approximately 650 clouds in our catalog are associated with the boundary of the Local Bubble, while around 740 clouds (excluding those associated with the Local Bubble) are located at high Galactic latitudes ($|b| > 20^\circ$). The spatial distribution of the cataloged clouds reveals prominent large-scale features in the Galactic disk, including coherent spur-like structures, large-scale cavities, and a more detailed view of the Local Bubble shell. These findings refine our understanding of how molecular clouds trace the Galactic spiral arm network and provide new insight into the spatial structure of the Local Bubble. The catalog serves as a valuable resource for future studies of star formation, Galactic structure, and the interaction between molecular clouds and large-scale ISM features.

 - **Abstract**
 3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object discovered to date, following 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Its unusually high excess velocity and active cometary nature make it a key probe of the Galactic population of icy planetesimals. Understanding its origin requires tracing its past trajectory through the Galaxy and assessing the possible role of stellar encounters, both as a potential origin and a perturber to its orbit. We integrated the orbit of 3I/ATLAS backward in time for 10 Myr, together with a sample of Gaia DR3 stars with high-quality astrometry and radial velocities, to identify close passages within 2 pc. We identify 93 nominal encounters, 62 of which are significant at the $2\sigma$ level. However, none of these encounters produced any meaningful perturbation. The strongest perturber Gaia DR3 6863591389529611264 at 0.30 pc and with a relative velocity of 35 km s$^{-1}$, imparted only a velocity change of $|\Delta v| \simeq 5\times10^{-4}$ km s$^{-1}$ to the orbit of 3I/ATLAS. Our results indicate that no stellar flybys within the past 10 Myr and 500 pc contained in Gaia DR3 can account for the present trajectory of 3I/ATLAS or be associated with its origin. We further show that 3I/ATLAS is kinematically consistent with a thin-disk population, despite its large peculiar velocity.

 - **Abstract**
 Light curves of young stars exhibit photometric variability over hours to decades and across a wide range of amplitudes. On time scales beyond a few rotation periods, these light curves are typically stochastic. The variability arises from a combination of accretion rate changes, line-of-sight extinction variations, and evolving spotted stellar surfaces. We aim to develop a methodology to quantitatively compare the full variability statistics of these inhomogeneously sampled light curves with model calculations. To achieve this, we converted the light curves into variability fingerprints. They map the probability of variation by a given amount over a given timescale. Applying principal component analysis to these fingerprints produces a stable distribution of the first two principal components. We show that this distribution is a continuum without clusters. Adding a model-generated fingerprint to an observational sample does not significantly alter the distribution of the sample, allowing a robust comparison between the model and observed light curves to assess statistical realism. We show that photometric uncertainties, timing, and observing cadence have a minimal impact on model placement within the observational distribution. The main source of variance among highly variable light curves of young stars is the timescale of the onset of significant variability (above 0.3mag), with 1-3month timescales being the most critical. The secondary cause of variance are long-term (above 1.5yr) dimming or rising trends.

 - **Abstract**
 Based on the updated M giant star catalog selected from LAMOST DR9, we iden-tify substructures within the integrals-of-motion space through Friends-of-Friends cluster-ing algorithm. We obtain members belonging to several known substructures: the Sagittarius stream, Galactic Anticenter Substructure (GASS), Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage (GES), Splash, and the high-{\alpha} disk. Furthermore, we also identify two groups which cannot be clearly asso-ciated with previously known substructures. Our findings confirm the existence of metal-rich constituents within the GES, representing newly formed stars that originated from the metal-enriched gas delivered during the GES merger event and subsequently evolved. Additionally, this study further expands the sample of GASS, high-{\alpha} disk, and Splash stars. Analysis of these metal-rich M giant stars as members of the GES, Splash, and high-{\alpha} disk compo-nents supports an evolution scenario for the early Milky Way, as proposed by previous stud-ies. In this scenario, stars initially formed in a high-{\alpha} primordial disk were dynamically heated by the massive accretion event (GES). This process redistributed stellar orbits, creat-ing the Splash population, while the undisturbed portion of the primordial disk persisted as the present-day high-{\alpha} disk component.

 We investigate how simultaneous mass and radius measurements of massive neutron stars (NSs) can help constrain properties of dark matter (DM) possibly admixed in them. Within a fermionic DM model that interacts only through gravitation, along with a well-constrained nuclear matter equation of state, we show that the simultaneous mass and radius measurement of PSRJ0740+6620 reduces the uncertainty of DM central energy density by more than 50\% compared to the results obtained from using the two observables independently, while other DM parameters remain unconstrained. Additionally, we find that the DM fraction $f_D$ should be smaller than 2\% when constrained by the observed NS maximum mass alone, and it could be even smaller than 0.3\% with the simultaneous measurement of mass and radius, supporting the conclusion that only a small amount of DM exists in DM admixed neutron stars (DANS).

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS at 3.8 au show an elongated coma similar to a cometary tail but pointing in the direction of the Sun. This type of anti-tail, not a result of perspective, may not have been previously observed. We explain the anti-tail as an anisotropic extension of the snow line, or survival radius of a sublimating ice grain, in the direction of the Sun. The anisotropy is due to the difference in the sublimation mass flux in the solar and perpendicular directions caused by the change in the illumination angle of the cometary surface. The stronger sublimation mass flux in the solar direction results in ice grains with larger sizes, longer sublimation lifetimes, and a snow line at a larger radial distance with respect to other directions. The observed radial surface brightness profiles as a function of illumination angle are well reproduced by a Haser-type spherical outflow with constant velocity and sublimating ice grains with angularly dependent survival lengths.

 - **Abstract**
 The nature of dark matter remains unknown, motivating the study of fuzzy/wave dark matter (FDM/$\psi$DM) and self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) as alternative frameworks to address small-scale discrepancies in halo profiles inferred from observations. This study presents a non-parametric reconstruction of the mass distribution of the previously-found, dark subhalo in the strong-lensing system JVAS B1938+666. Compared with the standard Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile, both SIDM and $\psi$DM ($m_{\psi}=1.32^{+0.22}_{-0.31}\times 10^{-22} \, \rm eV$) provide significantly better fits to the resulting density profile. Moreover, the SIDM model is favored over $\psi$DM with a Bayes factor of 14.44. The reconstructed density profile features a characteristic kiloparsec-scale core ($r_c \approx 0.5 \, \rm kpc$) with central density $\rho_c \approx 2.5\times 10^{7}\, \rm M_{\odot} \, kpc^{-3} $, exhibiting remarkable consistency with the core-halo mass scaling relations observed in Local Group dwarf spheroidals. These findings offer insights that may help address the core-cusp discrepancy in $\Lambda$CDM substructure predictions.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we revisit and evaluate new source terms which contribute to the induced gravitational wave background. We study their respective contributions to the stochastic gravitational wave background by computing their spectral densities in a radiation-dominated universe. These terms appear at third order in cosmological perturbation theory, however, their correlations with primordial gravitational waves are non-trivial and appear at the same order as so-called scalar induced and scalar-tensor induced gravitational waves. We find that these gravitational wave sources suppress the spectral density at the scales we consider. Furthermore, similarly to scalar-tensor source terms at second order, we find that some terms are enhanced when the input primordial power spectrum of scalar fluctuations is not sufficiently peaked. Hence, where possible, we show that under certain limits the integrands of these terms diverge in the UV sector.

 - **Abstract**
 The TOI-178 system hosts six planets with five of them locked in a :4:6:9:12 Laplace resonance chain. We perform N-body simulations to investigate the dynamics of test particles in this system. We observe that co-orbital regions around each planet are approximately 30\% wider than predicted by classical theory for planets in the resonance chain, while TOI-178b, which lies outside the chain, shows a 52\% enhancement. The region between TOI-178e and TOI-178f reveals Kirkwood gap-like structures created by mean-motion resonances with TOI-178f (4:3, 5:4, 6:5) and TOI-178g (5:3), where particle clearing occurs on 500-year timescales. An extended integration of the innermost region (0.015-0.025 au) shows periodic inclination oscillations with period 196 years, coincident with TOI-178b's own oscillation period, with maximum amplitude occurring near the 3:2 resonance location. These structures are consistent with the system's resonant architecture and provide a baseline characterization that enables future comparative studies of similar phenomena in other multi-planet systems with resonant configurations.

 - **Abstract**
 The observed architecture and modeled evolution of close-in exoplanets provide crucial insights into their formation pathways and survival mechanisms. To investigate these fundamental questions, we employed JADE, a comprehensive numerical code that models the coupled evolution of atmospheres and dynamics over secular timescales, rooted in present-day observations. JADE integrates photoevaporation with migration driven by von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai (ZLK) cycles from an external perturber, allowing us to explore evolutionary scenarios where dynamical and atmospheric processes influence each other. Here, we specifically considered GJ 436 b, a warm Neptune with an eccentric orbit and polar spin-orbit angle that has survived within the "hot Neptune desert" despite ongoing atmospheric escape. Our extensive exploration included over 500 000 simulations in a framework that combines precomputed grids with Bayesian inference. This allowed us to constrain GJ 436 b's initial conditions and the properties of its putative companion within a ZLK hypothesis. Our results suggest that GJ 436 b formed at ~ 0.3 AU and, despite its current substantial atmospheric erosion, has experienced minimal cumulative mass loss throughout its history, thanks to a late inward migration triggered by a distant companion inducing ZLK oscillations. We find that initial mutual inclinations of 80° - 100° with this companion best reproduce the observed polar orbit. By combining our explored constraints with radial velocity detection limits, we identified the viable parameter space for the hypothetical GJ 436 c. We found that it strongly disfavors stellar and brown dwarf masses, which offers a useful guide for future observational searches. This work demonstrates how coupled modeling can shed light on the interplay shaping close-in exoplanets and explain the survival of volatile-rich worlds near the edges of the desert.

          Towards an application of fourth-order shear statistics I. The information content of $\langle M_\mathrm{ap}^4 \rangle $

 - **Abstract**
 Higher-order shear statistics contain part of the non-Gaussian information of the projected matter field and therefore can provide additional constraints on the cosmological parameters when combined with second-order statistics. We aim to provide the theoretical framework for studying shear four-point correlation functions (4PCF) using fourth-order aperture statistics and develop a numerical integration pipeline to compute them. Finally, we forecast the information content of fourth-order aperture statistics. We begin by giving the relation of the $n$-th order aperture statistics, $\langle M_\mathrm{ap}^n\rangle$, to the shear $n$PCF and to the convergence polyspectra. We then focus on the fourth-order case, where we derive the functional form of their filters and test the behavior of these filters by numerically integrating over the 4PCF of a Gaussian random shear field (GRF). Finally, we perform a Fisher forecast on the constraining power of $\langle M_\mathrm{ap}^4\rangle_\rm{c}$, where we develop a novel method to estimate derivatives from a simulation suite with arbitrarily distributed cosmological sets. By analyzing and mitigating numerical effects within the integration pipeline, we achieve a two-percent-level precision on the fourth-order aperture statistics for a GRF, which remains well below the noise budget of Stage IV surveys. We report a minimal improvement in the constraining power of the aperture statistics when including fourth-order statistics to a $\langle M_\mathrm{ap}^2\rangle + \langle M_\mathrm{ap}^3\rangle$ joint analysis for a DES-Y3-like setup, using non-tomographic equal-scale aperture statistics.

 - **Abstract**
 Higher-order lensing statistics contain a wealth of cosmological information that is not captured by second-order statistics. Stage-III lensing surveys have sufficient statistical power to significantly detect cumulant-based statistics up to fourth order. We derive and validate an efficient estimation procedure for the four-point correlation function (4PCF) of polar fields such as weak lensing shear. We then use our approach to measure the shear 4PCF and the fourth-order aperture mass statistics in the DES Y3 survey. We construct an efficient estimator for fourth-order shear statistics which builds on the multipole decomposition of the shear 4PCF. We then validate our estimator on mock ellipticity catalogues obtained from Gaussian random fields and on realistic $N$-body simulations. Finally, we apply our estimator to the DES Y3 data and present a measurement of the fourth-order aperture statistics in a non-tomographic setup. Due to its quadratic scaling, our estimator provides a significant speed-up over hypothetical brute force or tree-based estimation methods of the shear 4PCF. We report a significant detection of the connected part of the fourth-order aperture mass in the DES Y3 data. We find the sampling distribution of the fourth-order aperture mass to be significantly skewed. We make our estimator code available on GitHub as part of the orpheus package.

          Advanced Weights for IXPE Polarization Analysis

 - **Abstract**
 As the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) measures increasingly faint sources, the need for precise polarimetry extraction becomes paramount. In addition to previously described neural-net (NN) weights, we introduce here point-spread function weights and particle background weights, which can be critical for faint sources. In some cases these can be augmented by time/phase and energy weights. We provide a publicly available analysis tool to incorporate these new weights, validate our method on simulated data, and test it on archival IXPE observations. Together these weights decrease the area of the polarization uncertainty contour by a factor of two and will be essential for background-limited IXPE observations.

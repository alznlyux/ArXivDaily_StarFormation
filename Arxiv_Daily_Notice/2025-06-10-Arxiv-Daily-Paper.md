 - **Abstract**
 Utilizing locally available materials is a crucial step towards sustainable planetary habitation. Lunar regolith has gained tremendous interest in additive manufacturing in the past decades. However, due to the constrained manufacturing facilities and materials on the moon, many existing additive manufacturing methods are not suitable for practical on-site manufacturing. Here, we envision that light-based direct sintering of lunar regolith can be a feasible approach. Instead of directly manufacturing large structures, we hypothesize that small-scale, reconfigurable building blocks can be an alternative to form large and complex structures. To verify the feasibility, we conducted laser sintering of lunar regolith simulants as a proof of concept, following a simple theoretical calculation for direct sintering using the light available in space. Different laser processing parameters are investigated to obtain controllable lunar regolith sintering. We further designed Lego-like interlocking bricks that are reconfigurable for different structure assemblies without additional material. Mechanical performance (compressive strength) of sintered cubic blocks is evaluated, showing a peak stress of ~1.5 MPa. We hope this work will inspire other in-space manufacturing techniques and enable low-cost space habitation.

 - **Abstract**
 The Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) is an all-sky optical sky survey with a cadence of 24 to 48 hours and the ATLAS Transient Server processes the alert stream to enable the discovery and follow-up of extra-galactic transients. The data from the ATLAS server can be accessed through a REST API, which has allowed the development of bots that need direct access to the data to help rank alerts and trigger followup observations of promising targets. Here we present the python client we have developed for the ATLAS API to help connect bots and scientists to our data.

 - **Abstract**
 Red giants undergo dramatic and complex structural transformations as they evolve. Angular momentum is transported between the core and envelope during this epoch, a poorly understood process. Here, we infer envelope and core rotation rates from Kepler observations of $\sim$1517 red giants. While many measurements are consistent with the existing studies, our investigation reveals systematic changes in the envelope-to-core rotation ratio and we report the discovery of anomalies such as clump stars with rapidly rotating cores, and red giants with envelopes rotating faster than their cores. We propose binary interactions as a possible mechanism by which some of these cores and envelopes are spun up. These results pose challenges to current theoretical expectations and can have major implications for compact remnants born from stellar cores.

          Searching for Historical Extragalactic Optical Transients Associated with Fast Radio Bursts

 - **Abstract**
 We present a systematic search for past supernovae (SNe) and other historical optical transients at the positions of fast radio burst (FRB) sources to test FRB progenitor systems. Our sample comprises 83 FRBs detected by the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) and its KKO Outrigger, along with 93 literature FRBs representing all known well-localized FRBs. We search for optical transients coincident in position and redshift with FRBs and find no significant associations within the 5-sigma FRB localization uncertainties except for a previously identified potential optical counterpart to FRB 20180916B. By constraining the timescale for SN ejecta to become transparent to FRB emission, we predict that it takes at least 6-10 years before the FRB emission can escape. From this, we infer that approximately 7% of matched optical transients, up to 30% of currently known SNe, and up to 40% of core-collapse SNe could have an observable FRB based on timescales alone. We derive the number of new, well-localized FRBs required to produce one FRB-SN match by chance, and find it will take ~ 22,700 FRBs to yield one chance association at the projected CHIME/FRB Outrigger detection rate. Looking forward, we demonstrate redshift overlap between SNe detected by the upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory and CHIME/FRB Outrigger FRBs, indicating the prospect of an increase in potential associations at redshift z < 1. Our framework is publicly available, flexible to a wide range of transient timescales and FRB localization sizes, and can be applied to any optical transient populations in future searches.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new framework for massive star evolution that is no longer driven by Dutch or other mass-loss rate Recipes, but which take the physics of Gamma or L/M dependent mass loss consistently into account. We first discuss the hot-star mass-loss kink and the transition mass loss rate between optically thin and thick winds, before discussing vertical stellar evolution, mass evaporation, and the maximum black hole (BH) mass. We end with a suggestion that a recently uncovered red supergiant (RSG) kink might be related to similar underlying L/M physics as the hot-star kink.

          Pavo: Stellar feedback in action in a low-mass dwarf galaxy

 - **Abstract**
 MeerKAT observations of the recently discovered, extremely low mass galaxy, Pavo, have revealed a neutral gas (HI) reservoir that was undetected in archival HI single dish data. Based on the latest distance measurement ($2.16^{+0.08}_{-0.07}$ Mpc), we measure Pavo's HI mass as $\log M_\mathrm{HI}/\mathrm{M_\odot} = 5.79 \pm 0.05$, making it the lowest mass HI reservoir currently known in an isolated galaxy (with a robust distance measurement). Despite Pavo's extreme isolation, with no known neighbor within over 700 kpc, its HI reservoir is highly disturbed. It does not show clear signs of rotation and its center of mass is offset from the stellar body center by 320 pc, while its peak is offset by 82 pc (both in projection). Despite this disturbed morphology, Pavo still appears to be consistent with the HI size--mass relation, although it is not possible to accurately determine a suitable inclination correction. Such disturbed, offset and disorganized HI reservoirs are predicted by simulations of low-mass, star-forming dwarfs in which supernova-driven outflows efficiently disrupt the interstellar medium after a star formation event. It is likely that we are witnessing Pavo in precisely this period, tens to a few hundred Myr after a star formation episode, when internal feedback has disrupted its gas reservoir.

          Maximizing Ariel's Survey Leverage for Population-Level Studies of Exoplanets

 - **Abstract**
 ESA's Ariel mission will be uniquely suited to performing population-level studies of exoplanets. Most of these studies consist of quantifying trends between an Ariel-measured quantity, y, and an a priori planetary property, x; for example, atmospheric metallicity as inferred from Ariel transit spectroscopy vs. planetary radius. We define the leverage of a survey with N targets as L = sqrt(N)stdev(x) and show that it quantitatively predicts the precision of population-level trends. The target selection challenge of Ariel can therefore be summarized as maximizing L along some axes of diversity for a given cumulative observing time. To this end, we consider different schemes to select the mission reference sample for a notional three year transit spectroscopy survey with Ariel. We divide the exoplanets in the mission candidate sample into logarithmic classes based on radius, equilibrium temperature, and host star temperature. We then construct a target list by cyclically choosing the easiest remaining target in each class. We find that in many cases the leverage is greatest for a single class: dividing planets into multiple classes increases the diversity of targets, but reduces their numbers. The leverage on a single axis of diversity can be increased by dividing that axis into many planet classes, but this sacrifices leverage along other axes of diversity. We conclude that a modest number of classes, possibly only one, should be defined when selecting Ariel targets. Lastly, we note that the statistical leverage of the Ariel transit survey would be significantly increased if current candidate planets were confirmed. This highlights the urgency of vetting and confirming the easiest transmission and emission spectroscopy targets in the Ariel mission candidate sample.

          Grand Design Spiral Arms in the Compact, Embedded Protoplanetary Disk of Haro 6-13

 - **Abstract**
 Millimeter continuum spiral arms have so far only been detected in a handful of protoplanetary disks, and thus we have a limited understanding of the circumstances in which they can form. In particular, substructures in small disks ($R\lessapprox 50$ au) have not been well-characterized in comparison with large disks. We present ALMA 1.3 mm continuum observations of the disk around the T Tauri star Haro 6-13 at a resolution of $\sim0.04''$ ($\sim5$ au). A pair of low-contrast spiral arms are detected at disk radii from $\sim10-35$ au. They can be approximated as Archimedean spirals with pitch angles ranging from $\sim10-30^\circ$. The low value of the disk-averaged spectral index between 1.3 and 3 mm ($\alpha=2.1$) and the high brightness temperatures suggest that the millimeter continuum is likely optically thick and thus may hide sufficient mass for the disk to become gravitationally unstable and form spiral arms. CO observations have shown that Haro 6-13 is surrounded by an envelope, raising the possibility that infall is facilitating spiral arm formation.

          Constraining Nuclear Mass Models Using r-process Observables with Multi-objective Optimization

 - **Abstract**
 Predicting nuclear masses is a longstanding challenge. One path forward is machine learning (ML) which trains on experimental data, but can suffer large errors when extrapolating toward neutron-rich species. In nature, such masses shape observables for the rapid neutron capture process (r-process), which in principle could inform ML models. Here we introduce a multi-objective optimization approach using the Pareto Front algorithm. We show that this technique, capable of identifying models which generate r-process abundances aligning with both Solar and stellar data, is a promising method to select ML models with reliable extrapolation power.

          Perturbative QCD reveals the softening of matter in the cores of massive neutron stars

 - **Abstract**
 The cores of neutron stars (NSs) contain the densest matter in the universe. Rapid advancements in neutron-star observations allow unprecedented empirical access to cold, ultra-dense Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) matter. The combination of these observations with theoretical calculations has revealed previously inaccessible features of the equation of state (EoS) and the QCD phase diagram. In this thesis, I demonstrate how perturbative-QCD calculations at asymptotically high baryon densities provide robust constraints on the EoS at neutron-star densities. The method for constraint propagation is based solely on thermodynamical causality, stability, and consistency of the EoS. By constructing a large ensemble of EoSs using Gaussian processes regression and incorporating it into a Bayesian inference of EoS, I demonstrate that the novel pQCD constraints go beyond those obtained from current astrophysical observations alone, forcing the EoS to soften at the maximum densities of stable neutron stars. This softening of the EoS can be interpreted as an indication of approximate conformal symmetry restoration, a sign of a first-order phase transition (FOPT), or potentially both. I show that the conformal symmetry restoration is consistent with the hypothesis of quark matter cores inside the most massive NSs. Although current astrophysical data and theoretical inputs cannot definitively distinguish between the two scenarios, they slightly favor the occurrence of a phase transition of some kind - whether a crossover to quark matter or a destabilizing FOPT - in the cores of the most massive neutron stars.

          LHAASO Protons versus LHAASO Diffuse Gamma Rays: A Consistency Check

 - **Abstract**
 We perform the first direct consistency check between the recently measured proton spectrum at the knee by LHAASO and the collaboration's own high-precision mapping of Galactic diffuse gamma-ray emission. By modeling the hadronic gamma-ray production using the updated cosmic-ray spectra, gas templates and cross-section models, we show that the predicted gamma-ray flux robustly overshoots the LHAASO data in both inner and lateral Galactic regions. This persistent mismatch in both normalization and spectral shape challenges conventional scenarios linking the local cosmic-ray sea to Galactic gamma-ray emission, and calls for a revision of current cosmic ray models in the TeV-PeV sky.

          Primordial black holes with mass ratio-modulated initial clustering: merger suppression and projected constraints

 - **Subjects:** Subjects:

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/
 - **Abstract**
 We present a modification of the expected local primordial black hole (PBH) count $N(y)$, typically seen in the context of the early PBH binary merger rate as a term in the merger rate suppression. We utilize recent results in small-scale PBH clustering to formulate $N(y)$ in such a way that accounts for variations in the binary mass ratio $q$. We then examine how this change affects the projected constraints on PBH abundance from simulated Einstein Telescope (ET) and LISA mergers. Our results indicate that for broadly extended mass distributions, the merger suppression is greatly reduced for binaries with $q \gg 1$. This leads to an enhanced merger rate for binary distributions favoring a lighter average mass. This change is best reflected in the constraints derived from the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB), as the increased merger rate does not have as much of an impact on constraints from resolvable mergers. Our results imply that the assumption of PBH clustering is testable at abundances and mass ranges much lower than anticipated, but only definitively through measurements of the SGWB.

          Indicator Functions: Distilling the Information from Gaussian Random Fields

 - **Abstract**
 A random Gaussian density field contains a fixed amount of Fisher information on the amplitude of its power spectrum. For a given smoothing scale, however, that information is not evenly distributed throughout the smoothed field. We investigate which parts of the field contain the most information by smoothing and splitting the field into different levels of density (using the formalism of indicator functions), deriving analytic expressions for the information content of each density bin in the joint-probability distribution (given a distance separation). We find that the information peaks at moderately rare densities (where the number of smoothed survey cells $N\sim 100$). Counter-intuitively, we find that, for a finite survey volume, indicator function analysis can outperform conventional two-point statistics while using only a fraction of the total survey cells, and we explain why. In light of recent developments in marked statistics (such as the indicator power spectrum and density-split clustering), this result elucidates how to optimize sampling for effective extraction of cosmological information.

          High count rate effects in event processing for XRISM/Resolve x-ray microcalorimeter: II. Energy scale and resolution in orbit

 - **Abstract**
 The Resolve instrument on the X-ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM) uses a 36-pixel microcalorimeter designed to deliver high-resolution, non-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Although it is optimized for extended sources with low count rates, Resolve observations of bright point sources are still able to provide unique insights into the physics of these objects, as long as high count rate effects are addressed in the analysis. These effects include {the loss of exposure time for each pixel}, change on the energy scale, and change on the energy resolution. To investigate these effects under realistic observational conditions, we observed the bright X-ray source, the Crab Nebula, with XRISM at several offset positions with respect to the Resolve field of view and with continuous illumination from {$^{55}$Fe sources} on the filter wheel. For the spectral analysis, we excluded data where exposure time loss was too significant to ensure reliable spectral statistics. The energy scale at 6 keV shows a slight negative shift in the high-count-rate regime. The energy resolution at 6 keV worsens as the count rate in electrically neighboring pixels increases, but can be restored by applying a nearest-neighbor coincidence cut (``cross-talk cut''). We examined how these effects influence the observation of bright point sources, using GX 13+1 as a test case, and identified an eV-scale energy offset at 6 keV between the inner (brighter) and outer (fainter) pixels. Users who seek to analyze velocity structures on the order of tens of km~s$^{-1}$ should account for such high count rate effects. These findings will aid in the interpretation of Resolve data from bright sources and provide valuable considerations for designing and planning for future microcalorimeter missions.

          The $α$-Attractor E-Model in Warm Inflation: Observational Viability from Planck 2018

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the inflationary evolution and observational viability of the $\alpha$-attractor E-model in the framework of warm inflation, focusing on both weak and strong dissipative regimes, with a dissipation coefficient linear in temperature. In the strong regime, we account for the growth of inflaton fluctuations due to coupling with the radiation bath via two different forms for the dissipation enhancement function: one associated with plateau-like potentials, and another motivated by the warm little inflation scenario. Employing slow roll conditions, we analytically derive the expressions for the key inflationary observables, the spectral index $n_s$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$, in both dissipative regimes. The resulting theoretical trajectories on the $n_s$--$r$ plane are then juxtaposed with the contour plots obtained from Planck 2018 data in order to constrain the model parameter. Our analysis shows that the warm $\alpha$-attractor E-model remains compatible with observations in both dissipative regimes, with dissipation playing a crucial role in shifting the predictions and enlarging the viable parameter space, highlighting observational robustness of the model when extended to warm inflation.

          Spectroscopic orbit and variability of the Be star V1624 Cyg = 28 Cyg

 - **Abstract**
 In recent years the idea, first formulated many decades ago, that the Be phenomenon could be causally related to the duplicity of Be stars, has been repeatedly reconsidered from various perspectives. It is important, therefore, to have reliable information on Be stars, which are confirmed members of binary systems. This study is devoted to V1624 Cyg = 28 Cygni, which was recently identified as a binary with a compact secondary. By measuring the radial velocities (RVs) of the wings of the H alpha emission line and using archival data and published RVs from the International Ultraviolet Explorer, we demonstrate that the Be primary moves in the 359.26 d orbit found recently from interferometry. Our preliminary radial-velocity solution leads to binary masses of 5.6, and 0.66 solar masses. Moreover, we documented large and irregular spectral, brightness, and colour changes over a time interval of several decades to show that the object never completely lost its circumstellar matter.

 - **Abstract**
 Reverberation mapping (RM) can measure black hole accretion disc sizes and radial structure through observed time lags that should increase with wavelength as $\tau\propto\lambda^{4/3}$. Our 250-day RM campaign on NGC 7469 combines sub-day cadence 7-band photometry from the Las Cumbres Observatory robotic telescopes and weekly X-ray and UVOT data from Swift. By fitting these light curves, we measure the spectral energy distribution of the variable accretion disc and inter-band lags of just 1.5 days across the UV to the optical range. The disc SED is close to the expected $f_\nu\propto\nu^{1/3}$, and the lags are consistent with $\tau\propto \lambda^{4/3}$, but three times larger than expected. We consider several possible modifications to standard disc assumptions. First, for a $9\times10^6$ M$_\odot$ black hole and 2 possible spins $a^\star=(0,1)$, we fit the X-ray-UV-optical SED with a compact relativistic corona at height $H_x=(46,27)R_g$ irradiating a flat disc with accretion rate $\dot{m}_{Edd}\sim(0.23,0.24)$ inclined to the line of sight by $i<20^\circ$. To fit the lags as well as the SED, this model requires a low spin $a^\star=0$ and boosts disc color temperatures by a factor $f_{col}=1.8$, which shifts reprocessed light to shorter wavelengths. Our Bowl model with $f_{col}=1$ neglects relativity near the black hole but fits the UV-optical lags and SEDs using a flat disc with $\dot{m}_{Edd}<0.06$ and a steep outer rim at $R_{out}/c\sim5-10$ days with H/R<1%. This rim occurs near the $10^3$K dust sublimation temperature in the disc atmosphere, supporting models that invoke dust opacity to thicken the disc and launch failed radiatively-driven dusty outflows at the inner edge of the broad line region (BLR). Finally, the disc lags and SEDs exhibit a significant excess in the $u$ and $r$ bands, suggesting the Balmer continuum and H$\alpha$ emission, respectively, from the BLR.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the radio continuum detection of well known Galactic Planetary Nebula (PN) NGC 5189, observed at 943 MHz during the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU) survey. Two detections of NGC 5189 have been made during the survey, of better resolution than previous radio surveys. Both measurements of the integrated flux density are consistent with each other, at $S_{\rm 943\,MHz} = 0.33\pm0.03$ Jy, and the spectral luminosity is $L_{\rm{943\,MHz}}$ = 8.89 $\times$ 10$^{13}$ W m$^{-2}$ Hz$^{-1}$. Using available flux density measurements for radio-detections of NGC 5189, we calculate a radio surface brightness at 1 GHz and measure $\Sigma_{\rm 1~GHz}$ = 6.0 $\times$ 10$^{-21}$ W m$^{-2}$ Hz$^{-1}$ sr$^{-1}$, which is in the expected range for Galactic PNe. We measure an apparent size of 3.4${'}$ $\times$ 2.2${'}$ corresponding to physical diameters of 1.48 pc $\times$ 0.96 pc, and combine available radio observations of NGC 5189 to estimate a spectral index of $\alpha$ = 0.12 $\pm$ 0.05. Hence, we agree with previous findings that NGC 5189 is a thermal (free-free) emitting nebula. Additional measurements of the optical depth ($\tau = 0.00246$) and electron density ($N_{e} = 138~cm^{-3}$) support our findings that NGC 5189 is optically thin at 943 MHz. Furthermore, the radio contours from the ASKAP-EMU image have been overlaid onto a Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Wide Field Camera 3 image, demonstrating that the radio morphology closely traces the optical. Notably, the contour alignment for the innermost region highlights the two envelopes of gas previously reported to be low-ionisation structures, which is considered a defining feature of post common-envelope PNe that surround a central Wolf-Rayet star.

          Primordial Black Holes Save $R^2$ Inflation

 - **Abstract**
 In light of the latest Planck-Atacama Cosmology Telescope (P-ACT) joint results on the primordial scalar power spectrum, we show that the $R^2$ inflation model extended with a non-minimally coupled scalar field $\chi$--namely the $R^2$-Higgs model--can yield a larger spectral index $n_s$ and a small positive running $\alpha_s$ at cosmic microwave background (CMB) scales, which are consistent with the data. This is because the $\chi$ field contributes a blue-tilted component to the primordial power spectrum which both modifies the large-scale power and, as a result, significantly enhances power on small scales. The consequent enhancement be large enough to lead to the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) of mass $\lesssim 10^{20}\mathrm{g}$, accounting for all of the dark matter. Furthermore, future observations of the small-scale power spectrum, CMB spectral distortions, and stochastic gravitational waves will provide decisive tests of this model and its predictions for PBHs.

 - **Abstract**
 The sub-millimetre dust opacity spectral index is a critical observable to constrain dust properties, such as the maximum grain size of an observed dust population. It has been widely measured at galactic scales and down to protoplanetary disks. However, because of observational and analytical challenges, quite a gap exists in measuring dust properties in the envelopes that feed newborn protostars and their disks. To fill this gap, we use sensitive dust continuum emission data at 1.2 and 3.1 mm from the ALMA FAUST Large Program and constrain the dust opacity millimetre spectral index around a sample of protostars. Our high-resolution data, along with a more refined methodology with respect to past efforts, allow us to disentangle disk and envelope contributions in the uv-plane, and thus measure spectral indices for the envelopes uncontaminated by the optically thick emission of the inner regions. First, we find that the young disks are small and optically thick. Secondly, we measure the dust opacity spectral index at envelope scales for n=11 sources: the beta of n=9 sources had never been constrained in the literature. We effectively double the number of sources for which the dust opacity spectral index beta has been measured at these scales. Third, combining the available literature measurements with our own (total n=18), we show how envelope spectral indices distribute between ISM-like and disk-like values, bridging the gap in the inferred dust evolution. Finally, we statistically confirm a significant correlation between beta and the mass of protostellar envelopes, previously suggested in the literature. Our findings indicate that the dust optical properties smoothly vary from the ISM, through envelopes and all the way down to disks. Multi-wavelength surveys are needed to further this study and make more general claims on dust evolution in its pathway from cloud to disks.

          Separating Angular and Radial Modes with Spherical-Fourier Bessel Power Spectrum on All Scales and Implications for Systematics Mitigation

 - **Abstract**
 Current and upcoming large-scale structure surveys place stringent requirements on the mitigation of observational systematics in order to achieve their unprecedented constraining power. In this work, we investigate the potential use of the spherical Fourier-Bessel (SFB) power spectrum in controlling systematics, leveraging its capability of disentangling angular and radial scales. We first clarify how the discrete SFB basis describes radial scales via the index $n$ and demonstrate that the SFB power spectrum reduces to the clustering wedge $P(k,\mu)$ in the plane-parallel limit, enabling it to inherit results from past literature based on the clustering wedge. Crucially, the separation of angular and radial scales allows systematics to be localized in SFB space. In particular, systematics with broad and smooth radial distributions primarily concentrate in the $n=0$ modes corresponding to the largest radial scales. This localization behavior enables one to selectively remove only particular angular and radial modes contaminated by systematics. This is in contrast to standard 3D clustering analyses based on power spectrum multipoles, where systematic effects necessitate the removal of all modes below a given $k_{\rm min}$. Our findings advocate for adopting the SFB basis in 3D clustering analyses where systematics have become a limiting factor.

          Comparative Testing of Subgrid Models for Fast Neutrino Flavor Conversions in Core-collapse Supernova Simulations

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate key methodologies of Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook subgrid modeling for neutrino fast flavor conversions (FFC) in core-collapse supernova based on spherically symmetric Boltzmann radiation hydrodynamics simulations. We first examine time integration methods (explicit, implicit, or semi-implicit) and time step control for the subgrid term, and then compare various approaches in the literature approximating FFCs in two aspects: (1) angular dependent survival probability of neutrinos versus simple equipartition condition with a certain baryon mass density threshold, and (2) 4-species treatment versus 3-species assumption ($\nu_x=\bar\nu_x$). We find that the equipartition condition is reasonable for out-going neutrinos, but large deviations emerge in the incoming neutrinos, that has an influence on matter profiles. We also find that the 3-species model, in which flavor conversions evolve towards erasing electron neutrino lepton number (ELN) crossings, behave differently from the 4-species models where heavy leptonic neutrino number (XLN) are appropriately treated in FFC subgrid modeling. In 4-species models, we commonly observe noticeable differences between $\nu_x$ and $\bar\nu_x$, highlighting the limitation in 3-species treatments to study impacts of flavor conversion on neutrino signals. Our result also suggests that FFC models yield lower neutrino heating rate and smaller shock radii compared to cases with no FFC, in agreement with earlier studies employing quantum kinetic neutrino transport. This work provides valuable information towards robust implementation of FFC subgrid model into classical transport, and serves as a pilot study for future multi-dimensional simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Our position within the Galactic plane and the dust obscuration make it challenging to retrieve a true picture of the Milky Way's morphology. While the Milky Way has been recognized as a barred spiral galaxy since the 1960s, there is still uncertainty about the exact number of spiral arms it contains. Currently, our understanding of the Galaxy is evolving thanks to the unprecedented detail provided by Gaia's parallactic distances. Aims. To shed light on the spatial distribution of red supergiants (RSGs) on the Disk and their uniformity of parameters across it, a census of Galactic RSGs detected by Gaia is needed. Methods. Candidate RSGs were extracted from the combined Gaia DR3 and 2MASS catalogs using color criteria and parallactic distances. The sample includes 335 stars that were not included in catalogs of previously known RSGs detected by Gaia DR3. Interstellar and circumstellar extinction values were estimated from the infrared bands. Spectral types were collected from Simbad or VIZIER databases and, for 135 candidates, were inferred from the Gaia DR3 BPRP spectra. Stellar luminosities were inferred using photometric measurements and the Gaia DR3 distances. Results. The analysis yielded a genuine sample of O-rich late-type stars, and the calculated luminosities confirm that the sample is mostly made of stars brighter than Mbol=-5 mag. This new sample represents a 40% increase in the number of highly probable RSGs compared to previous studies. When looking at the X and Y distribution on the Galactic plane, beside the populous Perseus associations of RSGs and the Sagittarius group of RSGs, a novel population of highly probable RSGs populating the more distant Scutum-Centaurus arm appears.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a first step toward field-level cosmological inference beyond the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, focusing on optimizing precision tests in the nonlinear regime of large-scale structure (LSS). As an illustrative case, we study the model-independent ``bootstrap'' coefficient of the second-order perturbation theory (PT) kernel for matter in real space, which we use as a proxy for new physics effects in the nonlinear sector. We discuss in details the ultraviolet (UV) cutoff dependence induced by discretizing fields on a grid, which requires proper renormalization to eliminate grid artifacts. We formulate a Wilsonian perturbative framework in which the evolution from a UV theory defined at a high cutoff $\Lambda_\text{uv}$ down to lower cutoffs is computed analytically, even beyond the validity of a derivative expansion. Within this framework, we develop an extended version of the GridSPT code incorporating the bootstrap parameterization and demonstrate how cutoff-independent predictions can be achieved through the inclusion of appropriate counterterms. We validate our approach at third- and fifth-order in PT, emphasizing the importance of higher-derivative contributions for unbiased parameter extraction. Our framework is readily extendable to biased tracers and redshift-space distortions.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a Bayesian analysis of cosmological parameter constraints from early- and late-universe observations, focusing on the matter density parameter ($\Omega_m$) and the amplitude of matter fluctuations ($\sigma_8$) within the $\Lambda$CDM framework. Using data from the Planck 2018 satellite mission and the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 3, we compute theoretical predictions for angular and matter power spectra via Boltzmann solvers and perform Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling using the \texttt{emcee} Python package. Our key contribution is a direct and quantitative comparison of DES and Planck constraints, assessing their consistency using chi-squared analysis and Gaussian tension metrics. We find a statistically significant $6.46\sigma$ tension in $\Omega_m$ and a $2.68\sigma$ tension in $\sigma_8$ between the two datasets. These results provide fresh evidence of persistent discrepancies in cosmological parameter estimates and suggest that simple extensions to the $\Lambda$CDM model may be insufficient to fully reconcile early- and late-time observations, motivating the need for more complex theoretical models or refined treatment of systematics.

          The initial evolution of SN 1993J: Piston phase versus standard model

 - **Abstract**
 The evolution of SN 1993J is unlikely to be self-similar. Spatially resolved VLBI-observations show that the velocity of the outer rim of the radio emission region brakes at a few hundred days. The reason for this break remains largely unknown. It is argued here that it is due to the transition between an initial piston phase to a later phase, which is described by the standard model. The properties of the reverse shock are quite different for a piston phase as compared to the standard self-similar model. This affects the expected X-ray emission; for example, the reverse shock becomes transparent to X-ray emission much earlier in the piston phase. Furthermore, it is shown that the observed box-like emission line profiles of H_alpha and other optical lines are consistent with an origin from the transition region between the envelope and the core. It is also pointed out that identifying the observed, simultaneous breaks at approximately 3100 days in the radio and X-ray light curves with the reverse shock reaching the core, makes it possible to directly relate the mass-loss rate of the progenitor star to observables.

 - **Abstract**
 HD 213985 is an eccentric binary system with a post-AGB primary and a jet-launching secondary star. We confirm that the system photometric variability is likely due to obscuration by the inner edge of a circumbinary disc, similar to RVb-type RV Tau stars. The system has shown an increase in the orbital variability amplitude in optical photometric bands, along with irregular changes in its shape that often started to appear skewed. Variability in the Na D lines suggests that this behaviour may be driven by interactions between the circumbinary disc and outflows through the L2 Lagrange point. Moreover, HD 213985 has exhibited episodes of short-term fluctuations whose appearance is not strictly related to the orbital phase. This variability is consistent with obscuration by transient dust structure leading to weather-like variability patterns.

 - **Abstract**
 We present new CO(2-1) observations (resolution $\sim1" = 460$pc) of the Coma cluster jellyfish galaxy NGC 4858 obtained from the ALMA-JELLY large program. Analyzing this data alongside complimentary Subaru H$\alpha$ and HST (F600LP / F350LP) observations, we find numerous structural and kinematic features indicative of the effects from strong, inclined ram pressure, including an asymmetric inner gas tail. We estimate a highly-inclined disk-wind angle of $\phi_{DW} = 75^{+10}_{-27}$. By subtracting a simple circular velocity model, we find (1): gas clumps that are being accelerated by ram pressure, and (2): signatures of gas clumps that had been previously pushed out of the disk but are now falling inwards. We also discuss head-tail morphologies in star complexes within the stellar disk that appear to be RPS-influenced. Lastly, we compare this galaxy to state-of-the-art galaxy ``wind tunnel'' simulations. We find that this galaxy is one of the best nearby examples of strong and inclined ram pressure gas stripping, and of gas that is perturbed by ram pressure but not fully stripped and falls back. We emphasize the importance of torques due to ram pressure in highly-inclined interactions, which help drive gas inwards on the side rotating against the wind, contributing to the formation of asymmetric inner RPS tails.

 - **Abstract**
 Modeling observations of transiting exoplanets or close binary systems by comparing the observations with theoretical light curves requires precise knowledge of the distribution of specific intensities across the stellar disk. We aim to facilitate this type of research by providing extensive tabulations of limb-darkening coefficients for 11 frequently used near- and mid-infrared passbands on the NIRCam, NIRISS, and NIRSpec instruments installed on board the James Webb Space Telescope. The calculation of the limb-darkening coefficients was based on spherically symmetric atmosphere models from the PHOENIX series, with high spectral resolution (approximately $10^{6}$ wavelengths), and covering the wavelength range $0.1-6.0~\mu$m. The models were computed for solar composition, and a microturbulent velocity of 1.0 km s$^{-1}$. We adopted two of the more accurate parametrizations for the coefficients: the 4-term law, and the power-2 law. We applied the Levenberg-Marquardt least-squares minimization method, with a strategy to determine the critical value $\mu_{\rm crit}$ of the cosine of the viewing angle near the limb that is designed to improve numerical accuracy. The limb-darkening coefficients were derived based on a total of 306 atmosphere models covering an effective temperature range of $2400-7800$ K, and a $\log g$ interval between 3.0 and 5.5. We discuss the quality of the fits to the specific intensities provided by the power-2 and 4-term laws, as well as by the often used quadratic law. Based on a comparison, we recommend the use of the 4-term or power-2 laws, in that order of preference.

 - **Abstract**
 It is assumed that superheavy dark matter particles (SHDM, $\phi$) with $\mathcal{O}$(ZeV) mass may decay to relativistic milli-charged particles (MCPs, $\chi$) via a channel $\phi\to\chi\bar{\chi}$ or $\gamma\chi\bar{\chi}$. The downward-going MCPs passing through the atmosphere can be measured by the Pierre Auger observatory (Auger). The massless hidden photon model is taken for MCPs to interact with nuclei, so that we evaluated the numbers and fluxes of expected MCPs at Auger assuming 14 years of Auger data. The hybrid data of Auger was fitted with the flux of UHE MCPs exceeding GZK-cutoff energy. Then the corresponding upper limits on $\epsilon^2$ are calculated at 90\% C. L.. These results indicate that MCPs can be directly detected with $\epsilon^2\gtrsim 2\times10^{-6}$ at Auger, when $m_{\phi}=2\times10^{21}$ eV and $\tau_{\phi}=10^{27}$ s. And a new region of 10$^{9.6}$ < $m_{MCP}$ < 10$^{11.6}$ eV and $\epsilon$ > $2.12\times10^{-2}$ is ruled out in the $m_{MCP}$-$\epsilon$ plane with 14 years of Auger data. These results indicate potential existence of MCPs and SHDM in the Universe.

 - **Abstract**
 We report detection and analysis of the largest low-frequency (200 - 231.25 MHz) sample of Crab giant pulses (GPs) reported in the literature. In total about 95000 GPs were detected. The observations were performed in 2024/2025 with the EDA2, a prototype station of the SKA-Low telescope. The fluence distribution of GPs in the entire sample is very well characterised with a single power law (no flattening at higher fluences) N(F) $\propto$ F$^\alpha$, where $\alpha = -3.17\pm0.02$ for all GPs, and $\alpha_{MP} = -3.13\pm0.02$ and $\alpha_{IP} = -3.59\pm0.06$ for GPs at the phases of the main pulse and interpulse respectively. The index of the power law fluence distribution remained approximately constant over the observing period, but the normalisation of the distribution was strongly correlated with the scatter broadening time ($\tau$). As a result, the measured fluence distribution increased for lower ($\tau \approx$ 2 ms) and decreased for higher ($\tau \approx$ 5 ms) scatter broadening time $\tau$ causing the GP rate to vary between 3000 and 100 per hour respectively. The timescale of variations (weeks) indicates refractive scintillation as the root cause. We also observe a strong positive correlation between the scatter broadening time and dispersion measure. Our modelling favours the screen of the size $\sim10^{-5}$ pc and mean electron density $\sim 400$e$^{-}$cm$^{-3}$ located within 100 pc from the pulsar. The frequency scaling of the scattering broadening time ($\tau \propto \nu^{\beta}$) with $\beta \approx -3.6\pm0.1$ is in agreement with earlier measurements. Our results agree with the current views that GPs from extra-galactic Crab-like pulsars can be responsible for very weak repeating FRBs, but cannot explain the entire FRB population. Finally, these results demonstrate an enormous scientific potential of individual SKA-Low stations.

 We present a joint analysis of weak gravitational lensing (shear) data obtained from the first three years of observations by the Dark Energy Survey and thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect measurements from a combination of Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and Planck data. A combined analysis of shear (which traces the projected mass) with the tSZ effect (which traces the projected gas pressure) can jointly probe both the distribution of matter and the thermodynamic state of the gas, accounting for the correlated effects of baryonic feedback on both observables. We detect the shear$~\times~$tSZ cross-correlation at a 21$\sigma$ significance, the highest to date, after minimizing the bias from cosmic infrared background leakage in the tSZ map. By jointly modeling the small-scale shear auto-correlation and the shear$~\times~$tSZ cross-correlation, we obtain $S_8 = 0.811^{+0.015}_{-0.012}$ and $\Omega_{\rm m} = 0.263^{+0.023}_{-0.030}$, results consistent with primary CMB analyses from Planck and P-ACT. We find evidence for reduced thermal gas pressure in dark matter halos with masses $M < 10^{14} \, M_{\odot}/h$, supporting predictions of enhanced feedback from active galactic nuclei on gas thermodynamics. A comparison of the inferred matter power suppression reveals a $2-4\sigma$ tension with hydrodynamical simulations that implement mild baryonic feedback, as our constraints prefer a stronger suppression. Finally, we investigate biases from cosmic infrared background leakage in the tSZ-shear cross-correlation measurements, employing mitigation techniques to ensure a robust inference.

 - **Abstract**
 Astrophysical transient phenomena on sub-millisecond timescales, such as fast radio bursts and giant radio pulses from the Crab pulsar, have been primarily observed in radio wavebands. To investigate their origins, a photon detector with high sensitivity and high time resolution is required also in other wavelengths. Recently, we developed the Imager of MPPC-based Optical photoN counter from Yamagata (IMONY), an observation system utilizing a Geiger-mode avalanche photodiode (GAPD) as a sensor. The sensor consists of 64 pixels, each comprising a GAPD and a quenching resistor, with pixel sizes of 75, 100, 150, and 200\,$\mu$m. Each pixel signal is read out independently, enabling single-photon detection. After successfully observing the Crab pulsar using two Japanese telescopes, we upgraded the readout boards to achieve a more compact and stable system. The new system incorporates an analog application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) developed at KEK for multi-purpose fast readout for silicon photomultipliers. This ASIC features a fast transimpedance amplifier and a comparator, independently processing 16 channels. A Global Navigation Satellite System receiver and a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) provide timestamps for each detected photon with a resolution of 100 ns. The FPGA transmits the acquired data to a PC via Ethernet. This paper presents the details of the new system and the results of its initial evaluation.

 - **Abstract**
 Waves are an integral part of the solar atmosphere, and their characteristics (e.g., dominant period, range of periods, power, and phase angle) change on a diverse spatio-temporal scale. It is well well-established observationally that the dominant periods of solar oscillations are 5-min and 3-min in the photosphere and chromosphere, respectively. This shows that the wave spectra and their dominant periods evolve between these two layers. We present observational results that demonstrate variations of the dominant period with heights in the photosphere and chromosphere. Six photospheric absorption lines and one chromospheric line are analyzed by using the IRIS data, and the Doppler velocity time series at seven different atmospheric heights are determined. The wavelet analysis is applied to these time series, and the resulting spectrum of wave periods and its dominant period are deduced at these heights, which gives height variations of the dominant period. The obtained data shows that the dominant period decreases with height, and that there are also changes in the range of wave periods within the spectrum. Numerical simulations of filtered wave spectra through the solar atmosphere are also performed, and the obtained results match the observational data.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar systems consisting of three or more stars are not an uncommon occurrence in the Galaxy. Nearly 50% of solar-type wide binaries with separations >1000 au are actually higher-order multiples with one component being a close binary. Additionally, the higher-order multiplicity fraction appears to be correlated with the physical separation of the widest component. These facts have motivated some of our current theories behind how the widest stellar systems formed, which can have separations on the order of or larger than protostellar cores. However, it is unclear if the correlation between wide binary separation and higher-order multiplicity extends to low-mass binaries. We present initial results of an ongoing speckle imaging survey of nearby low-mass wide binaries. We find an overall higher-order multiplicity fraction for our sample of $42.0\% \pm 10.9\%$. If we include systems where Gaia indicates that a companion is likely present, this fraction increases to $62.0\% \pm 14.2\%$. This is consistent with previous results from both higher-mass stars and a previous result for low-mass wide binaries. However, we do not detect the expected increase in higher-order multiplicity fraction with separation, as was seen with previous studies. We briefly explore why higher-order multiplicity statistics could be different in low-mass stars, and what the significance might be for models of wide binary formation.

 - **Abstract**
 The gravitational lensing effect of gravitational waves (GWs) has been extensively discussed as a probe of small-mass dark matter halos, which can provide missing information about dark matter. We propose a multi-band observation of lensed GWs from a compact binary to observe both geometrical optics (GO) and wave optics (WO) effects from the same source. This method is expected to be advantageous in breaking parameter degeneracies between a GW source and a dark matter halo acting as a lens. We assume DECIGO or B-DECIGO as a space-based detector observing the early inspiral phase, and the ET as a ground-based detector observing the merger phase. We perform a Fisher analysis of multi-band detection for a source with masses $m_1 = 30 M_{\odot}, m_2 = 20 M_{\odot}$ at redshift $z = 1.5$, and a lens with mass $3 \times 10^{3} M_{\odot}$ at redshift $z = 1.0$. With this setup, the GO effect appears in the ET frequency band, and the WO effect in that of DECIGO. For the halo density profile, we adopt Singular Isothermal Sphere, Cored Isothermal Sphere (CIS), and Navarro-Frenk-White models. We find that multi-band observation resolves parameter degeneracies and significantly reduces errors in estimated parameters. For the CIS model, in particular, we show that, by combining ET and DECIGO observations, the lens mass error improves by about 71 $\%$ and 58 $\%$ compared to ET and DECIGO alone, respectively. Similarly, the impact parameter error is reduced by about 65 $\%$ and 70 $\%$, and the core size error by 34 $\%$ and 68 $\%$, respectively. From these results, we conclude that the multi-band observation of GWs from compact binaries improves the estimation of the lens object properties by breaking the parameter degeneracy.

 - **Abstract**
 We use two subsets of 2000 and 1000 \textsc{Quijote} simulations to build two power spectrum emulators, allowing for fast computations of the non-linear matter power spectrum. The first emulator works on scales $k \in [0.015,1.8]\,h/ \rm{Mpc^{-1}}$ in terms of seven cosmological parameters: the matter and baryon fraction of the energy density of the Universe $\Omega_m$ and $\Omega_b$, the reduced Hubble constant $h$, the scalar spectral index $n_s$, the amplitude of matter density fluctuations $\sigma_8$, the total neutrino mass $M_{\nu}$ and the dark energy equation of state parameter $w$. The power spectra can be directly determined at redshifts 0, 0.5, 1, 2 and 3, while for intermediate redshifts these can be interpolated. The second emulator is based on five cosmological parameters, $\Omega_m$, $h$, $n_s$, $\sigma_8$ and the amplitude of equilateral non-Gaussianity $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm equilateral}$, at redshifts 0, 0.503, 0.733, 0.997 for $k \in [0.015,1.8]\,h/ \rm{Mpc^{-1}}$. The emulators are built on machine learning techniques. In both cases we have investigated both neural networks and tree-based methods and we have shown that the best accuracy is obtained for a neural network with two hidden layers. Both emulators achieve a root-mean-squared relative error of less then 5\% for all the redshifts considered on the scales discussed.

          Why Do Stars Turn Red? II. Solutions of Steady-State Stellar Structure

 - **Abstract**
 To investigate the physical origin of red giants (RGs) and red supergiants (RSGs), we construct steady-state models of stellar envelopes by explicitly solving the stellar structure equations, with boundary conditions set at the stellar surface and the hydrogen burning shell. For comparison, we consider both polytropic and realistic models. Polytropic models adopt a polytropic equation of state (EOS) and neglect energy transport, while realistic models incorporate radiative and convective energy transport, along with tabulated EOS and opacities. Our steady-state solutions reproduce three key features relevant to the evolution toward the RG/RSG phase. First, the refined mirror principle of \cite{Ou2024} is reproduced: the stellar radius varies inversely with the radius of the envelope's inner boundary, defined by the burning shell's surface. This feature arises purely from hydrostatic equilibrium, as it appears in both polytropic and realistic models. Second, realistic models reveal an upper limit to envelope expansion, corresponding to an effective temperature of $\sim4,000\,{\rm K}$, which is characteristic of RG/RSG stars and consistent with the classical Hayashi limit. Approaching this limit, the envelope undergoes a structural transition marked by a significant change in the density profile and the formation of an extended convective zone. The location of this limit is governed by the sharp drop in H$^{-}$ opacity as the envelope cools below $\sim10,000\,{\rm K}$. Finally, our solutions show that even a small shift in the envelope's inner boundary can induce substantial envelope expansion throughout the yellow regime, naturally explaining the bifurcation of giants and supergiants into red and blue branches.

 - **Abstract**
 Blue straggler stars (BSSs) are core hydrogen-burning stars routinely observed in resolved stellar systems. According to the theory of single star evolution they should not exist because, due to their large mass, they should have already evolved to stellar remnants. Hence, they are suspected to be the result of mass-enhancement processes, like mass-transfer activity in binary systems, mergers in binary or higher order systems, or direct stellar collisions, possibly mediated by dynamical interactions. Galactic globular clusters (GGCs) are templates of collisional stellar systems, where frequent gravitational interactions among stars occur on timescales shorter than their age. Thus, in these systems the number of BSSs originated by stellar collisions is expected to increase with the local stellar density and the collision rate. Here we analyse a sample of more than 3000 BSSs homogeneously observed in 48 GGCs with different structures, and we find that the number of BSSs normalized to the sampled luminosity anti-correlates (instead of correlating) with the central density, the collision rate, and the dynamical age of the parent cluster. We also find strikingly similar trends between these environmental properties and the cluster binary fraction, indicating that the latter decreases in high density/high collisional regions. We finally demonstrate that the correlations found between BSSs and the environmental parameters are explained by an underlying dependence of the BSS specific frequency on binary fraction. Once inserted in the context of the current knowledge of the BSS phenomenon, these correlations indicate that low-density regions (possibly because of a higher binary production/survival rate) are the natural habitat of both BSSs and binary systems, and the observed BSSs mostly have a binary-related origin mediated by the environmental conditions.

 - **Abstract**
 The main-sequence turnoff (MSTO) stars well preserve the chemical properties where they were born, making them ideal tracers for studying the stellar population. We perform a detailed chemo-dynamical analysis on moderately metal-poor ($-2.0<\mathrm{[Fe/H]}<-1.0$) MSTO stars to explore the early accretion history of the Milky Way. Our sample includes four stars observed with high-resolution spectroscopy using CFHT/ESPaDOnS and 163 nearby MSTO stars selected from the SAGA database with high-resolution results. Within the action-angle spaces, we identified Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE, 35), stars born in the Milky Way (in situ, 31), and other substructures (21). We find that both GSE and in-situ stars present a similar Li plateau around $A(\mathrm{Li)}\sim 2.17$. GSE shows a clear $\alpha$-knee feature in Mg at $\mathrm{[Fe/H]}\sim-1.60\pm 0.06$, while the $\alpha$-elements of in-situ stars remain nearly constant within the metallicity range. The iron-peak elements show little difference between GSE and in-situ stars except for Zn and Ni, which decrease in GSE at $\mathrm{[Fe/H]}>-1.6$, while they remain constant in in-situ stars. Among heavy elements, GSE shows overall enhancement in Eu, with [Ba/Eu] increasing with the metallicity, while this ratio remains almost constant for in-situ stars, suggesting the contribution of longer time-scale sources to the $s$-process in GSE. Moreover, for the first time, we present the $r$-process abundance pattern for an extremely $r$-process enhanced ($r$-II) GSE star, which appears consistent with the solar $r$-process pattern except for Pr. Further investigation of larger GSE samples using high-resolution spectra is required to explore the reason for the significantly higher Pr in the GSE r-II star.

 - **Abstract**
 Homogeneous and nearly-isotropic cosmological models are natural extensions of standard Friedmann cosmologies. Constraining their features is crucial, as any detection of their properties would impact our understanding of inflation and the cosmological principle. Since these models evolve as a set of non-interacting scalar, vector, and tensor modes on top of homogeneous and isotropic spacetimes, their imprints on cosmological observables, particularly the CMB, can be obtained using standard line-of-sight methods. This requires (1) that one resorts on Laplacian eigenmodes on spatially curved spaces and (2) that radial functions for these modes are analytically continued to accommodate complex (i.e., supercurvature) wavenumbers. We introduce two line-of-sight integrators implementing the evolution of the CMB anisotropies in these models: \texttt{AniLoS}, a user-friendly and easy to modify \texttt{Python} package, and \texttt{AniCLASS}, an advanced and efficient extension of the Boltzmann solver \texttt{CLASS}. We discuss possible initial conditions that could generate such fluctuations and provide illustrative examples using our codes. This work offers a pathway for leveraging diverse cosmological datasets to constrain superhorizon anisotropies of the late-time universe.

 - **Abstract**
 This work presents comprehensive multi-frequency radio monitoring of the black hole low-mass X-ray binary Swift J1727.8$-$1613, which underwent its first recorded outburst after its discovery in August 2023. Through a considerable community effort, we have coalesced the data from multiple, distinct observing programs; the light curves include ${\sim} 10$ months and 197 epochs of monitoring from 7 radio facilities with observing frequencies ranging from (approximately) 0.3$-$230GHz. The primary purpose of this work is to provide the broader astronomical community with these light curves to assist with the interpretation of other observing campaigns, particularly non-radio observing frequencies. We discuss the phenomenological evolution of the source, which included: (i) multiple radio flares consistent with the launching of discrete jet ejections, the brightest of which reached $\sim$ 1 Jy; (ii) temporally evolving radio spectral indices ($\alpha$), reaching values steeper than expected for optically-thin synchrotron emission ($\alpha {<} -1$) and emission with significant radiative cooling ($\alpha < -1.5$). We have published a digital copy of the data and intend for this work to set a precedent for the community to continue releasing comprehensive radio light curves of future low-mass X-ray binary outbursts.

 The goal of this paper is to describe the science verification of Milky Way Mapper (MWM) ASPCAP data products published in Data Release 19 (DR19) of the fifth phase of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-V). We compare MWM ASPCAP atmospheric parameters T$_{\rm eff}$, log g, 24 abundances of 21 elements (carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen have multiple sources for deriving their abundance values) and their uncertainties determined from APOGEE spectrograph spectra with those of the literature and evaluate their accuracy and precision. We also test the zero-point calibration of the v$_{\rm rad}$ derived by the APOGEE Data Reduction Pipeline. This data release contains ASPCAP parameters for 964,989 stars, including all APOGEE-2 targets expanded with new observations of 336,511 stars from the Apache Point Observatory (APO) observed until 4 July 2023. Overall, the new T$_{\rm eff}$ values show excellent agreement with the IRFM scale, while the surface gravities exhibit slight systematic offsets compared to asteroseisimic gravities. The estimated precision of T$_{\rm eff}$ is between 50 and 70 K for giants and 70$-$100 K for dwarfs, while surface gravities are measured with a precision of 0.07$-$0.09 dex for giants. We achieve an estimated precision of 0.02$-$0.04 dex for multiple elements, including metallicity, $\alpha$, Mg, and Si, while the precision of at least 10 elements is better than 0.1 dex.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of stellar occultations have revealed that small bodies are capable of hosting ring systems. The trans-Neptunian object (TNO) Quaoar, is the host of an enigmatic ring system, with two rings located well-outside the Roche limit. To better understand these structures, we observed a stellar occultation by Quaoar and its rings using the James Webb Space Telescope's (JWST) NIRCam instrument. Our observations detect both known rings, although Q2R -- the inner known ring -- is not detected on both sides of Quaoar, showing that it has substantial azimuthal variations similar to Q1R -- the outer ring. We also fit a model of the ring radii and pole orientation of the ring system, which confirms that Quaoar's spin-orbit and Weywot's mean motion resonances (especially Weywot's 6:1) may play a role in the rings' confinement and stability. In addition to examination of Quaoar's ring system, we also use our observations to place upper limits on a putative CH$_4$ atmosphere around Quaoar, finding that no global atmosphere with surface pressure $>1$ nbar can exist (at 3$\sigma$ significance). The lack of atmosphere supports the hypothesis that atmospheric processes are not the source of Quaoar's recently discovered inventory of light hydrocarbons.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar bowshock nebulae are arcuate shock fronts formed by the interaction of radiation-driven stellar winds and the relative motion of the ambient interstellar material. Stellar bowshock nebulae provide a promising means to measure wind-driven mass loss, independent of other established methods. In this work, we characterize the stellar sources at the center of bowshock nebulae drawn from all-sky catalogs of 24 $\mu$m-selected nebulae. We obtain new, low-resolution blue optical spectra for \numstars~stars and measure stellar parameters temperature \teff, surface gravity \logg, and projected rotational broadening \vsini. We perform additional photometric analysis to measure stellar radius \rstar, luminosity \lstar, and visual-band extinction $A_V$. All but one of our targets are O and early B stars, with temperatures ranging from $T$=16.5--46.8~k\kelvin, gravities $\log g=$2.57--4.60, and \vsini~from $<$100--400~\kms. With the exception of rapid rotator $\zeta$ Oph, bowshock stars do not rotate at or near critical velocities. At least 60 of 103 (60\%) OB bowshock stars are binaries, consistent with the multiplicity fraction of other OB samples. The sample shows a runaway fraction of 23\%, with \numrunaway~stars having $v_{\text{2D}}\geq25$~\kms. Of the 19 runaways, at least 15 ($\geq$79\%) are binaries, favoring dynamical ejection over the binary supernova channel for producing runaways. We provide a comprehensive census of stellar parameters for bowshock stars, useful as a foundation for determining the mass-loss rates for OB-type stars -- one of the single most critical factors in stellar evolution governing the production of neutron stars and black holes.

 - **Abstract**
 Planet formation models suggest that the formation of giant planets is significantly harder around low-mass stars, due to the scaling of protoplanetary disc masses with stellar mass. The discovery of giant planets orbiting such low-mass stars thus imposes strong constraints on giant planet formation processes. Here, we report the discovery of a transiting giant planet orbiting a $0.207 \pm 0.011 M_{\odot}$ star. The planet, TOI-6894 b, has a mass and radius of $M_P = 0.168 \pm 0.022 M_J (53.4 \pm 7.1 M_{\oplus})$ and $R_P = 0.855 \pm 0.022 R_J$, and likely includes $12 \pm 2 M_{\oplus}$ of metals. The discovery of TOI-6894 b highlights the need for a better understanding of giant planet formation mechanisms and the protoplanetary disc environments in which they occur. The extremely deep transits (17% depth) make TOI-6894 b one of the most accessible exoplanetary giants for atmospheric characterisation observations, which will be key for fully interpreting the formation history of this remarkable system and for the study of atmospheric methane chemistry.

 - **Abstract**
 By January 2025, 60 pulsars were discovered by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope globular cluster (GC) pulsar survey (GC FANS), with spin periods spanning 1.98 ms to 3960.72 ms. Of these, 55 are millisecond pulsars (MSPs; $P<30$ ms), while 34 are binaries with orbital periods spanning 0.12 days to 466.47 days. This paper describes GC FANS, a deep, thorough search for pulsars in 41 GCs in the FAST sky ($-14^\circ < \delta < 65^\circ$) and describes new discoveries in 14 of them. We present updated timing solutions for M92A, NGC 6712A, M71A, and M71E, all of which are ``spider'' pulsars with short orbital periods. We present new timing solutions for M71B, C, and D. With orbital periods of $\sim$466 and 378 days, M71B and M71C are the widest known GC binaries; these systems resemble the normal wide MSP-He WD systems in the Galactic disk. With a spin period of 101 ms, M71D is in an eccentric ($e\sim$0.63) orbit with an 11-day period and a massive companion; the system has a total mass of $2.63 \pm 0.08 \, M_{\odot}$. These features and its large characteristic age suggest it is a double neutron star system (DNS) formed via massive binary evolution early in the cluster's history, akin to Galactic disk DNSs--unlike other candidate GC DNSs, which typically form dynamically. A comparative analysis of GC pulsar populations within FAST's sky reveals that most clusters (10 of 14) resemble the Galactic disk MSP population, likely due to lower stellar densities.

          Not so dark, not so dense: an alternative explanation for the lensing subhalo in SDSSJ0946+1006

 - **Abstract**
 Previous studies of the strong lens system SDSSJ0946+1006 have reported a dark matter subhalo with an unusually high central density, potentially challenging the standard cold dark matter (CDM) paradigm. However, these analyses assumed the subhalo to be completely dark, neglecting the possibility that it may host a faint galaxy. In this work, we revisit the lensing analysis of SDSSJ0946+1006, explicitly modelling the subhalo as a luminous satellite. Incorporating light from the perturber broadens the range of allowed subhalo properties, revealing solutions with significantly lower central densities that are consistent with CDM expectations. The inferred luminosity of the satellite also aligns with predictions from hydrodynamical simulations. While high-concentration subhaloes remain allowed, they are no longer statistically preferred. The luminous subhalo model yields a better fit to the data, while also offering a more plausible explanation that is in line with theoretical expectations. We validate our methodology using mock data, demonstrating that neglecting subhalo light can lead to inferred mass distributions that are artificially compact.

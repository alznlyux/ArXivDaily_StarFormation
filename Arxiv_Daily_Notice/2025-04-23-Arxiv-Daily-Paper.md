 - **Abstract**
 Motivated by the recent Year-2 data release of the DESI collaboration, we update our results on time-varying dark energy models driven by the Cohen-Kaplan-Nelson bound. The previously found preference of time-dependent dark energy models compared to $\Lambda$CDM is further strengthend by the new data release. For our particular models, we find that this preference increases up to $\approx 2.6\,\sigma$ depending on the used supernova dataset.

          On DESI's DR2 exclusion of $Λ$CDM

 - **Abstract**
 The DESI collaboration, combining their Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data with cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy and supernovae data, have found significant indication against $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. The significance of the exclusion of $\Lambda$CDM can be interpreted entirely as significance of the detection of the $\boldsymbol{w_a}$ parameter that measures variation of the dark energy equation of state. We emphasize that DESI's DR2 exclusion of $\Lambda$CDM is quoted in the articles for a combination of BAO and CMB data with each of three different and overlapping supernovae datasets (at 2.8-sigma for Pantheon+, 3.8-sigma for Union3, and 4.2-sigma for DESY5). We show that one can neither choose amongst nor average over these three different significances. We demonstrate how a principled statistical combination yields a combined exclusion significance of 3.1-sigma. Further we argue that, based on available knowledge, and faced with these competing significances, the most secure inference from the DESI DR2 results is the 3.1-sigma level exclusion of $\Lambda$CDM, obtained from combining DESI+CMB alone, while omitting supernovae.

 - **Abstract**
 Several enigmatic dusty sources have been detected in the central parsec of the Galactic Center. Among them is X7, located at only $\sim$0.02 pc from the central super-massive black hole, Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*). Recent observations have shown that it is becoming elongated due to the tidal forces of Sgr A*. X7 is expected to be fully disrupted during its pericenter passage around 2035 which might impact the accretion rate of Sgr A*. However, its origin and nature are still unknown. We investigated the tidal interaction of X7 with Sgr A* in order to constrain its origin. We tested the hypothesis that X7 was produced by one of the observed stars with constrained dynamical properties in the vicinity of Sgr A*. We employed a set of test-particle simulations to reproduce the observed structure and dynamics of X7. The initial conditions of the models were obtained by extrapolating the observationally constrained orbits of X7 and the known stars into the past, making it possible to find the time and source of origin by minimizing the three-dimensional separation and velocity difference between them. Our results show that ejecta from the star S33/S0-30, launched in $\sim$1950, can to a large extent, replicate the observed dynamics and structure of X7, provided that it is initially elongated with a velocity gradient across it, and with an initial maximum speed of $\sim$600~km~s$^{-1}$. Our results show that a grazing collision between the star S33/S0-30 and a field object such as a stellar mass black hole or a Jupiter-mass object is a viable scenario to explain the origin of X7. Nevertheless, such encounters are rare based on the observed stellar dynamics within the central parsec.

          Cosmology in Extended Parameter Space with DESI DR2 BAO: A 2$σ$+ Detection of Non-zero Neutrino Masses with an Update on Dynamical Dark Energy and Lensing Anomaly

 - **Abstract**
 We obtain constraints in a 12 parameter cosmological model using the recent DESI Data Release (DR) 2 Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) data, combined with Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) power spectra (Planck Public Release (PR) 4) and lensing (Planck PR4 + Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) Data Release (DR) 6) data, uncalibrated type Ia Supernovae (SNe) data from Pantheon+ and Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 5 (DESY5) samples, and Weak Lensing (WL: DES Year 1) data. The cosmological model consists of six $\Lambda$CDM parameters, and additionally, the dynamical dark energy parameters ($w_0$, $w_a$), the sum of neutrino masses ($\sum m_{\nu}$), the effective number of non-photon radiation species ($N_{\textrm{eff}}$), the scaling of the lensing amplitude ($A_{\textrm{lens}}$), and the running of the scalar spectral index ($\alpha_s$). Our major findings are the following: i) With CMB+BAO+DESY5+WL, we obtain the first 2$\sigma$+ detection of a non-zero $\sum m_{\nu} = 0.19^{+0.15}_{-0.18}$ eV (95%). Replacing DESY5 with Pantheon+ still yields a $\sim$1.9$\sigma$ detection. ii) The cosmological constant lies at the edge of the 95% contour with CMB+BAO+Pantheon+, but is excluded at 2$\sigma$+ with DESY5, leaving evidence for dynamical dark energy inconclusive, contrary to claims by DESI collaboration. iii) With CMB+BAO+SNe+WL, $A_{\textrm{lens}} = 1$ is excluded at $>2\sigma$, while it remains consistent with unity without WL data - suggesting for the first time that the existence of lensing anomaly may depend on non-CMB datasets. iv) The Hubble tension persists at 3.6-4.2$\sigma$ with CMB+BAO+SNe; WL data has minimal impact.

          Dust populations from 30 to 1000 au in the debris disk of HD 120326

 - **Abstract**
 Context. To date, more than a hundred debris disks have been spatially resolved. Among them, the young system HD 120326 stands out, displaying different disk substructures on both intermediate (30-150 au) and large (150-1000 au) scales. Aims. We present new VLT/SPHERE (1.0-1.8 $\mu$m) and ALMA (1.3 mm) data of the debris disk around HD 120326. By combining them with archival HST/STIS (0.2-1.0 $\mu$m) and archival SPHERE data, we have been able to examine the morphology and photometry of the debris disk, along with its dust properties. Methods. We present the open-access code MoDiSc (Modeling Disks in Scattered light) to model the inner belt jointly using the SPHERE polarized and total intensity observations. Separately, we modeled the ALMA data and the spectral energy distribution (SED). We combined the results of both these analyses with the STIS data to determine the global architecture of HD 120326. Results. For the inner belt, identified as a planetesimal belt, we derived a semi-major axis of 43 au, fractional luminosity of 1.8 x 10-3 , and maximum degree of polarization of 45-57 % at 1.6 $\mu$m. The spectral slope of its reflectance spectrum is red between 1.0 and 1.3 $\mu$m and gray between 1.3 and 1.8 $\mu$m. Additionally, the SPHERE data show that there could be a halo of small particles or a second belt at distances <150 au. Using ALMA, we derived in the continuum (1.3 mm) an integrated flux of 541-581 $\mu$Jy. We did not detect any 12CO emission. At larger separations (>150 au), we highlight a spiral-like feature spanning hundreds of astronomical units in the STIS data. Conclusions. Further data are needed to confirm and better constrain the dust properties and global morphology of HD 120326.

 - **Abstract**
 The Milky Way has a large population of dwarf galaxy satellites. Their properties are sensitive to both cosmology and the physical processes underlying galaxy formation, but these properties are still not properly characterized for the entire satellite population. We aim to provide the most accurate systemic dynamical and metallicity properties of the dwarf galaxy Boötes II (Boo II). We use a new spectroscopic sample of 39 stars in the field of Boo II with data from the Fiber Large Array Multi Element Spectrograph (FLAMES) mounted on the Very Large Telescope (VLT). The target selection is based on a combination of broadband photometry, proper motions from Gaia, and the metallicity-sensitive narrow-band photometry from the Pristine survey that is ideal for removing obvious Milky Way contaminants. We found 9 new members, including 5 also in the recent work of Bruce et al. (2023), and the farthest member to date (5.7 half-light radii from Boo II centroid), extending the spectroscopic spatial coverage of this system. Our metallicity measurements based on the Calcium triplet lines leads to the detection of the two first extremely metal-poor stars (EMPS, [Fe/H] < -3.0) in Boo II. Combining this new dataset with literature data refines Boo II's velocity dispersion (5.6km/s), systemic velocity(-126.8 km/s) and shows that it does not show any sign of a significant velocity gradient. We are thus able to confirm the kinematic and metallicity properties of the satellite as well as identify new members for future high-resolution analyses.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) observations have revealed small-scale transient brightenings that may share common physical mechanisms with larger-scale solar flares. A notable feature of solar and stellar flares is the presence of quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs), which are considered a common and potentially intrinsic characteristic. Aims. We investigate the properties of QPPs detected in EUV brightenings, which are considered small-scale flares, and compare their statistical properties with those observed in solar and stellar flares. Methods. We extracted integrated light curves of 22,623 EUV brightenings in two quiet Sun regions observed by the Solar Orbiter/Extreme Ultraviolet Imager and identified QPPs in their light curves using Fourier analysis. Results. Approximately 2.7 % of the EUV brightenings exhibited stationary QPPs. The QPP occurrence rate increased with the surface area, lifetime, and peak brightness of the EUV brightenings. The detected QPP periods ranged from approximately 15 to 260 seconds, which is comparable to the periods observed in solar and stellar flares. Consistent with observations of QPPs in solar and stellar flares, no correlation was found between the QPP period and peak brightness. However, unlike the trend observed in solar flares, no correlation was found between the QPP period and lifetime/length scale. Conclusions. The presence of QPPs in EUV brightenings supports the interpretation that these events may be small-scale manifestations of flares, and the absence of period scaling with loop length further suggests that standing waves may not be the primary driver of QPPs in these events.

 - **Abstract**
 Spotted stars in eclipsing binary systems allow us to gather significant information about the stellar surface inhomogeneities that is otherwise impossible from only photometric data. Starspots can be scanned using the eclipse (or transit) mapping technique, which takes advantage of the passage of a companion star (or planet) in front of a spotted giant star in a binary system. Based on the characteristics of their ultra-precise space photometric light curves, we compile a list of eclipsing binaries whose primary component is a spotted subgiant or giant star, with the aim of applying the eclipse mapping technique to them. Eclipsing binaries with giant primaries were selected from Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) light curves by visual inspection. Spots showing up as bumps during eclipses are modeled with an eclipse mapping technique specialized for two stars, and the number of spots are found with the help of Bayes factors. The full light curves themselves were analyzed with time series spot modeling, and the results of the two approaches were compared. We present a catalog of 29 eclipsing close binaries with active giant components and analyze TIC 235934420, TIC 271892852 and TIC 326257590 from the Continuous Viewing Zones (CVZ) of TESS. Remarkable agreement is found between the starspot temperatures, sizes, and longitudes from the eclipse mapping results and the corresponding full light curve solutions. Spots are always present at the substellar points of the tidally locked binaries. Data from the TESS CVZ allow us to follow the changes of spot patterns on yearly timescales.

          Are Kronberger 80 and/or Kronberger 82 regions PeVatron candidates for LHAASO J2108+5157?

 - **Abstract**
 High-energy gamma rays have been detected in the region of LHAASO~J2108+5157 by the Fermi--LAT, HAWC and LHAASO-KM2A observatories. Cygnus~OB2 in Cygnus--X has been confirmed as the first strong stellar cluster PeVatron in our Galaxy. Thus, the star--forming regions Kronberger~80 and Kronberger~82, located in the field of LHAASO~J2108+5157, are analyzed to evaluate their stellar population and potential as associated PeVatron candidates. A distance of 10~kpc is adopted for Kronberger~80, while $\sim$1.6~kpc is estimated for Kronberger~82. Based on stellar densities, we report that their cluster radii are 2.5$\arcmin$ and 2.0$\arcmin$, while IR photometry reveals poor stellar content in massive O-type stars in both cases. From optical data, the estimation of cluster ages are 5--12.6~Myr and $\lesssim$ 5~Myr, respectively. We conclude that, in contrast to the stellar content of Cygnus~OB2, it is unlikely that Kronberger~80 and Kronberger~82 are PeVatrons associated with LHAASO~J2108+5157. The presence of a PeVatron in this region remains a mystery, but we confirm that the two Kronberger regions are star--forming regions undergoing formation rather than evolution.

          Generating Dark Matter Subhalo Populations Using Normalizing Flows

 - **Abstract**
 Strong gravitational lensing is a powerful tool for probing the nature of dark matter, as lensing signals are sensitive to the dark matter substructure within the lensing galaxy. We present a comparative analysis of strong gravitational lensing signatures generated by dark matter subhalo populations using two different approaches. The first approach models subhalos using an empirical model, while the second employs the Galacticus semi-analytic model of subhalo evolution. To date, only empirical approaches have been practical in the analysis of lensing systems, as incorporating fully physical models was computationally infeasible. To circumvent this, we utilize a generative machine learning algorithm, known as a normalizing flow, to learn and reproduce the subhalo populations generated by Galacticus. We demonstrate that the normalizing flow algorithm accurately reproduces the Galacticus subhalo distribution while significantly reducing computation time compared to direct simulation. Moreover, we find that subhalo populations from Galacticus produce comparable results to the empirical model in replicating observed lensing signals under the fiducial dark matter model. This work highlights the potential of machine learning techniques in accelerating astrophysical simulations and improving model comparisons of dark matter properties.

 - **Abstract**
 The transfer of material between planetary bodies due to impact events is important for understanding planetary evolution, meteoroid impact fluxes, the formation of near-Earth objects (NEOs), and even the provenance of volatile and organic materials at Earth. This study investigates the dynamics and fate of lunar ejecta reaching Earth. We employ the high-accuracy IAS15 integrator withing the REBOUND package to track for 100,000 years the trajectories of 6,000 test particles launched from various lunar latitudes and longitudes. Our model incorporates a realistic velocity distribution for ejecta fragments (tens of meters in size), derived form large lunar cratering events. Our results show that 22.6% of lunar ejecta collide with Earth, following a power-law $C(t) \propto t^{0.315}$ with half of the impacts occurring within ~10,000 years. We also confirm that impact events on the Moon's trailing hemisphere serve as a dominant source of Earth-bound ejecta, consistent with previous studies. Additionally, a small fraction of ejecta remains transiently in near-Earth space, providing evidence that lunar ejecta may contribute to the NEO population. This aligns with recent discoveries of Earth co-orbitals such as Kamo'oalewa (469219, 2016 HO3) and 2024 PT5, both exhibiting spectral properties consistent with lunar material. These findings enhance our understanding of the lunar ejecta flux to Earth, providing insights into the spatial and temporal patterns of this flux and its broader influence on the near-Earth environment.

          Upper Limits to the Proper Motions of JuMBO 24, a Jupiter-Mass Binary Object Candidate in Orion

 - **Abstract**
 Using JWST near-infrared data of the inner Orion Nebula, \citet{Pearson_McCaughrean_2023} detected 40 binary systems they proposed to be Jupiter-Mass Binary Objects (JuMBOs) -- although their actual nature is still in debate. Only one of the objects, JuMBO\,24, was detected in the radio continuum. Here, we report on new radio continuum (10 GHz) Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) detections of the radio counterpart to JuMBO\,24, and on an unsuccessful search for 5 GHz continuum emission with the High Sensitivity Array (HSA). From our new VLA detections and adopting a distance to the region, we set an upper limit of $\simeq 6$~km~s$^{-1}$ to the velocity of the radio source in the plane of the sky. This upper limit favors an origin for this source similar to that of stars, that is, from a stationary contracting core. The nature of the radio emission remains uncertain but the lack of strong variability (all VLA observations are consistent with a steady flux of $\sim$50 $\mu$Jy), of detection on long HSA baseline, and of detectable circular polarization in VLA data do not favor a non-thermal origin.

          Estimates of Rotation Periods for Jupiter Trojans with the Zwicky Transient Facility Photometric Lightcurves

 - **Abstract**
 We present new rotational period estimates for 216 Jupiter Trojans using photometric data from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), including 80 Trojans with previously unknown periods. Our analysis reveals rotation periods ranging from 4.6 hours to 447.8 hours. These results support the existence of a spin barrier for Trojans larger than 10 km, with periods clustering between 4 and 4.8 hours. This spin barrier is roughly twice as long as that observed for main-belt asteroids, suggesting that Jupiter Trojans have significantly lower bulk densities, likely due to a higher fraction of ices and volatile materials in their composition. We identify three new Trojans with reliable rotation periods near the spin barrier, doubling the number of known Trojans in this critical period range. Using these results, we estimate a mean density of approximately 0.52 g/cm^3 for rubble-pile Trojans. Our findings support the growing evidence that many Trojans are rubble-pile bodies with distinct physical properties compared to main-belt asteroids. Looking forward, we anticipate that data from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will provide rotational period estimates for several hundred thousand Trojans, down to objects as small as 1 km, enabling a more detailed investigation of their rotational properties and internal structure.

 - **Abstract**
 The Black Hole Explorer (BHEX) will be the first sub-mm wavelength Space Very-Long-Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) mission. It targets astronomical imaging with the highest ever spatial resolution to enable detection of the photon ring of a supermassive black hole. BHEX is being proposed for launch in 2031 as a NASA Small Explorers mission. BHEX science goals and mission opportunity require a high precision lightweight spaceborne antenna. A survey of the technology landscape for realizing such an antenna is presented. Technology readiness (TRL) for the antenna is discussed and assessed to be at TRL 5. An update on our technology maturation efforts is provided. Design studies leading to the conceptual design of a metallized carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) technology based antenna with a mass of only $\dim 50$ kg, incorporating a 3.4 m primary reflector with a surface precision of < 40 $\mu$m to allow efficient operation up to 320 GHz are outlined. Current plans anticipate attaining TRL6 in 2026 for the BHEX antenna. Completed design studies point to a large margin in surface precision which opens up opportunities for applications beyond BHEX, at significantly higher THz frequencies.

          Reconciling the Waiting Time Peaks Variations of Repeating FRBs with an Eccentric Neutron Star--White Dwarf Binary

 - **Abstract**
 Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are luminous radio transients with millisecond duration. For some active repeaters, such as FRBs 20121102A and 20201124A, more than a thousand bursts have been detected by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). The waiting time (WT) distributions of both repeaters, defined as the time intervals between adjacent (detected) bursts, exhibit a bimodal structure well-fitted by two log-normal functions. Notably, the time scales of the long-duration WT peaks for both repeaters show a decreasing trend over time. These similar burst features suggest that there may be a common physical mechanism for FRBs~20121102A and 20201124A. In this paper, we {revisit} the neutron star (NS)--white dwarf (WD) binary model with an eccentric orbit to account for the observed changes in the long-duration WT peaks. According to our model, the shortening of the WT peaks corresponds to the orbital period decay of the NS-WD binary. We consider two mass transfer modes, namely, stable and unstable mass transfer, to examine how the orbital period evolves. Our findings reveal distinct evolutionary pathways for the two repeaters: for FRB~20121102A, the NS-WD binary likely undergoes a combination of common envelope (CE) ejection and Roche lobe overflow, whereas for FRB~20201124A the system may experience multiple CE ejections. These findings warrant further validation through follow-up observations.

 - **Abstract**
 One of the most important discoveries in modern cosmology is cosmic acceleration. However, we find that today's universe could decelerate in the statistically preferred Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) scenario over the $\Lambda$CDM model by cosmic microwave background, type Ia supernova and DESI's new measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations. Using various datasets, at a beyond $5\,\sigma$ confidence level, we demonstrate that the universe experiences a triple deceleration during its evolution and finally reaches the state of the ``Big Stall", which predicts that: (i) the universe suddenly comes to a halt in the distant future; (ii) its eventual destiny is dominated by dark matter rather than dark energy ; (iii) it ultimately retains an extremely small fraction of dark energy but exerts an extremely large pressure. Our findings profoundly challenge the established understanding of cosmic acceleration and enrich our comprehension of cosmic evolution.

          Policy-Based Radiative Transfer: Solving the $2$-Level Atom Non-LTE Problem using Soft Actor-Critic Reinforcement Learning

 - **Abstract**
 We present a novel reinforcement learning (RL) approach for solving the classical 2-level atom non-LTE radiative transfer problem by framing it as a control task in which an RL agent learns a depth-dependent source function $S(\tau)$ that self-consistently satisfies the equation of statistical equilibrium (SE). The agent's policy is optimized entirely via reward-based interactions with a radiative transfer engine, without explicit knowledge of the ground truth. This method bypasses the need for constructing approximate lambda operators ($\Lambda^*$) common in accelerated iterative schemes. Additionally, it requires no extensive precomputed labeled datasets to extract a supervisory signal, and avoids backpropagating gradients through the complex RT solver itself. Finally, we show through experiment that a simple feedforward neural network trained greedily cannot solve for SE, possibly due to the moving target nature of the problem. Our $\Lambda^*-\text{Free}$ method offers potential advantages for complex scenarios (e.g., atmospheres with enhanced velocity fields, multi-dimensional geometries, or complex microphysics) where $\Lambda^*$ construction or solver differentiability is challenging. Additionally, the agent can be incentivized to find more efficient policies by manipulating the discount factor, leading to a reprioritization of immediate rewards. If demonstrated to generalize past its training data, this RL framework could serve as an alternative or accelerated formalism to achieve SE. To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first application of reinforcement learning in solar physics that directly solves for a fundamental physical constraint.

          Development of an Ultra-fast, Likelihood-based, Distance Inference Framework for the Next Generation of Type Ia Supernova Surveys

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we present EDRIS (French for Distance Estimator for Incomplete Supernova Surveys), a cosmological inference framework tailored to reconstruct unbiased cosmological distances from type Ia supernovae light-curve parameters. This goal is achieved by including data truncation directly in the statistical model which takes care of the standardization of luminosity distances. It allows us to build a single-step distance estimate by maximizing the corresponding likelihood, free from the biases the survey detection limits would introduce otherwise. Moreover, we expect the current worldwide statistics to be multiplied by O(10) in the upcoming years. This provides a new challenge to handle as the cosmological analysis must stay computationally towable. We show that the optimization methods used in EDRIS allow for a reasonable time complexity of O($N^2$) resulting in a very fast inference process (O(10s) for 1500 supernovae).

 - **Abstract**
 The ultra-hot Jupiter (UHJ) TOI-2109b marks the lower edge of the equilibrium temperature gap between 3500 K and 4500 K, an unexplored thermal regime that separates KELT-9b, the hottest planet yet discovered, from all other currently known gas giants. To study the structure of TOI-2109b's atmosphere, we obtained high-resolution emission spectra of both the planetary day- and nightsides with CARMENES and CRIRES$^+$. By applying the cross-correlation technique, we identified the emission signatures of Fe I and CO, as well as a thermal inversion layer in the dayside atmosphere; no significant H$_2$O signal was detected from the dayside. None of the analyzed species were detectable from the nightside atmosphere. We applied a Bayesian retrieval framework that combines high-resolution spectroscopy with photometric measurements to constrain the dayside atmospheric parameters and derive upper limits for the nightside hemisphere. The dayside thermal inversion extends from 3200 K to 4600 K, with an atmospheric metallicity consistent with that of the host star (0.36 dex). Only weak constraints could be placed on the C/O ratio ($>$ 0.15). The retrieved spectral line broadening is consistent with tidally locked rotation, indicating the absence of strong dynamical processes. An upper temperature limit of 2400 K and a maximum atmospheric temperature gradient of 700 K/log bar could be derived for the nightside. Comparison of the retrieved dayside T-p profile with theoretical models, the absence of strong atmospheric dynamics, and significant differences in the thermal constraints between the day- and nightside hemispheres suggest a limited heat transport efficiency across the planetary atmosphere. Overall, our results place TOI-2109b in a transitional regime between the UHJs below the thermal gap, which show both CO and H$_2$O emission lines, and KELT-9b, where molecular features are largely absent.

 - **Abstract**
 In recent years, high-precision high-cadence space photometry has revealed that stochastic low frequency (SLF) variability is common in the light curves of massive stars. We use the data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) to study and characterize the SLF variability found in a sample of 49 O- and B-type main-sequence stars across six Cygnus OB~associations and one low-metallicity SMC star AV~232. We compare these results to 53 previously studied SLF variables. We adopt two different methods for characterizing the signal. In the first, we follow earlier work and fit a Lorentzian-like profile to the power density spectrum of the residual light curve to derive the amplitude $\alpha_0$, characteristic frequency $\nu_{\rm char}$, and slope $\gamma$ of the variability. In our second model-independent method, we calculate the root-mean-square (RMS) of the photometric variability as well as the frequency at 50\% of the accumulated power spectral density, $\nu_{50\%}$, and the width of the cumulative integrated power density, $w$. For the full sample of 103 SLF variables, we find that $\alpha_0$, $\gamma$, RMS, $\nu_{50\%}$, and $w$ correlate with the spectroscopic luminosity of the stars. Both $\alpha_0$ and RMS appear to increase for more evolved stars whereas $\nu_{\rm char}$ and $\nu_{50\%}$ both decrease. Finally, we compare our results to 2-D and 3-D simulations of subsurface convection, core-generated internal gravity waves, and surface stellar winds, and find good agreement between the observed $\nu_{\rm char}$ of our sample and predictions from sub-surface convection.

 - **Abstract**
 Eclipsing binary systems (EBs), as foundational objects in stellar astrophysics, have garnered significant attention in recent years. These systems exhibit periodic decreases in light intensity when one star obscures the other from the observer's perspective, producing characteristic light curves (LCs). With the advent of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), a vast repository of stellar LCs has become available, offering unprecedented opportunities for discovering new EBs. To efficiently identify such systems, we propose a novel method that combines LC data and generalized Lomb-Scargle periodograms (GLS) data to classify EBs. At the core of this method is CNN Attention LSTM Net (CALNet), a hybrid deep learning model integrating Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and an Attention Mechanism based on the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM). We collected 4,225 EB samples, utilizing their 2-minute cadence LCs for model training and validation. CALNet achieved a recall rate of 99.1%, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness. Applying it to TESS 2-minute LCs from Sectors 1 to 74, we identified 9,351 new EBs after manual visual inspection, significantly expanding the known sample size. This work highlights the potential of advanced deep-learning techniques in large-scale astronomical surveys and provides a valuable resource for further studies on EBs.

 - **Abstract**
 Neutron stars (NSs) probe the high-density regime of the nuclear equation of state (EOS). However, inferring the EOS from observations of NSs is a computationally challenging task. In this work, we efficiently solve this inverse problem by leveraging differential programming in two ways. First, we enable full Bayesian inference in under one hour of wall time on a GPU by using gradient-based samplers, without requiring pre-trained machine learning emulators. Moreover, we demonstrate efficient scaling to high-dimensional parameter spaces. Second, we introduce a novel gradient-based optimization scheme that recovers the EOS of a given NS mass-radius curve. We demonstrate how our framework can reveal consistencies or tensions between nuclear physics and astrophysics. First, we show how the breakdown density of a metamodel description of the EOS can be determined from NS observations. Second, we demonstrate how degeneracies in EOS modeling using nuclear empirical parameters can influence the inverse problem during gradient-based optimization. Looking ahead, our approach opens up new theoretical studies of the relation between NS properties and the EOS, while effectively tackling the data analysis challenges brought by future detectors.

 - **Abstract**
 Determining the composition of an exoplanet atmosphere relies on the presence of detectable spectral features. The strongest spectral features, including DMS, look approximately Gaussian. Here, I perform a suite of Gaussian feature analyses to find any statistically significant spectral features in the recently published MIRI/LRS spectrum of K2-18b (N. Madhusudhan et al. 2025). In N. Madhusudhan et al. 2025, they claim a 3.4-$\sigma$ detection of spectral features compared to a flat line. In 5 out of 6 tests, I find the data preferred a flat line over a Gaussian model, with a $\chi^{2}_{\nu}$ of 1.06. When centering the Gaussian where the absorptions for DMS and DMDS peak, I find ln(B) = 1.21 in favour of the Gaussian model, with a $\chi^{2}_{\nu}$ of 0.99. With only $\sim$2-$\sigma$ in favour of Gaussian features, I conclude no strong statistical evidence for spectral features.

 - **Abstract**
 The infrared (IR) to X-ray luminosity ratio (IRX) is an indicator of the role of the dust plays in cooling of hot gas in supernova remnants (SNR). Using the 3D dynamics of gas and interstellar polydisperse dust grains we analyze the evolution of SNR in the inhomogeneous medium. We obtain spatial distributions of the surface brigthness both of the X-ray emission from hot gas inside SNR and the IR emission from the SNR swept-up shell, as well as, the average gas temperature in the SNR, $T_X$. We find that the IRX changes significantly (by a factor of $\sim 3-30$) as a function of impact distance within the SNR and its age. In a low inhomogeneous medium the IRX drops rapidly during the SNR evolution. On the other hand, if large inhomogeneities are present in the medium, the IRX is maintained at higher levels during the late SNR evolution at radiative phase due to replenishment of dust in the hot gas by incompletely destroyed fragments behind the shock front. We show that the onset of the radiative phase determines the evolution of the $T_X - {\rm IRX}$ diagram. We illustrate that decreasing gas metallicity or density leads to high values of temperature and IRX ratio. We discuss how our results can be applied to the observational data to analyse the SNR older than 10 kyr (i.e. when the mass of the swept-up dust in the shell is expected to exceed that produced in the SNR) in the Galaxy and Large Magellanic Cloud.

          A Novel Relationship Between Gamma Ray Burst Duration And Photospheric Radius

 - **Abstract**
 Long Gamma Ray Bursts (lGRBs) are associated with jets in Type Ic broadline supernovae. The Collapsar model provides a theoretical framework for the jet formation from the core collapse of a massive star in such supernovae. The GRB can only be produced after a successful jet break out from the star. Under this formalism the GRB duration ($t_{\rm{90}}$) has been hypothesized to be the difference between the central engine activity duration ($t_{\rm{eng}}$) and the jet breakout time ($t_{\rm{bo}}$), that is $t_{\rm{90}} = t_{\rm{eng}} - t_{\rm{bo}}$. This disallows $t_{\rm{90}} > t_{\rm{eng}}$ and puts a lower bound on successful lGRB jet central engine duration ($t_{\rm{eng}} > t_{\rm{bo}}$), various numerical simulations have shown otherwise. This study considers a photospheric GRB emission from a relativistic jet punching out of a Wolf-Rayet-like star. We use the bolometric lightcurve generated to calculate the lGRB duration ($t_{\rm{90}}$) for varying engine duration. We find for longer engine duration the lGRB lightcurve reflects the jet profile and $t_{\rm{90}} \approx t_{\rm{eng}}$. While for shorter engine duration, the $t_{\rm{90}}$ has photospheric radius ($R_{\rm{ph}}$) dependence. This can be modeled by a relation, $t_{\rm{90}} = t^{\rm{90}}_{\rm{eng}} + 0.03\left(\frac{R_{\rm{ph}}}{c}\right)$, where c is the speed of light, with a lower bound on $t_{\rm{90}}$ for a successful lGRB. This relation should be most relevant for possible low-luminous lGRBs originating from a collapsar with central engine duration comparable to the jet breakout time.

 The CHNOS elemental budgets of rocky planets are crucial for their structure, evolution and potential chemical habitability. It is unclear how the nonlocal disk processes affecting dust in planet-forming disks affect the CHNOS elemental budgets of nascent planets both inside and outside the Solar System. We aim to quantify the coupled effect of dynamical and collisional processes on the initial refractory CHNOS budgets of planetesimals, forming interior to the water ice line for a Solar and non-Solar composition consistent with the star HIP 43393. Methods. We utilize the SHAMPOO code to track the effects of dynamical and collisional processes on 16000 individual dust monomers. Each monomer is here assigned a refractory chemical composition and mineralogy informed by the equilibrium condensation code GGCHEM given the P-T conditions at the initial position of the monomer. Monomers travel embedded in aggregates through a young class I disk, whose structure is calculated with the ProDiMo code. Furthermore, monomers are allowed to undergo dehydration and desulfurization. We find that solid material becomes well-mixed both radially and vertically. For both the Solar and HIP43393 compositions, the solid phase in the disk midplane regions interior to r~0.7AU can become enriched in hydrogen and sulfur by up to 10at% relative to predictions from purely local calculations. This originates from the inward radial transport of hydrated and sulfur-bearing minerals such as lizardite and iron sulfide. Nonlocal disk processing in a young turbulent, massive disk can lead to significant compositional homogenization of the midplane dust and by extension of the initial composition of planetesimals. Planetesimals forming at r<0.7AU may become enriched in hydrated minerals and sulfur, which could result in more widespread aqueous alteration interior to the water iceline compared to planetesimals that emerge...

 Type IIn supernovae (SNe) resembling SN 2009ip (09ip-like SNe) originate from the interaction between circumstellar material (CSM) and the ejecta.

We suggest that these properties are explained by the difference in the CSM structure as compared to other 09ip-like SNe; SN 2023vbg had an inner denser CSM component, as well as generally smooth CSM density distribution in a more extended scale, than in the others. Such diversity of CSM likely reflects the diversity of pre-SN outbursts, which in turn may mirror the range of evolutionary pathways in the final stages of the progenitors.

 - **Abstract**
 Tidal disruption events (TDEs) occur when stars pass close enough to supermassive black holes to be torn apart by tidal forces. Traditionally, these events are studied with computationally intensive hydrodynamical simulations. In this paper, we present a fast, physically motivated two-stage model for TDEs. In the first stage, we model the star's tidal deformation using linear stellar perturbation theory, treating the star as a collection of driven harmonic oscillators. When the tidal energy exceeds a fraction $\gamma$ of the star's gravitational binding energy (with $\gamma \sim \mathcal{O}(1)$), we transition to the second stage, where we model the disrupted material as free particles. The parameter $\gamma$ is determined with a one-time calibration to hydrodynamical simulations. This method enables fast computation of the energy distribution $\mathrm{d}M/\mathrm{d}E$ and fallback rate $\mathrm{d}M/\mathrm{d}T$, while offering physical insight into the disruption process. We apply our model to MESA-generated profiles of middle-age main-sequence stars. Our code is available on GitHub.

 Jets and disc winds play an important role in the evolution of protoplanetary discs and the formation of planetary systems. However, there is still a lack of observational data regarding the presence and parameters of outflows, especially for close young binaries. In this study, we aim to find the HH flow near the young sub-arcsecond binary DF Tau and explore its morphology. Narrow-band H$\alpha$ and H$_2$ 2.12 $\mu$m imaging and spectroscopic observations of DF Tau and its vicinity were performed. We have discovered several emission nebulae near the binary, which likely result from the interaction of gas outflow from the binary components with the surrounding medium. The outflow appears to occur both in the form of jets, generating numerous Herbig-Haro objects (HH 1266 flow), and as a weakly collimated wind responsible for the formation of the ring-like nebula around the binary and the rim of the cometary globule. We have found that the angle between the jet and the counter-jet is $168^\circ$ and discuss the complex morphology of the HH flow.

 - **Abstract**
 The enhanced primordial scalar power spectrum is a widely studied mechanism for generating primordial gravitational waves (PGWs), also referred to as scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs). This process also plays a pivotal role in facilitating the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs). Traditionally, the ultra slow-roll (USR) mechanism has been the predominant approach used in the early universe. In this framework, the second slow-roll parameter $\epsilon_2$, is typically set to $-6$ or lower for a brief period -- marking a significant departure from the standard slow-roll condition where $\epsilon_2 \simeq 0$. Such conditions often emerge in models with inflection points or localized features, such as bumps in the potential. In this paper, we challenge the conventional assumption that $\epsilon_2 \lesssim -6$ is a prerequisite for substantial amplification of the scalar power spectrum. We demonstrate that any negative value of the second slow-roll parameter can indeed enhance the scalar power spectrum through sub-horizon growth, establishing this as a necessary and sufficient condition for amplification. Consequently, this mechanism facilitates the generation of both PGWs and PBHs. To illustrate this, we examine a standard scenario where a brief USR phase is embedded between two slow-roll (SR) phases. By systematically varying $\epsilon_{2}$ values from $-1$ to $-10$ in the USR region, we investigate the amplification of the power spectrum and its implications for PGWs and PBHs production, particularly in the context of ongoing and future cosmological missions.

          Increase of $n_s$ in regularized pole inflation & Einstein-Cartan gravity

 - **Abstract**
 We show that the regularization of the second order pole in the pole inflation can induce the increase of $n_s$, which may be important after the latest data release of cosmic microwave background (CMB) observation by Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT). Pole inflation is known to provide a unified description of attractor models that they can generate a flat plateau for inflation given a general potential. Recent ACT observation suggests that the constraint on the scalar spectral index $n_s$ at CMB scale may be shifted to a larger value than the predictions in the Starobinsky model, the Higgs inflation, and the $\alpha$-attractor model, which motivates us to consider the modification of the pole inflation. We find that if we regularize the second order pole in the kinetic term such that the kinetic term becomes regular for all field range, we can generally increase $n_s$ because the potential in the large field regime will be lifted. We have explicitly demonstrated that this type of regularized pole inflation can naturally arise from the Einstein-Cartan formalism, and the inflationary predictions are consistent with the latest ACT data without spoiling the success of the $\alpha$-attractor models.

          Optimal intrinsic alignment estimators in the presence of redshift-space distortions

 - **Abstract**
 We present estimators for quantifying intrinsic alignments in large spectroscopic surveys that efficiently capture line-of-sight (LOS) information while being relatively insensitive to redshift-space distortions (RSD). We demonstrate that changing the LOS integration range, {\Pi}max, as a function of transverse separation outperforms the conventional choice of a single {\Pi}max value. This is further improved by replacing the flat {\Pi}max cut with a LOS weighting based on shape projection and RSD. Although these estimators incorporate additional LOS information, they are projected correlations that exhibit signal-to-noise ratios comparable to 3D correlation functions, such as the IA quadrupole. Using simulations from Abacus Summit, we evaluate these estimators and provide recommended {\Pi}max values and weights for projected separations of 1 - 100 Mpc/h. These will improve measurements of intrinsic alignments in large cosmological surveys and the constraints they provide for both weak lensing and direct cosmological applications.

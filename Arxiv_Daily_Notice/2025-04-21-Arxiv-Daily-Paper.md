#### Title:
          Exoplaneteers Keep Calling Plots "Allan Variance" Plots When They Aren't

 - **Abstract**
 I highlight that there is a substantial number of papers (at least 11 published since 2024) which all refer to a specific type of plot as an "Allan variance" plot, when in fact they seem to be plotting the standard deviation of the residuals versus bin size. The Allan variance quantifies the stability of a time series by calculating the average squared difference between successive time-averaged segments over a specified interval; it is not equivalent to the standard deviation. This misattribution seems particularly prolific in the exoplanet transit spectroscopy community. However, I emphasize that it does not impact the scientific analyses presented in those works. I discuss where this confusion seems to stem from and encourage the community to ensure statistical measures are named correctly to avoid confusion.

          Light Scalar Fields Foster Production of Primordial Black Holes

 - **Abstract**
 Scalar fields are ubiquitous in theories of high-energy physics. In the context of cosmic inflation, this suggests the existence of spectator fields, which provide a subdominant source of energy density. We show that spectator fields boost the inflationary production of primordial black holes, with single-field ultra-slow roll evolution supplanted by a phase of evolution along the spectator direction, and primordial perturbations amplified by the resulting multifield dynamics. This generic mechanism is largely free from the severe fine-tuning that afflicts single-field inflationary PBH models.

 - **Abstract**
 The epoch of reionisation is a key phase in the cosmic history, characterised by the ionisation of the intergalactic medium by the first luminous sources. In this work, we constrain the reionisation history of the Universe using data from the cosmic microwave background, more specifically the latest Planck dataset (Public Data Release 4, PR4). We investigate a wide range of reionisation models, from simple parametric descriptions to more flexible non-parametric approaches, systematically evaluating their impact on the inferred constraints. Special attention is given to implicit priors introduced by each model and their influence on the derived reionisation optical depth $\tau$. To achieve this, we employ both Bayesian and frequentist methods to derive robust constraints. We obtain consistent estimates of $\tau$ across models, highlighting the robustness of the constraints on the integrated optical depth derived from Planck PR4 data. The posterior mean averaged across models is $\tau = 0.0576 \pm 0.0060$, while the average best-fit value, $\tau = 0.0581$, reflects the presence of small volume effects. Based on our analysis, we estimate that an additional uncertainty, associated with the modelling of reionisation, contributes an error of approximately $\sigma_\tau\!\sim\!0.0006$. Beyond the integrated optical depth, our analysis reveals that the inferred ionisation fraction as a function of redshift is highly model-dependent. While current CMB data do not favour significant early ionisation, they are consistent with a modest contribution from ionised gas at very early times ($z>15$). Although indicative upper bounds can be placed on such contributions, these limits remain strongly dependent on the assumed model.

 - **Abstract**
 Ultra-high energy neutrinos ($E>10^{17}$ eV) can provide insight into the most powerful accelerators in the universe, however their flux is extremely low. The Beamforming Elevated Array for COsmic Neutrinos (BEACON) is a detector concept which efficiently achieves sensitivity to this flux by employing phased radio arrays on mountains, which search for the radio emission of up-going extensive air showers created by Earth-skimming tau neutrinos. Here, we calculate the point-source effective area of BEACON and characterize its sensitivity to transient neutrino fluences with both short ($<15$ min) and long ($> 1$ day) durations. Additionally, by integrating the effective area, we provide an updated estimate of the diffuse flux sensitivity. With just 100 stations, BEACON achieves sensitivity to short-duration transients such as nearby short gamma-ray bursts. With 1000 stations, BEACON achieves a sensitivity to long-duration transients, as well as the cosmogenic flux, ten times greater than existing experiments at 1 EeV. With an efficient design optimized for ultrahigh energy neutrinos, BEACON is capable of discovering the sources of neutrinos at the highest energies.

 - **Abstract**
 The unstable accretion phases during pre-main-sequence evolution of T Tauri stars produce variable irradiation and heating of planet-forming regions. A strong accretion outburst was observed with Spitzer-IRS in 2008 in EX Lup, the prototype of EXor variables, and found to increase the mid-infrared water and OH emission and decrease organic emission, suggesting large chemical changes. We present here two JWST-MIRI epochs of quiescent EX Lup in 2022 and 2023 obtained over a decade after the 2008 outburst and several months after a moderate burst in 2022. With JWST's sharper spectral view, we can now analyze water emission as a function of temperature in the two MIRI epochs and, approximately, also in the previous Spitzer epochs. This new analysis shows a strong cold water vapor ``burst" in low-energy lines during the 2008 outburst, which we consider clear evidence for enhanced ice sublimation due to a recession of the snowline, as found in protostellar envelopes. JWST shows that EX Lup still has an unusually strong emission from cold water in comparison to other T Tauri disks, suggesting > 10-yr-long freeze-out timescales in the inner disk surface. EX Lup demonstrates that outbursts can significantly change the observed organic-to-water ratios and increase the cold water reservoir, providing chemical signatures to study the recent accretion history of disks. This study provides an unprecedented demonstration of the chemical evolution triggered by accretion outbursts in the Class II phase and of the high potential of time-domain experiments to reveal processes that may have fundamental implications on planet-forming bodies near the snowline.

 - **Abstract**
 Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) imprint gravitational signatures on the matter within their sphere of influence (SoI). Nuclear gas dynamics can hence be used to accurately measure the mass of an SMBH, yet such measurements remain elusive in the early Universe. We report the first dynamical measurement of an SMBH mass at $z >$ 2, based on high spatial resolution observations of the [C II] emission line that resolve the SoI in an obscured quasar at $z$ = 4.6. The velocity dispersion rises radially toward the center, requiring the presence of a 6.3$~\pm~0.14$ $\times$ 10$^9~\rm M_{\odot}$ SMBH. We propose that obscured quasars allow [C II] survivability in the inner regions, and may be ideal targets for increasing dynamical SMBH mass estimates in the early Universe.

 - **Abstract**
 Context: With the advancement of solar physics research, next-generation solar space missions and ground-based telescopes face significant challenges in efficiently transmitting and/or storing large-scale observational data. Aims: We develop an efficient compression and evaluation framework for solar EUV data, specifically optimized for Solar Orbiter Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) data, significantly reducing data volume while preserving scientific usability. Methods: We systematically evaluated four error-bounded lossy compressors across two EUI datasets. However, the existing methods cannot perfectly handle the EUI datasets (with continuously changing distance and significant resolution differences). Motivated by this, we develop an adaptive hybrid compression strategy with optimized interpolation predictors. Moreover, we designed a two-stage evaluation framework integrating distortion analysis with downstream scientific workflows, ensuring that observational analysis is not affected at high compression ratios. Results: Our framework SolarZip achieved up to 800x reduction for Full Sun Imager (FSI) data and 500x for High Resolution Imager (HRI$_{\text{EUV}}$) data. It significantly outperformed both traditional and advanced algorithms, achieving 3-50x higher compression ratios than traditional algorithms, surpassing the second-best algorithm by up to 30%. Simulation experiments verified that SolarZip can reduce data transmission time by up to 270x while ensuring the preservation of scientific usability. Conclusions: The SolarZip framework significantly enhances solar observational data compression efficiency while preserving scientific usability by dynamically selecting optimal compression methods based on observational scenarios and user requirements. This provides a promising data management solution for deep space missions like Solar Orbiter.

 - **Abstract**
 We report MIRI-JWST coronagraphic observations at 11.3 and 15.5 mic of the debris disk around the young star HD 106906. The observations were made to characterize the structure, temperature and mass of the disk through the thermal emission of the dust heated by the central star. Another goal was also to constrain the size distribution of the grains. The data were reduced and calibrated using the JWST pipeline. The analysis was based on a forward-modeling of the images using a multiparameter radiative transfer model coupled to an optical code for coronagraphy processing. The disk is clearly detected at both wavelengths. The slight asymmetry is geometrically consistent with the asymmetry observed in the near-IR, but it is inconsistent the brightness distribution. The observed structure is well reproduced with a model of a disk (or belt) with a critical radius 70 au, a mildly inward-increasing density (index 2) and a steeper decrease outward (index -6). This indication of a filled disk inside the critical radius is inconsistent with sculpting from an inner massive planet. The size distribution of the grains that cause the mid-IR emission is well constrained by the flux ratio at the two wavelengths : 0.45 10 mic and 0.65 10 mic for silicate and graphite grains, respectively. The minimum size is consistent with predictions of blowout through radiative pressure. We derive a mass of the dust that causes the mid-IR emission of 3.3 5.0 E3 Mearth. When the larger grains (up to 1 cm) that cause the millimeter emission are included, we extrapolate this mass to 0.10 0.16 Mearth. We point out to that this is fully consistent with ALMA observations of the disk in terms of dust mass and of its millimeter flux. We estimate the average dust temperature in the planetesimal belt to be 74 K, and a temperature range within the whole disk from 40 to 130 K.

 - **Abstract**
 Chirped-pulse Fourier transform microwave (CP-FTMW) spectroscopy is a versatile technique to record broadband gas-phase rotational spectra, enabling detailed investigations of molecular structure, dynamics, and hyperfine interactions. Here, we present the development and application of a CP-FTMW spectrometer operating in the 6.5-18 GHz frequency range, studying cyanocyclohexane, 1-cyanocyclohexene, and 4-cyanocyclohexene using a heated pulsed supersonic expansion source. The dynamic range, experimental resolution, and high sensitivity enable observation of multiple conformers, precise measurements of hyperfine splitting arising from nuclear quadrupole coupling due to the nitrogen atom in the cyano group, as well as the observation of singly $^{13}$C- and $^{15}$N-substituted isotopic isomers in natural abundance. Using the latter, precise structures for the molecules are derived. The accurate rotational spectra enabled a search for these species toward the dark, cold molecular cloud TMC-1; no signals are found, and we discuss the implications of derived upper limits on the interstellar chemistry of the cyanocyclohexane family.

 - **Abstract**
 Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are radio pulses that originate from cosmological distance. Over 800 FRB sources with thousands of bursts have been detected, yet their origins remain unknown. Analyse of the energy function and the redshift evolution of volumetric rate could provide crucial insights into FRB progenitors. In this paper, we present the energy functions of non-repeaters selected from the CHIME/FRB baseband data using the $V_\mathrm{max}$ method. The $V_\mathrm{max}$ method allows us to measure redshift evolution without prior assumptions. We observed Schechter-like shapes in the energy function at low redshift region, while high redshift regions show a relatively small slope ($\gamma\approx -2$). The redshift evolution of volumetric rates shows an ambiguous trend, indicating that the population of non-repeaters is still not well understood. In the future, more samples and accurate measurements are needed to clarify these trends.

 - **Abstract**
 The Galactic edge at Galactocentric distances of 14\,--\,22\,kpc provides an ideal laboratory to study molecular clouds in an environment that is different from the solar neighborhood, due to its lower gas density, lower metallicity, and little or no perturbation from the spiral arms. Observations of CO\,($J$\,=\,2--1) spectral lines were carried out towards 72 molecular clouds located at the Galactic edge using the IRAM\,30\,m telescope. Combined with CO\,($J$\,=\,1--0) data from the MWISP project, we investigate the variations of $R_{21}$ across these Galactic edge clouds, with $R_{21}$ representing CO(2-1)/CO(1-0) integrated intensity ratios. These are found to range from 0.3 to 3.0 with a mean of 1.0\,$\pm$\,0.1 in the Galactic edge clouds. The proportions of very low ratio gas (VLRG; $R_{21}$\,<\,0.4), low ratio gas (LRG; 0.4\,$\le$\,$R_{21}$\,<\,0.7), high ratio gas (HRG; 0.7\,$\le$\,$R_{21}$\,<\,1.0), and very high ratio gas (VHRG; $R_{21}$\,$\ge$\,1.0) are 6.9\%, 29.2\%, 26.4\%, and 37.5\%, respectively, indicating a significant presence of high $R_{21}$ ratio molecular gas within these regions. In our Galaxy, the $R_{21}$ ratio exhibits a gradient of initial radial decline followed by a high dispersion with increasing Galacticentric distance and a prevalence for high ratio gas. There is no apparent systematic variation within the Galactocentric distance range of 14 to 22\,kpc. A substantial proportion of HRG and VHRG is found to be associated with compact clouds and regions displaying star-forming activity, suggesting that the high $R_{21}$ ratios may stem from dense gas concentrations and recent episodes of star formation.

          The impact of new ($α$, n) reaction rates on the weak s-process in metal-poor massive stars

 - **Abstract**
 Massive stars are significant sites for the weak s-process (ws-process). $^{22}$Ne and $^{16}$O are, respectively, the main neutron source and poison for the ws-process. In the metal-poor stars, the abundance of $^{22}$Ne is limited by the metallicity, so that the contribution of $^{22}$Ne($\alpha$, n)$^{25}$Mg reaction on the s-process is small. Conversely, the $^{17}$O($\alpha$, n)$^{20}$Ne reaction is more evident in more metal-poor stars due to the most abundant $^{16}$O in all metallicities. In this work, we calculate the evolution of four metal-poor models ($Z=10^{-3}$) for the Zero-Age Main-Sequence (ZAMS) masses of $M ({\rm ZAMS})=$ 15, 20, 25, and 30 M$_{\odot}$ to investigate the effect of reaction rates on the ws-process. We adopt the new $^{17}$O($\alpha$, n)$^{20}$Ne and $^{17}$O($\alpha, \gamma$)$^{21}$Ne reaction rates suggested by Wiescher et al. (2023) and $^{22}$Ne($\alpha$, n)$^{25}$Mg and $^{22}$Ne($\alpha, \gamma$)$^{26}$Mg from Best et al. (2013). The yields of the s-process isotope with updated reaction rates are compared with the results using default reaction rates from JINA REACLIB. We find that the effects of new $^{17}$O+$\alpha$ are much more significant than those of new $^{22}$Ne+$\alpha$ reaction rates in the non-rotation stars.

          Disentangling the Effects of Temperature, Clouds, and Gravity on K I doublet in L dwarfs

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the effects of surface gravity, effective temperature, and cloudiness on the potassium doublet (\ion{K}{1}) at 1.17 {\mu}m in brown dwarf spectra. Using pseudo-Voigt profiles to fit the \ion{K}{1} doublet in Sonora Diamondback atmospheric model spectra, we find that gravity and cloudiness affect the spectra differently in mid to late-L dwarfs. The full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) is strongly correlated with surface gravity, while the maximum depth strongly correlates with cloudiness. This method allows us to separate the effects of clouds and surface gravity on the \ion{K}{1} 1.17 {\mu}m doublet. We also find that the FWHM and maximum depth of the doublet can help to estimate the effective temperature and surface gravity in early to mid-L dwarfs.

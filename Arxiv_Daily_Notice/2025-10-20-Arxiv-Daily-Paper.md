          Black Holes in Globular Clusters: A Structural and Kinematic Perspective

 - **Abstract**
 Black holes (BHs) play a major role in the structural and dynamical evolutions of Globular Clusters (GCs). Several recent works searched for BHs in Galactic GCs using scaling relations derived from numerical simulations. However, the conclusions drawn by such approaches are strongly dependent on the specific prescriptions adopted in numerical simulations. Therefore, we analyzed a survey of 101 Monte Carlo simulations to identify some observable parameters that allow us to probe the present-day BH population in GCs reliably. We thoroughly show that a single observable is not suited to infer the BH mass fraction in real GCs: similar values could be attained by systems with different BH mass fractions, depending on the specific dynamical evolution of the system. Finally, we present a combination of observable parameters that efficiently breaks this degeneracy. We also compare values from numerical simulations with a sample of Galactic GCs.

          Impact of Neutrino Flavor Conversions on Neutron Star Merger Dynamics, Ejecta, Nucleosynthesis, and Multi-Messenger Signals

 - **Abstract**
 We present numerical relativity simulations of binary neutron star mergers incorporating neutrino flavor transformations triggered by fast flavor instability, quantum many-body effects, or potential beyond standard model physics. In both long-lived and short-lived remnant scenarios, neutrino flavor conversions modify species-dependent neutrino luminosities and mean energies, and drive the matter towards more neutron rich conditions. They produce up to $300\%$ more neutron rich ejecta and significantly boost the r-process yields, especially in low-density, near-equatorial outflows. We identify regions unstable to fast flavor instabilities and find that these instabilities persist despite flavor conversions. We further test the sensitivity to the equilibration timescale of the flavor conversions, finding that slower flavor conversions can interact with thermodynamic equilibration, and increase the neutron richness of the ejecta. Flavor conversions may also contribute to stronger gravitational wave and neutrino emissions, pointing to a correlation between neutrino transport and merger dynamics. These results highlight the potential impact of flavor conversions while motivating future work to improve on theoretical understanding of flavor instabilities in global simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the orbital eccentricity evolution of supermassive black hole binaries within galactic environments. We analyze the dynamics in triaxial merger remnants and subsequent interactions with geometrically thick nuclear discs. We confirm that gravitational torques in triaxial potentials efficiently extract angular momentum, resulting in binary formation with high initial eccentricities. We then analyze the binary-disc interaction using a 3D analytical framework incorporating the Airy formalism and potential softening. We present a self-consistent derivation demonstrating that the 3D suppression of high-order torques leads to distinct scalings with disc thickness ($h$): migration rates $\tau_a^{-1} \propto h^{-3}$ and eccentricity damping rates $\tau_e^{-1} \propto h^{-5}$. This establishes a timescale hierarchy, $\tau_e/\tau_a \propto h^2$. For typical parameters ($h\approx 0.2$), eccentricity damping is significantly faster than orbital decay ($\tau_e \approx 0.04 \, \tau_a$). We further develop a wavelet-based formalism to quantify the impact of disc inhomogeneities arising from accretion feedback and turbulence. We derive the stochastic torque variance in the wavelet domain and employ a Fokker-Planck analysis to determine the equilibrium eccentricity distribution. While stochastic fluctuations counteract deterministic damping, the strong damping imposed by the thick disc geometry ensures the equilibrium eccentricity remains small unless the fluctuations are highly non-linear. Hence, even if born highly eccentric, SMBHBs are rapidly circularized. This circularization trap forces binaries to approach the gravitational wave-dominated regime on nearly circular orbits, prolonging the total merger timescale. This introduces a substantial cosmological delay governed by stellar relaxation, which impacts detection rates and the modeling of SMBH assembly in cosmological frameworks.

 - **Abstract**
 Globular clusters (GCs) host multiple stellar populations differing in their chemical and dynamical properties. A number of models for the formation of multiple populations predict that the subsystem of second generation (SG) stars is characterized by a more centrally concentrated spatial distribution and a more rapid rotation than the system of first generation (FG) stars. We present the results of N-body simulations exploring the long-term dynamical evolution of rotating multiple-population GCs. We study the evolution of systems starting with four different orientations of the GC's total internal angular momentum vector relative to the orbital angular momentum. We explore the evolution driven by two-body relaxation and the effects of the GC's interaction with the galactic tidal field. We focus on the kinematic differences between the two generations and we quantify them by exploring the FG and SG rotation velocity and angular momenta. We find that kinematic differences between the generations persist for most of the GCs' lifetimes, although the strength of these differences decreases after a few relaxation times. The differences can be seen most clearly in the lowest-mass stars. We find that the GCs' internal angular momentum gradually aligns with the orbital angular momentum, although there is little difference in this alignment between the FG and SG systems. We also find that stars in the GC's outer regions align with the orbital angular momentum vector more rapidly than those in the inner regions leading to a variation of the orientation of the internal angular momentum with the clustercentric distance. The alignment between internal angular momentum and orbital angular momentum occurs more rapidly for low-mass stars. We study the evolution of the anisotropy in the velocity distribution and find the SG to be characterized by a stronger radial anisotropy than the FG.(abridged)

          Multi-species Dark Matter with Warmth and Randomness

 - **Abstract**
 We present a general analytic framework for the evolution of cosmic structure in multi-species dark matter models that simultaneously incorporates finite velocity dispersion and Poisson fluctuations. Our approach accommodates arbitrary numbers of dark matter components with distinct mass fractions, velocity distributions, and number densities -- ranging from cold particles to warm species and sparse populations such as primordial black holes or solitons. The framework is based on solving a truncated BBGKY hierarchy, whose solution is obtained by solving Volterra integral equations. We provide an efficient algorithm to solve for the total, as well as inter- and intra-species power spectra. Worked examples with two-component mixtures illustrate how isocurvature (initially Poisson) and adiabatic spectra evolve differently depending on the properties of the warm or sparse fraction. This evolution is controlled by the free-streaming and Jeans scales, and the results match analytic estimates and $N$-body simulations.

          Implications of a high growth index on the variation of $G$

 - **Abstract**
 A recent determination of the growth index indicates a value significantly higher than the $\Lambda$CDM prediction, suggesting that alternative scenarios to $\Lambda$CDM may be required. In this work, we investigate whether a time-varying Newton's constant, $G_N$, can account for such a high growth index, $\gamma=0.063\pm0.025$. Adopting a phenomenological approach, we study two parameterizations of the effective gravitational coupling, $G_{\rm eff}$, one based on a Taylor expansion and another linked to the energy density parameter of Dark Energy. We constrain the models with Cosmic Chronometers (CC), Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument baryon acoustic oscillations (data release 2), CMB priors, and a gaussian likelihood for the growth index. We show that the constant $\gamma$ approximation is accurate for the parametrization linked to the energy density parameter of dark energy, but presents a non-negligible error for the other case, which we treat as a systematic error in the analysis. We find a $2.4\sigma-3.4\sigma$ tension level with constant $G_{\rm eff}$, depending on the parametrization. The results indicate that $G_{\rm eff}<G_N$ around the period of accelerated expansion, corresponding to a weaker effective gravitational interaction on cosmological scales, which leads to a suppression of the growth of cosmological structures.

          Wave-Mediated Boundary Layers of Accretion Discs: Role of Internal Structure of the Accretor

 - **Abstract**
 Disc accretion onto astrophysical objects with a material surface proceeds through the boundary layer (BL) -- a radially narrow region in the inner disc where the incoming gas must slow down its rotation before settling onto the surface of the accretor. Here we numerically study a BL in which the angular momentum transport in the layer is accomplished via the excitation of global acoustic waves. While the earlier studies of such wave-mediated BLs typically modeled the internal structure of the central object as a globally isothermal sphere with sharply rising density profile, here we explore the effect of other internal density and temperature profiles on the mode operation. We model the inner structure of an accretor as a polytropic sphere, allowing a shallower increase of density and a non-trivial temperature profile inside the object. While the mix of acoustic modes observed in our long-duration (1000 inner orbits long) 2D hydrodynamic simulations is a weak function of the polytropic index $n$ of the accretor's structure, the mass accretion rate and the angular momentum flux across the BL show a clear dependence on $n$, both decreasing in amplitude as $n$ is lowered. Interestingly, in 2D these transport metrics are better correlated not with $n$ but with a total mass inside the central object contained within the simulation domain. These results improve our understanding of the wave-mediated BL accretion by quantifying the effect of the inner structure of the accretor on the excitation and propagation of acoustic modes mediating the BL transport.

 - **Abstract**
 Super-Earths and mini-Neptunes are missing from our Solar System, yet they appear to be the most abundant planetary types in our Galaxy. A detailed characterization of key planets within this population is important for understanding the formation mechanisms of rocky and gas giant planets and the diversity of planetary interior structures. In 2019, NASA's TESS satellite found a transiting planet candidate in a 17.6-day orbit around the star TOI-283. We started radial velocity (RV) follow-up observations with ESPRESSO to obtain a mass measurement. Mass and radius are measurements critical for planetary classification and internal composition modeling. We used ESPRESSO spectra to derive the stellar parameters of the planet candidate host star TOI-283. We then performed a joint analysis of the photometric and RV data of this star, using Gaussian processes to model the systematic noise present in both datasets. We find that the host is a bright K-type star ($d = 82.4$ pc, $\mathrm{T}_\mathrm{eff} = 5213 \pm 70$ K, $V = 10.4$ mag) with a mass and radius of $\mathrm{M}_\star = 0.80 \pm 0.01\; \mathrm{M}_\odot$ and $\mathrm{R}_\star = 0.85 \pm 0.03\; \mathrm{R}_\odot$. The planet has an orbital period of $P = 17.617$ days, a size of $\mathrm{R}_\mathrm{p} = 2.34 \pm 0.09\; \mathrm{R}_\oplus$, and a mass of $\mathrm{M}_\mathrm{p} = 6.54 \pm 2.04\; \mathrm{M}_\oplus$. With an equilibrium temperature of $\sim$600 K and a bulk density of $\rho_\mathrm{p} = 2.81 \pm 0.93$ g cm$^{-3}$, this planet is positioned in the mass-radius diagram where planetary models predict H$_2$O- and H/He-rich envelopes. The ESPRESSO RV data also reveal a long-term trend that is probably related to the star's activity cycle. Further RV observations are required to confirm whether this signal originates from stellar activity or another planetary body in the system.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an atlas of full-scan spectra from the Short-Wavelength Spectrometer (SWS) aboard the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) after reprocessing and improving an earlier version published 22 years ago. The SWS spectra cover the wavelength range from 2.35 to 45.3 {\mu}m. They include scans in 12 separate bands, and we have updated the methods used to combine those bands into a single continuous spectrum. The main improvement comes from applying multiple constraints, including new photometry and spectra from the Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) on the Spitzer Space Telescope that have become available since the release of the original products, and individualized attention to each spectrum, to renormalize the separate bands into a more consistent single spectrum. In particular this removed unphysical negative fluxes that were common in the original data products. The new database, with 1035 reprocessed spectra, will be available to the community at IRSA, which also hosts the original processing.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational waves from core-collapse supernovae provide a unique probe of the equation of state (EOS) of high density matter. In this work, we focus on the bounce signal from numerical simulations of rotating supernovae and explore its potential for EOS inference. We employ a support vector machine, previously shown to perform best among tested methods, to classify GW signals simulated for 18 EOS models. For optimally oriented sources, we estimate that the Advanced LIGO A+ detector can probe the EOS for Galactic events, while third-generation observatories such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer can reach substantially farther. For randomly oriented sources, only these next-generation detectors are expected to have sufficient sensitivity. These results represent the potential observational range for probing the nuclear EOS, although, due to the simplifying assumptions adopted, they should be regarded as approximate upper limits.

 - **Abstract**
 Direction of arrival (DOA) estimation is mostly performed using specialized arrays that have carefully designed receiver spacing and layouts to match the operating frequency range. In contrast, radio interferometric arrays are designed to optimally sample the Fourier space data for making high quality images of the sky. Therefore, using existing radio interferometric arrays (with arbitrary geometry and wide frequency variation) for DOA estimation is practically infeasible except by using images made by such interferometers. In this paper, we focus on low cost DOA estimation without imaging, using a subset of a radio interferometric array, using a fraction of the data collected by the full array, and, enabling early determination of DOAs. The proposed method is suitable for transient and low duty cycle source detection. Moreover, the proposed method is an ideal follow-up step to online radio frequency interference (RFI) mitigation, enabling the early estimation of the DOA of the detected RFI.

 - **Abstract**
 The next-generation radio-interferometric (RI) telescopes require imaging algorithms capable of forming high-resolution high-dynamic-range images from large data volumes spanning wide frequency bands. Recently, AIRI, a plug-and-play (PnP) approach taking the forward-backward algorithmic structure (FB), has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in monochromatic RI imaging by alternating a data-fidelity step with a regularisation step via learned denoisers. In this work, we introduce HyperAIRI, its hyperspectral extension, underpinned by learned hyperspectral denoisers enforcing a power-law spectral model. For each spectral channel, the HyperAIRI denoiser takes as input its current image estimate, alongside estimates of its two immediate neighbouring channels and the spectral index map, and provides as output its associated denoised image. To ensure convergence of HyperAIRI, the denoisers are trained with a Jacobian regularisation enforcing non-expansiveness. To accommodate varying dynamic ranges, we assemble a shelf of pre-trained denoisers, each tailored to a specific dynamic range. At each HyperAIRI iteration, the spectral channels of the target image cube are updated in parallel using dynamic-range-matched denoisers from the pre-trained shelf. The denoisers are also endowed with a spatial image faceting functionality, enabling scalability to varied image sizes. Additionally, we formally introduce Hyper-uSARA, a variant of the optimisation-based algorithm HyperSARA, promoting joint sparsity across spectral channels via the l2,1-norm, also adopting FB. We evaluate HyperAIRI's performance on simulated and real observations. We showcase its superior performance compared to its optimisation-based counterpart Hyper-uSARA, CLEAN's hyperspectral variant in WSClean, and the monochromatic imaging algorithms AIRI and uSARA.

          Precise frequencies of H$_2^{~16}$O lines protected for radio astronomy

 - **Abstract**
 Precise frequency values have been determined for H$_2^{~16}$O radio lines appearing in protected line lists of the International Astronomical Union and the Panel on Frequency Allocations of the US National Academy of Sciences. The improved precision is attributable to a spectroscopic network built from a large set of near-infrared Lamb-dip lines augmented with a handful of ultrahigh-accuracy rotational transitions. The ultraprecise H$_2^{~16}$O network contains 376 Lamb-dip lines recorded previously via our frequency-comb locked cavity-enhanced spectrometer. During the present study, altogether 55 target lines have been (re)measured at high accuracy. Due to our network-assisted measurements, the accuracy has been significantly improved with respect to previous direct radio-frequency measurements for all the protected lines of H$_2^{~16}$O above 750 GHz. Furthermore, 43 of these protected transitions now benefit from the accuracy of the new near-infrared Lamb dips reported in this paper.

 - **Abstract**
 Multiplicity is ubiquitous among massive stars. While the stellar components usually display similar masses, some binaries with extremely low mass ratios were also observed. Some of them are primordial, while others arise from binary interactions. The identification of systems with extreme mass ratios brings valuable information, notably on the origin of fast rotation in massive stars. We identify new short-period systems with extreme mass ratios through the detection of eclipses and reflection effects. The physical properties of a dozen newly identified cases were precisely evaluated through high-quality photometry and spectroscopy. In addition to characterizing these binaries, we found a clear signature of apsidal motion in one system, and three other systems display long-term shifts in eclipse times. All systems we reported here are composed of a massive star and a cool low-mass companion. They are therefore primordial cases. This doubles the known number of these systems in the Galaxy. In this context, it is important to note that most massive stars in these systems, as well as in previous systems reported in the literature, rotate fast (supersynchronous compared to the orbital motion). The high incidence of fast rotation in these nascent binaries provides strong constraints for star formation models.

          Sensitivity of Nuclear Reaction Rates in X-ray Burst Models

 - **Abstract**
 Type I X-ray bursts (XRBs) are thermonuclear runaways on the surface of accreting neutron stars, powered by rapid proton-capture and alpha-capture processes on neutron-deficient nuclei. Uncertainties in the corresponding reaction rates remain a major limitation in modeling burst light curves and ashes. We present a systematic study of the sensitivity of XRB models to uncertainties in charged-particle-induced reaction rates across a broad parameter space of accretion rates and fuel compositions in low-mass X-ray binaries. The study proceeds in two stages: ignition conditions are first determined with a semi-analytic framework coupled to a full reaction network, followed by a sensitivity analysis using the ONEZONE model with individual rate variations. We identify 41 reactions that alter the burst light curve and 187 that significantly impact final abundances. Reactions on bottleneck isotopes in the alpha-p- and rp-process paths strongly affect both observables, while most (p, gamma) reactions on medium-mass (A > 32) and heavy-mass (A > 55) nuclei influence only the final composition. Medium-mass cases dominate in He-rich bursts, where the reaction flow terminates earlier, while heavy-mass cases appear in mixed H and He bursts with extended rp-process paths reaching A ~ 110. We identify a subset of reactions whose rate uncertainties exert influence on the final 12C yield in helium-rich bursts, which could have important consequences for the mechanism of ignition of carbon superbursts. Our results identify key targets for nuclear reaction experiments to reduce nuclear physics uncertainties in XRB models.

          Event types in H.E.S.S.: a combined analysis for different telescope types and energy ranges

 - **Abstract**
 Imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs) are the main technique for detecting gamma rays with energies between tens of GeV and hundreds of TeV. Amongst them, the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) has pioneered the use of different telescope types to achieve an energy range as broad as possible. A large, 28 m diameter telescope is used in monoscopic mode to access the lowest energies ($E \gtrsim 30$ GeV), while the four smaller, 12 m diameter telescopes are used in stereoscopic mode to study energies between 150 GeV and 100 TeV. Nevertheless, a combination of both telescope types and trigger strategies has proven to be challenging. In this work, we propose for the first time an analysis based on event types capable of exploiting both telescope types, trigger strategies, and the whole energy range of the experiment. Due to the large differences between monoscopic and stereoscopic reconstructions, the types are defined based on Hillas parameters of individual events, resulting in three types (Type M, Type B, and Type A), each dominating over a different energy range. The performances of the new analysis configurations are compared to the standard configurations in the H.E.S.S. Analysis Package (HAP), Mono and Stereo. The proposed analysis provides optimal sensitivity over the whole energy range, in contrast to Mono and Stereo, which focus on smaller energy ranges. On top of that, improvements in sensitivity of 25-45% are found for most of the energy range. The analysis is validated using real data from the Crab Nebula, showing the application to data of an IACT analysis capable of combining significantly different telescope types with significantly different energy ranges. Larger energy coverage, lower energy threshold, smaller statistical uncertainty, and more robustness are observed. The need for a run-by-run correction for the observation conditions is also highlighted.

          Exploring Ultra-Slow-Roll Inflation in Composite Pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone Boson Models: Implications for Primordial Black Holes and Gravitational Waves

 - **Abstract**
 We study inflation driven by a scalar potential arising from composite-sector dynamics, inspired by generalized composite Higgs models. The introduction of a non-minimal coupling, possessing the same functional form as the potential, induces a flattening at large field values that enables successful inflation. We analyze the conditions for ultra-slow-roll inflation, which leads to enhanced curvature perturbations, by combining analytical criteria near the inflection point with comprehensive numerical scans of the parameter space. The region consistent with Cosmic Microwave Background constraints and yielding approximately $N_e \approx 55\text{-}60$ e-folds also predicts primordial black holes with masses in the range $10^3\text{-}10^5\,\mathrm{g}$. Although such ultra-light primordial black holes are typically expected to have evaporated, recent proposals invoking evaporation suppression via memory-burden effects could allow their survival as viable dark matter candidates. Under this assumption, the induced gravitational wave signal peaks in a frequency gap between standard interferometers and resonant-cavity experiments, motivating exploration of this observational frontier.

          Disentangling two spectral components in the X-ray emission of the blazar 1ES 0229+200

 - **Abstract**
 X-ray observations are essential to achieve a deeper understanding of the broadband emission mechanism in blazars. Here, we present a long-term spectral and temporal analysis of X-ray and optical observations of 1E 0229+200 collected with the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory from 2008 to 2024, complemented by hard X-ray observations from the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array NuSTAR. The blazar 1ES 0229+200 is a high-frequency, peaked BL Lac object, known for its exceptionally hard very high-energy (VHE) $\gamma$-ray spectrum extending up to 10 TeV. In August 2021, NuSTAR observed the source in a low X-ray state, revealing a concave spectral shape with a distinct upturn around 25 keV. This feature contrasts with previous observations performed with NuSTAR and Swift-BAT, which showed no such spectral upturn. Previous observations of 1ES 0229+200 and broadband SED (spectral energy distribution) modelling suggest that its X-ray emission extends beyond 100 keV without a significant cutoff. The newly detected spectral upturn may indicate a transition between the synchrotron and inverse Compton components or could be linked to photohadronic processes involving high-energy neutrinos. We discuss the implications of this finding in the context of blazar spectral energy distributions, particularly the potential existence of a third SED bump in the kiloelectronvolt to megaelectronvolt range. The observed spectral features support the hypothesis that 1ES 0229+200 could be a source of high-energy neutrino emission.

 - **Abstract**
 The knowledge of the Venus near-surface atmosphere is sparse. Few spacecrafts landed on the surface and measured winds with amplitudes below 1 m/s. The diurnal cycle of the wind amplitude and orientation is not known. Recent numerical simulations showed that slope winds along topographic structures could strongly impact the direction of winds. This study presents the first mesoscale modelling of such winds on Venus. A change of direction is occurring during the day in the main slopes, with upslope winds at noon due to solar heating and downslope winds at night. This is due to efficient IR cooling of the surface during the night, being colder than its surroundings slope atmospheric environment and leading to displacement of air. The temperature is impacted by the adiabatic cooling/warming induced by those winds. A strong heating effect is occurring for the downslope winds, leading to an anti-correlation between the surface temperature diurnal amplitude and the topography. This diurnal amplitude reaches 4 K in the plains and below 1 K in the mountains. The saltation of sediment by those winds was also quantified, with a higher probability at night along the slopes on the western flanks.

 - **Abstract**
 All future lunar missions require a definition of the lunar reference system and a realization in the form of the lunar reference frame to ensure consistent products for positioning, navigation, cartography, and timing. This paper defines the origin, orientation, and scale of the Lunar Reference System (LRS), as well as provides numerical solutions for the first realization of the International Lunar Reference Frame (ILRF). ILRF is defined as the Principal Axis (PA) system, attached to the surface and co-rotating with the Moon, with its origin in the lunar center of mass (lunocenter). The ILRF realization is based on variance component estimation of the three lunar ephemeris solutions: INPOP21a, DE430, and EPM2021 for the series of the position of the lunar center of mass and rotation Euler angles -- precession, nutation, and proper rotation. The solution is valid starting with the period covered by Lunar Laser Ranging (LLR) data in 1970 and ending with extrapolated ILRF realizations in 2052 for future lunar missions. Results. The combined ILRF is characterized by the mean error of 17.6 cm for 2010-2030, where 15.3 cm comes from the origin and 8.6 cm from the orientation realization. The error in the realization of the origin is mainly caused by a poor geometry of the retroreflector network, resulting in a high correlation between the scale and the X component of the lunocenter in PA. The LLR post-fit residuals in ILRF are at the level of 2-3 cm in terms of the standard deviations of one-way ranges for best-performing LLR stations. The mean errors of the transformation between ILRF and other reference frame realizations in PA are at the level of 3 cm, whereas the mean transformation error to the DE421 Mean Earth frame equals 5 cm.

 - **Abstract**
 Volcanism on Venus has never been directly observed, but several measurements indicate present-day activity. Volcanism could potentially play a role in climatic processes on Venus, especially in the sulfur cycle like on Earth. Observation of volcanic activity is the primary objective of future Venus spacecraft. However, there are many unknowns regarding its Venusian characteristics, like the condition at the vent, the volatile content and composition. Past modelling efforts have only studied explosive volcanic plume propagation over a limited range of flow parameters at the vent and in an idealised Venus atmospheric configuration. We propose to use the 1D FPLUME volcanic plume model in a realistic Venusian environment. In similar Venusian conditions, the height of the plume is consistent with past modelling. The present study shows that explosive volcanism would preferably reach 15 km of altitude. Under certain conditions, plumes are able to reach the VenSpec-H tropospheric altitude range of observations and even the 45 km cloud floor. For the first time, the impact of wind was quantified, and the super-rotating winds have a substantial impact by plume-bending of reducing the height of plumes. Contrary to the Earth, the atmospheric heat capacity depends greatly on temperature, and will disadvantage lower plumes and allow larger plumes to propagate at higher altitudes. The high latitude atmospheric environment, due to the thermal profile and weaker winds, is favorable to plumes reaching higher altitudes.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Cygnus OB2, in the Cygnus X complex -- one of the most active star-forming regions of the Galaxy -- hosts hundreds of O- and B-type stars at different evolutionary stages. This association provides a unique laboratory to study massive star evolution and dynamics. However, despite extensive studies, the absence of a fast-rotating group ($v\sin{i}>200\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$) among the O-type population of Cygnus OB2 challenges current models of massive star evolution. Aims. Stellar rotation strongly impacts spectral line shapes of O-type stars, and high rotation can potentially lead to misclassifications. We investigate whether some stars in Cygnus OB2, classified at low spectral resolution as B0, are actually rapidly rotating late-O types. Such cases could explain the observed lack of fast rotators in Cygnus OB2. Methods. Accounting for rotation, we reclassify the known B0 population in Cygnus OB2, using the MGB tool and both new and pre-existing optical spectroscopy. Finally, we compute projected rotational velocities using iacob-broad. Results. About $19\,\%$ of the initial B0 population in Cygnus OB2 are, in fact, late-O types. Only 6 stars in the entire dataset show $v\sin{i}>200\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$, with just 1 new O-type star exceeding this threshold. Conclusions. In our study of Cygnus OB2, we continue to find a notable lack of fast rotators among its O-type population. We propose a combination of three factors as the most likely explanation: (i) the young age of Cygnus OB2 may imply that fast rotators has not been produced yet due to binary interactions; (ii) fast rotators may have been dynamically ejected from the core as runaway stars; (iii) local star formation conditions may hinder binary formation (reducing spin-up interactions) or result in slower rotational velocities at birth.

 - **Abstract**
 Aims. Studying protostellar objects in their earliest stages, particularly during the Class 0 phase, provides key insight into the beginnings of planet formation and dust evolution. Disentangling the various components, however, is particularly challenging. High spatial and spectral resolution observations of molecular line emission with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) are therefore crucial for probing their complex environments. Methods. In this work, we present high-resolution ($\sim$30 au) ALMA observations at 1.3 millimeters of the Class 0 protostellar system IRAS4A2. Results. We detected large, well-traced outflows in HCN (3-2), H$_{2}$CO$(2_{1~2}-1_{1~1})$, and HCO$^{+}$ (3-2), along with numerous complex organic molecules (COMs) tracing central, more compact regions. Using moment maps, we analyzed the kinematics and spatial distributions of the molecular emission, revealing a wide range of spatial scales, from compact structures within the IRAS4A2 core at $\sim$8 au in radius, to extended $\sim$5000 au outflow emission. Specifically, we find that CH$_{3}$CDO and CH$_{3}$OCHO could be both good tracers of the disk, possibly tracing its rotation. Lines of OCS (22-21), SO$_{2}~(13_{3~11}-13_{2~12})$, HCN, H$_{2}$CO, and HCO$^{+}$, show more extended structures around IRAS4A2, likely tracing the envelope, disk, accretion shocks, the base of an outflow, and the outflow itself. Conclusions. Most COMs appear to trace distinct inner regions near the central protostar, while other molecules trace more extended structures, such as the envelope or outflows. The kinematics, emission patterns, and position-velocity diagrams suggest that individual molecules trace multiple components simultaneously, making it challenging to disentangle their true origins. Altogether, these findings highlight the complex spatial distribution within the IRAS4A2 system. Abridged.

 - **Abstract**
 Studying the SDSS-DR16 quasar catalog, we detect a baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) signal in the two-point angular correlation function with a statistical significance of $3\sigma$, at an effective redshift of $z_{\rm eff}=1.725$. Using a simple parameterization-comprising a polynomial plus a Gaussian function-we measure the transverse BAO scale as $\theta_{\rm BAO}=1.928^{\circ}\pm0.094^{\circ}$. This measurement is obtained from a narrow redshift shell, $z \in [1.72, 1.73]$ (i.e., $\Delta z=0.01$), thin enough that projection-effect corrections are negligible, making it only weakly dependent on the assumed fiducial cosmology. The only assumption adopted is isotropy in the computation of the correlation function, further ensuring that the result depends only weakly on specific cosmological-model hypotheses. We also investigate possible systematics that could affect the detection or significance of the BAO signal and find them to be subdominant or implausible. When combined with other transverse BAO measurements from the literature, our result shows good concordance-within the $1\sigma$ confidence level-with the cosmological parameter values reported by the Planck and DESI collaborations. This new measurement of the transverse BAO scale, obtained from the SDSS quasar sample with minimal cosmological-model assumptions, provides an additional independent constraint for updated statistical studies aimed at probing the nature of dark energy.

 - **Abstract**
 The question of whether genuinely young high-$\alpha$ stars exist has been discussed for over a decade since their discovery from asteroseismology of giant stars as it is challenging to break the degeneracy between the binary interaction and the genuinely young scenarios. Young high-$\alpha$ stars are hard to explain with traditional chemical evolution model as the high-$\alpha$ disk is typically associated with the early epoch of star formation in the Milky Way. Combined with recent advances of gyrochronology, and that $^7$Li can serve as an unambiguous indicator for identifying merger products in dwarfs thanks to its low burning temperature, we identified young high-$\alpha$ dwarf candidate stars through their fast rotation in a previous study. In this paper, we performed high-resolution spectroscopic follow-up of these candidates using Potsdam Echelle Polarimetric and Spectroscopic Instrument (PEPSI), and confirm 3 additional stars that are most likely genuinely young. Together with the star from the earlier paper, we find three out of four of them center around [Fe/H]=-0.5 dex, are ~5 Gyr old, and have a similar amount of elevated Li (~0.5 dex) and Al (~0.1 dex) compared to stars with matching $\log g$, $T_{\rm eff}$, Mg, and Fe within observational uncertainties, hinting at their common formation pathway.

 - **Abstract**
 Two main formation routes have been proposed for interstellar complex organic molecules (iCOMs): on dust grain surfaces and in the gas phase. Observing such molecules in protostellar outflow shock regions - provided that their ages are well-constrained - can help distinguish between these pathways by probing chemical evolution over time. This study focuses on the potential daughter-mother relationship of glycolaldehyde (CH$_2$OHCHO) and ethanol (C$_2$H$_5$OH), previously proposed in the literature. We test whether gas-phase reactions converting ethanol into glycolaldehyde derived in these works can explain the observed abundance of the latter in star-forming regions. We target the southern outflow of L1157, which hosts three shock regions, B0, B1 and B2, of increasing ages: about 900, 1500 and 2300 yr. We obtained high-resolution IRAM NOEMA maps of three lines of glycolaldehyde and one line of ethanol. We derived their abundances in the three shocks and used a pseudo time-dependent astrochemical model to simulate gas-phase and grain-surface formation scenarios for glycolaldehyde. Ethanol is assumed to form on grains and be released in the gas by shocks, where it is gradually converted into glycolaldehyde via the ethanol-tree reaction network. We present the first spatially resolved maps of glycolaldehyde and ethanol in the L1157 southern outflow, and more generally toward solar-like star forming regions. The abundance ratio [CH$_2$OHCHO]/[C$_2$H$_5$OH] increases from B1 to B2, consistent with model predictions. However, the model cannot reproduce all three shocked regions simultaneously, suggesting that one of the assumptions of our model, such as the same excitation temperature and grain composition in B0, B1 and B2, or gas temperature evolution, is wrong. Nonetheless, our modeling rules out the possibility that all the observed gaseous glycolaldehyde is a grain-surface product.

 - **Abstract**
 With the growing number of gamma-ray monitors in operation, several research teams have adopted a strategy of joint operation and scientific duty to improve efficiency. A successful example is the GECAM-HXMT-SVOM (GHS) constellation collaboration, which sets a precedent for other gamma-ray monitor constellations. However, joint duty also presents challenges to Burst Advocates (BAs), including the increased number of triggers and, more importantly, the frequent switching between various systems due to incompatibilities among different missions, which complicates the situation. To address the current requirements of multi-wavelength and multi-messenger astronomy, we developed a customized framework for unified trigger processing within the GHS joint duty, named "BA's Rapid Evaluation and Analysis Kit for Formulating Alerts and Summary Tools" (BREAKFAST). This framework incorporates a series of automated, semi-automated, and manual pipelines designed to rapidly process triggers of prompt emissions in the gamma-ray band from different instruments, while maintaining flexible compatibility for future missions. The pursuit of BREAKFAST goes beyond merely providing trigger processing for BAs. BREAKFAST also aims to filtering high-value targets and guiding follow-up telescopes through rapid analysis and reporting, thus serving as an important bridge between prompt emission observations and afterglow observations. To this end, a suite of comprehensive analysis modules is included in BREAKFAST, particularly the specially designed module that predicts X-ray afterglow brightness based on prompt emission properties. The framework's effectiveness has already been demonstrated in recent observational campaigns, and it is expected to play a significant role in the discovery and observation of peculiar transients in the future.

 - **Abstract**
 HD 100453 disk is a prototypical companion-disk interaction system hosting a pair of spirals and a substellar companion. We present new noncoronagraphic high-contrast imaging observations of HD 100453 with $V$ filter on SPHERE/ZIMPOL. We combined high-contrast imaging data of the reflected light from 0.55 to 2.2 $\mu m$ using the $V$, $I'$, $J$, and $Ks$ band data of ZIMPOL and IRDIS at VLT/SPHERE. For each observational epoch, we corrected for the smearing effect to derive the intrinsic disk-integrated polarized flux. We derived a steady increase with wavelengths from $\hat{Q}_{\varphi}/I_{\star}(V)=0.3\%$ to $\hat{Q}_{\varphi}/I_{\star}(K)=1.2\%$. We applied reference differential imaging to extract the disk intensity for the $V$ and $Ks$ bands using star hopping observations. We obtained the first $V$-band total intensity for HD 100453 with ZIMPOL star hopping. The integrated total flux $I_{\rm disk}/I_{\star}(V)=1.5\%$ increases to $I_{\rm disk}/I_{\star}(K)=4.8\%$. Both the total intensity and the polarization fraction show red colors, and the intrinsic maximum degree of polarization increases moderately from $40\%$ to $55\%$. We then used RADMC-3D radiative transfer modeling with a parametrized Henyey-Greenstein phase function to constrain the dust properties. From the $V$ to $Ks$ band, the dominating dust in the outer disk has an increasing scattering albedo and degree of polarization, while the asymmetry parameter slightly decreases. The outer disk of HD 100453 contains sub-micron-sized low porosity grains/aggregates. The cavity in scattered light is not empty and is replenished with optically thin dust with a maximum size of $\leq 0.1\mu m$. The linear polarization is higher in the spiral region than in the other regions, suggesting different dust properties in those regions.

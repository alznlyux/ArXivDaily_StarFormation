 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the use of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Decomposition-LSTM (DLSTM) networks, combined with an ensemble algorithm, to predict solar flare occurrences using time-series data from the GOES catalog. The dataset spans from 2003 to 2023 and includes 151,071 flare events. Among approximately possible patterns, 7,552 yearly pattern windows are identified, highlighting the challenge of long-term forecasting due to the Sun's complex, self-organized criticality-driven behavior. A sliding window technique is employed to detect temporal quasi-patterns in both irregular and regularized flare time series. Regularization reduces complexity, enhances large flare activity, and captures active days more effectively. To address class imbalance, resampling methods are applied. LSTM and DLSTM models are trained on sequences of peak fluxes and waiting times from irregular time series, while LSTM and DLSTM, integrated with an ensemble approach, are applied to sliding windows of regularized time series with a 3-hour interval. Performance metrics, particularly TSS (0.74), recall (0.95) and the area under the curve (AUC=0.87) in the receiver operating characteristic (ROC), indicate that DLSTM with an ensemble approach on regularized time series outperforms other models, offering more accurate large-flare forecasts with fewer false errors compared to models trained on irregular time series. The superior performance of DLSTM is attributed to its ability to decompose time series into trend and seasonal components, effectively isolating random noise. This study underscores the potential of advanced machine learning techniques for solar flare prediction and highlights the importance of incorporating various solar cycle phases and resampling strategies to enhance forecasting reliability.

 - **Abstract**
 The discovery of the third interstellar object (ISO), 3I/ATLAS (`3I'), provides a rare chance to directly observe a small body from another Solar System. Studying its chemistry and dynamics will add to our understanding of how the processes of planetesimal formation and evolution happen across the Milky Way's disk, and how such objects respond to the Milky Way's potential. In this Letter, we present a first assessment of 3I in the context of the Ōtautahi-Oxford model, which uses data from Gaia in conjunction with models of protoplanetary disk chemistry and Galactic dynamics to predict the properties of the ISO population. The model shows that both the velocity and radiant of 3I are within the expected range. Its velocity suggests an origin within the Milky Way's thick disk, making it the first ISO from this population, and predicts a high water mass fraction, which may become observable shortly. We also conclude that it is very unlikely that 3I shares an origin with either of the previous two interstellar object detections.

 - **Abstract**
 We describe the drizzling pipeline and contents of the drizzled database for Hubble Space Telescope Cycle 27-29 Archival Legacy project "SKYSURF," the largest archival project ever approved for Hubble. SKYSURF aims to investigate the extragalactic background light (EBL) using all 143,914 ACSWFC, WFC3UVIS, and WFC3IR images that have been taken by Hubble since its launch in 2002. SKYSURF has produced 38,027 single-visit mosaics and 7,893 multi-visit mosaics across 28 ACSWFC, WFC3UVIS, and WFC3IR filters using non-standard drizzling methods, which include preserving the lowest sky-level of each visit/group in the drizzled products, applying wider apertures for cosmic ray rejection, correcting effects caused by charge transfer efficiency (CTE) degradation, and removing potential light gradients from input images via sky-map subtraction. We generate source catalogs for all drizzled products with Source Extractor and provide updated star-galaxy separation parameters and integrated galaxy light (IGL) estimates for 25 of the 28 SKYSURF filters (wavelength range 0.2-1.7 microns) using a novel IGL fitting method made possible by the vast SKYSURF dataset. We discuss the data processing and data analysis challenges encountered, detail our solutions, and offer suggestions that may facilitate future large-scale IGL investigations with Webb, SPHEREx, and Roman.

 - **Abstract**
 We assess the computational feasibility of end-to-end Bayesian analysis of the JAXA-led LiteBIRD experiment by analysing simulated time ordered data (TOD) for a subset of detectors through the Cosmoglobe and Commander3 framework. The data volume for the simulated TOD is 1.55 TB, or 470 GB after Huffman compression. From this we estimate a total data volume of 238 TB for the full three year mission, or 70 TB after Huffman compression. We further estimate the running time for one Gibbs sample, from TOD to cosmological parameters, to be approximately 3000 CPU hours. The current simulations are based on an ideal instrument model, only including correlated 1/f noise. Future work will consider realistic systematics with full end-to-end error propagation. We conclude that these requirements are well within capabilities of future high-performance computing systems.

          Unveiling the dark Universe with HI and EMBER-2

 - **Abstract**
 Next-generation radio telescopes will provide unprecedented data volumes of the neutral hydrogen (HI) distribution across cosmic time. Combining weak lensing surveys with spatial and kinematic observations of HI could help constrain key properties of dark matter, such as its mass, clustering behavior, and spatial distribution. However, inferring dark matter properties from HI observations is challenging because of processes related to galaxy formation, such as stellar feedback. Methods that use empirical relations, often calibrated via numerical simulations, do not use full field-level information to model the complex relation between dark matter and HI. We address this shortcoming with a data-driven approach, leveraging the recently introduced EMBER-2 model to learn the HI-dark matter mapping at the field level for a wide redshift range, z=6-0. After training on cosmological galaxy formation simulations run with FIRE-2, EMBER-2 accurately recovers key statistics, including dark matter mass fractions and surface density profiles. The HI-dark matter density cross-correlation is reconstructed at an accuracy of 10% down to scales of k = 100 h/cMpc, a significant improvement over traditional approaches. The presented method may become a key ingredient in future inference pipelines as it can be readily integrated into downstream analysis tasks of radio surveys.

          Probing Binary Architectures of Lithium-Rich Giants in GALAH with COSMIC and Stellar Models

 - **Abstract**
 Surface lithium is depleted when a star goes through the first dredge-up phase, yet $1\%$ of red giants are found to be Li-rich. The formation mechanism for these remains uncertain. We combine observational constraints from GALAH Li-rich giants, with the binary population synthesis code COSMIC to investigate system properties of these objects assuming binary mass transfer. By evolving 9 million binary systems, we find that binary histories most consistent with observational constraints are mass transfer from an intermediate-mass AGB donor to a main-sequence star now observed as a Li-rich red giant. In GALAH, $9\%$ of main-sequence stars have $\rm A(Li)=2.5-3.2$ dex making it plausible to create red giants with $\rm A(Li)=1.5-2.2 \; dex$ via main-sequence mass transfer, but cannot explain the more enriched giants $\rm A(Li) \gtrsim 2.2 \; dex$. Nucleosynthetic yields from stellar models show that AGB stars with initial masses of $4.25-5 \; \rm M_\odot$ and $8 \; \rm M_\odot$ contain the most Li in their ejecta. Intermediate-mass AGB stars comprise $29\%$ of COSMIC results, with present-day separations $s=3.3\pm0.5 \rm \; AU$ and mass ratios $q=0.5-1.6$. We achieve $95\%$ agreement in mean enhancements in $\rm (Ba, Y)$ between GALAH observations and stellar models of 6 and $8 \rm \; M_\odot$ AGB, assuming $1\%$ mass transfer efficiency. We find a low mass transfer efficiency best reproduces GALAH observations suggesting that the preferred mass transfer mechanism for Li-enrichment is via wind Roche Lobe Overflow. While we constrain the most plausible binary parameters assuming AGB mass transfer creates Li-rich giants, discrepancies in nucleosynthesis comparisons, and the small fraction of Li-enhanced main-sequence stars suggests additional enrichment mechanisms are likely.

          Evolution of the ZTF SLRN-2020 star-planet merger

 - **Abstract**
 We model the optical and infrared transient ZTF SLRN-2020, previously associated with a star-planet merger. We consider the scenario in which orbital decay via tidal dissipation led to the merger, and find that tidal heating within the star was likely unobservable in the archival image of the system taken $12\mathrm{yr}$ before the merger. The observed dust formation months before the merger is consistent with a planet of mass $M_\mathrm{p} \gtrsim 5M_\mathrm{J}$ ejecting material as it skims the stellar surface. This interaction gradually intensifies, leading to significant mass ejection on a dynamical timescale ($ \approx $ hours) as the planet plunges into the stellar interior. Part of the recombination transient associated with this dynamical mass ejection might be inaccessible to the optical observations because its duration ($ \approx $ hours) is comparable to the cadence. Correspondingly, the observed duration of the transient $\approx100\mathrm{d}$ is inconsistent with a single episode of dynamical mass ejection. Instead, the transient could be powered by the recombination of $ \approx 3.4\times10^{-5}M_\odot $ of hydrogen in an outflow, or the contraction of an inflated envelope of mass $ \approx 10^{-6}M_\odot $ that formed during the merger. The observed ejecta mass $320\mathrm{d}$ after the peak of the optical transient is $ \approx 1.3\times10^{-4}M_\odot$, consistent with the idea that a fraction of the ejecta might be unobservable in the light curve. Energetically, this post-merger ejecta mass suggests a planet at least as massive as Jupiter. Our results suggest that ZTF SLRN-2020 was the result of a merger between a star close to the main sequence and a planet with mass at least several times that of Jupiter.

 - **Abstract**
 We study a simple setup with dark matter halos in real space, with the amplitude of the linear density field $A$ as the only free cosmological parameter. We show that Eulerian perturbation theory is adequate for describing this system on large scales, compute the leading $n$-point functions and perform a joint power spectrum, bispectrum and trispectrum analysis. Beyond the bispectrum which is crucial for breaking the degeneracy between $A$ and the linear bias, we find that addition of the trispectrum reduces the error on $A$ by only $20-30\%$. Our results for the joint analysis are in good agreement with recent field-level analyses in the same setup. This implies that the field-level inference on large scales does not get significant information from large displacements beyond those in Eulerian kernels or higher-order $n$-point functions beyond the trispectrum. We provide further evidence for this showing that the dependence of the error bars on the maximum wavenumbers used in the analysis is the same in the two approaches. Our results are in disagreement with some of the recent joint power spectrum and bispectrum analyses using likelihood-free inference based on perturbative forward modeling. We discuss a possible origin of this discrepancy and highlight the importance of resolving it in order to have the optimal results in cosmological analyses based on perturbation theory.

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, the structural, astrophysical, kinematic, and Galactic orbital parameters of the open clusters Czernik 41 and NGC 1342, as well as their dynamical evolution, are investigated using CCD UBV photometry and Gaia data. By applying the UPMASK algorithm to Gaia astrometric data for the estimation of cluster membership probabilities, we have determined that 382 stars in Czernik 41 and 111 stars in NGC 1342 exhibit the highest statistical likelihood of being cluster members. Fundamental parameters (including reddening, metallicity, distance, and age) were derived using both classical methods, where parameters are determined separately, and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, where parameters are estimated simultaneously. The results obtained from both approaches are in agreement, confirming the reliability of the derived parameters and demonstrating their robustness against potential degeneracies. The distances to Czernik 41 and NGC 1342 were determined as 2485$\pm$151 pc and 645$\pm$42 pc, respectively, while their ages were estimated to be 69$\pm$10 Myr and 1000$\pm$50 Myr. The metallicity values ([Fe/H]) were found to be 0.07$\pm$0.09 dex for Czernik 41 and -0.14$\pm$0.07 dex for NGC 1342. The stellar mass functions for both clusters were derived, yielding slopes of $\Gamma$=1.67$\pm$0.23 for Czernik 41 and $\Gamma$ =1.56$\pm$0.41 for NGC 1342. Kinematic orbit analysis indicates that Czernik 41 originated within the Solar circle, whereas NGC 1342 formed outside it.

 - **Abstract**
 WD-1856b+534b (WD-1856b) is to date the only detected cold Jupiter outside of our Solar System. This cold Jupiter can provide useful information about the cold giants in our Solar System. Recent JWST observations have targeted WD-1856b, with more scheduled in the near future. To support the interpretation of these observations, we simulated WD-1856b using a three-dimensional (3D) General Circulation Model (GCM) and produced synthetic emission spectra of the planet. We used the Exo-FMS GCM with correlated-k radiative transfer (RT) and mixing-length theory (MLT). In addition, we included abundances of 13 chemical species using the thermochemical kinetic model mini-chem. Because there are substantial uncertainties in the metallicity and internal temperature of WD-1856b, we ran simulations with 1x, 10x, and 100x solar compositions and at low and high internal temperatures (100 K and 500 K). We generated emission spectra and brightness temperature curves with the GCM output using the 3D Monte Carlo radiative-transfer code gCMCRT. Our results suggest larger volume mixing ratios (VMR) of CO and \CO2 with a warmer core at higher metallicity. With a colder core, H2O and CH4 become more relevant and increase to 0.01 VMR at 100x Solar. We suggest possible \H2O cloud formation in the upper atmosphere in the warm 100x solar case and in all cold cases, which may reduce gas phase H2O in the upper atmosphere moderately.

 - **Abstract**
 The dynamical stability of differentially rotating neutron stars, including hypermassive neutron stars, is of paramount importance in understanding the fate of the post-merger remnant of binary neutron stars mergers and the formation of a black hole during core collapse supernovae. We study systematically the dynamical stability of differentially rotating neutron stars within a broad range of masses, rotation rates and degrees of differential rotation, modeled as polytropes with $\Gamma=2$. We pay particular attention to quasi-toroidal configurations that are outside the parameter space region explored in previous works. We estimate the limits of the region of stability against quasi-radial perturbations by performing an extensive set of numerical simulations. We find that some of the stability criteria proposed in the past are not sufficient nor necessary to determine stability if differential rotation is present and propose a new more general criterion. We show that there is a large parameter space that allows for quasi-toroidal configurations that will not collapse immediately to a black hole and that can sustain masses up to $\sim 2.5$ times the maximum mass of a non-rotating neutron star.

 - **Abstract**
 Type Ia supernovae have provided fundamental observational data in the discovery of the late acceleration of the expansion of the Universe in cosmology. However, this analysis has relied on the assumption of a Gaussian distribution for the data, a hypothesis that can be challenged with the increasing volume and precision of available supernova data. In this work, we rigorously assess this Gaussianity hypothesis and analyze its impact on parameter estimation for dark energy cosmological models. We utilize the Pantheon+ dataset and perform a comprehensive statistical, analysis including the Lilliefors and Jarque-Bera tests, to assess the normality of both the data and model residuals. We find that the Gaussianity assumption is untenable and that the redshift distribution is more accurately described by a t-distribution, as indicated by the Kolmogorov Smirnov test. Parameters are estimated for a model incorporating a nonlinear cosmological interaction for the dark sector. The free parameters are estimated using multiple methods, and bootstrap confidence intervals are constructed for them.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the optical properties of exoplanet cloud particles is a top priority. Many cloud condensates form as nonspherical particles and their optical properties can be very different from those of spheres. In this study, we focus on KCl particles, which likely form as cuboids in warm (T=500-1000K) exoplanet atmospheres. We compare the phase functions (at 532 nm wavelength) of KCl particles computed with Mie theory, the two-term Henyey-Greenstein (TTHG) approximation, laboratory data, and the discrete dipole approximation (DDA). Mie theory assumes scattering from spheres, while TTHG functions are used to approximate cloud scattering in two-stream radiative transfer models like PICASO. Laboratory measurements and DDA allow for a robust understanding of scattering from cuboid and deformed cuboid particle shapes. We input these phase functions into PICASO using cloud distributions from the cloud model Virga, to determine how different phase functions can impact the reflected-light intensities of the benchmark sub-Neptune, GJ 1214b. Simulated reflected light phase curves of GJ1214b produced using the TTHG, laboratory, and DDA phase curves differ by less than 3ppm. Our findings suggest that TTHG phase functions may be useful for approximating the scattering intensity of certain cuboid and irregular particle shapes. Future work should expand upon the wavelengths and particles considered to better determine when scattering approximations, like TTHG, may be useful in lieu of more accurate, but time-consuming laboratory measurements and/or nonspherical scattering theory.

          Investigating the extent of bladed terrain on Pluto via photometric surface roughness

 - **Abstract**
 NASA's New Horizons spacecraft discovered fields of sub-parallel sets of steep ridges situated in the high-altitude, low-latitude regions in Pluto's encounter hemisphere called 'bladed terrain'. Thought to be formed due to sublimational erosion of methane ice, bladed terrain represents an active response of Pluto's landscape to current and past climates. The observation of a strong methane signature within the low latitudes of Pluto's non-encounter hemisphere points to the possibility that this terrain type is also present there. To test this hypothesis, in the absence of high resolution images of Pluto's non-encounter hemisphere, we employ photometric analysis of the methane rich regions. We specifically focus on determining the macroscopic surface roughness in selected images, whose photometric-effect can be apparent even in low-resolution images. We employ the `crater-roughness' photometric model of Buratti & Veverka (1985), which assumes that the surface is covered with parabolic depressions defined by a depth-to-radius ratio parameter $q$ (higher $q$ values correspond to rougher surfaces). Despite the high uncertainty in the retrieved roughness values from our analysis, we can safely conclude that the hypothesized bladed terrain region on the non-encounter hemisphere of Pluto is very rough ($q = 0.47_{-0.11}^{+0.10}$, 2$\sigma$), with the median roughness more than twice that of other broad regions of Pluto studied in this work, including the encounter-hemisphere bladed terrain region ($q = 0.21_{-0.18}^{+0.08}$, 2$\sigma$).

 - **Abstract**
 Ultra-stripped supernovae are core-collapse supernovae from progenitors that lose a significant fraction of mass because of the binary interactions with their compact companion stars. Ultra-stripped supernovae have been connected to fast-evolving faint Type Ib or Ic supernovae. Here, we show that in some cases ultra-stripped supernovae can result in Type Ibn supernovae. Progenitors of ultra-stripped supernovae may trigger violent silicon burning shortly before the core collapse, leading to mass ejection that results in a dense circumstellar matter. By taking an ultra-stripped supernova progenitor that loses 0.2 Msun at 78 days before the core collapse, we compute the light-curve evolution of the ultra-stripped supernova within the dense circumstellar matter. The core collapse results in a supernova explosion with an ejecta mass of 0.06 Msun and an explosion energy of 9e49 erg. Because the dense circumstellar matter is more massive than the supernova ejecta, the ejecta are immediately decelerated and the light curve is powered mainly by the circumstellar interaction. Therefore, this ultra-stripped supernova is likely observed as a Type Ibn supernova. We suggest that some Type Ibn supernovae may originate from ultra-stripped supernova progenitors losing significant mass shortly before their explosion due to violent silicon burning.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate whether a novel method of quantum machine learning (QML) can identify anomalous events in X-ray light curves as transient events and apply it to detect such events from the XMM-Newton 4XMM-DR14 catalog. The architecture we adopt is a quantum version of the long-short term memory (LSTM) where some fully connected layers are replaced with quantum circuits. The LSTM, making predictions based on preceding data, allows identification of anomalies by comparing predicted and actual time-series data. The necessary training data are generated by simulating active galactic nucleus-like light curves as the species would be a significant population in the XMM-Newton catalog. Additional anomaly data used to assess trained quantum LSTM (QLSTM) models are produced by adding flares like quasi-periodic eruptions to the training data. Comparing various aspects of the performances of the quantum and classical LSTM models, we find that QLSTM models incorporating quantum superposition and entanglement slightly outperform the classical LSTM (CLSTM) model in expressive power, accuracy, and true-positive rate. The highest-performance QLSTM model is then used to identify transient events in 4XMM-DR14. Out of 40154 light curves in the 0.2--12 keV band, we detect 113 light curves with anomalies, or transient event candidates. This number is $\approx$ 1.3 times that of anomalies detectable with the CLSTM model. By utilizing SIMBAD and four wide-field survey catalogs made by ROSAT, SkyMapper, Pan-STARRS, and WISE, no possible counterparts are found for 12 detected anomalies.

 Globular Clusters (GCs) displaying extended structures are becoming increasingly ubiquitous in the Milky Way (MW). Despite their low surface brightness, which makes disentangling the true structure from the MW overwhelmingly difficult, the increasing availability of multi-dimensional data sets has allowed for new detections of extended GC structure. This work utilises the Pristine-Gaia-Synthetic catalogue released as part of the Pristine Surveys first data release to search for tidally stripped stars in the peripheries of MW GCs. Pristine provides photometric [Fe/H] measurements based on CaHK-band photometry. Using unsupervised machine learning techniques, we provided lists of extra-tidal stars for 30 GCs, one of the largest surveys of its kind. We find that (1) 22 GCs that passed our quality cut have extended structure within 5 deg from the cluster centers of which six are new tentative detections, (2) four of those GCs exhibit diffuse envelope-like extra-tidal features, while the remaining GCs exhibit tidal tail-like structures. We measure the position angles of the extended structures, find broad consistency between the position angles and the GC orbits, and discuss our results concerning N-body models. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of adding photometric metallicities to the multi-dimensional search of extended tidal structure and how the upcoming multi-object spectrographs will be crucial for exploring GC peripheries in the coming years.

 - **Abstract**
 We provide a simple yet effective semi-analytical approach to confront Mukhanov Parametrization of inflationary equation-of-state, $1+\omega =\frac{\beta}{({N}+1)^\alpha}$, with the latest ACT-DR6 data employing Hamilton-Jacobi formulation. We find that equation-of-state formalism comes up with excellent fit to the latest data. In the process we are also able to put stringent constraint on the two model parameters. In order to get the bounds of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ we have also made use of the recent finding $r<0.032$. We have further utilized results from the joint analysis of ACT-DR6, Planck-2018 and DESI-Y1 data to find the observationally viable region for $\alpha$ and $\beta$. We have also employed the predictions on primordial gravity waves from forthcoming CMB missions in the likes of CMB-S4 and LiteBIRD along with results from the combination of ACT-DR6, Planck-2018 and DESI-Y1 data to further restrict the model parameters. We find that detection of gravity waves would help us narrow the viable parameter space for Mukhanov parametrization. But in the absence of detection of primordial gravity waves signal by those CMB missions parameter space is reduced significantly for $\beta$, while the range for $\alpha$ is slightly increased. In addition we observe that, $\alpha$ is primarily dependent on the observationally viable range for scalar spectral index while other model parameter $\beta$ is resting heavily on the restriction upon the amplitude of primordial gravity waves. We find that equation-of-state formalism has a wide range of parameter values consistent with recent observational data set along with futuristic CMB missions in the likes of CMB-S4 and LiteBIRD.

 - **Abstract**
 PRATUSH -- Probing ReionizATion of the Universe using Signal from Hydrogen -- is a proposed cosmology experiment to detect the global red-shifted 21-cm signal from the Cosmic Dawn and Epoch of Reionization (CD/EoR). PRATUSH orbiting the Moon will seek to precisely measure the low-frequency radio sky-spectrum over 40 to 200 MHz. The scientific observations would be made in the radio-quiet region when in the farside of the Moon, and the data would be transmitted back to Earth when in the near-side. PRATUSH was proposed to the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) during a call for proposals in the announcement of opportunity for science payloads in 2018. PRATUSH is in the pre-project studies phase. Here we present a mission concept and baseline design of the proposed payload optimized to operate over the Cosmic Dawn signal band of 55 - 110 MHz. Starting with a description of the fundamental design principles followed, we discuss the PRATUSH baseline design and sensitivity. We further enumerate the challenges that are common to most PRATUSH like experiments, which have been proposed to seek a detection of the CD/EoR signal in orbit in the lunar farside. Due to the highly sensitive nature of the measurement, PRATUSH is designed to operate as a solo experiment with a dedicated spacecraft. Our simulations, assuming a mission lifetime of two years, estimate that PRATUSH would have the sensitivity required to detect the CD signal predicted by the standard models with varying degrees of confidence.A concept model of PRATUSH is under development, which is expected to lead to the engineering model followed by flight model subject to mission approval.

 - **Abstract**
 Probing ReionizATion of the Universe using Signal from Hydrogen (PRATUSH) is a proposed space-based radiometer that aims to detect the sky-averaged 21-cm signal from Cosmic Dawn - a crucial phase in the cosmic evolution of the Universe. PRATUSH will operate in the frequency range of 55-110 MHz. PRATUSH will conduct observations in low earth orbit in its first phase, followed by lunar orbit in the second phase. Digital correlation spectrometer is an integral subsystem of PRATUSH radiometer, enabling phase switching, digitization and generation of sky spectrum. The digital correlation spectrometer for PRATUSH laboratory model features 10-bit analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) and a Virtex-6 Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). A Raspberry Pi 4 Model B-based single-board computer (SBC) serves as the master controller, real-time processor and data recorder, to minimize the power, mass and volume requirement of the laboratory model. This paper presents the implementation of the PRATUSH laboratory model digital receiver, challenges arising from the use of an SBC in place of a conventional computer, and demonstrates the performance of the spectrometer when integrated with the PRATUSH laboratory model analog receiver.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the analysis of the stellar populations and kinematics of the globular cluster (GC) rich ultra-diffuse galaxy, PUDG-R21, using spectroscopic observations obtained with the Keck Cosmic Web Imager (KCWI). The recessional velocity is measured to be 5536$\pm$10 km s$^{\mathrm{-1}}$, confirming its association with the Perseus cluster. The galaxy exhibits mild rotation of 15.6$\pm$10 km s$^{\mathrm{-1}}$ and a stellar velocity dispersion of 19.4$\pm$3.5 km s$^{\mathrm{-1}}$ within the galaxy effective radius. From this, we infer a dynamical mass of M$_{\mathrm{dyn}}=9.3\pm3.3\times10^{8}$ M$_{\odot}$. Based on a halo mass derived from PUDG-R21 GC counts, we find our dynamical mass is consistent with a cored dark matter profile. The integrated stellar population analysis reveals a predominantly old stellar population of 10.4$\pm$1.2 Gyr, with intermediate-low metallicity ([M/H]=-0.64$\pm$0.12 dex) and elevated alpha abundances ([Mg/Fe]=0.38$\pm$0.25 dex). The inferred star formation history suggests rapid stellar assembly, likely truncating prior to or during the galaxy's infall into the cluster at an early epoch ($\sim$10 Gyr ago). The analysis of stellar population gradients (age and metallicity) indicates a flat profile out to one effective radius. Here, we consider the involvement of two star formation events, initially forming a large population of metal-poor globular clusters, and then the latter contributing to the more metal-enriched diffuse stellar body. The evidence of subsequent star formation suggests this galaxy is more like an extension of the classical dwarf population than the much discussed failed galaxy UDGs.

 - **Abstract**
 Radio emissions from extensive air showers (EAS) provide a valuable tool for detecting ultra-high-energy (UHE) astroparticles. In this context, several radio arrays focus on detecting highly inclined EAS, as this enables the observation of Earth-skimming UHE neutrinos, in addition to cosmic rays and gamma rays. The reconstruction of such inclined events relies heavily on a thorough understanding of the radio features observed on the ground, with the Cherenkov cone being one of the most prominent. In this study, we demonstrate that the Cherenkov cone can be accurately described for inclined air showers using basic propagation principles. Furthermore, we have developed an analytical model that computes the expected opening angles of the cone and reproduces the asymmetry effects observed in simulations. The high accuracy of these computations can enhance current reconstruction methods and pave the way for the development of new ones.

          A New Search Pipeline for Short Gamma Ray Bursts in Fermi/GBM Data -- A 50% Increase in the Number of Detections

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we present the development and the results of a new search pipeline for short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs) in the publicly available data from the Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM) on board the Fermi satellite. This pipeline uses rigorous statistical methods that are designed to maximize the information extracted from the Fermi/GBM detectors. Our approach differs substantially from existing search efforts in several aspects: The pipeline includes the construction of template banks, Poisson matched filtering, background estimation, background misestimation correction, automatic routines to filter contaminants, statistical estimation of the signal location and a quantitative estimator of the signal probability to be of a cosmological, terrestrial, or solar origin. Our analysis also includes operating the pipeline on "time-slided" copies of the data, which allows exact significance assessment and $p_{\text{astro}}$ computation, akin to the state-of-the-art gravitational waves (GW) data analysis pipelines. Depending on the spectral properties of the bursts, our pipeline achieves a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) improvement by a factor of 2 to 15 over the onboard GBM triggering algorithm. This enhancement increases the detectable volume for sGRBs and results in an approximate 50% increase in sGRB detections in the 2014 GBM dataset. As a further consequence of the sensitivity increase, we detect hundreds of soft gamma-ray flares of galactic origin. This improved sensitivity enhances the chances of detecting fainter, off-axis GRBs that would likely fall below the standard triggering thresholds. Applying this pipeline to the full GBM archive is expected to expand further the joint sGRB-GW detection volume.

          Numerical Validation of the Yarkovsky Effect in Super-Fast Rotating Asteroids

 - **Abstract**
 Recent discoveries show that asteroids spinning in less than a few minutes undergo sizeable semi-major-axis drifts, possibly driven by the Yarkovsky effect. Analytical formulas can match these drifts only if very low thermal inertia is assumed, implying a dust-fine regolith or a highly porous interior that is difficult to retain under such extreme centrifugal forces. With analytical theories of the Yarkovsky effect resting on a set of assumptions, their applicability to cases of super-fast rotation should be verified. We aim to evaluate the validity of the analytical models in such scenarios and to determine whether the Yarkovsky effect can explain the observed drift in rapidly rotating asteroids. We have developed a numerical model of the Yarkovsky effect tailored to super-fast rotators. The code resolves micrometre-scale thermal waves on millisecond time steps, capturing the steep gradients that arise when surface thermal inertia is extremely low. A new 3-D heat-conduction and photon-recoil solver is benchmarked against the THERMOBS thermophysical code and the analytical solution of the Yarkovsky effect, over a range of rotation periods and thermal conductivities. The analytical Yarkovsky drift agrees well with the numerical solver. For thermal conductivities from $0.0001$ to $1$ $\mathrm{Wm^{-1}K^{-1}}$ and spin periods as short as 10 s, the two solutions differ by no more than $15\%$. Applied to the 34-s rapid rotator 2016 GE1, the best match of the measured drift is obtained with $\Gamma\lesssim20$ $\mathrm{Jm^{-2}K^{-1}s^{-1/2}}$, a value that implies $\sim100$ K temperature swings each spin cycle. This confirms that the observed semi-major axis drifts for super-fast rotators can be explained by the Yarkovsky effect and very low thermal inertia, which might point to rapid thermal fatigue as a regolith-generation mechanism.

 - **Abstract**
 Determining the amount of sulfur in volatiles and refractories in the ISM remains one of the main problems in astrochemistry. The detection of H$_2$S ices, which are thought to be one of the main sulfur reservoirs, has not been achieved yet, and the only S-bearing species detected in the ices to date is OCS. PRODIGE large survey observations with NOEMA of several Class 0/I protostars in the Perseus Molecular Cloud provide a perfect opportunity to study the H$_2$S and OCS composition of the ices through the volatiles sublimated in the warm inner core (T$>$100K, n $\sim10^6$cm$^{-3}$) of these protostars. Our aim is to determine the H$_2$S/OCS ratio in the warm inner core of 24 protostars in order to study how it is affected by different factors during its evolution. We used the NOEMA millimeter observations from the PRODIGE program of H$_2$S, H$_2^{33}$S, OCS, OC$^{33}$S and OC$^{34}$S to estimate the H$_2$S and OCS column densities in the warm inner cores. We used SO and SO$_2$ data from the ALMA archive to give a rough estimate of the total sulfur abundance. We explore the chemistry of H$_2$S and OCS in the warm cores using chemical and dynamical simulations of the collapse of a dense core to form a protostar. The estimated H$_2$S/OCS ratio reveals a segregation of the sources into ``OCS-poor'' and ``OCS-rich'' protostars, where the OCS-poor protostars present higher H$_2$S/OCS ratios than the OCS-rich ones. Total sulfur abundance is always dominated by either H$_2$S or OCS, grows with evolution during the Class 0 phase up to $D_S<8$, and decreases again in the Class I. Simulations show that temperature changes in the pre-stellar phase and during the collapse can produce substantial differences in the H$_2$S and OCS abundances and in the H$_2$S/OCS ratio. Our analysis shows that the H$_2$S/OCS ratio is strongly influenced by the environment and the initial conditions of the cloud.

 - **Abstract**
 IceTop, the km$^2$ surface array of the IceCube Neutrino Observatory at the South Pole, is sensitive to air showers of all primary particles, including gamma rays. In particular, in the PeV energy range, the combination of IceTop and IceCube's deep optical detector provides excellent gamma-hadron separation. Almost all air showers induced by cosmic-ray protons and heavier nuclei in this energy range contain high-energy muons detectable by the deep detector, while most photon-induced air showers do not. Therefore, IceCube's deep detector can be used to strongly suppress hadronic background in photon searches. Furthermore, the lateral distribution of the air-shower signal in IceTop provides additional gamma-hadron separation. In the PeV energy range, the gamma-hadron separation achieved is better than $10^{-3}$: air-shower events measured with IceCube are suppressed more than 1000 times stronger than photon-induced showers of the same energy simulated with Sibyll 2.3d. This improved gamma-hadron separation in combination with an extension of the energy range to lower energies provides discovery potential for future searches for PeV photon sources in IceCube's field of view.

 - **Abstract**
 The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS shows a weak cometary activity. Its brightness suggests a maximum radius of ~10km (A/0.05)^{-1/2} for an asteroid with an albedo A. I show that interstellar objects with that radius would amount to an interstellar mass density that is well above the expected mass budget of interstellar comets or asteroids. Given this budget, the detection rate of objects like 3I/ATLAS implies that it is a comet with a small core radius <0.6km, or a member of a rare population with a number density <5x10^{-8}au^{-3}} for R<10km. The second possibility would suggest that the rare population of 3I/ATLAS objects favors plunging orbits towards the inner solar system to accommodate their inferred detection rate.

 - **Abstract**
 In the current panorama of large surveys, the vast amount of data obtained with different methods, data types, formats, and stellar samples, is making an efficient use of the available information difficult. The Survey of Surveys is a project to critically compile survey results in a single catalogue, facilitating the scientific use of the available information. In this second release, we present two new catalogs of stellar parameters (Teff, logg, and [Fe/H]). To build the first catalog, SoS-Spectro, we calibrated internally and externally stellar parameters from five spectroscopic surveys (APOGEE, GALAH, Gaia-ESO, RAVE, and LAMOST) and externally on the PASTEL database. The second catalog, SoS-ML catalog, is obtained by using SoS-Spectro as a reference to train a multi-layer perceptron, which predicts stellar parameters based on two photometric surveys, SDSS and SkyMapper. As a novel approach, we build on previous parameters sets, from Gaia DR3 and Andrae et al. (2023), aiming to improve their precision and accuracy. We obtain a catalog of stellar parameters for around 23 millions of stars, which we make publicly available. We validate our results with several comparisons with other machine learning catalogs, stellar clusters, and astroseismic samples. We find substantial improvements in the parameters estimates compared to other Machine Learning methods in terms of precision and accuracy, especially in the metal-poor range, as shown in particular when validating our results with globular clusters. We believe that there are two reasons behind our improved results at the low-metallicity end: first, our use of a reference catalog, the SoS-Spectro, which is calibrated using high-resolution spectroscopic data; and second, our choice to build on pre-existing parameter estimates from em Gaia and Andrae et al., rather than attempting to obtain our predictions from survey data alone.

 GRANDProto300 (hereafter referred to as GP300) is a pioneering prototype array of the GRAND experiment. It consists of 300 radio antennas and will cover an area of 200 km$^2$ in a radio-quiet region of western China. Serving as a test bench for the GRAND experiment, GRANDProto300 aims to achieve autonomous radio detection and reconstruction of highly inclined air showers. It is designed to detect ultra-high-energy cosmic rays in the energy range of $10^{16.5}$-$10^{18}$ eV at a rate comparable to that of the Pierre Auger Observatory. Over the past two years, significant improvements have been made to both the hardware and firmware of GP300. Currently, 65 antenna units have been deployed at the site by June 2025. We present the current status of detector commissioning, including updates on hardware, calibration results such as GPS timing and antenna positioning. Additionally, we discuss the solar radio bursts associated with solar flares, the galactic radio emissions detected, and preliminary cosmic ray surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 The detection of very high-energy (VHE) afterglow emission of the gamma-ray burst (GRB) 221009A by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) provides a unique opportunity to probe particle acceleration in relativistic outflows. The hard spectrum at multi-TeV band cannot be fully explained by synchrotron-self-Compton radiation of the conventional one-zone afterglow model. In this work, we introduce a second component of relativistic electrons from stochastic acceleration via downstream turbulence of the external shock. Using a Fokker-Planck approach to model the evolution of protons and electrons, and the non-linear feedback of turbulence damping, we show that the inverse Compton radiation of the second electron component may harden the observed spectrum above multi-TeV energy, and significantly ameliorate the fitting to the spectral evolution measured by LHAASO without violating lower-energy observations. We also discuss the potential presence of the second electron component in other GRB afterglows, which may provide a possible observational signature for future studies.

 - **Abstract**
 The IceCube Neutrino Observatory utilizes the Cherenkov radiation emitted by charged secondary particles produced in interactions of neutrinos with ice nucleons to detect neutrino events. "Starting events", where this interaction vertex is contained inside the detector volume, can be used to distinguish neutrinos from the dominant background of atmospheric through-going muons. We present the Medium Energy Starting Events (MESE) selection, which employs a series of vetoes to obtain a neutrino-pure sample to measure the flux of diffuse extragalactic neutrinos from 1 TeV to 10 PeV from the entire sky. In this talk we will present a measurement of the spectrum of the diffuse flux of neutrinos, which demonstrates strong evidence for structure in the spectrum beyond a single power law, with a significance of $4.2\,\sigma$.

          Rotation dynamics and torque efficiency of cometary nuclei

 - **Abstract**
 The dynamics of a rigid cometary nucleus is described by the evolutions of its center-of-mass and of its rotation state. Solar irradiation that reaches the surface of a cometary nucleus causes the sublimation of volatiles that form the coma around the nucleus. The sublimation process transfers linear momentum and rotational angular momentum from the nucleus to the surrounding space, and thus affects the dynamics via nongravitational forces and nongravitational torques. The 2014-2016 Rosetta mission accompanying the comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko provides the longest continuous observational data to track its rotation state. The observed change in the rotation state is not explained by a low heat conductivity thermophysical model in combination with a homogeneous surface ice coverage of comet 67P. Spatially and/or temporally varying weights for effective active fraction with respect to a prescribed set of surface regions provide a potential solution to this problem. Here, we present a methodology for classifying the surface based on vectorial efficiency of the torque. On any cometary surface without geometric symmetry, the methodology highlights the decomposition into eight characteristic regions that encode the signs of torque efficiency with respect to all vector components. We analyze in detail rotation states close to lowest energy and different thermophysical models, and we discuss how the uncertainties of observations affect the model parameters. We study the occurrence of these regions for an oblate ellipsoid, a near-prolate ellipsoid, a bilobed shape, and a shape model analogous to that of comet 67P. The sensitivity analysis for comet 67P indicates that the observations constrain only one of the eight weights uniquely. The other directions are poorly constrained and show the limitation of the rotational data in determining regional activity.

 - **Abstract**
 In the light of new full-sky surveys, many attempts of creating a consistent Galactic model were made. The main interest is to estimate the still poorly understood dark matter content. However, the results vary depending on methodology, assumptions, and baryonic distribution used. To understand this discrepancy, we take the first step by estimating the model-free local mass density of stars and stellar remnants. We use a complete sample from the Gaia Catalogue of Nearby Stars within 100 pc from the Sun, together with the data on the sample of the White Dwarfs and the recent estimate of the Neutron Stars concentration in the solar neighborhood. After correction for unresolved binary stars and accounting for missing low-mass stars, we find the local mass density of stars and stellar remnants in the solar neighborhood is $\rho_{100} = 0.040^{+0.012} _{ -0.006}M_\odot pc^{-3}$ with Kroupa IMF, and $\rho_{100} = 0.037^{+0.012}_{ -0.006}M_\odot pc^{-3}$ with Chabrier IMF.

 - **Abstract**
 The detection of high gas-phase abundances of SO2 and SO in the cold envelope of an intermediate mass protostar suggests that these molecules might form on icy dust grains and subsequently desorb to the gas phase by non-thermal desorption processes such as photodesorption. In this work we report photodesorption yields for SO2 and, tentatively, SO upon ultraviolet photon irradiation of SO2 ice samples at temperatures between 14 and 80 K. Photodesorption yields were measured directly in the gas phase using a calibrated quadrupole mass spectrometer. Yields of 2.3 x 10-4 molecule/photon and 6 x 10-5 molecule/photon were estimated for SO2 and SO at 14 K (respectively). The SO2 photodesorption yield increased with temperature up to a value of 3.8 x 10-4 molecule/photon at 70 K, followed by a decrease at 80 K that could be due to crystallization of the sample. The signal assigned to SO photodesorption did not significantly change with temperature. The estimated photodesorption yields were included in the Nautilus gas-grain chemical model to evaluate their contribution to the SO2 and SO gas-phase abundances in an astrophysical environment. In addition, we also present a theoretically estimated band strength for the 1395 cm-1 SO3 IR feature (A = 1.1 x 10-16 cm molecule-1). SO3 is the main detected product in irradiated SO2 ices, and a potential contributor to the 7.2 um band observed in some interstellar ice IR spectra.

 - **Abstract**
 The diffuse Galactic neutrino flux is produced by cosmic rays interacting with the interstellar medium. The measurement of this flux can help to understand the distribution of cosmic rays in the Galaxy. The first observation of this neutrino flux was published in 2023 by the IceCube Collaboration. Here, plans for a new analysis combining different event topologies are presented. IceCube measures events in two main topologies. Tracks, originating in charged current $\nu_\mu$ interactions, provide a better angular resolution. In contrast, cascades, from most other possible interactions, provide a better energy resolution and are able to observe the Southern sky (and therefore the Galactic Center) despite the huge background of atmospheric muons. Combining both event topologies in one analysis exploits all these advantages. Sensitivities and model discrimination power of a combined measurement using a forward folding binned likelihood fit are discussed here.

 - **Abstract**
 In recent decades, significant attention has been dedicated to analytical and observational studies of the atomic hydrogen (HI) to molecular hydrogen (H2) transition in the interstellar medium. We focussed on the Draco diffuse cloud to gain deeper insights into the physical properties of the transition from HI to H2. We employed the total hydrogen column density probability distribution function (N-PDF) derived from Herschel dust observations and the N(HI)-PDF obtained from HI data collected by the Effelsberg HI survey. The N-PDF of the Draco cloud exhibits a double-log-normal distribution, whereas the N(HI)-PDF follows a single log-normal distribution. The HI-to-H2 transition is identified as the point where the two log-normal components of the dust N-PDF contribute equally; it occurs at Av = 0.33 (N=6.2e20 cm^-2). The low-column-density segment of the dust N-PDF corresponds to the cold neutral medium, which is characterized by a temperature of around 100 K. The higher-column-density part is predominantly associated with H2. The shape of the Draco N-PDF is qualitatively reproduced by numerical simulations. In the absence of substantial stellar feedback, such as radiation or stellar winds, turbulence exerts a significant influence on the thermal stability of the gas and can regulate the condensation of gas into denser regions and its subsequent evaporation. Recent observations of the ionized carbon line at 158 micron in Draco support this scenario. Using the KOSMA-tau photodissociation model, we estimate a gas density of n=50 cm^-3 and a temperature of 100 K at the location of the HI-to-H2 transition. Both the molecular and atomic gas components are characterized by supersonic turbulence and strong mixing, suggesting that simplified steady-state chemical models are not applicable under these conditions.

          Observation of Broadband In-ice Radiation from Impacting High-Energy Cosmic Rays

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first experimental evidence for in-ice radiofrequency emission from high-energy particle cascades developing in the Antarctic ice sheet. In 208 days of data recorded with the phased-array trigger of the Askaryan Radio Array, we detect 13 events with impulsive radiofrequency pulses originating from below the ice surface. Considering only the arrival angles and timing properties, this rate is inconsistent with an a-posteriori background expectation for thermal noise events and on-surface events at the level of 3.5$\,\sigma$, which rises to 5.1$\,\sigma$ when additionally considering impulsivity. The observed event geometry, event rate, signal shape, spectral content, and electric field polarization are consistent with Askaryan radiation from cosmic ray air shower cores impacting the ice sheet. For the brightest events, the angular radiation pattern independently favors an extended cascade-like emitter over a pointlike source.

 - **Abstract**
 High-energy atmospheric muon neutrinos are detected by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory with a high rate of almost a hundred thousand events per year. Being mainly produced in meson decays in cosmic-ray-induced air showers in the upper atmosphere, the flux of these neutrinos is expected to depend on atmospheric conditions and thus features a seasonal variation. The correlation between temperature fluctuations and variations of the neutrino rates can be described with a slope parameter $\alpha$, whose previous measurement with 6 years of IceCube data indicated a discrepancy to theoretical expectations. In this work, we present an update of the previous analysis, extending the statistics to 12-years of IceCube data, as well as adding a region in the Northern Hemisphere to the analysis. We estimate the slope parameter in the Southern Hemisphere to be $\alpha=0.325\pm0.022$, which confirms the previous observation of the tension between the theoretical predictions and experimental measurements with significance $>3\sigma$. Furthermore, the seasonal variation in the Northern Hemisphere has also been observed for the first time, with $\alpha=0.731\pm0.222$. Investigations into systematic effects reveal that the observations not only show a weaker correlation compared to the predictions, but also deviate from the expected linear relation between the atmospheric neutrino flux and the atmospheric temperature.

          Reconstructing PTA measurements via early seeding of supermassive black holes

 - **Abstract**
 The growing evidence of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) being present in the early Universe poses challenges to their traditional formation pathways. Separately, studies suggest that merging SMBH binaries with total masses $\gtrsim 10^9 M_\odot$ could be the primary sources of the nanohertz gravitational wave background detected by the Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs). Owing to their extreme masses, these SMBHs have a higher probability of forming earlier than their lower-mass counterparts. In this work, we provide a formalism to calculate the implications of early seeded SMBHs for the PTA signal. As an application, we explore the two most prominent scenarios of high-$z$ SMBHs seeding mechanisms: direct collapse black holes (DCBHs) and collapse of supermassive dark stars (SMDSs). We show that SMDS-seeded SMBHs, with comoving seed number density of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-3}) \, {\rm Mpc}^{-3}$ can be the dominant contributor to the PTA signal, with mass $> 10^9 M_\odot$ binaries acquiring a peak merger rate at $z< 1$. By contrast, SMBHs seeded via the DCBH channel may contribute only sub-dominantly unless produced with a much larger number density than implied by numerical simulations. Our analysis further suggests that the seed number density should be $< \mathcal{O}(10^{-1}) \, {\rm Mpc}^{-3}$ in order to not over-predict the expected PTA signal.

          IceCat-2: Updated IceCube Event Catalog of Alert Tracks

 - **Abstract**
 We present preliminary results for IceCat-2, the second public catalog of IceCube Alert Tracks, which plans to build and improve upon the first release, IceCat-1. The initial catalog, last updated in October 2023, included all real-time alerts issued since 2016, as well as events observed by IceCube since the start of full-detector data collection in 2011 that would have triggered an alert if the program had been in place at that time. IceCat-2 plans to expand on this by incorporating all additional alerts since IceCat-1, and reprocessing all events with significantly improved reconstruction algorithms. A key advancement in IceCat-2 will come from an updated reconstruction technique introduced by the IceCube Collaboration in September 2024. This approach substantially enhances the angular resolution of muon track alerts, while also improving statistical coverage. With respect to IceCat-1, the 50%(90%) angular uncertainty on track alerts is expected to be reduced by a factor of approximately 5(4). These refined reconstructions will allow us to revisit possible correlations between past alerts and sources in gamma-ray and X-ray catalogs. The enhanced precision may uncover new astrophysical associations with known astrophysical sources, offering deeper insight into potential cosmic ray accelerators.

 - **Abstract**
 The merger of binary pulsars in dark matter (DM)-rich environments can result in DM particle accretion, leading to an increase in the individual pulsar masses. In this work, we investigate the effects of DM accretion on the change in orbital period rate of binary pulsars. Our analysis reveals that while DM accretion increases the system's mass, it may also modify the orbital evolution by enhancing the orbital decay rate. By comparing our results with existing binary pulsar data near Earth's location, we report that the current DM accretion rate is insufficient to place meaningful constraints on DM particle properties. However, we demonstrate that future observations of pulsar mergers in the high DM-density environment of the galactic center could offer a unique opportunity to probe DM microphysics through this mechanism.

 - **Abstract**
 The oxygenation of Earth's atmosphere 2.3 billion years ago, which on exoplanets is expected to be most detectable via the UV ozone feature at $\sim$0.25 $\mu$m, is often regarded as a sign of the emergence of photosynthetic life. On exoplanets, we may similarly expect life to oxygenate the atmosphere, but with a characteristic distribution of emergence times. In this paper, we test our ability to recover various "true" emergence time distributions as a function of 1) stellar age uncertainty and 2) number of Earth analogs in the sample. The absolute uncertainties that we recover, for diverse underlying distributions, are mostly independent of the true underlying distribution parameters, and are more dependent on sample size than stellar age uncertainty. For a sample size of 30 Earth analogs, and an HWO architecture sensitive to ozone at 1% of the current atmospheric level on Earth, we find that no ozone detections across the entire sample would place a 10$\sigma$ limit on the mean time of ozone emergence, regardless of stellar age uncertainty.

 - **Abstract**
 HD 135344 AB is a young visual binary system that is best known for the protoplanetary disk around the secondary star. The circumstellar environment of the A0-type primary star, on the other hand, is already depleted. HD 135344 A is therefore an ideal target for the exploration of recently formed giant planets because it is not obscured by dust. We searched for and characterized substellar companions to HD 135344 A down to separations of about 10 au. We observed HD 135344 A with VLT/SPHERE in the $H23$ and $K12$ bands and obtained $YJ$ and $YJH$ spectroscopy. In addition, we carried out VLTI/GRAVITY observations for the further astrometric and spectroscopic confirmation of a detected companion. We discovered a close-in young giant planet, HD 135344 Ab, with a mass of about 10 $M_\mathrm{J}$. The multi-epoch astrometry confirms the bound nature based on common parallax and common proper motion. This firmly rules out the scenario of a non-stationary background star. The semi-major axis of the planetary orbit is approximately 15-20 au, and the photometry is consistent with that of a mid L-type object. The inferred atmospheric and bulk parameters further confirm the young and planetary nature of the companion. HD 135344 Ab is one of the youngest directly imaged planets that has fully formed and orbits on Solar System scales. It is a valuable target for studying the early evolution and atmosphere of a giant planet that could have formed in the vicinity of the snowline.

 - **Abstract**
 We present results from the SNAD VIII Workshop, during which we conducted the first systematic anomaly search in the ZTF fields also observed by LSSTComCam during Rubin Scientific Pipeline commissioning. Using the PineForest active anomaly detection algorithm, we analysed four selected fields (two galactic and two extragalactic) and visually inspected 400 candidates. As a result, we discovered six previously uncatalogued variable stars, including RS~CVn, BY Draconis, ellipsoidal, and solar-type variables, and refined classifications and periods for six known objects. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the SNAD anomaly detection pipeline and provide a preview of the discovery potential in the upcoming LSST data.

 - **Abstract**
 Massive stars in the Hertzsprung gap are a mixed population of objects in short-lived evolutionary phases: yellow supergiants (YSGs) evolving towards the red supergiant (RSG) phase, partially-stripped post-RSGs, and other, rarer outcomes of stellar evolution. Studies of sufficiently large samples of these objects can constrain massive star structure and evolution during these poorly-understood phases. As part of our ongoing program searching for post-RSGs, we characterized the spectral line profiles of 32 YSGs in the Large Magellanic Cloud using high-resolution spectra obtained with the MIKE spectrograph on the Magellan 2/Clay telescope at Las Campanas Observatory. We find that the line profiles are strongly broadened by turbulent photospheric motion. After fitting the profiles to measure microturbulent and macroturbulent velocities, we identify two groups within our sample that are separated by the ratio of the two velocity scales. In both groups, the macroturbulent velocity scales with stellar properties such as effective temperature. Additionally, we find statistically-significant correlations between the macroturbulent velocity and other possible probes of large-scale photospheric motions: line profile asymmetry, as well as the amplitude and quality factor of the stochastic low frequency variability measured from {\it Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite} lightcurves. These correlations differ between the two groups of YSGs. Finally, we construct 1D evolutionary models of YSGs in both pre- and post-RSG phases, and find reasonable agreement between the convective velocities in these models and our measured microturbulent velocities. However, the macroturbulent velocities are much higher than the convective velocities in the models.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first results from the COSINE (Cometary Object Study Investigating their Nature and Evolution) project, based on a uniformly processed dataset of 484 comets observed over the full 15-year duration of the WISE/NEOWISE mission. This compilation includes 1,633 coadded images spanning 966 epochs with signal-to-noise ratios (S/N) greater than 4, representing the largest consistently analyzed infrared comet dataset obtained from a single instrument. Dynamical classification identifies 234 long-period (LPCs) and 250 short-period comets (SPCs), spanning heliocentric distances of 0.996--10.804 au. LPCs are statistically brighter than SPCs in the W1 (3.4 um) and W2 (4.6 um) bands at comparable heliocentric distances. Cometary activity peaks near perihelion, with SPCs exhibiting a pronounced post-perihelion asymmetry. Multi-epoch photometry reveals that SPCs show steeper brightening and fading slopes than LPCs. The observing geometry of WISE/NEOWISE -- constrained to a fixed ~90-deg solar elongation from low-Earth orbit -- introduces systematic biases in the sampling of orientation angles for extended features. Collectively, the results reveal a continuous evolutionary gradient across comet populations, likely driven by accumulated solar heating and surface processing. This study establishes a foundation for subsequent COSINE analyses, which will separate nucleus and coma contributions and model dust dynamics to further probe cometary activity and evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive analysis of transit, eclipse, and radial velocity data of the hot Jupiter TrES-1 b and confirm evidence of orbital variations on secular timescales. Apparent variations due to systemic motion and light travel time effects have been ruled out, indicating that the observed changes are dynamical in origin. Joint modeling of the TrES-1 b data favors an apsidal precession model, but the rapid precession rate of $4^\circ$ yr$^{-1}$ cannot be explained without invoking an undetected close-in planetary companion, which remains unseen in the data. While radial velocity measurements reveal a previously undetected companion candidate on a wide, eccentric orbit, it is unlikely to drive the observed evolution of TrES-1 b. However, an orbital decay model provides a plausible alternative if the loss of orbital energy is driven by planetary obliquity tides. We find that the best-fit orbital decay rate of $-7.1^{ +1.5}_{-1.6}$ ms yr$^{-1}$ is aligned with theoretical predictions for modified tidal quality factors of hot Jupiters if TrES-1 b has a planetary obliquity $\varepsilon_p > 30^\circ$. We encourage follow-up observations of this system, particularly of eclipse timing and radial velocities, to further constrain the nature of the observed evolution. This paper provides a practical framework for studying secular variations and aims to accelerate future research on similar systems.

 - **Abstract**
 Type Ia supernovae (SNIa) are thermonuclear explosions of white dwarfs in binary systems. They are central to galactic chemical evolution and serve as standardizable candles in cosmology, yet their progenitors remain uncertain. In this work, we present a grid of five models detailing the evolution and nucleosynthesis of slowly merging carbon-oxygen white dwarfs approaching the Chandrasekhar mass. These models test a variety of physics input settings, including accretion rates, nuclear reaction rates, convection parameters, and the composition of the accreted material. During the merger process, as the mass of the primary white dwarf approaches the Chandrasekhar limit, carbon burning is initiated first on the surface before eventually igniting explosively at the center. As a consequence, the 22Ne(a,n)25Mg reaction activates in the outer layers of all models. The neutrons released in this way produce a weak s-process-like abundance distribution peaking at Kr, which is overproduced by more than a factor of 1000 compared to solar. The trans-Fe elements-enriched outer layer mass varies from 0.04 Msun to 0.11 Msun, depending on the accretion rate. Our explosion simulation of these progenitor models ejects significant amount of first-peak elements (e.g., Kr, Sr) as well as of some long-lived radioactive species, such as 60Fe. In a previous theoretical study, we found that a similar nucleosynthesis process during the progenitor phase may also occur on the surface of near-Chandrasekhar white dwarfs formed through the accretion of H-rich material via the single-degenerate scenario. Therefore, these results suggest trans-Fe enrichment might be a hallmark of near-Chandrasekhar SNIa ejecta, regardless of the specific progenitor channel, and could provide a new spectral signature distinguishing them from sub-Chandrasekhar explosions.

 - **Abstract**
 The potential presence of a magma surface below a thick atmosphere primarily composed of hydrogen in some sub-Neptune exoplanets suggests a strong link between the interior composition and atmosphere through chemical coupling of volatile and refractory species. In this study, we aim to model the possibility for mineral cloud formation in the atmosphere of sub-Neptunes from outgassing of refractory species at the magma surface. In our specific cases, we find that mineral clouds easily form near the magma-atmosphere boundary, but also higher in the atmosphere once vapour is mixed to the cooler atmospheric regions. We find that the vertical cloud structure depends on the mixing profile of the atmosphere, with stronger mixing allowing particles to remain lofted in the atmosphere, while weak to moderate mixing produces larger, more sedimented cloud particle profiles. We suggest that due to the strong thermal feedback from cloud opacity, clouds may play an important role in the overall structure of the interior-surface-atmosphere coupled system in sub-Neptunes, as well as affect their observed spectral properties, especially at near-infrared wavelengths.

 - **Abstract**
 Here we present an open-source cloud model for substellar atmospheres, called Virga. The Virga-v0 series has already been widely adopted in the literature. It is written in Python and has heritage from the Ackerman & Marley (2001) model (often referred to as eddysed), used to study clouds on both exoplanets and brown dwarfs. In the development of the official Virga-v1 we have retained all the original functionality of eddysed and updated/expanded several components including the back-end optical constants data, calculations of the Mie properties, available condensate species, saturation vapor pressure curves and formalism for fall speeds calculations. Here we benchmark Virga by reproducing key results in the literature, including the SiO2 cloud detection in WASP-17 b and the brown dwarf Diamondback-Sonora model series. Development of Virga is ongoing, with future versions already planned and ready for release. We encourage community feedback and collaborations within the GitHub code repository.

 - **Abstract**
 This study evaluates the performance of several machine learning models for predicting hazardous near-Earth objects (NEOs) through a binary classification framework, including data scaling, power transformation, and cross-validation. Six classifiers were compared, namely Random Forest Classifier (RFC), Gradient Boosting Classifier (GBC), Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Logistic Regression (LR), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). RFC and GBC performed the best, both with an impressive F2-score of 0.987 and 0.986, respectively, with very small variability. SVC followed, with a lower but reasonable score of 0.896. LDA and LR had a moderate performance with scores of around 0.749 and 0.748, respectively, while KNN had a poor performance with a score of 0.691 due to difficulty in handling complex data patterns. RFC and GBC also presented great confusion matrices with a negligible number of false positives and false negatives, which resulted in outstanding accuracy rates of 99.7% and 99.6%, respectively. These findings highlight the power of ensemble methods for high precision and recall and further point out the importance of tailored model selection with regard to dataset characteristics and chosen evaluation metrics. Future research could focus on the optimization of hyperparameters with advanced features engineering to further the accuracy and robustness of the model on NEO hazard predictions.

 - **Abstract**
 Flares from stars can significantly impact the atmospheres of their orbiting planets, yet the role of hard X-ray (HXR; 3-20 keV) emission in driving escape and tracing particle acceleration remains poorly constrained. With the aim of quantifying the HXR share of the total radiative budget, we obtained a NuSTAR observation, quasi-simultaneous with Swift and Einstein Probe observations, of the young M1Ve star AU Mic, detecting two flares. We build an empirical soft X-ray (SXR; 0.3-3 keV)-HXR scaling relation and, on that basis, quantify the HXR share of the total radiative budget, defined as the sum of extreme ultraviolet (EUV; 0.01-0.3 keV), SXR, and HXR, and assess its effect on atmospheric escape. We find that the HXR fraction is 1.7% in quiescence and rises to 3.3% at flare peaks; even adopting the EUV + SXR (collectively referred to as XUV) escape efficiency as an upper bound, HXR-powered mass loss amounts to only a few percent of the XUV-driven rate. High-energy spectral tails are detected in quiescence and in Flare 2. Both nonthermal and high temperature thermal models provide acceptable fits to the data; however, the presence of two localized Neupert effect episodes in Flare 2, combined with the implausibly large energy budget required for a 290 MK plasma, strongly favors a nonthermal interpretation. Consistent with this picture, spectral-timing analysis shows that the 6-20 keV share of the emission actually declines during flares, while heating is dominated by 3-6 keV photons-implying rapid thermalization of accelerated electrons and a predominantly thermal energy release. Overall, the flares are thermally dominated, nonthermal electrons can power chromospheric heating episodically, but HXR-induced escape appears to be marginal for the long-term atmospheric evolution of AU Mic's planets.

 - **Abstract**
 The prominent Thackeray's globules are a collection of cloudlets seen in silhouette against the bright emission of the IC 2944 HII region, ionized by the Collinder 249 cluster of early-type stars (placed at 2331$\pm$30 pc, derived from a Gaia DR3 analysis of the parallaxes of 11 massive stars). Here we present the analysis of Band 3 ALMA data that reveals the cold emission (continuum and molecular) associated with the neutral gas and its kinematic behavior. Many of the globules follow a linear velocity gradient that can be explained as the result of an acceleration process due to the rocket effect, where freshly ionized material streams away from the globule, compressing and accelerating it. We identified 46 globules (12 of which are new detections), measured their kinematics, and estimated their densities and masses. At least 5 of them are associated with emission of dense molecular tracers and/or millimeter continuum sources and have indications of possible gravitational collapse. We applied a simple model for the acceleration of the globules which accounts for the observed kinematics. In this scenario only the most massive of the globules will be able to gravitationally collapse before being completely destroyed, in the process reaching speeds of tens km/s, and potentially becoming low-mass walkaway/runaway protostars.

          Carbon-rich Sub-Neptune Interiors Are Compatible with JWST Observations

 - **Abstract**
 Many possible interior compositions exist for sub-Neptunes: ice-poor, ice-rich, and water-dominated interiors can all match the measured masses and radii. Motivated by recent theory of carbon-rich planet formation outside of the refractory organic carbon "soot line" and observations of carbon-rich protoplanetary disks around late M dwarfs, we propose another possible sub-Neptune composition: a carbon-rich composition consisting of an iron-silicate core, a carbon layer, and a hydrogen/helium-dominated envelope. We show that the interiors of three prototypical sub-Neptunes with high-quality spectral observations - TOI-270 d, GJ 1214 b, and K2-18 b - are consistent with carbon-rich compositions if they have $\leq100\times$ solar metallicity atmospheres. We further show that carbon-rich interiors lead to atmospheric compositions that match HST and JWST observations. Simulated carbon-rich TOI-270 d transmission spectra pass the $\chi^2$ test under a wide range of C/O, haze, and cloud scenarios. K2-18 b spectral models are broadly consistent with observation, but requires additional sources for carbon species to be fully compatible. GJ 1214 b models, however, are incompatible with observations, ruling out a carbon-rich interior composition, if the atmosphere of the planet is primordial and reflects interior C/O.

 - **Abstract**
 The Integrating Miniature Piggyback for Impulsive Solar Hard X-rays (IMPISH) is a solar X-ray spectrometer that features large-area scintillators, fast readout electronics, and good energy resolution in the hard X-ray band. IMPISH is a low-cost spectrometer designed to measure subsecond variation in hard X-ray time profiles from solar flares, with the goal of constraining particle acceleration timescales. To meet these requirements, we carried out a systematic optimization of the scintillation design, focusing on maximizing photon collection, reducing noise level, and improving energy resolution. We tested two high-yield scintillating crystals (LYSO, lutetium yttrium oxyorthosilicate, and GAGG, gadolinium aluminum gallium garnet), two reflector types (specular and lambertian), two kinds of surface finishes (all sides polished and readout face only polished), different optical coupling materials and thicknesses, multiple geometries, and readout face angles. Our studies show that light collection improves with increasing the crystal's effective area, breaking its symmetry, and reducing the photon's travel length. These minimize photon loss due to self-absorption and total internal reflection. Through combined simulation and laboratory tests, we achieved an optimal energy resolution with the LYSO trapezoid-shaped crystal coupled to a Broadcom NUV-MT SiPM with an approximately 0.25 mm thin Sylgard 184 optical pad.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate whether an Early-Universe stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) can account for the common spectrum process reported by NANOGrav, while also being consistent with current and projected CMB measurements of extra radiation. We compute the contribution of effective number of relativistic species, $\Delta N_{eff}$, for a number of Early-Universe models proposed to explain the pulsar timing array (PTA) spectrum. We demonstrate that models predicting $\Delta N_{eff}$ above the CMB limit would be firmly excluded, implying that the NANOGrav signal in tension with these bounds must instead arise from astrophysical sources. We find that current NANOGrav 15-year dataset, sensitive up to 60 nHz, gives a negligible contribution to $\Delta N_{eff}$ and remains well below the present and future CMB detection threshold. However, when we project future PTA capabilities reaching upto 1 $\mu$Hz, even with our conservative estimate we find that Inflation, Scalar Induced Gravitational Waves (SIGW), and metastable cosmic strings can induce a $\Delta N_{eff}$ large enough for $>3.5\sigma$ detection by the Simons Observatory.

          Verification of Cas A neutron star cooling rate using Chandra HRC-S observations

 - **Abstract**
 The young neutron star (NS) in the Cassiopeia A (Cas A) supernova remnant is a fascinating test for theories of NS cooling. Chandra observations have indicated that its surface temperature is declining rapidly, about 2% per decade, using 20 years of data, if a uniform carbon atmosphere is assumed for the NS. This rapid decline may be caused by the neutrons in the NS core transitioning from a normal to a superfluid state. However, most of the Cas A NS observations were performed by the Chandra ACIS detectors, which suffer complicated systematic effects. Here, we test the cooling of the Cas A NS with Chandra HRC data over 25 years. The Chandra HRC detector has independent systematics, serving as a cross-check. Assuming a fixed hydrogen column density ($N_{\rm H}$), we infer the cooling rate of the Cas A NS to be 0.57$^{+0.26}_{-0.27}$% per decade. Allowing the $N_{\rm H}$ to vary with time (as estimated using ACIS data), the cooling rate is 1.11$^{+0.25}_{-0.28}$% per decade. These cooling rates are smaller than measured using ACIS data, implying systematic uncertainties have not been eradicated from either or both datasets. However, we have verified the decline in the absorbed flux from the Cas A NS using an independent instrument, at $>3\sigma$ level (4.7%$\pm$1.5% over 10 years). Additionally, the weaker cooling rate of Cas A NS inferred from HRC datasets eliminates the tension with the theoretically predicted cooling, and can be explained by the reduced efficiency of the neutrino emission accompanying the Cooper pair breaking and formation process in neutron triplet-state superfluid.

          Interaction of polytropic dark energy in cosmological model: Constraints from observational data

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate an interacting polytropic dark energy (PDE) model characterised by the equation of state $p_{d} = \alpha \rho_{d}^{\,1+\frac{1}{\beta}}$, where the interaction between dark energy and pressureless matter is modelled via a linear coupling term $Q = 3\eta H\rho_{d}$. The background dynamics are formulated by deriving the Hubble parameter in the interacting scenario, and the model parameters are constrained through a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis using three joint observational data sets: Hubble77+BAO26, Hubble77+Pantheon$^+$, and Hubble77+BAO26+DESI DR2. The resulting best-fit values of $(H_0, \Omega_{d0}, \eta) $ are $(69.22^{+1.27}_{-1.24},\,0.73^{+0.02}_{-0.02},\,-0.22^{+0.10}_{-0.12})$, $(69.23^{+1.27}_{-1.22},\,0.73^{+0.02}_{-0.02},\,-0.34^{+0.15}_{-0.17})$, and $(67.77^{+1.26}_{-1.24},\,0.73^{+0.02}_{-0.02},\,\\-0.02^{+0.10}_{-0.11})$ respectively for the respective data combinations. Our results indicate a positive energy density and negative pressure over the full redshift range, with the evolution of the equation-of-state parameter and state finder parameters placing the model firmly within the Quintessence regime. The study of the deceleration parameter also reveals a shift from a decelerating to an accelerating cosmic expansion. The estimated present age of the Universe is $14\,\mathrm{Gyr}$, consistent with recent observational data. Furthermore, the sign of $Q$ implies a current energy transfer from dark energy to matter. These findings support the interacting PDE framework as a viable candidate for explaining late-time cosmic acceleration and related large-scale dynamics.

 Understanding the evolution of pulsar dispersion measures is vital to high precision timing experiments, as well as astrometric experiments to determine pulsar positions and proper motions. In this work, we present a novel approach to measuring dispersion measure gradients using pulsar scintillometry. This approach makes use of the multipath propagation through the interstellar medium to simultaneously probe dispersion measures along multiple sight lines from a single observation. Using existing data of PSR B0834+06, we are able to measure gradients of $9.7\pm0.3\times10^{-6}~\rm{pc}~\rm{cm}^{-3}~\rm{mas}^{-1}$.

 - **Abstract**
 The diffuse Galactic $\gamma$-ray emission (DGE) provides a valuable probe for investigating the cosmic ray propagation and interactions within our Galactic environment. Recent observations have demonstrated systematic excesses of DGE compared with the conventional cosmic-ray propagation model predictions. While $\gamma$-ray emissions have been detected in a subset of globular clusters, their undetected populations may significantly contribute to the DGE. Motivated by this possibility, we present a comprehensive assessment of potential contributions from unresolved globular clusters to the DGE. In our analysis, a nonparametric method is employed to estimate the luminosity function and spatial distribution function of globular clusters using the Fermi-LAT fourth source catalog (4FGL) combined with a reference globular cluster catalog. Based on these distributions, we calculate the cumulative contribution of unresolved globular cluster populations to the DGE observed by Fermi-LAT and the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO). Our results reveal that globular clusters account for only $\sim$2\% of the DGE at the TeV range, and smaller than $1\%$ in the GeV regime, which is effectively negligible.

 - **Abstract**
 The search for large polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with over 100 carbon atoms is crucial to resolving the origin of unidentified infrared emission (UIE) bands. These bands are commonly observed in nebulae and the interstellar medium, yet their spectroscopic assignment has remained unknown for decades. Using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope (FAST), the world's most sensitive instrument operating in the decimeter-wavelength range, we conducted a search for rotational transitions of large, quasi-symmetric PAHs. Our sample included two prototypical UIE sources, NGC 7027 and TMC-1, along with a non-UIE source, IRC+10216, for comparison. A matched filter technique was employed to isolate comb-like spectral features from quasi-symmetric PAHs containing 138 to 194 carbon atoms in the FAST spectra. This method significantly enhanced detection sensitivity to these astrophysically critical molecular signatures. Although no such features were detected, we derived upper limits on the abundance of large PAHs based on simplifying assumptions. These upper limits are lower than the values predicted by theoretical models, which might tentatively suggest that large PAHs may not be the primary carriers of UIE bands. However, this conclusion should be treated as tentative, given that it rests on simplistic assumptions which have not been empirically validated.

 - **Abstract**
 Redback pulsars are a subclass of millisecond pulsar system with a low-mass non-degenerate companion star being ablated by the pulsar. They are of interest due to the insights they can provide for late-stage pulsar evolution during the recycling process. J0523.5-2529 is one such candidate where redback-like emission has been seen at multiple wavelengths except radio. It is a system with a binary orbit of 16.5 hours and a low-mass non-degenerate companion of approximately 0.8 solar masses. The aim of this work was to conduct follow-up radio observations to search for any exhibited radio pulsar emission from J0523.5-2529. This work employs a periodicity and single burst search across 74 percent of the system's orbital phase using a total of 34.5 hours of observations. Observations were carried out using the Murriyang Telescope at Parkes and the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope (GBT). Despite extensive orbital phase coverage, no periodic or single-pulse radio emission was detected above a signal-to-noise threshold of 7. A comprehensive search for radio pulsations from J0523.5-2529 using Parkes and GBT yielded no significant emission, likely due to intrinsic faintness, scattering, or eclipses by the companion's outflow. The results demonstrate the elusiveness of the pulsar component in some redback systems and highlight the need for multi-wavelength follow-up and higher-frequency radio observations to constrain the source nature and binary dynamics.

 - **Abstract**
 To directly image Earth-like planets, contrast levels of 10^-8 - 10^-10 are required. The next generation of instruments will need wavefront control below the nanometer level to achieve these goals. The Zernike wavefront sensor (ZWFS) is a promising candidate thanks to its sensitivity, which reaches the fundamental quantum information limits. However, its highly non-linear response restricts its practical use case. We aim to demonstrate the improvement in robustness of the ZWFS by reconstructing the wavefront based on multi-wavelength measurements facilitated by technologies such as the microwave kinetic inductance detectors (MKIDs). We performed numerical simulations using an accelerated multi-wavelength gradient descent reconstruction algorithm. Three aspects are considered: dynamic range, photon noise sensitivity, and phase unwrapping. We examined both the scalar and vector ZWFS. Firstly, we find that using multiple wavelengths improves the dynamic range of the scalar ZWFS. However, for the vector ZWFS, its already extended range was not further increased. In addition, a multi-wavelength reconstruction allowed us to take advantage of a broader bandpass, which increases the number of available photons, making the reconstruction more robust to photon noise. Finally, multi-wavelength phase unwrapping enabled the measurement of large discontinuities such as petal errors with a trade-off in noise performance.

 - **Abstract**
 In mid-August 2025, 0.75-5.0 micron SPHEREx imaging spectrophotometric and ancillary NASA-IRTF SpeX 0.7-2.5 micron low-resolution spectral observations of Interstellar Object 3I ATLAS were obtained. The combined spectrophotometry is dominated by features due to water ice absorption and CO2 gas emission. A bright, 3 arcmin radius CO2 gas coma was clearly resolved, corresponding to Qgas,CO2 = 9.4 x 10{^26} molec/sec. From the SPHEREx photometry, we put conservative, preliminary 3sigma upper limits on the gas production rates for H2O and CO of 1.5 x 10{^26} and 2.8 x 10{^26} molec/sec. No obvious jet, tail, or trail structures were found in SPHEREx images. Assuming all observed 1-um flux is scattered light from an pv = 0.04 albedo spherical nucleus, its radius would be 23 km. Compared to the nucleus size limit r = 2.8km of Jewitt+ 2025, this suggests that greater than 99 percent of the measured SPHEREx continuum flux is from coma dust.

 - **Abstract**
 More than 30 Galactic double neutron star (DNS) binaries have now been identified through radio pulsar timing. The 24 DNSs in the Galactic field with measured total masses lie in the narrow range of 2.3--2.9 $M_{\odot}$. In contrast, gravitational-wave observations have detected two DNS mergers: GW170817, with a total mass of 2.7 $M_{\odot}$, and GW190425, with a significantly higher mass of 3.4 $M_{\odot}$. The unusually high mass of GW190425 suggests a non-standard formation channel not represented in the known Galactic population. To investigate the origin of such a massive DNS system, we model the late evolutionary stages of helium stars with initial masses between 2.5 and 9.8 $M_{\odot}$ in binaries with 1.4 $M_{\odot}$ neutron star companions, using the 1D stellar evolution code MESA at solar metallicity. We test alternative formation pathways and calibrate our models to reproduce the observed Galactic DNS mass and orbital distributions. By incorporating a modified natal kick prescription, our population synthesis results are broadly consistent with the observed total mass distribution of known DNS systems. Only a small fraction of DNSs of our model have total masses $\geq$ 3 $M_{\odot}$, insufficient to explain the high rate of massive DNS mergers inferred from GW observations. However, our model rules out the formation of heavy DNS systems like GW190425 via the second unstable mass transfer.

 - **Abstract**
 We aim to understand how landslides affect the shape and rotational motion of small rubble planetary bodies. We limit ourselves to axisymmetric global landslides, and take the primordial shape of the body to also be axisymmetric. The landslides are modeled through depth-averaging, while also incorporating the effect of the body's rotation, topographical changes due to multiple landslides, the body's non-uniform gravity field and possible surface mass shedding. The body's rotational dynamics is coupled to its shape change due to landsliding, and also includes the action of radiation torque. We utilize our model to investigate regolith motion on actual asteroids. We then study the evolution of the shape and spin state of an initially spherical rubble asteroid due to impact-induced global landsliding events over its lifetime. We find that rotational fission is suppressed by regolith redistribution to the body's equator by landsliding. Furthermore, top shapes are rapidly formed and this may explain the abundance of top-shaped asteroids in near-Earth orbits.

 - **Abstract**
 Calibrating the ages, masses, and radii of stars on the upper main sequence depends heavily on accurate measurements of the effective temperature ($T_\mathrm{eff}$) and surface gravity ($\log g$). These parameters are difficult to obtain meticulously due to the nature of hot stars, which exhibit features such as rapid rotation, atomic diffusion, pulsation, and stellar winds. We compare the $T_\mathrm{eff}$, and $\log g$, values of apparent normal B-F stars in four recent catalogues that employ different methods and pipelines to obtain these parameters. We derived various statistical parameters to compare the differences between the catalogues and discussed the astrophysical implications of these differences. Our results show that the huge differences in $T_\mathrm{eff}$, (up to $10^4$\,K) and $\log g$, (up to 2 dex) between the catalogues have serious implications on the determination of ages, masses, and radii of the stars in question. We conclude that there appears to be no homogeneous set of stellar parameters on the upper main sequence, and one must be cautious when interpreting results obtained from using only one of the catalogues. The homogenisation of said parameters is an essential task for the future and will have a significant impact on astrophysical research dealing with stars on the upper main sequence.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the role of fluctuations in the matter density on neutrino flavor evolution by studying their effects on the collision terms in the spherically symmetric quantum kinetics equations (QKEs). We solve the QKEs with varying radial resolution ($r_{\mathrm{bins}} = 150 \, , 1500 \, , 15000$) to assess numerical convergence in angular distributions, number densities, and energy spectra for four neutrino flavors ($\nu_e$, $\bar{\nu}_e$, $\nu_x$, $\bar{\nu}_x$). Our results demonstrate that the solutions are numerically converged already at the coarsest resolution, with higher resolutions yielding almost identical outcomes. We introduce random perturbations to each radial bin, thus adding perturbations with a length scale that is related to the radial resolution. We study both time-independent and time-dependent perturbations to the matter density that affect the collision term and analyze their effects on neutrino flavor evolution. We find that such fluctuations do not induce any significant instabilities or qualitative changes in flavor evolution. Angular structure remains robust, and flavor-dependent number densities and energy spectra show only minor deviations compared to the unperturbed case. These findings suggest that matter perturbations have a negligible effect on neutrino flavor evolution in spherically symmetric settings.

 - **Abstract**
 The detection and atmospheric characterization of potentially habitable, temperate terrestrial exoplanets using a space-based mid-infrared nulling interferometer is a major goal of contemporary astrophysics. A central part of the analysis of such an instrument are correlated errors arising from perturbations in the system. While previous studies have often treated their effects in a limited manner, we aim to treat them comprehensively here and argue that data whitening based on the covariance of these errors is a suitable method to mitigate their impact. We present a framework that quantitatively connects instrumental perturbations to performance metrics and develop two computational tools to support our analysis: PHRINGE, for the generation of synthetic nulling data, and LIFEsimMC, a new Monte Carlo-based end-to-end simulator for the Large Interferometer For Exoplanets (LIFE). Applying our framework to a reference observation of an Earth twin orbiting a Sun twin at 10 pc, we find that whitening is not only essential for a correct interpretation of the detection metric used in hypothesis testing, but also improves the estimates of the planetary properties. Moreover, our approach enables an estimation of the spectral covariance of the extracted planetary spectra, providing valuable additional input for future atmospheric retrievals. We therefore recommend incorporating the framework into performance assessments and requirement derivations for future nulling interferometers.

          3I/ATLAS (C/2025 N1): Direct Spacecraft Exploration of a Possible Relic of Planetary Formation at "Cosmic Noon"

 - **Abstract**
 The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS (also C/2025 N1 (ATLAS), henceforth, 3I), discovered by the ATLAS Chile telescope on 2025 July 1, was rapidly revealed to be the third known interstellar object (ISO) transiting the solar system, with an incoming velocity at infinity of 57.9763 $\pm$ 0.0044 km s$^{-1}$. An examination of 3I's pre-encounter kinematics shows that it is likely to be an object from the galactic thick disk, and thus a remnant of the Galaxy's ``cosmic noon'' period of intense star formation $\sim$9 - 13 gigayears ago. This kinematic assignment of 3I to the thick disk can be tested observationally in the transit of 3I through the solar system. Unfortunately for terrestrial observers, the 3I perihelion will happen when it is on the other side of the Sun as seen from Earth, at a solar elongation of 12.80 degrees, rendering observation from Earth (or near-Earth space telescopes) hard or impossible. With a retrograde orbit inclined 175.114 degrees (only 4.886 degrees from the ecliptic plane), and a trajectory passing inside the orbit of Mars, 3I will pass relatively close to a number of already launched interplanetary spacecraft. We find a strong science case for observations in the periods of the close approaches of the Psyche spacecraft on 2025 September 4, at 0.302 AU, the martian spacecraft array on 2025 October 3, and the Juice spacecraft on 2025 November 4. In addition, the Europa Clipper, Hera and even the more distant Lucy spacecraft may pass through 3I's cometary tail in the period after its perihelion passage, potentially directly observing the conditions and composition there. Spacecraft observations could, to the extent they are possible, provide the only source of spectral and imaging data during the 3I perihelion passage.

          Overview of complex organic molecule observations in protostellar systems

 - **Abstract**
 Complex organic molecules (COMs) have been detected abundantly at various stages of star formation, particularly in the warm protostellar phase. The progress in gas-phase measurements has been accelerated by the advent of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array and in ice measurements by the James Webb Space Telescope. Particularly, the community has moved from single-source studies of COMs to statistical analyses because of these powerful instruments. In this article, I review surveys that consider COMs in the gas and ice. The two takeaways from this review include; 1. Gas-phase abundance ratios for some COMs show a small difference across many objects and the ice abundance ratios show similar or higher values to the gas, both pointing to the importance of ice chemistry in COM formation, 2. Some COM ratios show larger differences across many objects which could be due to either chemical or physical effects, thus both factors need to be considered when interpreting the data.

- **Abstract**
 The abundance of elements in the interstellar medium (ISM) is a key facet for many fields of astrophysical study. In the soft X-ray spectra, absorption by interstellar gas can result in deep absorption features that affect continuum measurements. In this paper, we focus on measuring the abundance of interstellar iron and neon from the column densities observed in soft spectra from XMM-Newton and Chandra for various low mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs), which allows for a direct probe of elemental abundances. As a noble gas, neon will not deplete into solid form, thus providing a benchmark with abundances determined via UV spectroscopy. We find that, when assuming Fe is 90\% depleted into grains, [Fe/Ne]$ = -0.523\pm0.025$, [Fe/H]$ + 12 = 7.482\pm0.016$, and [Ne/H]$ + 12 = 8.012\pm0.022$, which are the tightest observational constraints on these abundances to date, while being consistent with literature which uses protosolar abundances. We also test how depletion into solid grains and scattering affect the results. The choice of depletion fraction can affect the abundance measurement by roughly $5\%$, and that the inclusion of a scattering component can affect abundance measurements by $\sim1-7\%$.

          On the radial velocity wave in the Galactic disk

- **Abstract**
 Stars in the Galactic disk have mean radial velocities $\overline{v}_R$ that oscillate as a function of angular momentum $J_\varphi$. This `$J_\varphi$-${\overline{v}}_R$ wave' signal also exhibits a systematic phase shift when stars are binned by their dynamical temperatures. However, the origin of the wave is unknown. Here we use linear perturbation theory to derive a simple analytic formula for the $J_\varphi$-$\overline{v}_R$ signal that depends on the equilibrium properties of the Galaxy and the history of recent perturbations to it. The formula naturally explains the phase shift, but also predicts that different classes of perturbation should drive $J_\varphi$-$\overline{v}_R$ signals with very different morphologies. Ignoring the self-gravity of disk fluctuations, it suggests that neither a distant tidal kick (e.g., from the Sgr dwarf) nor a rigidly-rotating Galactic bar can produce a qualitatively correct $J_\varphi$-$\overline{v}_R$ wave signal. However, short-lived spiral arms can, and by performing an MCMC fit we identify a spiral perturbation that drives a $J_\varphi$-${\overline{v}}_R$ signal in reasonable agreement with the data. We verify the analytic formula with test particle simulations, finding it to be highly accurate when applied to dynamically cold stellar populations. More work is needed to deal with hotter orbits, and to incorporate the fluctuations' self-gravity and the role of interstellar gas.

          Compact HII Regions as Clocks of Massive-Star Formation: Evidence for Long Formation Timescales

- **Abstract**
 We revisit the luminosity function (LF) of compact HII regions in the context of the inertial--inflow model, in which massive stars assemble over extended, mass-dependent timescales. The comparison of the compact-HII-region LF with that of OB stars is traditionally used to estimate the compact-HII-phase lifetime and is often cited as evidence for the classical ``lifetime problem" of HII regions. We show that once stellar growth during the ionizing phase is included, the LF comparison instead constrains massive-star formation timescales, so the lifetime problem turns into evidence for prolonged growth. We illustrate the principle with a simple analytic model and then forward-model the two LFs with Monte Carlo realizations. We also derive revised Galactic LFs for compact HII regions and OB stars from the Red MSX Source survey and the Alma Luminous Star catalogue. The joint LF constraints imply a growth law where the formation time is about 2 Myr for a $60\,M_\odot$ star, with a square-root dependence on mass. The revised OB-star LF exhibits a statistically significant knee at $\log_{10}(L_{\rm k}/L_\odot)=5.0$, while the HII-region LF knee occurs at lower luminosity, as expected in the interpretation that HII regions are powered by stars that are still growing in mass. We conclude that massive stars in the Milky Way form over Myr timescales that increase with their final mass.

          Disk-Regulated Mass Transfer Between Rotating Non-Degenerate Stars: Insights from Be and sdOB Binaries

- **Abstract**
 Mass transfer between non-degenerate stars is a fundamental but still poorly understood process in binary evolution. The commonly used rotationally limited accretion prescription in detailed binary evolution simulations that account for stellar rotation generally yields low accretion efficiencies that are difficult to reconcile with several observational constraints. We present a physically-motivated mass-accretion prescription in which accretion or decretion disks regulate the angular momentum transported to the accretor, thereby allowing for continued accretion at near-critical rotation. The accretion efficiency can be calculated from the conservation of the mass and the angular momentum of the disk. Analytical estimates show that the accretion efficiency depends on stellar rotation and mass ratio for direct impact accretion, and additionally on stellar radius and orbital separation in the disk accretion regime. The overall mass-weighted accretion efficiencies are close to the values expected near the threshold rotation rate, where the accreted specific angular momentum declines sharply. Applying this model to binary evolution simulations, we find that rotationally limited accretion systematically underestimates Be-star masses in Be+subdwarf O/B-type star (sdOB) systems, whereas the disk-star coupling model can produce more massive Be stars that are consistent with observations. The final binary component masses depend not only on accretion efficiency but also core-envelope mass ratio, which itself depends sensitively on the assumed overshooting. We find that our new disk-star coupling model with reduced overshooting yields component masses for Be+sdOB systems that are in closer agreement with observations.

- **Abstract**
 I describe an `oct-tree' N-body code which randomly shifts, reorients, and resizes the root cell at each time step. Averaging over a plurality of root cell positions and orientations statistically restores translational and rotational invariance. The potentials and forces which result can be much more accurate than those obtained from a single force calculation. In this paper, the principle of averaging is tested on static configurations. The next paper will show how this technique can substantially improve global energy, momentum, and angular momentum conservation at a negligible computational cost.

- **Abstract**
 We present a highly scalable, MPI-parallelized framework for reconstructing the initial cosmic density field, designed to meet the computational demands of next-generation cosmological simulations, particularly the upcoming ELUCID-DESI simulation based on DESI BGS data. Building upon the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo approach and the FastPM solver, our code employs domain decomposition to efficiently distribute memory between nodes. Although communication overhead increases the per-step runtime of the MPI version by roughly a factor of eight relative to the shared-memory implementation, our scaling tests-spanning different particle numbers, core counts, and node layouts-show nearly linear scaling with respect to both the number of particles and the number of CPU cores. Furthermore, to significantly reduce computational costs during the initial burn-in phase, we introduce a novel ``guess'' module that rapidly generates a high-quality initial density field. The results of the simulation test confirm substantial efficiency gains: for $256^3$ particles, 53 steps ($\sim$54 CPU hours) are saved; for $1024^3$, 106 steps ($\sim$7500 CPU hours). The relative gain grows with the number of particles, rendering large-volume reconstructions computationally practical for upcoming surveys, including our planned ELUCID-DESI reconstruction simulation with $8192^3$ particles, with a rough estimation of 720 steps ($\sim$37,000,000 CPU hours).

          The Walkaway Star HP Tau/G2: Evidence for a Stellar Merger

- **Abstract**
 HP~Tau/G2 is a luminous, short-period, fast-rotating G-type weak-line T Tauri star with a large radius, an oblate shape with gravity-darkening, little circumstellar material, and centered in a slowly expanding cloud cavity. It is an X-ray source and a variable nonthermal radio source. It forms, together with the late-type T Tauri star KPNO 15, a pair of oppositely directed walkaway stars launched when a multiple system broke apart ~5600 yr ago. Momentum conservation indicates a mass of G2 of only ~0.7 Msun, much lower than the ~1.9 Msun determined from evolutionary models. G2 is virtually a twin of FK Com, the prototype of a class of evolved stars resulting from coalescence of W UMa binaries. We suggest that G2 became a very close and highly eccentric binary during viscous evolution in the protostellar stage and with KPNO 15 formed a triple system, which again was part of a larger unstable group including the binary G3 and the single G1. Dynamical evolution led to multiple bound ejections of KPNO 15 before it finally escaped after ~2 Myr. As a result the G2 binary recoiled and contracted 5600 yr ago, became Darwin unstable and merged in a major outburst ~2000 yr ago. The nearby compact triple system G1+G3 was also disturbed, and broke up 4900 yr ago, forming another walkaway pair. The G5 star HD 283572 has similar unusual properties, indicating that G2 is not a pathological case. G2 is now fading towards a new stable configuration. YSO mergers may be rather common and could explain some FUor eruptions.

- **Abstract**
 We present results of a pilot observational wide-field VLBI campaign on probing scattering properties of the partly ionized interstellar medium towards the Galactic plane sky region between $28^\circ<l<36^\circ$ and $|b|<1^\circ$. This covers the region where the Galactic bar connects to the spiral arms and where a lot of star formation is currently ongoing. The Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) observations of the whole region were performed in a special mode with multiple phase centers at L-band (1.4 -- 1.8 GHz) during April-June 2022 and a year later complemented by sessions at S (2.2 -- 2.4 GHz) and C-band (4.6 -- 5.0 GHz) partially covering the pilot region. We found compelling evidence that target sources are subject to scattering. The total detection rate in L, S and C-bands is 1.5, 3.4 and 9.2 per cent, respectively, and approximately scales with the square of the observation frequency. The low rate values imply that scattering is strong. Its power is non-uniform across the Galactic plane and it can be approximated by a Gaussian with a width of about $2^\circ$ peaking at the Galactic mid-plane. One of the brightest sources of the field shows anisotropic scattering, with a $\lambda^2$ dependence of its observed angular size, along a position angle of $26^\circ$ aligned with the line of constant Galactic latitude. We estimate the turbulence dissipation scale $r_\text{in}\approx1500$ km toward the source J1833+0015.

- **Abstract**
 Strong outflows from active galactic nuclei are frequently observed in objects with lower coronal X-ray luminosity. This intrinsic X-ray weakness is considered a requirement for the formation of radiatively driven winds. To obtain an unbiased view on the connection between X-ray emission and the presence of powerful winds in the most luminous quasar phase, we present an X-ray analysis of a sample of extremely luminous, radio-quiet quasars with signatures of strong outflows in their rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) emission spectra. We study the $Chandra$ X-ray spectral properties of 10 objects, selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 16 quasar catalogue based on their UV luminosities and ${\rm C}_{\rm IV}$ emission line blueshifts, comparing them to typical optically blue quasars. Our analysis reveals that seven out of 10 quasars in our sample have photon indices $\Gamma>1.7$. Only two out of 10 objects exhibiting outflows with velocities exceeding 1400 km/s are X-ray 'weak', consistent with the fraction of X-ray 'weak' objects generally observed in quasar populations. Notably, one of the objects identified as X-ray 'weak' is likely an intrinsically X-ray 'normal' quasar that is heavily obscured. We observe a tentative indication at a $\sim$2$\sigma$ confidence level that the correlation between the excessively low X-ray flux level and the presence of ${\rm C}_{\rm IV}$ emission-line outflows might emerge at wind velocities greater than 3000 km/s. Our study provides additional evidence that the relationship between X-ray emission and the presence of winds is intricate. Our findings emphasise the need for X-ray observations of a larger sample of UV-selected quasars with confirmed strong emission-line outflows to unravel the nuanced interplay between winds and X-ray emission.

- **Abstract**
 The availability of asteroseismic constraints for tens of thousands of red giant (RG) stars has opened the door to robust age estimates, enabling time-resolved studies of different populations of stars in the Milky Way. This study leverages data from Kepler, K2, and TESS, in conjunction with astrometric data from Gaia DR3 and spectroscopic constraints from APOGEE DR17 and GALAH DR3, to infer parameters for over 17,000 RGs. We use the code PARAM to homogeneously infer stellar properties considering in detail the sensitivity of our results to different choices of observational constraints. We focus on age estimation, identifying potentially unreliable age determinations, and highlight stars with unreliable $\Delta\nu$ measurements based on comparisons using Gaia luminosities. These are particularly relevant in K2 data due to the short duration of the observations of each campaign, and therefore important to characterise for Galactic archaeology studies where the spatial range of K2 is a benefit. Thanks to the combination of data from different missions we explore trends in age, mass, and orbital parameters such as $R_\mathrm{g}$ and $Z_\mathrm{max}$, and examine time-resolved [$\alpha$/M]-[Fe/H] planes across different Galactic regions. Additionally, we compare age distributions in low- and high-$\alpha$ populations and chemically selected ex situ stars. The study also extends known mass-[C/N] ratio relationships to lower masses. The catalogues resulting from this work will be instrumental in addressing key questions in Galactic archaeology and stellar evolution, and to improve training sets for machine-learning-based age estimations.

          Optical spectral characterization of OP 313. Constraining the contribution of thermal and non-thermal optical emission

- **Abstract**
 The quasar OP 313 was discovered in December 2023 in very-high-energy $\gamma$ rays above 100 GeV, enabling for the first time a complete characterization of its emission. However, the lack of updated measurements of its accretion disk, broad line region and dusty torus hampers a detailed interpretation of the role of accretion in the observed $\gamma$-ray production. We intend to characterize, during high-activity states, the external photon fields contributing to the IR-to-UV emission$-$namely dusty torus, broad line region and accretion disk$-$and investigate potential variability and blurring effects on the broad emission lines. We present new spectroscopic observations of OP 313 with the NOT and TNG telescopes to characterize its optical spectrum and variability with respect to archival observations from SDSS. We measure the luminosity of different broad emission lines, characterizing the broad line region, accretion disk and dusty torus. We measure the Mg II emission line, with an average flux of $F_{\mathrm{Mg \ II}} = (0.85 \pm 0.11)\times 10^{-14}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. Its equivalent width and luminosity are consistent with a constant line with a variable non-thermal continuum. From the stable Mg II line we derive a constant luminosity of the thermal components, $\log(L_{\mathrm{BLR}} \ \mathrm{[erg \ s^{-1}]}) = 44.91 \pm 0.19$, $\log(L_{\mathrm{disk}} \ \mathrm{[erg \ s^{-1}]}) = 45.91 \pm 0.19$ and $\log(L_{\mathrm{torus}} \ \mathrm{[erg \ s^{-1}]}) = 44.70 \pm 0.16$, and estimated a BH mass of $\log(M_{BH}/M_{\odot})=8.36 \pm 0.18$, in line with with that derived from the C III] line. These characteristics and the indicator of the accretion rate from the disk/Eddington luminosity ratio $\lambda =L_{AD}/L_{Edd} = 0.23 \pm 0.10$, along with a high Compton dominance, favour a FSRQ-like nature, contrary to the argued changing-look nature.

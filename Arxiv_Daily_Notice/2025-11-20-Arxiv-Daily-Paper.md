- **Abstract**
 Observations have shown that planets similar to Neptune are rarely found orbiting Sun-like stars with periods up to ~4 days, defining the so-called Neptune desert region. Therefore, the detection of each individual planet in this region holds a high value, providing detailed insights into how such a population came to form and evolve. Here we report the detection of TOI-333b, a Neptune desert planet with a mass, radius, and bulk density of 20.1 $\pm$ 2.4 M$_{\oplus}$, 4.26 $\pm$ 0.11 R$_{\oplus}$, and 1.42 $\pm$ 0.21 \gccc, respectively. The planet orbits a F7V star every 3.78 d, whose mass, radius and effective temperature are of 1.2 $\pm$ 0.1 \msun, 1.10 $\pm$ 0.03 \rsun, and 6241$^{+73}_{-62}$ K, respectively. TOI-333b is likely younger than 1 Gyr, which is supported by the presence of the doublet Li line around 6707.856 textup{~Å} and its comparison to Li abundances in open clusters with well constrained ages. The planet is expected to host only 8.5$^{+10.9}_{-8.3}\%$ gas-to-core mass ratio for a H/He envelope. On the other hand, irradiated ocean world models predict 20$^{+11}_{-10}\%$ H$_2$O mass fraction with a core fraction of 35$^{+20}_{-23}\%$. Therefore, we expect that TOI-333b internal composition may be dominated by a pure rocky composition with almost no H/He envelope, or a rocky world with almost equal mass fraction of water. Finally, TOI-333b is more massive and larger than 77$\%$ and 82$\%$ of its Neptune desert counterparts, respectively, while its host ranks among the hottest known for Neptune Desert planets, making this system a unique laboratory to study the evolution of such planets around hot stars.

- **Abstract**
 Chemistry in diffuse molecular clouds relies primarily on rapid ion-molecule reactions. Formation of the initial ions, H$^+$ and H$_2^+$, is dominated by cosmic-ray ionization of H and H$_2$, making the cosmic-ray ionization rate (denoted $\zeta({\rm X})$ for species X) an important parameter for chemical modeling. We have made observations targeting absorption lines of H$_3^+$, one of the most reliable tracers of $\zeta({\rm H_2})$, toward diffuse molecular cloud sight lines where the H$_2$ column density has been directly measured in the ultraviolet, detecting H$_3^+$ in 12 out of 27 sight lines. The 3D-PDR modeling method introduced by Obolentseva et al. (2024) was used to infer cosmic-ray ionization rates in the clouds along these sight lines, and our combined sample has a mean ionization rate of $5.3\times10^{-17}$ s$^{-1}$ with standard deviation $2.5\times10^{-17}$ s$^{-1}$. By associating H$_3^+$ absorption with gas density peaks derived from the differential extinction maps of Edenhofer et al. (2024) we have constructed a sparsely sampled 3D map of the cosmic-ray ionization rate in targeted regions within about 1~kpc of the Sun. Specific regions show reasonably uniform ionization rates over length scales of tens of parsecs, with the average ionization rate in each region being different. Large differences (factor of 5) in $\zeta({\rm H_2})$ are found over length scales of about 100 pc. This supports a picture where the cosmic-ray ionization rate varies smoothly over small size scales, but is not uniform everywhere in the Galactic disk, likely being controlled by proximity to particle acceleration sites.

- **Abstract**
 R Aquarii (R Aqr) is a well-known symbiotic binary that has attracted renewed interest during its recent periastron passage, an event that occurs only once every about 40 years. This passage marks the first to be observed with modern, state-of-the-art instruments. We investigate the inner, sub-arcsecond active region of R Aqr during this recent periastron passage, with the goal of gaining insight into the jet-launching mechanisms at work in this system. We analyse Ha speckle interferometric images obtained one month apart using Fourier techniques. These are complemented by high-resolution optical spectra in the same emission line. Our speckle imaging reveals a newborn two-sided jet orientated in the north-south direction. Its proper motion, 66 +- 19 mas per year, confirms that it was launched around 2020 Jan 7, at the onset of the periastron passage. Further analysis of the elongated central structure reveals a knot in the southern counterpart of the jet, moving away from the binary with a 27 +- 17 mas per year at a position angle of 187 degrees, and an ejection time around 2019 Oct 28. This interpretation is further supported by our high-resolution spectroscopic data. In addition, we update the expansion parallax distance of R Aqr to 260 pc.

- **Abstract**
 We present an improved approach for constructing the UV source catalogs using observations from the UltraViolet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) onboard AstroSat, by considering the Poisson distribution of the UV background. The method is tested extensively using fields that are not crowded, the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) and M31 (Field 13). The results are compared with previous studies that used UVIT observations. This approach is successful in detecting fainter sources and produces a large number of new sources ($\sim 15$ to $92\%$ more). Most of the newly discovered UV sources fall in the faint end of the source distribution (m $\gtrsim 22$). The counterparts at other wavelengths are identified for most sources. This approach is more efficient for source detection and provides an opportunity to explore new classes of UV sources.

- **Abstract**
 Growing evidence shows that most stars in the Milky Way, including the Sun, are born in high-mass star-forming regions, but due to both observational and theoretical challenges, our understanding of their chemical evolution is much less clear than that of their low-mass counterparts. Thanks to the capabilities of new generation telescopes and computers, a growing amount of observational and theoretical results have been recently obtained, which have important implications not only for our understanding of the (still mysterious) formation process of high-mass stars, but also for the chemistry that the primordial Solar System might have inherited from its birth environment. In this review, we summarise the main observational and theoretical results achieved in the last decades in the study of chemistry evolution in high-mass star-forming regions, and in the identification of chemical evolutionary indicators. Emphasis is especially given to observational studies, for which most of the work has been carried out so far. A comparison with the chemical evolution occurring in other astrophysical environments, in particular in low-mass star-forming cores and extragalactic cores, is also briefly presented. Current open questions and future perspectives are discussed.

- **Abstract**
 We present high-resolution spectroscopic observations of the quiet-Sun center-to-limb variations (CLV) of the He I triplet at 10 830 Å and the nearby Si I 10 827 Å line, observed with GREGOR Infrared Spectrograph (GRIS) and the improved High-resolution Fast Imager (HiFI+). The observations cover the interval $\mu = [0.1,\, 1.0]$, where $\mu$ is the cosine of the heliocentric angle. At each $\mu$-position, the spectra are spatially averaged over 0.02 $\mu$, and the resulting CLVs are given both as these averaged data points and as smooth polynomial curves fitted across each wavelength point. The He I spectra were inverted using the HAnle and ZEeman Light (HAZEL) code, showing an increase in optical depth towards the limb and a reversed convective blueshift for the red component, while the blue component was entirely absent. In addition, we find a strong increase in the steepness of the He I CLV compared to that of the nearby continuum. The Si I showed a behavior more typical of photospheric lines, namely shallower CLV, a reduction in width and depth, and a more typical convective blueshift.

- **Abstract**
 In this paper, we explore the kinematic properties of a sample of 19 young (<1 Gyr) and intermediate-age (1-2.5 Gyr) massive star clusters within the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). We analyse the proper motions of the clusters, which have been measured based on multi-epoch Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations. Additionally, we infer from the HST data homogeneous and robust estimates for the distances, ages and metallicities of the clusters. This collection of information, in combination with literature line-of-sight velocities, allows us to investigate the full 3D dynamics of our sample of clusters within the frame of the LMC in a self-consistent way. While most young clusters orbit the LMC close to the stellar disc plane, NGC 1850 (~100 Myr old) depicts a peculiar case. Depending on the exact distance from the disc, it follows either a highly inclined, retrograde orbit or an eccentric orbit along the bar structure. The orbits of young clusters that formed North of the LMC centre show signs that might be connected to the resettling motion of the LMC bar structure. Based on the dynamic properties in combination with the positions of the clusters in the age-metallicity space, we find no clear-cut evidence for clusters in our sample that could have been stripped from the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) onto the LMC. We finally compare the kinematics of the intermediate-age clusters with a suite of simple numerical simulations of the Magellanic system to interpret the cluster motions. A possible interaction history of the LMC with the SMC, where the SMC had two past crossings of the LMC disc plane (about 300 and 900 Myr ago), in combination with the recent SMC pericentre passage, can qualitatively explain the observed kinematic structure of the clusters analysed in this work.

- **Abstract**
 The soft X-ray telescope on board the Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG) mission, eROSITA (extended ROentgen Survey with an Imaging Telescope Array), has produced the largest sample to date of galaxy groups and clusters detected via their intracluster/intragroup medium (ICM/IGrM) emission. Scaling relations between the intrinsic properties of these systems provide valuable insight into their formation and evolution. In this work, we investigate the scaling relations between key physical properties, such as soft band X-ray luminosity, temperature, gas mass, and the low-scatter mass proxy $Y_{\rm X}$, for the galaxy groups and clusters detected in the first eROSITA All-Sky Survey (eRASS1). Our analysis fully accounts for selection effects and the redshift evolution of the observable distributions. We construct a high-purity sample of $3061$ galaxy groups and clusters spanning the redshift range $0.05<z<1.07$ and mass range of $1.1\times10^{13}<M_{500}/$M$_{\odot}<1.6\times10^{15}$. This represents the largest sample to date used for scaling relation analysis. The selection function, derived from state-of-the-art simulations of the eROSITA sky, is rigorously incorporated into our modeling. We report best-fit parameters - normalization, slope, redshift evolution, and intrinsic scatter - for a set of scaling relations: $L_{\mathrm{X}}-T$, $L_{\mathrm{X}}-M_{\rm gas}$, $L_{\mathrm{X}}-Y_{\rm X}$, as well as the $M_{\rm gas}-T$ relation. Our best-fit models indicate that the slopes of the scaling relations deviate significantly from self-similar expectations, while the redshift evolution remains consistent with the self-similar model. The fits exhibit small statistical uncertainties, likely owing to the large sample size. Our results are in good agreement with previous observational studies that account for selection effects, as well as with simulations that incorporate non-gravitational physics.

- **Abstract**
 The Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP) is a deep wide-field multi-band imaging survey consisting of three layers (Wide, Deep, and UltraDeep), with the Wide layer covering $\sim 1470$ deg$^2$ to a depth of $i \sim 26$ mag. We present the QHSC catalog, a machine-learning selected sample of quasar candidates with photometric redshifts in the Wide layer of the HSC-SSP survey (Public Data Release 3). The full QHSC catalog contains four distinct samples: a master sample with HSC-only photometry, an HSC+WISE sample, and two samples including near-infrared data from UKIDSS and VISTA, denoted as GoldenU and GoldenV. For each sample, an XGBoost classifier is trained and evaluated using independent spectroscopic test sets from HETDEX, VVDS, and zCOSMOS-bright. The numbers of quasar candidates in the QHSC catalog are 1,184,574 (master), 371,777 (HSC+WISE), 87,460 (GoldenU), and 120,572 (GoldenV), with respective completeness values of 85.3%, 92.7%, 89.8%, and 91.3%. We develop ensemble photometric redshift estimators based on bootstrap aggregating (bagging) of multiple XGBoost regressors, achieving outlier fractions of 21.7%, 13.1%, 9.5%, and 10.7% for these samples. The catalog provides quasar classification probabilities (p_QSO), enabling construction of purer subsamples via thresholding. This work offers a valuable resource for studies of quasars and cosmology, and highlights the effectiveness of machine learning for quasar selection in future wide and deep imaging surveys. The catalog is publicly available at this https URL.

- **Abstract**
 Our knowledge of the chemical composition of the gas in the inner disc of intermediate-mass young stars is limited, due to the lack of suitable instrumentation. The launch of JWST has provided a significant improvement in our ability to probe gas in these inner discs. We analyse the gas composition and emitting conditions of the disc around HD 35929, a young intermediate-mass Herbig star, using MIRI/MRS data. Our goal is to constrain the chemistry and kinematics of the gas phase molecules detected in the inner disc. We use iSLAT to examine the observed molecular lines and DuCKLiNG to detect, fit, and analyse the molecular emission. We find gas phase H2O, CO, CO2, and OH in the disc, as well as HI recombination lines. Surprisingly, we also detect gas phase SiO in the fundamental v=1-0 vibrational band. We derive column densities and temperature ranges of the detected species, arising from the inner ~0.2 au, hinting towards a compact and very warm disc. The molecular column densities are much higher than found in lower mass T Tauri discs. In general, the molecular composition is consistent with an O-rich gas from which silicate-rich solids condense and the strong gas phase molecular line emission suggests a low dust opacity. The unexpected detection of gas phase SiO at the source velocity points to an incomplete condensation of rock forming elements in the disc, suggesting chemical disequilibrium and/or an underestimate of the gas kinetic temperature.

- **Abstract**
 To advance our understanding of massive star formation, it is essential to perform a comprehensive suite of simulations that explore the relevant parameter space and include enough physics to enable a comparison with observational data. We simulate the gravitational collapse of isolated, parsec-scale turbulent cores using the FLASH code, modelling stars as sink particles. Our simulations incorporate ionizing radiation and the associated radiation pressure from stellar sources, and non-ionizing radiation and its dust heating, along with self-consistent chemistry, to capture the properties of emerging ultra-compact HII regions. Dust, gas, and radiation temperature are computed independently. The initial conditions are informed by ALMAGAL observations. We assess stellar feedback, comparing ionizing radiation and radiation pressure. Ionizing radiation ultimately halts mass accretion on to sink particles, while direct radiation pressure enhances the expansion of HII regions. Heating from non-ionizing radiation suppresses fragmentation. We examine the effect of spatial resolution, finding that higher resolution leads to more sink particles which are situated in environments with higher densities. As a result, ionizing radiation remains trapped longer, allowing continued accretion and yielding a higher overall star formation efficiency (SFE). We explore the impact of varying initial conditions, including the core density profile, virial parameter, and metallicity. Our parameter study reveals that a flatter density profile, higher virial parameter, and increased metallicity promote fragmentation, potentially enhancing the SFE by slowing the growth of the most massive stars and delaying the onset of stellar feedback. Overall, we find SFEs between 35% and 57%. Stellar feedback dictates the final SFE.

- **Abstract**
 Hot Jupiters are Jupiter-mass planets with orbital periods of less than ten days. Their short orbital separations make tidal dissipation within the stellar host especially efficient, potentially leading to a measurable evolution of the orbit. One possible manifestation of this is orbital decay, which presents itself observationally through variations in the orbital period and thus times of transit. Here we select four promising exoplanetary systems for detecting this effect: HIP 65, NGTS-6, NGTS-10 and WASP-173. We present 33 new transit light curves taken with the 1.54 m Danish Telescope, and analyse these alongside photometric data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite and transit timing data from the literature. We construct two ephemeris models for each target: a linear ephemeris and a shrinking orbital period due to tidal decay. The linear ephemeris is preferred for all four models - the highest significance for the quadratic ephemeris is 2 sigma for WASP-173. We compare these results to theoretical predictions for tidal dissipation of gravity waves in radiation zones, and find that wave breaking is predicted only in WASP-173, making rapid decay plausible in this system but unclear in the other three. The sensitivity of transit timings to orbital decay depends on the square of the time interval covered by available observations, so our results establish a useful baseline against which future measurements can be compared. NGTS-6 and NGTS-10 are important objects for future study as they are in the first field to be observed by the upcoming PLATO mission.

 - **Abstract**
 The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data analysis and the map-making process rely heavily on the use of spherical harmonics. For suitable pixelizations of the sphere, the (forward and inverse) Fourier transform plays a crucial role in computing all-sky map from spherical harmonic expansion coefficients -- or from angular power spectrum -- and vice versa. While the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is traditionally employed in these computations, the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) offers a theoretical advantage in terms of computational efficiency and potential speedup. In this work, we study the potential advantage of using the QFT in this context by exploring the substitution of the FFT with the QFT within the \textit{healpy} package. Performance evaluations are conducted using the Aer simulator. Our results indicate that QFT exhibits potential advantages over FFT that are particularly relevant at high-resolution. However, classical-to-quantum data encoding overhead represents a limitation to current efficiency. In this work, we adopted amplitude encoding, due to its efficiency on encoding maximum data to minimum number of qubits. We identify data encoding as a potential significant bottleneck and discuss its impact on quantum speedup. Future improvements in quantum encoding strategies and algorithmic optimizations could further enhance the feasibility of QFT in CMB data analysis.

 - **Abstract**
 The effectiveness and stability of mass transfer in binaries system are crucial in determining its final product. Rapid binary population synthesis (BPS) codes simplify the complex physics of mass transfer by adopting parameterized prescriptions for the stability of mass transfer, accretion efficiency in stable mass transfer, and the efficiency of common-envelope ejection. We calibrate these uncertain parameters by comparing BPS models with observational data. White dwarf and main sequence binaries are an ideal population to study binary interaction, as they can be formed through stable or unstable mass transfer, or without interaction, which affect the orbital period and masses of the present-day population. The APOGEE-GALEX-Gaia catalog provides a homogeneous sample of over 500 systems with well measured radial velocities that can be used as a comparison baseline for BPS simulations of such binaries. We compare the distribution of observed maximum radial velocity variation ($\Delta RV_{\rm max}$) and estimated masses to BPS models simulated with COSMIC, varying the mass transfer and common-envelope ejection efficiency, and the criteria for mass transfer stability at key evolutionary stages. The $\Delta RV_{\rm max}$ comparison shows clear preference for a higher fraction of stable mass transfer during the first ascent giant branch, and for highly effective envelope ejection. For the systems with WD masses, there is a slight preference for non-conservative mass transfer. In COSMIC and similar codes, the envelope ejection efficiency and the envelope binding energy are degenerate parameters. Our result of high ejection efficiency may indicate that either additional sources of energy are required to eject the envelope, or that its binding energy is lower than traditionally assumed. Future comparisons to BPS simulations can be drawn for other datasets as they become available.

 - **Abstract**
 A stellar common envelope occurs in a binary system when the atmosphere of an evolving star expands to encompass an orbiting companion object. Such systems are predicted to evolve rapidly, ejecting the stellar envelope and leaving the companion in a tighter orbit around a stripped star. We used radio timing to identify a pulsar, PSR J1928+1815, with a spin period of 10.55 ms in a compact binary system with an orbital period of 3.60 hours. The companion star has 1.0 to 1.6 solar masses, eclipses the pulsar for about 17% of the orbit, and is undetected at other wavelengths, so it is most likely a stripped helium star. We interpret this system as having recently undergone a common envelope phase, producing a compact binary.

          The CMB optical depth constrains the duration of reionization

 - **Abstract**
 Recently, it was pointed out that invoking a large value of the CMB optical depth, $\tau_{\rm CMB} = 0.09$, could help resolve tensions between DESI DR2 BAO data and the CMB. This is larger than the value of $\tau_{\rm CMB} = 0.058$ measured from the Planck low-$\ell$ polarization data. Traditionally, $\tau_{\rm CMB}$ is thought of as a constraint on reionization's midpoint. However, recent observations and modeling of the Ly$\alpha$ forest of high-$z$ quasars at $5 < z < 6$ have tightly constrained the timing of the last $10-20\%$ of reionization, adding nuance to this interpretation. Here, we point out that fixing reionization's endpoint, in accordance with the latest Ly$\alpha$ forest constraints, renders $\tau_{\rm CMB}$ a sensitive probe of the duration of reionization, as well as its midpoint. We compare low and high values of $\tau_{\rm CMB}$ to upper limits on the patchy kinematic Sunyaev-Zeldovich (pkSZ) effect, another CMB observable that constrains reionization's duration, and find that a value of $\tau_{\rm CMB} = 0.09$ is in $\approx 2\sigma$ tension with existing limits on the pkSZ from the South Pole Telescope.

          Core Collapse Beyond the Fluid Approximation: The Late Evolution of Self-Interacting Dark Matter Halos

 - **Abstract**
 We show that the gravothermal collapse of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) halos can deviate from local thermodynamic equilibrium. As a consequence, the self-similar evolution predicted by the commonly adopted conducting fluid model can be altered or broken. Our results are obtained using a novel, efficient kinetic solver called KiSS-SIDM for tracing the gravothermal evolution based on the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) framework. In the long mean free path stage, the code is a viable alternative to the fluid model, yet requires no calibration parameters. Further, this method enables a fully kinetic treatment well into the late, short mean free path, stage of the collapse. We apply the method to a canonical case with isotropic, velocity independent scattering. We find that although a fluid treatment is appropriate deep in the short mean free path core, departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium develop in the intermediate mean free path region bounding the core, which modify the late-time evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Luminous quasars at $z>4$ provide key insights into the early Universe. Their rarity necessitates wide-field multi-band surveys to efficiently separate them from the main astrophysical contaminants (i.e., ultracool dwarfs). To expand the sample of high-$z$ quasars, we conducted targeted selections using optical, infrared, and radio surveys, complemented by literature-based quasar candidate catalogs. In this paper, we report the discovery of \nqsos\ new quasars at $4.6<z<6.9$ (six at $z\geq6.5$), with $M_{1450}$ between $-$25.4 and $-$27.0. We also present new spectra of six $z>6.5$ quasars we selected, but whose independent discovery has already been published in the literature. Three of the newly discovered quasars are strong radio emitters (L$_{1.4~\rm GHz}$$=0.09-1.0\times$10$^{34}$erg s$^{-1}$ Hz$^{-1}$). Among them, one source at $z=4.71$ exhibits typical blazar-like properties, including a flat radio spectrum, radio-loudness $\sim$1000, and multi-frequency variability. It is also detected by SRG/eROSITA X-ray telescope (f$_{\rm 0.2-2.3keV} \sim 1.3\times10^{-13}$erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$). In addition, for seven $6.3<z<6.9$ quasars we present near-infrared spectroscopy and estimate the central black hole mass from their C$\rm IV$ and Mg$\rm II$ broad emission this http URL masses (log[M$_{\rm BH,MgII}$]$=8.58-9.14~\rm M_{\odot}$) and Eddington ratios ($\lambda_{\rm Edd,MgII}=0.74-2.2$) are consistent with other $z>6$ quasars reported in the literature. A $z = 6.3$ quasar exhibits a velocity difference of approximately $9000$ km s$^{-1}$ between the C$\rm IV$ and Mg$\rm II$ emission lines, making it one of the most extreme C$\rm IV$ outflows currently known. Additionally, the sample includes three high-ionization broad absorption line quasars. One of these quasars shows potential evidence of an extremely fast outflow feature, reaching $48000$ km s$^{-1}$.

 - **Abstract**
 The Nuclear Stellar Disc (NSD) is a rotating, disc-like structure in the Galactic Center, believed to have a distinct star formation. However, its formation history and evolutionary links to other structures in the Galactic Center remain uncertain. This study aims to present the first comprehensive chemical census of the NSD by deriving abundance trends for 18 elements in 9 M giants in the metallicity range of -1.0 <[Fe/H]< 0.5. By comparing these trends with those of other Galactic populations we seek to understand the chemical relationships between these structures. We obtained high-resolution H- and K-band spectra of NSD stars using the IGRINS spectrometer mounted on the Gemini South telescope. The giants were analyzed consistently with stars from a comparison populations to minimize systematic uncertainties. The abundance trends of NSD stars exhibit similarities with those of the inner-bulge and Nuclear Star Cluster (NSC) populations across a broad range of elements with different chemical evolution histories. The trends for 17 elements align closely with the local thick-disc behaviour at subsolar metallicities. At super-solar metallicities, most elements follow the NSC and inner-bulge trends. Sodium is the only element exhibiting a distinct trend, with enhanced abundances in the NSD and NSC compared to both thin-disc and inner-bulge stars. The chemical similarity suggests that the NSD likely shares an evolutionary history with the NSC and possibly the inner-disc sequence. Further studies are required to determine potential evolutionary links to Liller 1 and metal-rich globular clusters. We find no evidence of typical globular cluster abundance signatures in our NSD stars with subsolar metallicities. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of obtaining high-quality abundance data even in highly dust-obscured regions of the Milky Way, paving the way for future surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 Currently, 20 co-orbital asteroids of Venus are known, with only one with an eccentricity below 0.38. This is most likely caused by observational biases since asteroids with larger eccentricities may approach the Earth and are easier to detect. We aim to assess the possible threat that the yet undetected population of Venus co-orbitals may pose to Earth, and investigate their detectability from Earth and space observatories. We used semi-analytical models of the 1:1 mean-motion resonance with Venus and numerical simulations to monitor close encounters with Earth on several co-orbital cycles. We analyzed observability windows and brightness variations for potential Venus co-orbitals as viewed from ground-based telescopes to assess their future detection feasibility with next-generation survey capabilities. There is a range of orbits with e < 0.38, larger at lower inclinations, for which Venus' co-orbitals can pose a collisional hazard to Earth. Current ground-based observations are constrained by periodic observing windows and solar elongation limitations, though the Rubin Observatory may detect some of these objects during favorable configurations. Space missions based on Venus' orbits may be instrumental in detecting Venus' co-orbitals at low eccentricities.

          NIRCam yells at cloud: JWST MIRI imaging can directly detect exoplanets of the same temperature, mass, age, and orbital separation as Saturn and Jupiter

 - **Abstract**
 NIRCam and MIRI coronagraphy have successfully demonstrated the ability to directly image young sub-Jupiter mass and mature gas-giant exoplanets. However, these modes struggle to reach the sensitivities needed to find the population of cold giant planets that are similar to our own Solar System's giant planets ($T_{\rm eff} = 60 - 125$ K; $a=5 - 30$ AU). For the first time, we explore the high-contrast imaging capabilities of MIRI imaging rather than coronagraphy. Using data from the JWST GO 6122: Cool Kids on the Block program which targets nearby ($<6$ pc) M-dwarfs with NIRCam coronagraphy and MIRI imaging, we demonstrate that 21$\mu$m MIRI imaging can detect planets with the same temperature, mass, age, and orbital separations as Saturn and Jupiter. For systems within 3pc, 21$\mu$m MIRI imaging reaches the sensitivity needed to detect planets colder than Saturn ($<95$ K). NIRCam coronagraphy can achieve similar results only in the unlikely case that a cold giant planet is cloud-free. Motivated by these compelling findings, we extend our analysis to evaluate the measured performance of MIRI F2100W imaging versus NIRCam F444W coronagraphy to 70 pc and conclude that MIRI imaging offers the advantage for systems within 20pc. Microlensing surveys predict an occurrence rate as high as 1 - 2 low-mass giant exoplanets per star, suggesting that JWST MIRI imaging surveys of nearby systems may be poised to uncover a substantial population. This breakthrough enables a path towards the first direct characterization of cold giant exoplanets that are analogous to the solar system giant planets.

 - **Abstract**
 High-velocity clouds (HVCs) are interstellar gas clouds whose velocities are incompatible with Galactic rotation. Since the first discovery of HVCs in 1963, their origins have been debated for decades but are still not settled down, because of the lack of vital parameters of HVCs, e.g., the distance. In this work, we determined the distance to the high-velocity cloud, namely the Anti-Center Shell (ACS). We trace the ACS with extinction derived from K-giant stars with known distances and with the diffuse interstellar band (DIB) feature at 5780 $\text{Å}$ fitted on spectra of O- and B-type stars with distance. As a result, we provide a lower limit distance of ACS as $\sim$8 kpc, which extends the lower limit outward by approximately 4 kpc compared to previous work. A byproduct of the DIB method is that we detected a bar-shaped structure with a unusually high positive line-of-sight velocity. Its shape extends along the (l,b)=(155,-5)$^{\circ}$ sight-line and shows a slightly increasing trend in equivalent width and velocity as the distance increases.

 - **Abstract**
 Mantle convection simulations are an essential tool for understanding how rocky planets evolve. However, the poorly known input parameters to these simulations, the non-linear dependence of transport properties on pressure and temperature, and the long integration times in excess of several billion years all pose a computational challenge for numerical solvers. We propose a physics-based machine learning approach that predicts creeping flow velocities as a function of temperature while conserving mass, thereby bypassing the numerical solution of the Stokes problem. A finite-volume solver then uses the predicted velocities to advect and diffuse the temperature field to the next time-step, enabling autoregressive rollout at inference. For training, our model requires temperature-velocity snapshots from a handful of simulations (94). We consider mantle convection in a two-dimensional rectangular box with basal and internal heating, pressure- and temperature-dependent viscosity. Overall, our model is up to 89 times faster than the numerical solver. We also show the importance of different components in our convolutional neural network architecture such as mass conservation, learned paddings on the boundaries, and loss scaling for the overall rollout performance. Finally, we test our approach on unseen scenarios to demonstrate some of its strengths and weaknesses.

 - **Abstract**
 This exploratory study investigates whether seismic signals can be used to infer fragmentation during a fireball event. Re-entry objects, particularly sample return capsules (SRCs) such as the one from the Hayabusa2 mission, behave similarly to slow meteors during atmospheric entry and provide valuable insights into natural fireball events. In this study, we initially analyse seismic signals from the Hayabusa2 SRC re-entry, which took place on December 5, 2020, over South Australia. The SRC's signature was captured by a dense network of seismic stations (Eakin, 2018; O'Donnell et al., 2020), offering a unique opportunity to investigate the signals' characteristics and verify their connection to the re-entry event. The ballistic trajectory was confirmed as the source shock mechanism for this event. We isolate this signal and use it as a reference for a ballistic shock signature and compare it to three other fireball case studies, including a suborbital re-entry and two natural meteoroids. Although factors such as local geology and atmospheric conditions were not considered in this preliminary study, our results show promise, with high correlations for events with purely ballistic trajectories and lower correlations for those involving fragmentation or airbursts. This implies that seismic data may be able to disambiguate whether any particular fireball event underwent significant fragmentation or airburst, key phenomena for assessing body strengths.

 - **Abstract**
 The H I Lyman-alpha (Ly$\alpha$) emission, with a wavelength of 1216 Å, is the brightest solar ultraviolet (UV) line. However, comprehensive observations of the Ly$\alpha$ emission line across the full solar disk remain limited. As part of the ASO-S mission, the Solar Disk Imager (SDI) has successfully captured full-disk images in the Ly$\alpha$ band. Gaussian fitting of SDI's spectral response function (SRF) yields a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of approximately 85 Å, which is significantly broader than the distance of Si III line at 1206 Å and the Ly$\alpha$ line. Thus, the emission contribution of Si III to the SDI Ly$\alpha$ passband needs to be considered. For flares, in practice, we calculated the integrated intensity ratio $I$(Si III)/$I$(Ly$\alpha$) by analyzing spectral observations from the SOLSTICE instrument. It yields values between 1.7% and 14.6%. Empirically, the ratio is proportional to the SXR flux. Further analysis of spectral data from the SUMER instrument reveals that the ratio $I$(Si III)/$I$(Ly$\alpha$) is approximately 0.5% for prominences, 0.7%--0.9% for the inner disk, and 1.4%--1.9% close to the limb. These findings suggest that $I$(Si III)/$I$(Ly$\alpha$) is minimal for prominences and the inner disk, and the varying ratios across regions align with the center-to-limb variation of the Si III and Ly$\alpha$ lines. Additionally, we compared Ly$\alpha$ image intensity with 304 Å, 1600 Å, and 1700 Å observations from AIA, as well as H$\alpha$ from CHASE, in multiple regions (a prominence region, two active regions, and a quiet region). A relatively higher correlation of about 85% is found between Ly$\alpha$ and 304 Å in active regions, whereas in the quiet region and prominence, their correlation coefficients are about 55%.

 - **Abstract**
 Robust exoplanet characterization studies are underway, and the community is looking ahead toward developing observational strategies to search for life beyond our solar system. With the development of life detection approaches like searching for atmospheric chemical species indicative of life, chemical disequilibrium has also been proposed as a potentially key signature for life. Chemical disequilibrium can arise from the production of waste gases due to biological processes and can be quantified using a metric known as the available Gibbs free energy. The main goal of this study was to explore the detectability of chemical disequilibrium for a modern Earth-like analog. Atmospheric retrievals coupled to a thermodynamics model were used to determine posterior distributions for the available Gibbs free energy given simulated observations at various noise levels. In reflected light, chemical disequilibrium signals were difficult to detect and limited by the constraints on the CH4 abundance, which was challenging to constrain for a modern Earth case with simulated observations spanning ultraviolet through near-infrared wavelengths with V-band SNRs of 10, 20, and 40. For a modern Earth analog orbiting a late-type M dwarf, we simulated transit observations with the James Webb Space Telescope Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) and found that tight constraints on the available Gibbs free energy can be achieved, but only at extremely low noise on the order of several ppm. This study serves as further proof of concept for remotely inferring chemical disequilibrium biosignatures and should be included in continuing to build life detection strategies for future exoplanet characterization missions.

          Investigating the chemical link between H$_2$CO and CH$_3$OH within the CMZ of NGC 253

 - **Abstract**
 Formaldehyde (H$_2$CO) and methanol (CH$_3$OH) have served as traditional tracers of the star formation process for decades. Studies of the environments which produce these species, though, have pointed to significant differences in the physical environments within which each molecule resides. In this paper we investigate the physical and chemical conditions which give rise to formaldehyde and methanol emission in the nearby starburst galaxy NGC 253. We employ high spatial (1.$''$6 or $\sim28$ pc) and spectral ($\sim10$ km/s) imaging of the NGC 253 central molecular zone (CMZ) from the ALCHEMI Large Program to constrain radiative transfer models of the dense gas volume density, and temperature, molecular species column density, and source filling factor within eight giant molecular clouds (GMCs). We also measure the relative abundances of the two nuclear spin isomers of CH$_3$OH to investigate its formation history. The physical and chemical conditions derived clearly indicate that H$_2$CO and CH$_3$OH originate from distinct physical environments. H$_2$CO traces low volume density and high kinetic temperatures, while CH$_3$OH traces high volume density and low kinetic temperatures. The H$_2$CO abundances are constant, though poorly constrained, within the eight NGC 253 GMCs analyzed, while the CH$_3$OH abundance shows a radial gradient from low to high values within the NGC 253 CMZ. Our findings highlight the complex chemical and physical differentiation of CH$_3$OH and H$_2$CO in the starburst environment of NGC 253. Methanol formation appears to be influenced by warm, dynamic processes rather than cold cloud chemistry, while formaldehyde primarily forms via gas-phase reactions. These results challenge the assumption of a direct chemical link between CH$_3$OH and H$_2$CO and underscores the impact of starburst-driven shocks, turbulence, and cosmic rays on molecular gas chemistry.

 - **Abstract**
 Eclipsing millisecond pulsars (MSPs) are a type of pulsar binaries with close orbits ($\lesssim1.0\,$d). They are important objects for studying the accretion history of neutron stars (NSs), pulsar winds, and the origin of isolated MSPs, etc. Recently, a new eclipsing MSP, PSR J$1928+1815$, was discovered by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope. It is the first known pulsar with a He star companion, as suggested in Yang et al. The system features a short orbital period of $\sim0.15\,$d and a relatively massive companion $\gtrsim1.0\,M_\odot$. However, the origin of PSR J$1928+1815$ remains highly uncertain. In this paper, we investigated the formation of the new subclass of eclipsing MSPs containing (evolved) He star companions through NS + He star channel. We found that if a NS binary undergoes subsequent mass-transfer phases following Case BA or Case BB, it may appear as an eclipsing MSP during the detached phase. Additionally, we obtained the initial parameter space for producing eclipsing MSPs with He star companions. Using binary population synthesis approach, we estimated their birth rate to be $\sim2.1-4.7\times10^{-4}\rm\,yr^{-1}$, corresponding to a total number of $\sim55-150$ systems in the Galaxy. Moreover, we concluded that PSR J$1928+1815$ may originate from the evolution of an NS+He star system with an initial orbital period of $\sim0.1\,$d, which can undergo the Case BB mass transfer.

          Early Stellar Flybys are Unlikely: Improved Constraints from Sednoids and Large-$q$ TNOs

 - **Abstract**
 Sedna-like objects (a.k.a. sednoids) are transneptunian objects (TNOs) characterized by large semimajor axes and exceptionally high perihelia. Their high-$q$ orbits are detached from the influence of the four giant planets and need extra perturbation to form. One hypothesis posits that close stellar flybys could have perturbed objects from the primordial scattering disk, generating the sednoid population. In this study, we run N-body simulations with different stellar encounter configurations to explore whether such a close stellar flyby can satisfy new constraints identified from sednoid (and detached extreme TNO) observation, including the low-inclination ($i<30^\circ$) profile and primordial orbital alignment. Our results suggest that flybys with field stars are unable to generate a sufficient population, whereas flybys within the birth cluster fail to produce the primordial orbital alignment. To meet the inclination constraint of detached extreme TNOs, flybys have to be either coplanar ($i_\star \sim 0^\circ$) or symmetric about the ecliptic plane ($\omega_\star \sim 0^\circ, i_\star \sim 90^\circ$). After taking into account their occurrence rate at the early stage of the Solar System, we conclude that close-in stellar flybys ($q_\star \le 1000$~au) that satisfy all constraints are unlikely to happen ($\lesssim$5\%). Future discoveries of additional sednoids with precise orbital determinations are crucial to confirm the existence of the low-inclination tendency and the primordial alignment, and to further constrain the early dynamical evolution of the Solar System.

 - **Abstract**
 The GRAPES-3 large area muon telescope with its sixteen independent modules records the high energy (>1 GeV) muons continuously over 2.3 sr of the sky. However, the recorded muon rates are contaminated by instrumental effects and instabilities spanning both short- and long-timescales, such as variations in the efficiency of the detector. We present an automated, algorithmic method, which employs Bayesian blocks to discretize the data stream into periods and exploits the correlations among the sixteen independent modules of the muon telescope to separate the impact of these instrumental problems from those originating in physical effects of interest, allowing the Savitzky-Golay filter to be employed to mitigate the former. Compared to legacy methods, this method is less dependent on subjective input from experimental operators and provides a data stream free of all known instrumental effects over calendar years. The muon rate obtained with the new method shows a fairly better correlation with neutron monitor data, than that obtained with the legacy method.

 - **Abstract**
 Classical Wolf-Rayet (cWR) stars are evolved massive stars that have lost most of their H envelope and exhibit dense, extended atmospheres with strong, line-driven winds. Accurately modeling wind launching from optically thick layers remains a challenge. Two main approaches have advanced our understanding: 1D stationary atmosphere models with consistent hydrodynamics and time-dependent, multi-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamic simulations. Due to high computational demands, multi-dimensional models are limited in scope. Therefore, 1D hydrodynamically consistent models remain essential but must incorporate insights from 3D simulations. We compare averaged stratifications from recent multi-dimensional cWR models with 1D models computed using the hydrodynamically consistent PoWR$^{HD}$ code. We focus on winds driven by the hot iron opacity bump and explore how variations in 1D input parameters affect model outcomes. The 1D models reproduce the average 3D density structure well. While mass-loss rates are typically $\lesssim$0.2 dex higher in 1D models, small adjustments accounting for multi-dimensional dispersion reconcile the differences. 1D models tend to be more radially extended, with higher terminal velocities and lower effective temperatures. They reproduce the general velocity trends of 3D models but launch winds slightly further out and reach higher velocities during the hot iron bump. These differences also manifest in synthetic spectra computed from different 1D model approaches. Despite methodological variations, both 1D and averaged 3D models yield consistent stellar parameters when accounting for the variability seen in time-dependent simulations. For stars near the Eddington limit, reducing Doppler velocities in 1D models improves agreement in mass-loss rates, temperatures, and wind velocities. Matching temperature structures in optically thin layers remains an open challenge.

          Influence of Bar Formation on Star Formation Segregation and Stellar Migration: Implications for Variations in the Age Distribution of Milky Way Disk Stars

 - **Abstract**
 We present a chemo-dynamical $N$-body/hydrodynamic simulation of an isolated Milky Way-like galaxy to investigate how bar formation influences star formation rates, stellar migration, and the resulting age and metallicity distributions of disk stars. Focusing on the transient epoch of bar formation, a phase that triggers gas inflows, enhances local star formation, and drives significant orbital migration, we find that the star formation rate in the inner disk exhibits a pronounced peak during this period. This behavior arises from the combined effect of vigorous star formation driven by strong spiral arms prior to bar formation and the subsequent suppression of star formation once the bar is established. In contrast, star formation in the outer disk persists after bar formation at modest levels, and enhanced outward migration of stars originally formed in the inner regions gives rise to a pronounced peak in the outer disk's stellar age distribution corresponding to the bar formation epoch. Moreover, stars formed during this epoch tend to exhibit higher gas-phase metallicities, reflecting their origin in more metal-rich inner regions. Although our model does not capture every detail of the Milky Way's complex evolution, our results highlight the dominant role of bar driven migration in segregating star formation activity and in shaping the long-term chemical and age structure of the Galactic disk. Recent observational studies suggest that the Milky Way's bar is approximately 8 Gyr old; therefore, our findings imply that the age distribution of stars in the solar circle and outer disk should show a corresponding peak around that age.

          Abiotic Ozone in the Observable Atmospheres of Venus and Venus-like Exoplanets

 - **Abstract**
 Ozone is a potential biosignature and disambuguator between Earth-like and Venus-like exoplanets due to its association on Earth with photosynthetically produced oxygen (O$_2$). However, the existence of ozone in Venus's observable atmosphere, a planet with no known life, raises the possibility of ozone biosignature false-positives on Venus-like exoplanets. We use a photochemical model of Venus's atmosphere to investigate the origin of its mesospheric ozone layer, and to predict how similar ozone layers would manifest for Venus-like exoplanets. For Venus, our model shows that the previously proposed fluxes of O atoms produced on the dayside and transported to the nightside cannot generate enough ozone to match the observed nightside ozone concentrations without also producing O$_2$ in excess of the observed upper limit. Nor can sufficient ozone be produced by varying the lower-atmosphere chemistry, atmospheric thermal structure, or received stellar flux in our model of Venus's atmosphere. These results imply that a presently unknown chemical pathway is responsible for the ozone production in Venus's nightside mesosphere. Ozone production rates from this pathway of 10$^5$--10$^7$ cm$^{-3}$s$^{-1}$ above the cloud layer on the nightside can re-produce the observed O$_3$ concentrations. Generalised to Venus-like exoplanets, known chemistry similarly fails to produce ozone in the abundance seen in the Venusian mesosphere. However, until the origin of Venus's ozone is understood, we cannot rule out that ozone production at concentrations observable with JWST will be common on abiotic Venus-like worlds, a possibility that limits the usefulness of ozone as a habsignature and as a biosignature.

 - **Abstract**
 The Gaia dataset has revealed many intricate Milky Way substructures in exquisite detail, including moving groups and the phase spiral. Precise characterisation of these features and detailed comparisons to theoretical models require engaging with Gaia's heteroscedastic noise model, particularly in more distant parts of the Galactic disc and halo. We propose a general, novel machine-learning approach using normalizing flows for denoising density estimation, with particular focus on density estimation from stellar survey data such as that from Gaia. Normalizing flows transform a simple base distribution into a complex target distribution through bijective transformations resulting in a highly expressive and flexible model. The denoising is performed using importance sampling. We demonstrate that this general procedure works excellently on Gaia data by reconstructing detailed local velocity distributions artificially corrupted with noise. For example, we show the multiple branches of the Hercules stream and the phase-space spiral can both be well captured by our model. We discuss hyperparameter choice to optimally recover substructure and compare our approach to extreme deconvolution. The model therefore promises to be a robust tool for studying the Milky Way's kinematics in Galactic locations where the noise from Gaia is significant.

 - **Abstract**
 Long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are characterized by a brief gamma-ray flash followed by a longer-lasting multiwavelength afterglow. The basic mechanism is largely understood, and the early afterglow evolution often shows complex features that provide crucial insights into the transition between prompt and afterglow phases. We present a detailed analysis of GRB 210312B, detected by INTEGRAL, which exhibits both a precursor and a complex optical afterglow evolution. Through careful modeling using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, we disentangled the contributions of an early optical flare and forward shock emission. Our analysis reveals a gamma-ray precursor 17 s before the main pulse with a significantly softer spectrum (hardness ratio 0.37 +/- 0.12 versus 1.9 +/- 0.4). The optical afterglow shows an early peak at 76.0^{+4.4}{-5.1} s characterized by a steep rise ({\alpha}{flare,1} = -4.1^{+1.6}{-2.3}) and decay ({\alpha}{flare,2} = 4.0^{+2.1}{-1.5}), followed by forward shock emission with a broad hydrodynamic peak at around 150 s. In the subsequent plateau phase, the afterglow initially has a complex structure before settling into a final power law decay consistent with an electron distribution index p = 2.36^{+0.18}{-0.15}. The negligible host extinction (A_{V,host} = -0.073^{+0.100}_{-0.078}) suggests we are observing the intrinsic afterglow spectrum. The host system consists of two luminous (M_B ~ -21.7) components separated by 11.5 kpc at z = 1.069, which are possibly an interacting galaxy pair. GRB 210312B provides a rare opportunity to study the prompt-to-afterglow transition in detail. The consistency of the forward shock component with standard afterglow theory supports our physical interpretation despite the lack of X-ray coverage.

 - **Abstract**
 Herbig Ae/Be stars are young, pre-main-sequence stars that provide critical insights into the processes of stellar formation, early stellar evolution and protoplanetary this http URL of the key features of such stars are their circumstellar dusty disk and bipolar ionized outflows, which are key components for understanding planet formation processes and energy/matter deposition in the interstellar medium, respectively. In this context, imaging polarimetry is probably the sharpest tool to characterize the various structures and dynamics around the central star, due to the sensitivity of polarization to the morphology of the emitting, scattering and absorbing media. We take advantage of never published, near-ultraviolet polarimetric data of LK-H{\alpha}-233 taken by the Faint Object Camera aboard the Hubble Space Telescope in 1991, 1994 and 1995, which remained dormant in the archives despite their quality. Using the most recent and robust reduction pipeline for this instrument, we obtained high spatial resolution (0.0287 x 0.0287 arcsecond2) maps of this object at 4118 Å, together with polarimetric measurements. A dark lane, bisecting the approaching and receding polar outflows, suggests the presence of a circumstellar disk or dust torus, obscuring the pre-main sequence star and collimating the ejecta. Polarization reveals that the outflows have an X-shape structure with a significant centro-symmetric pattern in polarization angle, indicating that the outflows are both hollow and scattering the emission from the buried star. We constrain the half-opening angle of both the outflows and circumstellar disk, determine the inclination of the system and estimate the obscured star's intrinsic flux. This study highlights the importance of high-resolution polarimetric observations in understanding the complex environment around Herbig Ae/Be stars and advocates for future similar instruments.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the nonlinear evolution of cosmological perturbations in theories with scale-dependent perturbation growth, first in general and then focusing on Horndeski gravity. Within the framework of standard perturbation theory, we derive the second- and third-order kernels and show that they are fully determined by two effective functions, $h_1$ and $h_c$, which parametrize deviations from general relativity. Using the Wronskian method, we obtain solutions for the nonlinear growth functions and present explicit expressions for the resulting kernels, including bias and redshift space distortions. We show that the kernels are entirely dependent on the linear growing mode: once this is calculated, the kernels are analytic up to a time integral. Our approach provides a physically motivated framework for evaluating the one-loop galaxy power spectrum in scale-dependent theories, suitable for the forecasts and actual data analysis.

 IceCube is a Cherenkov detector instrumenting over a cubic kilometer of glacial ice deep under the surface of the South Pole. The DeepCore sub-detector lowers the detection energy threshold to a few GeV, enabling the precise measurements of neutrino oscillation parameters with atmospheric neutrinos. The reconstruction of neutrino interactions inside the detector is essential in studying neutrino oscillations. It is particularly challenging to reconstruct sub-100 GeV events with the IceCube detectors due to the relatively sparse detection units and detection medium. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are broadly used in physics experiments for both classification and regression purposes. This paper discusses the CNNs developed and employed for the latest IceCube-DeepCore oscillation measurements. These CNNs estimate various properties of the detected neutrinos, such as their energy, direction of arrival, interaction vertex position, flavor-related signature, and are also used for background classification.

 - **Abstract**
 The scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) produced nonlinearly by the enhanced cosmological curvature perturbations can serve as a potentially powerful probe of primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG) in the early Universe. In this work, we comprehensively investigate the imprints of local-type PNG on the SIGW background beyond the widely used quadratic and cubic approximations. We develop a diagrammatic approach capable of analyzing SIGWs for PNG up to any order. Utilizing this approach, we derive semi-analytic formulas for the energy-density fraction spectrum of the isotropic background, the angular power spectrum of the energy-density anisotropies, as well as the angular bispectrum and trispectrum of the energy-density non-Gaussianity. Specializing to PNG up to quartic approximation (parameterized by $f_\mathrm{NL}$, $g_\mathrm{NL}$, and $h_\mathrm{NL}$), we numerically compute all contributions to these SIGW spectra. We find that PNG can significantly alter the amplitude of the energy-density spectrum and generate substantial anisotropies through the initial inhomogeneities. Furthermore, we observe that the angular bispectrum and trispectrum always vanish when the primordial curvature perturbations are Gaussian; otherwise, they do not, indicating their potential utility as probes of PNG. Therefore, we anticipate that both the isotropic background and the anisotropies of the SIGW background will provide essential information about the early Universe.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work we consider a generalization of Starobinsky inflation obtained by combining power law ($R^\beta$), and $\alpha$-Starobinsky inflation ($E$-model). The Einstein frame potential for this model is that of power law Starobinsky inflation modified by a parameter $\alpha$ in the exponential. After computing power spectra for scalar and tensor perturbations numerically, we perform MCMC analysis to put constraints on the potential parameter $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $M$, and the number of e-foldings $N_{pivot}$ during inflation, using Planck-2018, BICEP/Keck (BK18) and other LSS observations. We find $\log_{10}\alpha= 0.37^{+0.82}_{-0.85}$, $\beta = 1.969^{+0.020}_{-0.023}$, $M=\left(3.54^{+2.62}_{-1.73}\right)\times 10^{-5}$ and $N_{pivot} = 47\pm{10}$. We compute the Bayesian evidences for our proposed model, power law Starobinsky inflation, $\alpha$-Starobinsky inflation and Starobinsky inflation. Considering the Starobinsky model as the base model, we calculate the Bayes factor and find that our proposed model is preferred by the CMB and LSS observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Flares produced following the tidal disruption of stars by supermassive black holes can reveal the properties of the otherwise dormant majority of black holes and the physics of accretion. In the past decade, a class of optical-ultraviolet tidal disruption flares has been discovered whose emission properties do not match theoretical predictions. This has led to extensive efforts to model the dynamics and emission mechanisms of optical-ultraviolet tidal disruptions in order to establish them as probes of supermassive black holes. Here we present the optical-ultraviolet tidal disruption event AT 2022dbl, which showed a nearly identical repetition 700 days after the first flare. Ruling out gravitational lensing and two chance unrelated disruptions, we conclude that at least the first flare represents the partial disruption of a star, possibly captured through the Hills mechanism. Since both flares are typical of the optical-ultraviolet class of tidal disruptions in terms of their radiated energy, temperature, luminosity, and spectral features, it follows that either the entire class are partial rather than full stellar disruptions, contrary to the prevalent assumption, or that some members of the class are partial disruptions, having nearly the same observational characteristics as full disruptions. Whichever option is true, these findings could require revised models for the emission mechanisms of optical-ultraviolet tidal disruption flares and a reassessment of their expected rates.

 - **Abstract**
 In this study we incorporate a new grid of kilonova simulations produced by the Monte Carlo radiative transfer code SuperNu in an inference pipeline for astrophysical transients, and evaluate their performance. These simulations contain four different two-component ejecta morphology classes. We analyze follow-up observational strategies by Vera Rubin Observatory in optical, and James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in mid-infrared (MIR). Our analysis suggests that, within these strategies, it is possible to discriminate between different morphologies only when late-time JWST observations in MIR are available. We conclude that follow-ups by the new Vera Rubin Observatory alone are not sufficient to determine ejecta morphology. Additionally, we make comparisons between surrogate models based on radiative transfer simulation grids by SuperNu and POSSIS, by analyzing the historic kilonova AT2017gfo that accompanied the gravitational wave event GW170817. We show that both SuperNu and POSSIS models provide similar fits to photometric observations. Our results show a slight preference for SuperNu models, since the wind ejecta parameters recovered with these models are in better agreement with expectations from numerical simulations.

 The study of quasi-periodic oscillations in X-ray binaries provides valuable insights into the physics of accretion around compact objects. The M82 galaxy hosts two ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs), one of which is suspected to harbor an intermediate-mass black hole. Using 39 NuSTAR observations acquired between 2014--2024, we investigate the aperiodic X-ray variability in M82. In particular, we study in detail the evolution of the QPO from M82 X-1 in the range 20--300 mHz. We do not find additional timing features in the data, besides a frequent broad noise component at lower frequencies. The QPO behaves similarly to other classes of low-frequency oscillations in accreting compact objects, both black holes and neutron stars.

 The Dark matter Nanosatellite Equipped with Skipper Sensors (DarkNESS) deploys a recently developed skipper-CCD architecture with sub-electron readout noise in low Earth orbit (LEO) to investigate potential signatures of dark matter (DM). The mission addresses two interaction channels: electron recoils from strongly interacting sub-GeV DM and X-rays produced through decaying DM. Orbital observations avoid attenuation that limits ground-based measurements, extending sensitivity reach for both channels. The mission proceeds toward launch following laboratory validation of the instrument. A launch opportunity has been secured through Firefly Aerospace's DREAM 2.0 program, awarded to the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). This will constitute the first use of skipper-CCDs in space and evaluate their suitability for low-noise X-ray and single-photon detection in future space observatories.

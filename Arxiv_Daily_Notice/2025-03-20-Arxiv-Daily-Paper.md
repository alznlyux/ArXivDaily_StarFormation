#### Title:
          The Exoplanet Citizen Science Pipeline: Human Factors and Machine Learning

 - **Abstract**
 We present the progress of work to streamline and simplify the process of exoplanet observation by citizen scientists. International collaborations such as ExoClock and Exoplanet Watch enable citizen scientists to use small telescopes to carry out transit observations. These studies provide essential supports for space missions such as JWST and ARIEL. Contributions include maintenance or recovery of ephemerides, follow up confirmation and transit time variations. Ongoing observation programs benefit from a large pool of observers, with a wide variety of experience levels. Our projects work closely with these communities to streamline their observation pipelines and enable wider participation. Two complementary approaches are taken: Star Guide applies human-centric design and community consultation to identify points of friction within existing systems and provide complementary online tools and resources to reduce barriers to entry to the observing community. Machine Learning is used to accelerate data processing and automate steps which are currently manual, providing a streamlined tool for citizen science and a scalable solution for large-scale archival research.

          Planck isocurvature constraint on primordial black holes lighter than a kiloton

 - **Abstract**
 We demonstrate that primordial black holes (PBHs) lighter than $10^9 \, \text{g}$, which evaporated before the Big Bang nucleosynthesis, can induce significant isocurvature perturbations due to their biased clustering amplitude and the branching ratio of the Hawking radiation differing from the abundance ratio. By leveraging the upper bound on the isocurvature perturbations from the cosmic microwave background anisotropies reported by the Planck collaboration, we derive a new upper bound on the abundance of these light PBHs.

          Search for dark matter subhalos among unassociated Fermi-LAT sources in presence of dataset shift

 - **Abstract**
 We search for dark matter (DM) annihilating subhalos of the Milky Way halo among the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) unassociated sources. We construct, for the first time, a statistical model of the unassociated sources at latitudes above 10 degrees. The latter is built as a combination of both DM annihilation subhalos as well as Galactic and extragalactic astrophysical components. The astrophysical components are constructed based on distributions of associated sources, while the distribution of DM subhalos is derived from Monte Carlo simulations. In this model we take into account the differences in the distributions of associated and unassociated sources including both covariate and prior probability shifts (both being forms of ``dataset shifts''). Previous searches of DM subhalos were based on classify-and-count strategies, while the approach adopted in this work is based on quantification learning, which allows one to determine a well-defined statistical interpretation of the contribution of a population of DM subhalos to the unassociated Fermi-LAT sources. In the $b\bar{b}$ annihilation channel and for a range of DM masses from 10 GeV to 1 TeV, we don't find a significant contribution from DM subhalos and derive a statistical 95% confidence upper limit on the DM annihilation cross section in this channel. While the derived limits are consistent with previous classify-and-count approaches, our generative statistical model opens new avenues for population studies of Fermi-LAT sources and, more generally, for searches of anomalies on top of backgrounds in presence of statistical and systematic uncertainties.
#### Title:
          Refractory carbon depletion by photolysis through dust collisions and vertical mixing
 - **Authors:** Vignesh Vaikundaraman, Joanna Drazkowska, Fabian Binkert, Til Birnstiel, Anna Miotello

 - **Abstract**
 The inner Solar System is depleted in refractory carbon in comparison to the interstellar medium and the depletion likely took place in the protoplanetary disk phase of the Solar System. We study the effect of photolysis of refractory carbon in the upper layers of the protosolar disk and its interplay with dust collisional growth and vertical mixing. We make use of a 1D Monte Carlo model to simulate dust coagulation and vertical mixing. To model the FUV flux of the disk, we use a simple analytical prescription and benchmark it with data from a radiative transfer simulation. We study the effects of fragmentation and bouncing on dust distribution and the propagation of carbon depletion. We find that when bouncing is included, the size distribution is truncated at smaller sizes than fragmentation-limited size distributions but there is a loss of small grains as well. The population of small grains is reduced due to fewer fragmentation events and this reduces the effectiveness of photolysis. We find that dust collisional growth and vertical mixing increase the effectiveness of carbon depletion by efficiently replenishing carbon to the upper regions of the disk with higher FUV flux. It takes around 100-300 kyr to reach the measured carbon abundances at 1 au, depending on the strength of the turbulence in the disk. These timescales are faster than reported by previous studies. Collisional redistribution and turbulent mixing are important aspects of dust evolution that should be included when modeling dust chemistry as they can influence the efficiency of chemical processes. Photolysis, along with another process such as sublimation, most likely played a key role in refractory carbon depletion that we see around us in the inner Solar System.

          A Million Three-Body Binaries Caught by Gaia

 - **Abstract**
 Gaia observations have revealed over a million stellar binary candidates within ~1 kpc of the Sun, predominantly characterized by orbital separations >10^3 AU and eccentricities >0.7. The prevalence of such wide, eccentric binaries has proven challenging to explain through canonical binary formation channels. However, recent advances in our understanding of three-body binary formation (3BBF) -- new binary assembly by the gravitational scattering of three unbound bodies -- have shown that 3BBF in star clusters can efficiently generate wide, highly eccentric binaries. We further explore this possibility by constructing a semi-analytic model of the Galactic binary population in the solar neighborhood, originating from 3BBF in star clusters. The model relies on 3BBF scattering experiments to determine how the 3BBF rate and resulting binary properties scale with local stellar density and velocity dispersion. We then model the Galactic stellar-cluster population, incorporating up-to-date prescriptions for the Galaxy's star-formation history as well as the birth properties and internal evolution of its star clusters. Finally, we account for binary destruction induced by perturbations from stellar interactions before cluster escape and and for subsequent changes to binary orbital elements by dynamical interactions in the Galactic field. Without any explicit fine-tuning, our model closely reproduces both the total number of Gaia's wide binaries and their separation distribution, and qualitatively matches the eccentricity distribution, suggesting that 3BBF may be an important formation channel for these enigmatic systems.

          The Bulge Cluster Origin (BulCO) survey at the ESO-VLT: probing the early history of the Milky Way assembling. Design and first results in Liller1

 - **Abstract**
 We present the scientific goals and the very first results of the Bulge Cluster Origin (BulCO) survey. This survey has been specifically designed to perform an unprecedented chemical screening of stellar systems orbiting the Milky Way bulge, with the aim to unveil their true origin. It takes advantage of the improved performances of the spectrograph CRIRES+ operating at the ESO Very Large telescope, in the near-infrared domain. Due to the complex evolutionary history of the Milky Way, a variety of relics tracing different phenomena is expected to populate the Bulge: globular clusters formed in-situ or accreted from outside the Galaxy, nuclear star clusters of cannibalized structures, and possibly a few remnants of the proto-bulge formation process (the so-called ``bulge fossil fragments"). The signatures of the different origins are imprinted in the chemical properties of these stellar systems because specific abundance patterns provide authentic "chemical DNA" tests univocally tracing the enrichment process and, therefore, the environment where the stellar population formed. Thus, each system can provide a new piece of information on the bulge formation and evolutionary history. As first results of the survey, here we discuss the alpha-element and iron abundances of a sample of stars observed in the stellar system Liller 1, which is proposed to be a bulge fossil fragment. By combining this dataset with a recently published sample of high/mid-resolution spectra, we discuss the overall chemical properties of the stellar populations in Liller1, proving its link with the Galactic bulge and providing new constraints on its star formation history.

          On the Origin of the Very-High-Energy Diffuse $γ$-Ray Emission: The Case for Galactic Source Cocoons

 - **Abstract**
 The secondary/primary cosmic-ray ratios and the diffuse backgrounds of gamma rays and neutrinos provide us with complementary information about the transport of Galactic cosmic rays. We use the recent measurement of the diffuse gamma ray background in the $\sim \rm TeV -\rm PeV$ range by LHAASO and of the very high energy diffuse neutrino background from the Galactic disc by IceCube to show that CRs may be accumulating an approximately energy independent grammage $X\sim 0.4\, \rm g \, \rm cm^{-2}$, in regions where gamma rays and neutrinos are produced with a hard spectrum, resembling the source spectrum. We speculate that this grammage reflects the early stages of cosmic ray transport around sources, in so-called cocoons, where particles spend $\sim 0.3\, \rm Myr$ before starting their journey in the Galactic environment.

 - **Abstract**
 Advancements in VLBI instrumentation, driven by the geodetic community's goal of achieving positioning accuracy of 1 mm and stability of 0.1 mm/y, have led to the development of new broadband systems. Here, we assess the potential of these new capabilities for space weather monitoring. These enhanced VLBI capabilities were used to investigate interplanetary scintillation (IPS), a phenomenon caused by the scattering of radio waves due to density irregularities in the solar wind. Compact radio sources near the Sun were observed using the AuScope VLBI array in Australia, which consists of 12-meter telescopes at Hobart, Katherine, and Yarragadee. The baseline lengths between these telescopes are approximately 3400 km (Hobart-Katherine), 3200 km (Hobart-Yarragadee), and 2400 km (Katherine-Yarragadee). The observations covered solar elongations from 6.5$^\circ$ to 11.3$^\circ$ and frequencies between 3 and 13 GHz. The study focused on phase scintillation as an indicator of turbulence in the solar wind. As the solar elongation decreased, we observed an increase in the phase scintillation index, consistent with theoretical models. Importantly, the broadband system also detected IPS using relatively weak radio sources. Additionally, the phase scintillation increased with baseline length, in agreement with Kolmogorov turbulence with an index of 11/3. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of geodetic broadband VLBI in capturing detailed features of the solar wind. This capability enables continuous space weather monitoring and advances our understanding of solar and interplanetary dynamics.

          Inferring astrophysics and cosmology with individual compact binary coalescences and their gravitational-wave stochastic background

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational waves (GWs) from compact binary coalescences (CBCs) provide a new avenue to probe the cosmic expansion, in particular the Hubble constant $H_0$. The spectral sirens method is one of the most used techniques for GW cosmology. It consists of obtaining cosmological information from the GW luminosity distance, directly inferred from data, and the redshift that can be implicitly obtained from the source frame mass distribution of the CBC population. With GW detectors, populations of CBCs can be either observed as resolved individual sources or implicitly as a stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) from the unresolved ones. In this manuscript, we study how resolved and unresolved sources of CBCs can be employed in the spectral siren framework to constrain cosmic expansion. The idea stems from the fact that the SGWB can constrain additional population properties of the CBCs thus potentially improving the measurement precision of the cosmic expansion parameters. We show that with a 5-detector network at O5-designed sensitivity, the inclusion of the SGWB will improve our ability to exclude low values of $H_0$ and the dark matter energy fraction $\Omega_m$, while also improving the determination of a possible CBC peak in redshift. Although low values of $H_0$ and $\Omega_m$ will be better constrained, we obtain that most on the precsion on $H_0$ will be provided by resolved spectral sirens. We also performed a spectral siren analysis for 59 resolved binary black hole sources detected during the third observing run with an inverse false alarm rate higher than 1 per year jointly with the SGWB. We obtain that with current sensitivities, the cosmological and population results are not impacted by the inclusion of the SGWB.

 - **Abstract**
 Mass loss governs the evolution of massive stars and shapes the stellar surroundings. To quantify the impact of the stellar winds we need to know the exact mass-loss rates; however, empirical constraints on the rates are hampered by limited knowledge of their small-scale wind structure or 'wind clumping'. We aim to improve empirical constraints on the mass loss of massive stars by investigating the clumping properties of their winds, in particular the relation between stellar parameters and wind structure. We analyse the optical and ultraviolet spectra of 25 O-type (super)giants in the LMC, using the model atmosphere code Fastwind and a genetic algorithm. We derive stellar and wind parameters including detailed clumping properties, such as the amount of clumping, the density of the interclump medium, velocity-porosity of the medium, and wind turbulence. We obtain stellar and wind parameters for 24 of our sample stars and find that the winds are highly clumped, with an average clumping factor of $f_{\rm cl}=33\pm14$, an interclump density factor of $f_{\rm ic}=0.2\pm0.1$, and moderate to strong velocity-porosity effects. The scatter around the average values of the wind-structure parameters is large. With the exception of a significant, positive correlation between the interclump density factor and mass loss, we find no dependence of clumping parameters on either mass-loss rate or stellar properties. In the luminosity range that we investigate, the empirical and theoretical mass-loss rates both have a scatter of about 0.5~dex, or a factor 3. Within this uncertainty, the empirical rates and the theoretical predictions agree. The origin of the scatter of the empirical mass-loss rates requires further investigation. It is possible that our description of wind clumping is still not sufficient to capture effects of the structured wind; this could contribute to the scatter.

 - **Abstract**
 NASA's Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) concept and the 2020 Decadal Survey's recommendation to develop a large space telescope to "detect and characterize Earth-like extrasolar planets" requires new starlight suppression technologies to probe a variety of biomarkers across multiple wavelengths. Broadband absorption due to ozone dominates Earth's spectrum in the mid-ultraviolet (200-300 nm) and can be detected with low spectral resolution. Despite the high value of direct ultraviolet (UV) exoplanet observations, high-contrast coronagraph demonstrations have yet to be performed in the UV. Typical coronagraph leakage sources such as wavefront error, surface scatter, polarization aberrations, and coronagraph mask quality all become more significant in the UV and threaten the viability of HWO to produce meaningful science in this regime. As a first step toward a demonstration of UV coronagraphy in a laboratory environment, we develop an end-to-end model to produce performance predictions and a contrast budget for a vacuum testbed operating at wavelengths from 200-400nm. At 300nm, our model predicts testbed performance of ${\sim}3\times10^{-9}$ contrast in a narrow 2% bandwidth and $\lessapprox10^{-8}$ in a 5% bandwidth, dominated primarily by the chromatic residuals from surface errors on optics that are not conjugate to the pupil.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements with the Lyman-alpha (LyA) forest from the second data release (DR2) of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey. Our BAO measurements include both the auto-correlation of the LyA forest absorption observed in the spectra of high-redshift quasars and the cross-correlation of the absorption with the quasar positions. The total sample size is approximately a factor of two larger than the DR1 dataset, with forest measurements in over 820,000 quasar spectra and the positions of over 1.2 million quasars. We describe several significant improvements to our analysis in this paper, and two supporting papers describe improvements to the synthetic datasets that we use for validation and how we identify damped LyA absorbers. Our main result is that we have measured the BAO scale with a statistical precision of 1.1% along and 1.3% transverse to the line of sight, for a combined precision of 0.65% on the isotropic BAO scale at $z_{eff} = 2.33$. This excellent precision, combined with recent theoretical studies of the BAO shift due to nonlinear growth, motivated us to include a systematic error term in LyA BAO analysis for the first time. We measure the ratios $D_H(z_{eff})/r_d = 8.632 \pm 0.098 \pm 0.026$ and $D_M(z_{eff})/r_d = 38.99 \pm 0.52 \pm 0.12$, where $D_H = c/H(z)$ is the Hubble distance, $D_M$ is the transverse comoving distance, $r_d$ is the sound horizon at the drag epoch, and we quote both the statistical and the theoretical systematic uncertainty. The companion paper presents the BAO measurements at lower redshifts from the same dataset and the cosmological interpretation.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the Damped Ly$\alpha$ Toolkit for automated detection and characterization of Damped Ly$\alpha$ absorbers (DLA) in quasar spectra. Our method uses quasar spectral templates with and without absorption from intervening DLAs to reconstruct observed quasar forest regions. The best-fitting model determines whether a DLA is present while estimating the redshift and HI column density. With an optimized quality cut on detection significance ($\Delta \chi_{r}^2>0.03$), the technique achieves an estimated 72% purity and 71% completeness when evaluated on simulated spectra with S/N$>2$ that are free of broad absorption lines (BAL). We provide a catalog containing candidate DLAs from the DLA Toolkit detected in DESI DR1 quasar spectra, of which 21,719 were found in S/N$>2$ spectra with predicted $\log_{10} (N_\texttt{HI}) > 20.3$ and detection significance $\Delta \chi_{r}^2 >0.03$. We compare the Damped Ly$\alpha$ Toolkit to two alternative DLA finders based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) and Gaussian process (GP) models. We present a strategy for combining these three techniques to produce a high-fidelity DLA catalog from DESI DR2 for the Ly$\alpha$ forest baryon acoustic oscillation measurement. The combined catalog contains 41,152 candidate DLAs with $\log_{10} (N_\texttt{HI}) > 20.3$ from quasar spectra with S/N$>2$. We estimate this sample to be approximately 76% pure and 71% complete when BAL quasars are excluded.

 The second data release (DR2) of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), containing data from the first three years of observations, doubles the number of Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) forest spectra in DR1 and it provides the largest dataset of its kind. To ensure a robust validation of the Baryonic Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) analysis using Ly$\alpha$ forests, we have made significant updates compared to DR1 to both the mocks and the analysis framework used in the validation. In particular, we present CoLoRe-QL, a new set of Ly$\alpha$ mocks that use a quasi-linear input power spectrum to incorporate the non-linear broadening of the BAO peak. We have also increased the number of realisations used in the validation to 400, compared to the 150 realisations used in DR1. Finally, we present a detailed study of the impact of quasar redshift errors on the BAO measurement, and we compare different strategies to mask Damped Lyman-$\alpha$ Absorbers (DLAs) in our spectra. The BAO measurement from the Ly$\alpha$ dataset of DESI DR2 is presented in a companion publication.

 - **Abstract**
 We conduct an extended analysis of dark energy constraints, in support of the findings of the DESI DR2 cosmology key paper, including DESI data, Planck CMB observations, and three different supernova compilations. Using a broad range of parametric and non-parametric methods, we explore the dark energy phenomenology and find consistent trends across all approaches, in good agreement with the $w_0w_a$CDM key paper results. Even with the additional flexibility introduced by non-parametric approaches, such as binning and Gaussian Processes, we find that extending $\Lambda$CDM to include a two-parameter $w(z)$ is sufficient to capture the trends present in the data. Finally, we examine three dark energy classes with distinct dynamics, including quintessence scenarios satisfying $w \geq -1$, to explore what underlying physics can explain such deviations. The current data indicate a clear preference for models that feature a phantom crossing; although alternatives lacking this feature are disfavored, they cannot yet be ruled out. Our analysis confirms that the evidence for dynamical dark energy, particularly at low redshift ($z \lesssim 0.3$), is robust and stable under different modeling choices.

 - **Abstract**
 The United Kingdom Infrared Telescope (UKIRT) microlensing survey was conducted over four years, from 2016 to 2019, with the goal of serving as a precursor to future near-infrared microlensing surveys (Shvartzvald et al. 2017). Focusing on stars in the Galactic center and utilizing near-infrared passbands, the survey identified approximately one thousand microlensing events, 27 of which displayed anomalies in their light curves (Wen et al. 2023). This paper presents an analysis of these anomalous events, aiming to uncover the underlying causes of the observed anomalies. The events were analyzed under various configurations, considering the potential binarity of both the lens and the source. For 11 events that were additionally observed by other optical microlensing surveys, including those conducted by the OGLE, KMTNet, and MOA collaborations, we incorporated their data into our analysis. Among the reported anomalous events, we revealed the nature of 24 events except for three events, in which one was likely to be a transient variable, and two were were difficult to accurately characterize their nature due to the limitations of the available data. We confirmed the binary lens nature of the anomalies in 22 events. Among these, we verified the earlier discovery that the companion in the binary lens system UKIRT11L is a planetary object. Accurately describing the anomaly in UKIRT21 required a model that accounted for the binarity of both the lens and the source. For two events UKIRT01 and UKIRT17, the anomalies could be interpreted using either a binary-source or a binary-lens model.

 - **Abstract**
 The stellar initial mass function is of great significance for the study of star formation and galactic structure. Observations indicate that the IMF follows a power-law form. This work derived that when the expected number of stars formed from a spherical molecular cloud is much greater than 1, there is a relationship between the slope $\alpha$ of the IMF and $r^n$ in the radius-density relation of spherically symmetric gas clouds, given by $\alpha = 3/(n+3)$ ($\Gamma_{\mathrm {IMF}} = n/(n+3)$). This conclusion is close to the results of numerical simulations and observations, but it is derived from a pure probabilistic model, which may have underlying reasons worth pondering.

 - **Abstract**
 The $\beta^{-}$-decay rate of $^{63}$Ni, an important branching point, affects the subsequent nucleosynthesis in the weak component of the slow-neutron capture process (weak $s$-process). To evaluate the impact of the uncertainties of stellar lifetime of $^{63}$Ni on abundances, we calculate the contribution to $\beta^{-}$-decay rates from its excited states using the large-scale shell model with various interactions and also explore the atomic effects in the highly ionized plasma. In the core He burning stage and the shell C burning stage of massive stars, our new rates can be larger than those from Takahashi and Yokoi(1987) by up to a factor of 4 and 6, respectively. We evaluate the impact of the stellar decay rates of $^{63}$Ni on the nucleosynthesis of $A=60\sim90$ in a star with an initial mass of 25 $M_{\bigodot}$ and solar metalicity. We find that the new rates can lead to the abundance changes of $^{64}$Ni, $^{63}$Cu, $^{65}$Cu, $^{64}$Zn, $^{66}$Zn, $^{67}$Zn, and $^{68}$Zn by up to $18\%$, $14\%$, $7\%$, $98\%$, $16\%$, $15\%$, and $13\%$, respectively, after the shell C burning stage at the Lagrangian mass coordinate $M_{r}=2M_{\bigodot}$. The enhancement of the decay rate of $^{63}$Ni increases the weak $s$-process efficiency of nuclei after $^{65}$Cu.

 - **Abstract**
 Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are short, intense radio signals from distant astrophysical sources, and their accurate localisation is crucial for probing their origins and utilising them as cosmological tools. This study focuses on improving the astrometric precision of FRBs discovered by the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) by correcting systematic positional errors in the Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey (RACS), which is used as a primary reference for ASKAP FRB localisation. We present a detailed methodology for refining astrometry in two RACS epochs (RACS-Low1 and RACS-Low3) through crossmatching with the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) catalogue. The uncorrected RACS-Low1 and RACS-Low3 catalogues had significant astrometric offsets, with all-sky median values of $0.58''$ in RA and $-0.26''$ in Dec. (RACS-Low1) and $0.29''$ in RA and $1.24''$ in Dec. (RACS-Low3), with a substantial and direction-dependent scatter around these values. After correction, the median offset was completely eliminated, and the 68\% confidence interval in the all-sky residuals was reduced to $0.2''$ or better for both surveys. By validating the corrected catalogues against other, independent radio surveys, we conclude that the individual corrected RACS source positions are accurate to a 1-$\sigma$ confidence level of $0.3''$ over the bulk of the survey area, degrading slightly to $0.4''$ near the Galactic plane. This work lays the groundwork to extend our corrections to the full RACS catalogue that will enhance future radio observations, particularly for FRB studies.

 - **Abstract**
 We conducted contemporaneous optical and near-infrared polarimetric and spectroscopic observations of C/2023 A3 (Tsuchinshan-ATLAS, hereafter T-A) from 2024 October 16 to December 17, covering a wide range of phase angles (20-123 deg) and wavelength (0.5-2.3 um). We paid special attention to gas contamination in the dust polarization using these data. As a result, we find the maximum polarization degree $P_max=31.21 +- 0.05 %, 33.52 +- 0.06 %, 35.12 +- 0.01 %, 37.57 +- 0.01 %, and 35.35 +- 0.01 % in the Rc-, Ic-, J-, H-, and Ks-bands, respectively. Although dust polarization shows a red slope at shorter wavelengths and can peak around 1.6 um, the phase angle at which maximum polarization occurs exhibits less dependence on wavelength (alpha_max ~ 90 deg - 95 deg). Although only a few historically bright comets, such as West, Halley, and Hale-Bopp, have undergone such extensive dust-polarization observations, our measurements are generally consistent with those of two comets that possibly originated from the Oort Cloud (West and Halley). From these results, we conjecture that the optical properties and growth processes of dust in the presolar nebula, which formed these cometary nuclei, were likely uniform.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the results of a spatially compete, high-sensitivity survey for Herbig-Haro (HH) outflows in the Western and Eastern Circinus molecular clouds. We have detected 28 new HH objects in Circinus West, doubling the number known in this dark nebula. We have also discovered 9 outflows in Circinus East, the first to be identified here. Although both Circinus West and East appear to be located at ~800 pc, their morphologies are distinct. Circinus West shows filamentary structure, while Circinus East is dominated by amorphous dark clouds. North-east of Circinus East, an extended distribution of young stars is centered on the ~6 Myr-old open cluster ASCC 79, which may have triggered the sequential formation of younger surrounding populations. New transverse velocities from Gaia show two dynamically distinct stellar populations in Circinus East; their velocity distribution is consistent with an active cloud-cloud collision between material ejected by the formation of O and B stars in ASCC~79 and a dynamically similar interloping cloud. Given the similar distances to Circinus West and East, and the presence in both of HH objects -- a phenomenon associated with stellar ages of ~1 Myr -- it is likely that these clouds are nominally related, but only Circinus East is subject to substantial feedback from the central cluster in the parent complex. This feedback appears to guide the morphology and evolution of Circinus East, resulting in a complex and possibly disruptive dynamical environment rich in star formation potential that contrasts with the relatively quiescent environment in Circinus West.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent cosmological measurements suggest the possibility of an anisotropic universe. As a result, the Bianchi Type I model, being the simplest anisotropic extension to the standard Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker metric has been extensively studied. In this work, we show how the recombination history should be modified in an anisotropic universe and derive observables by considering the null geodesic. We then constrain the axially symmetric Bianchi Type I model by performing Markov Chain Monte Carlo with the acoustic scales in Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation data, together with local measurements of $H(z)$ and Pantheon Supernova data. Our results reveal that the anisotropic model is not worth a bare mention compared to the $\Lambda$CDM model, and we obtain a tight constraint on the anisotropy that generally agrees with previous studies under a maximum temperature anisotropy fraction of $2\times 10^{-5}$. To allow for a non-kinematic CMB dipole, we also present constraints based on a relaxed maximum temperature anisotropy comparable to that of the CMB dipole. We stress that there is a significant difference between the geodesic-based observables and the naive isotropic analogies when there is a noticeable anisotropy. However, the changes in recombination history are insignificant even under the relaxed anisotropy limit.

          V1047 Cen: The first Z And-type outburst observed in the classical nova binary

 - **Abstract**
 In 2019, the classical nova V1047 Cen experienced an unusual outburst, the nature of which has not yet been clearly determined. In this paper, we show that the 2019 V1047~Cen outburst is of Z And-type -- a type that is characteristic and has so far been observed only in symbiotic binaries. We support our claim by modeling the near-ultraviolet to near-infrared spectral energy distribution, which revealed a close similarity between the fundamental parameters and the mass-loss rate of the burning white dwarf during the 2019 V1047 Cen outburst and those measured during Z And-type outbursts in symbiotic stars. All parameters are in agreement with the theoretical prediction when the accretion rate exceeds the stable burning limit for white dwarfs with masses less than 0.7 solar units. Our analysis showed that after a nova explosion, the Z And-type outburst can occur not only in symbiotic binaries but also in short-period cataclysmic variables, when the accretion-powered system changes to a nuclear-powered one, as a consequence of the donor's reaction to the nova explosion. Such a development promotes the production of Type Ia supernovae.

          Discrete treatment of inverse Compton scattering: implications on parameter estimation in gamma-ray astronomy

 - **Abstract**
 In gamma-ray astronomy and cosmic-ray physics, the continuous approximation of inverse Compton scattering (ICS) is widely adopted to model the evolution of electron energy. However, when the initial electron energy approaches $\sim100$ TeV, the discrete nature of ICS becomes prominent, and the energy of evolved electrons should be considered as a broad distribution rather than a deterministic value. By simulating the evolution paths of individual electrons under ICS, we capture this discrete nature and demonstrate that when the electron injection spectrum exhibits a high-energy cutoff, the correct discrete treatment yields a higher cutoff energy in the evolved spectrum compared to the continuous approximation. Applying the discrete ICS treatment to interpret the gamma-ray spectrum of the Geminga pulsar halo measured by HAWC, we find that the inferred cutoff energy of the injection spectrum is correspondingly lower than that derived using the continuous approximation at a $95\%$ confidence level. This suggests that the systematic bias introduced by the approximation has exceeded the measurement precision. We also expect the application of the discrete ICS correction in the PeV regime using the ultra-high-energy gamma-ray source 1LHAASO J1954+2836u as a case study, pointing out that adopting the continuous approximation may considerably overestimate the electron acceleration capability of the source.

 - **Abstract**
 Massive star formation is associated with energetic processes that may influence the physics and chemistry of parental molecular clouds and impact galaxy evolution. The high-mass protostar DR21 Main in Cygnus X possesses one of the largest and most luminous outflows ever detected in the Galaxy, but the origin of its structure and driving mechanisms is still debated. Our aim is to spatially resolve the far-infrared line emission from DR21 Main and to investigate the gas physical conditions, energetics, and current mass loss rates along its outflow. Far-infrared SOFIA FIFI-LS spectra covering selected high-J CO lines, OH, [O I], [CII] and [O III] lines are analyzed across the almost full extent of the DR21 Main outflow using 2.00' x 3.75' mosaic. The spatial extent of far-infrared emission follows closely the well-known outflow direction of DR21 Main in case of high-J CO, [O I] 63.18 um, and the OH line at 163.13 um. On the contrary, the emission from the [C II] 157.74 um and [O I] 145.53 um lines arises mostly from the eastern part of the outflow, and it is likely linked with a photodissociation region. Comparison of non-LTE radiative transfer models with the observed [O I] line ratios suggest H2 densities of ~10^5 cm^(-3) in the western part of the outflow and ~10^4 cm^(-3) in the East. Such densities are consistent with the predictions of UV-irradiated non-dissociative shock models for the observed ratios of CO and [O I] along the DR21 Main. Main outflow. Assuming that the bulk of emission arises in shocks, the outflow power of DR21 Main of 4.3-4.8x10^2 Lsol and the mass-loss rate of 3.3-3.7x10^(-3) Msol/yr are determined. Observations provide strong support for its origin in outflow shocks, and the stratification of physical conditions along the outflow. The total line cooling provides additional evidence that DR21 Main drives one of the most energetic outflows in the Milky Way.

          A Novel Quantity for Probing Matter Perturbations Below the Fresnel Scale in Gravitational Lensing of Gravitational Waves

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational lensing of gravitational waves provides a powerful probe of the mass density distribution in the universe. Wave optics effects, such as diffraction, make the lensing effect sensitive to the structure around the Fresnel scale, which depends on the gravitational wave frequency and is typically sub-Galactic for realistic observations. Contrary to this common lore, we show that wave optics can, in principle, probe matter perturbations even below the Fresnel scale. This is achieved by introducing a new quantity derived from the amplification factor, which characterizes the lensing effect, and analyzing its correlation function. Our results demonstrate that this quantity defines an effective Fresnel scale: a characteristic scale that can be arbitrarily small, even when observational frequencies are bounded. In practice, the effective Fresnel scale is constrained by the observation time $T$ and is suppressed by a factor of $1/\sqrt{fT}$ relative to the standard Fresnel scale at frequency $f$. Nevertheless, it remains significantly smaller than the conventional Fresnel scale for $fT \gg 1$; for instance, in one-year observations of mHz GWs, the effective Fresnel scale can be as small as 1 pc. This approach opens new avenues for probing the fine-scale structure of the universe and the nature of dark matter.

 - **Abstract**
 The very wide binary asteroid (VWBA) population is a small subset of the population of known binary and multiple asteroids made of systems with very widely orbiting satellites and long orbital periods, on the order of tens to hundreds of days. The origin of these systems is debatable, and most members of this population are poorly characterized. We have compiled all available high-angular resolution imaging archival data of VWBA systems from large ground- and space-based telescopes. We measure the astrometric positions of the satellite relative to the primary and analyze the dynamics of the satellites using the Genoid genetic algorithm. Additionally, we use a NEATM thermal model to estimate the diameters of two systems, and we model the orbit of Litva's inner satellite using photometric lightcurve observations. We determine the effective diameters of binary systems Christophedumas and Alconrad to be 4.7 + 0.4km and 5.2 + 0.3km respectively. We determine new orbital solutions for five systems, Huenna, Litva, (3548) Eurybates, Pauling, and Alconrad. We find a significantly eccentric best-fit orbital solution for the outer satellite of Litva, a moderately eccentric solution for Alconrad, and a nearly circular solution for Pauling. We also confirm previously reported orbital solutions for (379) Huenna and Eurybates. It is unlikely that BYORP expansion could be solely responsible for the formation of VWBAs. It is possible that the satellites of these systems were formed through YORP spin-up and then later scattered onto very wide orbits. Additionally, we find that some members of the population are unlikely to have formed satellites through YORP spin-up, and a collisional formation history is favored. In particular, this applies to VWBAs within large dynamical families, or large VWBA systems such as Huenna and NASA's Lucy mission target Eurybates.

 - **Abstract**
 The discovery of the kilonova (KN) AT 2017gfo, accompanying the gravitational wave event GW170817, provides crucial insight into the synthesis of heavy elements during binary neutron star (BNS) mergers. Following this landmark event, another KN was detected in association with the second-brightest gamma-ray burst (GRB) observed to date, GRB 230307A, and subsequently confirmed by observations of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). In this work, we conduct an end-to-end simulation to analyze the temporal evolution of the KN AT 2023vfi associated with GRB 230307A, and constrain the abundances of superheavy elements produced. We find that the temporal evolution of AT 2023vfi is similar to AT 2017gfo in the first week post-burst. Additionally, the \textit{r}-process nuclide abundances of lanthanide-rich ejecta, derived from numerical relativity simulations of BNS mergers, can also successfully interpret the temporal evolution of the KN with the lanthanide-rich ejecta mass of $0.02 M_\odot$, which is consistent with the mass range of dynamical ejecta from numerical simulations in literature. Both findings strongly suggest the hypothesis that GRB 230307A originated from a BNS merger, similar to AT 2017gfo. Based on the first time observation of the KN for JWST, we are able to constrain the superheavy elements of another KN following AT 2017gfo. The pre-radioactive-decay abundances of the superheavy nuclides: $^{222}$Rn, $^{223}$Ra, $^{224}$Ra and $^{225}$Ac, are estimated to be at least on the order of $1 \times 10^{-5}$. These abundance estimates provide valuable insight into the synthesis of superheavy elements in BNS mergers, contributing to our understanding of astrophysical \textit{r}-process nucleosynthesis.

          Probing the physical environment of the most high-redshift H$_2$-DLAs through numerical models

 - **Abstract**
 Damped Lyman-$\alpha$ absorbers (DLAs) with molecular hydrogen have been probed in detail through both spectroscopic observations and numerical modelling. However, such H$_2$ absorbers are quite sparse at very high redshifts. We identify six of the most distant known H$_2$-DLAs (redshift between 3 and 4.5), with medium/high-resolution spectroscopic observations reported in the literature, and perform detailed numerical modelling followed by Bayesian analysis to constrain their physical properties mainly using the H$_2$ rotational level population and CI fine structure levels. Our modelling approach involves setting up a constant-pressure multiphase cloud irradiated from both sides, in comparison to most models which employ constant density. This enables us to use all observed atomic and molecular species as constraints to build a more realistic model of the DLA. Our results indicate high interstellar radiation field strength $\sim$ 10$^2$ to 10$^3$ G$_0$ for some sightlines, which is suggestive of in situ star formation. The cosmic ray ionization rate for all DLAs is constrained between 10$^{-17}$ and 10$^{-14}$ s$^{-1}$, consistent with recent estimates for high-redshift sightlines. Total hydrogen density and temperature lie in the ranges 50 to 4 $\times$ 10$^4$ cm$^{-3}$ and 35-200 K in the innermost part of the absorbers. The corresponding gas pressure in our DLA models lies between 10$^{3.5}$ and 10$^{6.4}$ cm$^{-3}$ K, with three sightlines having a higher pressure than the range typical of high-redshift H$_2$-DLAs.

 - **Abstract**
 Existing methods for obtaining flat field rely on observed data collected under specific observation conditions to determine the flat field. However, the telescope pointing and the column fixed pattern noise of the CMOS detector change during actual observations. These leads to the residual signals in real-time observation data after flat field correction, such as interference fringes and column-fixed pattern noise. In actual observations, the wind causes the telescope to wobble slightly, which leads to shifts in the observed data. In this paper, a method of extracting the flat field from the real-time solar observation data is proposed. Firstly, the average flat field obtained by multi-frame averaging is used as the initial value. A set of real-time observation data is input into the KLL method to calculate the correction amount for the average flat field. Secondly, the average flat field is corrected using the calculated correction amount to obtain the real flat field for the current observation conditions. To overcome the residual solar structures caused by atmospheric turbulence in the correction amount, real-time observation data are grouped to calculate the correction amounts. These residual solar structures are suppressed by averaging multiple groups, improving the accuracy of the correction amount. The test results from diffraction-limited and ground-based simulated data demonstrate that our method can effectively calculate the correction amount for the average flat field. The NVST He I 10830 A/Ha data were also tested. High-resolution reconstruction confirms that the correction amount effectively corrects the average flat field to obtain the real flat field for the current observation conditions. Our method works for chromosphere and photosphere data.

 - **Abstract**
 Isotope anomalies in meteorites reveal a fundamental dichotomy between non-carbonaceous- (NC) and carbonaceous-type (CC) planetary bodies. Until now, this dichotomy is established for the major meteorite groups, representing about 36 distinct parent bodies. Ungrouped meteorites represent an even larger number of additional and so far mostly unexplored parent bodies. Here, the genetics and chronology of 26 ungrouped iron meteorites are investigated. The ungrouped irons confirm the NC-CC dichotomy for Mo, where NC and CC meteorites define two distinct, subparallel s-process mixing lines. All ungrouped NC irons fall on the NC-line, which is now precisely defined for 41 distinct parent bodies. The ungrouped CC irons show scatter around the CC-line indicative of small r-process Mo heterogeneities among these samples. These r-process Mo isotope variations correlate with O isotope anomalies, most likely reflecting mixing of CI chondrite-like matrix, chondrule precursors and Ca-Al-rich inclusions. This implies that CC iron meteorite parent bodies accreted the same nebular components as the later-formed carbonaceous chondrites. The Hf-W model ages of core formation for the ungrouped irons reveal a narrow age peak at ~3.3 Ma after Ca-Al-rich inclusions for the CC irons. By contrast, the NC irons display more variable ages, including younger ages indicative of impact-induced melting events, which seem absent among the CC irons. This is attributed to the more fragile and porous nature of the CC bodies, making impact-induced melting on their surfaces difficult. The chemical characteristics of all iron meteorites together reveal slightly more oxidizing conditions during core formation for CC compared to NC irons. More strikingly, strong depletions in moderately volatile elements, typical of many iron meteorite parent bodies, predominantly occur among CC irons.

 - **Abstract**
 A key step in the comparison between inflationary predictions and cosmological observations is the computation of primordial correlators. Numerical methods have been developed that overcome some of the difficulties arising in analytical calculations when the models considered are complex. The PyTransport package, which implements the transport formalism, allows computation of the tree-level 2- and 3-point correlation functions for multi-field models with arbitrary potentials and a curved field space. In this work we investigate an alternative numerical implementation of the transport approach, based on the use of transfer ''matrices'' called multi-point propagators (MPP). We test the novel MPP method, and extensively compare it with the traditional implementation of the transport approach provided in PyTransport. We highlight advantages of the former, discussing its performance in terms of accuracy, precision and running time, as well as dependence on the number of e-folds of sub-horizon evolution and tolerance settings. For topical ultra-slow-roll models of inflation we show that MPPs (i) precisely track the decay of correlators even when PyTransport produces erroneous results, (ii) extend the computation of squeezed bispectra for squeezing values at least one decade beyond those attainable with PyTransport.

 - **Abstract**
 This work presents the simulation results of the radio science experiment onboard the proposed Heavy Metal mission to the M-type asteroid (216) Kleopatra. Earth-based radiometric measurements (range and range-rate), complemented by images from the onboard optical camera and by measurements from the inter-satellite link between the maincraft and a secondary subcraft, are used in an orbit determination process to assess the attainable accuracy for the mass of Kleopatra and its extended gravity field. Preliminary results indicate that the asteroid mass can be retrieved with a relative accuracy up to $10^{-7}$, while the extended gravity field can be estimated up to degree 10 with sufficient accuracy to discriminate between internal structure models, satisfying the scientific goals of the mission.

 - **Abstract**
 Planetary growth within protoplanetary disks involves accreting material from their surroundings, yet the underlying mechanisms and physical conditions of the accreting gas remain debated. This study aims to investigate the dynamics and thermodynamic properties of accreting gas giants, and to characterize the envelope that forms near the planet during accretion. We employ three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of a Jupiter-mass planet embedded in a viscous gaseous disk. Our models incorporate a non-isothermal energy equation to compute gas and radiation energy diffusion and include radiative feedback from the planet. Results indicate that gas accretion occurs supersonically towards the planet, forming an ionized envelope that extends from the planetary surface up to 0.2 times the Hill radius in the no-feedback model, and up to 0.4 times the Hill radius in the feedback model. The envelope's radius, or ionization radius, acts as a boundary halting supersonic gas inflow and is pivotal for estimating accretion rates and H$\alpha$ emission luminosities. Including radiative feedback increases accretion rates, especially within the ionization radius and from areas to the right of the planet when the star is positioned to the left. The accretion luminosities calculated at the ionization radius are substantially lower than those calculated at the Hill radius, highlighting potential misinterpretations in the non-detection of H$\alpha$ emissions as indicators of ongoing planet formation.

 - **Abstract**
 The first Euclid Quick Data Release, Q1, comprises 63.1 sq deg of the Euclid Deep Fields (EDFs) to nominal wide-survey depth. It encompasses visible and near-infrared space-based imaging and spectroscopic data, ground-based photometry in the u, g, r, i and z bands, as well as corresponding masks. Overall, Q1 contains about 30 million objects in three areas near the ecliptic poles around the EDF-North and EDF-South, as well as the EDF-Fornax field in the constellation of the same name. The purpose of this data release -- and its associated technical papers -- is twofold. First, it is meant to inform the community of the enormous potential of the Euclid survey data, to describe what is contained in these data, and to help prepare expectations for the forthcoming first major data release DR1. Second, it enables a wide range of initial scientific projects with wide-survey Euclid data, ranging from the early Universe to the Solar System. The Q1 data were processed with early versions of the processing pipelines, which already demonstrate good performance, with numerous improvements in implementation compared to pre-launch development. In this paper, we describe the sky areas released in Q1, the observations, a top-level view of the data processing of Euclid and associated external data, the Q1 photometric masks, and how to access the data. We also give an overview of initial scientific results obtained using the Q1 data set by Euclid Consortium scientists, and conclude with important caveats when using the data. As a complementary product, Q1 also contains observations of a star-forming area in Lynd's Dark Nebula 1641 in the Orion~A Cloud, observed for technical purposes during Euclid's performance-verification phase. This is a unique target, of a type not commonly found in Euclid's nominal sky survey.

 This paper describes the VIS Processing Function (VIS PF) of the Euclid ground segment pipeline, which processes and calibrates raw data from the VIS camera. We present the algorithms used in each processing element, along with a description of the on-orbit performance of VIS PF, based on Performance Verification (PV) and Q1 data. We demonstrate that the principal performance metrics (image quality, astrometric accuracy, photometric calibration) are within pre-launch specifications. The image-to-image photometric scatter is less than $0.8\%$, and absolute astrometric accuracy compared to Gaia is $5$ mas Image quality is stable over all Q1 images with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of $0.\!^{\prime\prime}16$. The stacked images (combining four nominal and two short exposures) reach $I_\mathrm{E} = 25.6$ ($10\sigma$, measured as the variance of $1.\!^{\prime\prime}3$ diameter apertures). We also describe quality control metrics provided with each image, and an appendix provides a detailed description of the provided data products. The excellent quality of these images demonstrates the immense potential of Euclid VIS data for weak lensing. VIS data, covering most of the extragalactic sky, will provide a lasting high-resolution atlas of the Universe.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper describes the near-infrared processing function (NIR PF) that processes near-infrared images from the Near-Infrared Spectrometer and Photometer (NISP) instrument onboard the Euclid satellite. NIR PF consists of three main components: (i) a common pre-processing stage for both photometric (NIR) and spectroscopic (SIR) data to remove instrumental effects; (ii) astrometric and photometric calibration of NIR data, along with catalogue extraction; and (iii) resampling and stacking. The necessary calibration products are generated using dedicated pipelines that process observations from both the early performance verification (PV) phase in 2023 and the nominal survey operations. After outlining the pipeline's structure and algorithms, we demonstrate its application to Euclid Q1 images. For Q1, we achieve an astrometric accuracy of 9-15 mas, a relative photometric accuracy of 5 mmag, and an absolute flux calibration limited by the 1% uncertainty of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) CALSPEC database. We characterise the point-spread function (PSF) that we find very stable across the focal plane, and we discuss current limitations of NIR PF that will be improved upon for future data releases.

 - **Abstract**
 The SPE processing function (PF) of the \Euclid pipeline is dedicated to the automatic analysis of one-dimensional spectra to determine redshifts, line fluxes, and spectral classifications. The first \Euclid Quick Data Release (Q1) delivers these measurements for all $H_\mathrm{E}<22.5$ objects identified in the photometric survey. In this paper, we present an overview of the SPE PF algorithm and assess its performance by comparing its results with high-quality spectroscopic redshifts from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey in the Euclid Deep Field North. Our findings highlight remarkable accuracy in successful redshift measurements, with a bias of less than $3 \times 10^{-5}$ in $(z_{\rm SPE}-z_{\rm DESI})/(1+z_{\rm DESI})$ and a high precision of approximately $10^{-3}$. The majority of spectra have only a single spectral feature or none at all. To avoid spurious detections, where noise features are misinterpreted as lines or lines are misidentified, it is therefore essential to apply well-defined criteria on quantities such as the redshift probability or the \ha\ flux and signal-to-noise ratio. Using a well-tuned quality selection, we achieve an 89\% redshift success rate in the target redshift range for cosmology ($0.9<z<1.8$), which is well covered by DESI for $z<1.6$. Outside this range where the \ha\ line is observable, redshift measurements are less reliable, except for sources showing specific spectral features (e.g., two bright lines or strong continuum). Ongoing refinements along the entire chain of PFs are expected to enhance both the redshift measurements and the spectral classification, allowing us to define the large and reliable sample required for cosmological analyses. Overall, the Q1 SPE results are promising, demonstrating encouraging potential for cosmology.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a catalogue of 497 galaxy-galaxy strong lenses in the Euclid Quick Release 1 data (63 deg$^2$). In the initial 0.45\% of Euclid's surveys, we double the total number of known lens candidates with space-based imaging. Our catalogue includes 250 grade A candidates, the vast majority of which (243) were previously unpublished. Euclid's resolution reveals rare lens configurations of scientific value including double-source-plane lenses, edge-on lenses, complete Einstein rings, and quadruply-imaged lenses. We resolve lenses with small Einstein radii ($\theta_{\rm E} < \ang{;;1}$) in large numbers for the first time. These lenses are found through an initial sweep by deep learning models, followed by Space Warps citizen scientist inspection, expert vetting, and system-by-system modelling. Our search approach scales straightforwardly to Euclid Data Release 1 and, without changes, would yield approximately 7000 high-confidence (grade A or B) lens candidates by late 2026. Further extrapolating to the complete Euclid Wide Survey implies a likely yield of over 100000 high-confidence candidates, transforming strong lensing science.

 - **Abstract**
 The observation of gravitational waves from merging black holes and neutron stars provides a unique opportunity to discern information about their astrophysical environment. Two signatures that are considered powerful tracers to distinguish between different binary formation channels are general-relativistic spin-induced orbital precession and orbital eccentricity. Both effects leave characteristic imprints in the gravitational-wave signal that can be extracted from observations. To date, neither precession nor eccentricity have been discerned in neutron star - black hole binaries. Here we report the first measurement of orbital eccentricity in a neutron star - black hole binary. Using, for the first time, a waveform model that incorporates precession and eccentricity, we perform Bayesian inference on the event GW200105 and infer a median orbital eccentricity of $e_{20}\sim 0.145$ at an orbital period of $0.1$s, excluding zero at more than $99\%$ confidence. We find inconclusive evidence for the presence of precession, consistent with previous, non-eccentric results. Our result implies a fraction of these binaries will exhibit orbital eccentricity even at small separations, suggesting formation through mechanisms involving dynamical interactions beyond isolated binary evolution. Future observations will reveal the contribution of eccentric neutron star - black hole binaries to the total merger rate across cosmic time.

 - **Abstract**
 Neutron star-black hole (NSBH) mergers, detectable via their gravitational-wave (GW) emission, are expected to produce kilonovae (KNe). Four NSBH candidates have been identified and followed-up by more than fifty instruments since the start of the fourth GW Observing Run (O4), in May 2023, up to July 2024; however, no confirmed associated KN has been detected. This study evaluates ejecta properties from multi-messenger observations to understand the absence of detectable KN: we use GW public information and joint observations taken from 05.2023 to 07.2024 (LVK, ATLAS, DECam, GECKO, GOTO, GRANDMA, SAGUARO, TESS, WINTER, ZTF). First, our analysis on follow-up observation strategies shows that, on average, more than 50% of the simulated KNe associated with NSBH mergers reach their peak luminosity around one day after merger in the $g,r,i$- bands, which is not necessarily covered for each NSBH GW candidate. We also analyze the trade-off between observation efficiency and the intrinsic properties of the KN emission, to understand the impact on how these constraints affect our ability to detect the KN, and underlying ejecta properties for each GW candidate. In particular, we can only confirm the kilonova was not missed for 1% of the GW230529 and S230627c sky localization region, given the large sky localization error of GW230529 and the large distance for S230627c and, their respective KN faint luminosities. More constraining, for S230518h, we infer the dynamical ejecta and post-merger disk wind ejecta $m_{dyn}, m_{wind}$ $<$ $0.03$ $M_\odot$ and the viewing angle $\theta>25^\circ$. Similarly, the non-astrophysical origin of S240422ed is likely further confirmed by the fact that we would have detected even a faint KN at the time and presumed distance of the S240422ed event candidate, within a minimum 45% credible region of the sky area, that can be larger depending on the KN scenario.

          Spectroscopy of Supernova Remnants and Candidates in M31

 - **Abstract**
 With a star formation rate of order 0.4 M$_\odot $ yr$^{-1}$, M31 should have significant population of supernova remnants (SNRs), and, in fact, 156 SNR and SNR candidates have been suggested by Lee et al. (2014) by searching for nebulae with elevated [SII]/H${\alpha}$ ratios in narrow band images. Here we use a combination of low and high resolution optical spectroscopy obtained with Hectospec on the MMT to characterize 152 of these nebulae. Of these candidates, we find 93 nebulae that have [SII]/H${\alpha}$ ratios that exceed 0.4, the traditional ratio used to separate SNRs from HII regions, strongly suggesting that at least these objects are SNRs. Our high resolution spectroscopy reveals 108 nebulae that have velocity widths in H${\alpha} $ (full-width at 20% peak flux) that exceed 50 km s$^{-1}$, significantly larger than found in HII regions. There are 72 objects that satisfy both tests. Here we discuss the spectroscopic characteristics of all of the objects in our sample, and the likelihood that other objects in the sample of Lee et al. are also SNRs, and we briefly consider confirmation by X-ray, radio and UV observations. We also discuss several new candidates that have been identified serendipitously in the course of examining a large amount of archival Hectospec data.

          Bright Sungrazing Comets in a Great Historical Controversy and Prospects for Their Appearance in the Near Future

 - **Abstract**
 Until the second half of the 19th century, two or more brief appearances of bright comets, such as the ones in 1668 and 1702, alike in aspect and motion, seen with a tail near the Sun, were almost universally believed to be periodic returns of a single object. It is likely that the exceptional story of Halley's comet was the compelling precedent for this school of thought. Application to sungrazers was discredited by the observed fragmentation of the nucleus of the giant sungrazer of 1882 shortly after perihelion. Generally, separations and orbital periods of the Kreutz comets are known to be governed in such events by the solar tidal force, while the range in the longitude of the nodal line is linked to the pyramidal architecture caused by nontidal, cascading fragmentation along the entire orbit and described by an updated contact-binary model. Perception of the sungrazer system was changed dramatically by coronagraphic imaging from space, which led to discovery of up to ten populations of dwarf comets. Past fragmentation patterns have been used to tentatively predict the arrivals of two bright Kreutz sungrazers -- a Population II member around 2027 (and before 2040) and a Population I member around 2050.

 - **Abstract**
 The atmospheres of ultra-hot Jupiters are unique compared to other planets because of the presence of both refractory and volatile gaseous species, enabling a new lens to constrain a planet's composition, chemistry, and formation. WASP-178b is one such ultra-hot Jupiter that was recently found to exhibit enormous NUV absorption between 0.2 and 0.4 $\mu$m from some combination of Fe+, Mg, and SiO. Here, we present new infrared observations of WASP-178b with HST/WFC3 and JWST/NIRSpec/G395H, providing novel measurements of the volatile species H$_2$O and CO in WASP-178b's atmosphere. Atmospheric retrievals find a range of compositional interpretations depending on which dataset is retrieved, the type of chemistry assumed, and the temperature structure parametrization used due to the combined effects of thermal dissociation, the lack of volatile spectral features besides H$_2$O and CO, and the relative weakness of H$_2$O and CO themselves. Taken together with a new state-of-the-art characterization of the host star, our retrieval analyses suggests a solar to super-solar [O/H] and [Si/H], but sub-solar [C/H], perhaps suggesting rock-laden atmospheric enrichment near the H$_2$O iceline. To obtain meaningful abundance constraints for this planet, it was essential to combine the JWST IR data with short-wavelength HST observations, highlighting the ongoing synergy between the two facilities.

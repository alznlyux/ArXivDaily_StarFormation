 - **Abstract**
 The computational expense of solving non-equilibrium chemistry equations in astrophysical simulations poses a significant challenge, particularly in high-resolution, large-scale cosmological models. In this work, we explore the potential of machine learning, specifically Neural Operators, to emulate the Grackle chemistry solver, which is widely used in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. Neural Operators offer a mesh-free, data-driven approach to approximate solutions to coupled ordinary differential equations governing chemical evolution, gas cooling, and heating. We construct and train multiple Neural Operator architectures (DeepONet variants) using a dataset derived from cosmological simulations to optimize accuracy and efficiency. Our results demonstrate that the trained models accurately reproduce Grackle's outputs with an average error of less than 0.6 dex in most cases, though deviations increase in highly dynamic chemical environments. Compared to Grackle, the machine learning models provide computational speedups of up to a factor of six in large-scale simulations, highlighting their potential for reducing computational bottlenecks in astrophysical modeling. However, challenges remain, particularly in iterative applications where accumulated errors can lead to numerical instability. Additionally, the performance of these machine learning models is constrained by their need for well-represented training datasets and the limited extrapolation capabilities of deep learning methods. While promising, further development is required for Neural Operator-based emulators to be fully integrated into astrophysical simulations. Future work should focus on improving stability over iterative timesteps and optimizing implementations for hardware acceleration. This study provides an initial step toward the broader adoption of machine learning approaches in astrophysical chemistry solvers.

 - **Abstract**
 Since its inception, speckle interferometry has revolutionized high-resolution astronomical imaging, overcoming atmospheric challenges to achieve the diffraction limits of telescopes. Almost a decade ago, in 2018, a pair of speckle cameras -- 'Alopeke and Zorro -- were installed at the twin 8.1-meter Gemini North and South telescopes, two of the largest apertures in the world, in Hawai'i and Chile. Equipped with dual blue and red channels, 'Alopeke and Zorro deliver high-resolution imaging across optical bandpasses from 350 to 1000 nm, which has led to crucial discoveries in both stellar multiplicity and exoplanetary science. Furthermore, the broad and nonrestrictive access to these instruments, given by each Gemini Observatory partner and via the US NOIRLab open skies policy, has allowed our community to expand the applications of the instruments, supporting a wide range of scientific investigations from Solar System bodies, to morphological studies of stellar remnants, to evolved stars, to transient phenomena. This paper reviews the instrument technology and observational capabilities, and highlights key scientific contributions and discoveries of 'Alopeke and Zorro, emphasizing the enduring importance of speckle interferometry in advancing modern observational astronomy and expanding the frontiers of astronomical research.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new machine learning algorithm for classifying short-duration features in raw time ordered data (TODs) of cosmic microwave background survey observations. The algorithm, specifically designed for the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), works in conjunction with the previous TOD preprocessing techniques that employ statistical thresholding to indiscriminately remove all large spikes in the data, whether they are due to noise features, cosmic rays, or true astrophysical sources in a process called "data cuts". This has the undesirable effect of excising real astrophysical sources, including transients, from the data. The machine learning algorithm demonstrated in this work uses the output from these data cuts and is able to differentiate between electronic noise, cosmic rays, and point sources, enabling the removal of undesired signals while retaining true astrophysical signals during TOD pre-processing. We achieve an overall accuracy of 90% in categorizing data spikes of different origin and, importantly, 94% for identifying those caused by astrophysical sources. Our algorithm also measures the amplitude of any detected source seen more than once and produces a sub-minute to minute light curve, providing information on its short timescale variability. This automated algorithm for source detection and amplitude estimation will be particularly useful for upcoming surveys with large data volumes, such as the Simons Observatory.

 - **Abstract**
 Blast wave models are commonly used to model relativistic outflows from ultra-relativistic gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), but are also applied to lower Lorentz factor ejections from X-ray binaries (XRBs). Here we revisit the physics of blast waves and reverse shocks in these systems and explore the similarities and differences between the ultra-relativistic ($\Gamma \gg 1$) and moderately relativistic ($\Gamma \sim$ a few) regimes. We first demonstrate that the evolution of the blast wave radius as a function of the observer frame time is recovered in the on-axis ultra-relativistic limit from a general energy and radius blast wave evolution, emphasizing that XRB ejections are off-axis, moderately relativistic cousins of GRB afterglows. We show that, for fixed blast wave or ejecta energy, reverse shocks cross the ejecta much later (earlier) on in the evolution for less (more) relativistic systems, and find that reverse shocks are much longer-lived in XRBs and off-axis GRBs compared to on-axis GRBs. Reverse shock crossing should thus typically finish after $\sim10-100$ days (in the observer frame) in XRB ejections. This characteristic, together with their moderate Lorentz factors and resolvable core separations, makes XRB ejections unique laboratories for shock and particle acceleration physics. We discuss the impact of geometry and lateral spreading on our results, explore how to distinguish between different shock components, and comment on the implications for GRB and XRB environments. Additionally, we argue that identification of reverse shock signatures in XRBs could provide an independent constraint on the ejecta Lorentz factor.

 - **Abstract**
 Black hole X-ray binaries in outburst launch discrete, large-scale jet ejections which can propagate to parsec scales. The kinematics of these ejecta appear to be well described by relativistic blast wave models original devised for gamma-ray burst afterglows. In previous kinematic-only modelling, a crucial degeneracy prevented the initial ejecta energy and the interstellar medium density from being accurately determined. In this work, we present the first joint Bayesian modelling of the radiation and kinematics of a large-scale jet ejection from the X-ray binary MAXI J1535-571. We demonstrate that a reverse shock powers the bright, early ejecta emission. The joint model breaks the energetic degeneracy, and we find a conservative initial ejecta energy of $E_{0} \sim 4 \times 10^{43} \, {\rm erg}$, consistent with the disc luminosity integrated over a flare-informed launching timescale, and a low interstellar medium density of $n_{\rm ism} \sim 5 \times 10^{-5} \, {\rm cm^{-3}}$. This work lays the foundation for future parameter estimation studies using all available data of X-ray binary jet ejecta.

 - **Abstract**
 Pulsar Timing Arrays are playing a crucial role in the ongoing gravitational wave astronomy revolution. The current evidence for a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) at nHz frequencies offers an opportunity to discover cosmological signals and threatens the observability of other subdominant GWs. We explore prospects to constrain second-order scalar-induced GWs (SIGWs) associated with enhanced curvature perturbations in the primordial universe, forecasting realistic future PTA datasets. We assess how the currently observed signal could eventually limit future capabilities to search for GW relics of primordial phenomena and associated phenomenological consequences such as primordial black hole (PBH) formation. Given the sensitivity of PBH abundance to spectral parameters, measuring it remains a challenge for realistic signals. However, future observation could still rule out nearly subsolar mass PBHs formed through standard formation scenarios in some cases. Future progress in constraining PBH models is expected to stem from theoretical advancements in PBH computations, which should help resolve the tension between different computational methods. The analysis is based on and extends the Python code $\texttt{fastPTA}$.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate a scenario where a dark energy quintessence field $\phi$ with positive kinetic energy is coupled with dark matter. With two different self-interaction potentials for the field and a particular choice of the coupling function, we show explicitly how the observable effective equation of state parameter $w_{\rm eff}$ for the dark energy field crosses the phantom barrier ($w_{\rm eff} = -1$) while keeping the equation of state of the quintessence field $w_\phi > -1$. With appropriate choices of parameters, $w_{\rm eff}$ crosses the phantom divide around redshift $z\sim 0.5$, transitioning from $w_{\rm eff} <-1$ in the past to $w_{\rm eff}>-1$ today. This explains DESI observations well. Our analysis reveals that the model remains consistent within the $2\sigma$ confidence intervals provided by DESI for several combinations of the scalar field parameters, highlighting its potential in explaining the dynamics of dark energy arising from a simple Yukawa-type long-range interaction in the dark sector. While the current findings offer a promising framework for interpreting DESI observations, future work, including a comprehensive Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis, is necessary to constrain the parameter space further and strengthen the statistical significance of the results.

 - **Abstract**
 This work investigates the multi-wavelength properties of 165 4FGL blazars from the Fermi-LAT fourth source catalogue, looking for with counterparts in the Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP) First Large Absorption Survey in HI (FLASH) continuum. Using high-resolution data from FLASH and complementary radio datasets, combined with archival Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) observations, we perform detailed spectral energy distribution (SED) analyses across cm-to-mm wavelengths. Our findings reveal that most blazars exhibit re-triggered peaked spectra, indicative of emission dominated by a single emitting region. Additionally, we identify strong correlations between radio and gamma-ray luminosities, highlighting the significant role of relativistic jets in these active galactic nuclei. The inclusion of spectroscopic redshifts from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and Gaia enables a comprehensive analysis of the evolutionary trends and physical characteristics of the sources. Furthermore, we report a tight Radio-X-ray Correlation for Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars, contrasting with the more scattered behaviour observed in BL-Lacs, reflecting their distinct accretion and jet-driving mechanisms. These results provide critical insights into the physics of blazars and their environments, paving the way for future studies with next-generation facilities like the SKA Observatory (SKAO) for radio observations and Cherenkov Telescope Array for gamma-ray studies.

 - **Abstract**
 In the cosmic web, filaments play a crucial role in connecting walls to clusters and also act as an important stage for galaxy formation and evolution. Recent observational studies claim that filaments have spin. In this study, we examined the potential impact of diversity in filament identification algorithms and galaxy survey datasets on the quantification of filament spin. The results of this study demonstrate qualitative agreement with previous research, suggesting that a reliable filament spin signal is detectable when the viewing angle of filament spine larger than 80 degrees under a rough estimation. The detected filament spin signal is intricately linked to the viewing angle, dynamic temperature, etc. The quantitative difference of filament spin signal among samples is slightly dependent on the filament identification algorithms, while the value is relatively greater dependent on the redshift space distortion effect in the galaxy sample.

 - **Abstract**
 Comparative studies of young and old exoplanet populations offer a glimpse into how planets may form and evolve with time. We present an occurrence rate study of short-period ($<$12 days) planets between 1.8--10 Rearth around 1374 FGK stars in nearby (200 pc) young clusters ($<$1 Gyr), utilizing data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission. These planets represent a population closer to their primordial state. We find that the occurrence rate of young planets is higher ($64^{+32}_{-22}$%) compared to the Gyr-old population observed by \kepler ($7.98^{+0.37}_{-0.35}$%). Dividing our sample into bins of young (10--100 Myr) and intermediate (100\,Myr--1 Gyr) ages, we also find that the occurrence distribution in orbital period remains unchanged while the distribution in planet radius changes with time. Specifically, the radius distribution steepens with age, indicative of a larger planet population shrinking due to the atmospheric thermal cooling and mass loss. We also find evidence for an increase (1.9$\sigma$) in occurrence after 100 Myr, possibly due to tidal migration driving planets inside of 12 days. While evidence suggests post-disk migration and atmospheric mass loss shape the population of short-period planets, more detections of young planets are needed to improve statistical comparisons with older planets. Detecting long-period young planets and planets $<$1.8 Rearth will help us understand these processes better. Additionally, studying young planetary atmospheres provides insights into planet formation and the efficiency of atmospheric mass loss mechanisms on the evolution of planetary systems.

          Thermodynamics of self-gravitating fermions as a robust theory for dark matter halos: Stability analysis applied to the Milky Way

 - **Abstract**
 We present a framework for dark matter (DM) halo formation based on a kinetic theory of self-gravitating fermions together with a solid connection to thermodynamics. Based on maximum entropy arguments, this approach predicts a most likely phase-space distribution which takes into account the Pauli exclusion principle, relativistic effects, and particle evaporation. The most general equilibrium configurations depend on the particle mass and develop a degenerate compact core embedded in a diluted halo, both linked by their fermionic nature. By applying such a theory to the Milky Way we analyze the stability of different families of equilibrium solutions with implications on the DM distribution and the mass of the DM candidate. We find that stable core-halo profiles, which explain the DM distribution in the Galaxy, exist only in the range $mc^2 \approx 194 - 387\,\rm{keV}$. The lower bound is a consequence of imposing thermodynamical stability on the core-halo solutions having a $4.2\times 10^6 M_\odot$ quantum core mass alternative to the black hole hypothesis at the Galaxy center. The upper bound is solely an outcome of general relativity when the quantum core reaches the Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit and undergoes gravitational collapse towards a black hole. We demonstrate that there exists a set of stable core-halo profiles which are astrophysically relevant in the sense that their total mass is finite, do not suffer from the gravothermal catastrophe, and agree with observations. The morphology of the outer halo tail is described by a polytrope of index $5/2$, developing a sharp decline of the density beyond $25\,\rm{kpc}$ in excellent agreement with the latest Gaia DR3 rotation curve data. Moreover, we obtain a total mass of about $2\times 10^{11} M_\odot$ including baryons and a local DM density of about $0.4\,\rm{GeV}\,c^{-2}\,\rm{cm}^{-3}$ in line with recent independent estimates.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Planetary migration models predict multiple planets captured into a chain of mean-motion resonances during the disk phase. Over a dozen systems have been observed in these configurations, nearly all close-in planets, with a lack of resonant chains for planets with orbital periods larger than ~300 days. Aims. Dynamical studies often overlook the fact that stars do not evolve in isolation. In this work, we explore the possibility that the absence of giant planets in long-period resonant chains may be due to post-formation disruption caused by stellar flybys. Methods. For planets in the 2:1-2:1 and 3:2-3:2 resonant chains, we evaluate the long-term stability after varying parameters such as the planet masses, as well as the inclination, pericentric distance, and mass of the flyby star. Results. Our integrations show that the 2:1-2:1 resonant chain is significantly more resilient to a stellar flyby than for the 3:2-3:2 configuration. The nature of the instability is different in both scenarios, the 2:1-2:1 becomes unstable quickly, soon after a penetrative close encounter. Instead, planets in the 3:2-3:2 chain become unstable in long timescales due to more distant flybys (up to q/a_out ~ 25 for Jupiter-mass planets) that only provide small perturbations for the system to chaotically dissolve. Conclusions. If an encounter occurs between a star hosting planets and a passing star, Jupiter-mass systems with 3 planets in a 3:2-3:2 resonant chain or more compact initial configurations are likely to be disrupted.

 Image alignment plays a crucial role in solar physics research, primarily involving translation, rotation, and scaling. \G{The different wavelength images of the chromosphere and transition region have structural complexity and differences in similarity, which poses a challenge to their alignment.} Therefore, a novel alignment approach based on dense optical flow (OF) and the RANSAC algorithm is proposed in this paper. \G{It takes the OF vectors of similar regions between images to be used as feature points for matching. Then, it calculates scaling, rotation, and translation.} The study selects three wavelengths for two groups of alignment experiments: the 304 Å of the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA), the 1216 Å of the Solar Disk Imager (SDI), and the 465 Å of the Solar Upper Transition Region Imager (SUTRI). Two methods are used to evaluate alignment accuracy: Monte Carlo simulation and Uncertainty Analysis Based on the Jacobian Matrix (UABJM). \G{The evaluation results indicate that this approach achieves sub-pixel accuracy in the alignment of AIA 304 Å and SDI 1216 Å, while demonstrating higher accuracy in the alignment of AIA 304 Å and SUTRI 465 Å, which have greater similarity.

          Dust Clumping in Outer Protoplanetary Disks: the Interplay Among Four Instabilities

 - **Abstract**
 Dust concentration in protoplanetary disks (PPDs) is the first step towards planetesimal formation, a crucial yet highly uncertain stage in planet formation. Although the streaming instability (SI) is widely recognized as a powerful mechanism for planetesimal formation, its properties can be sensitive to the gas dynamical environment. The outer region of PPDs is subject to the vertical shear instability (VSI), which could further induce the Rossby wave instability (RWI) to generate numerous vortices. In this work, we use the multifluid dust module in Athena++ to perform a 3D global simulation with mesh refinement to achieve adequate domain size and resolution to resolve and accommodate all these instabilities. The VSI mainly governs the overall gas dynamics, dominated by the breathing mode due to dust mass loading. The dust strongly settles to the midplane layer, which is much more densely populated with small vortices compared to the dust-free case. Strong dust clumping is observed, which is likely owing to the joint action of the SI and dusty RWI, and those sufficient for planetesimal formation reside only in a small fraction of such vortices. Dust clumping becomes stronger with increasing resolution, and has not yet achieved numerical convergence in our exploration. In addition, we find evidence of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) operating at certain parts of the dust-gas interface, which may contribute to the temporary destruction of dust clumps.

 - **Abstract**
 Aims. Asteroseismic radius and Gaia distance (ARD) method has been proposed to establish the SBCRs for late-type stars. Methods. We select Kepler RGB stars with high-precision asteroseismic radii (uncertainties < 1%) and cross-match them with 2MASS, APASS, and Gaia to obtain Johnson-B, Johnson-V, G, J, H, and Ks-band photometric data. After applying selection criteria, we obtain 626 RGB stars to build the SBCR. Among these, 100 RGBs are used as independent validation for the distance, and the remaining samples are used to fit the SBCR. Results. First, using 526 targets with asteroseismic radii and Gaia distances, nine SBCRs are proposed based on 2MASS (J, H, Ks), APASS (Johnson-B, Johnson-V), and Gaia (G) photometry. The average rms scatter in these relations is 0.075 mag, which corresponds to an uncertainty of approximately 3.5% in distance. These relations are further validated using 100 independent samples with Gaia distances, showing no bias, with a dispersion of approximately 3%. Compared to interferometric measurements, a systematic underestimation of 2.3% was observed, and the discrepancy decreases as the angular diameter increases. Additionally, the distances of eclipsing binaries in the Large Magellanic Cloud and Small Magellanic Cloud obtained using our SBCRs are generally consistent with those measured in the literature, with a dispersion of 1% and a slight overestimation of 1% to 2.5%. Conclusions. The ARD method capitalizes on two key advantages for precise stellar distance determination: a statistically robust sample of homogeneous RGB stars with low observational costs, and independent distance verification through Gaia data. Such SBCRs can be further calibrated and expanded more efficiently and effectively.

          A Novel Calibration and Imaging Method for ALMA Observations of SgrA$^*$

 - **Abstract**
 This document presents a novel method for the intra-field calibration and imaging of the radio source SgrA$^*$, observed with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). SgrA$^*$ is a complex source comprising two components: the compact core (which exhibits high variability) and the extended minispiral (which is relatively stable over short timescales). The novel approach consists in a self-calibration method that employs the extended structure of the source (the minispiral) to calibrate the flux variability of the compact core. The algorithm involves several steps: (1) an initial CLEAN image is generated for the entire source; (2) the core is subtracted, leaving only the minispiral; (3) a two-component visibility model is constructed, comprising the minispiral and the core; (4) the model is fitted to the data, retrieving flux density parameters for each integration time; and (5) the data are scaled and calibrated, resulting in nearly constant brightness for the minispiral and variable flux for the core. The implementation of this algorithm through a script in the CASA package is described, detailing the configuration parameters and the steps involved. The success of the method is demonstrated through light curves of SgrA$^*$ observed on day 21 April 2018 in Band 6, as part of the 2018 EHT campaign. The light curves have been produced for Stokes I (total intensity), linear polarized intensity, EVPA (electric vector position angle), and Stokes V (circular polarization), providing valuable insights into the variability of this radio source.

 - **Abstract**
 The optical depth to reionization, a key parameter of the $\Lambda$CDM model, can be computed within astrophysical frameworks for star formation by modeling the evolution of the intergalactic medium. Accurate evaluation of this parameter is thus crucial for joint statistical analyses of CMB data and late-time probes such as the 21 cm power spectrum, requiring consistent integration into cosmological solvers. However, modeling the optical depth with sufficient precision in a computationally feasible manner for MCMC analyses is challenging due to the complexities of the nonlinear astrophysics. We introduce NNERO (Neural Network Emulator for Reionization and Optical depth), a framework that leverages neural networks to emulate the evolution of the free-electron fraction during cosmic dawn and reionization. We demonstrate its effectiveness by simultaneously constraining cosmological and astrophysical parameters in both standard cold dark matter and non-cold dark matter scenarios, including models with massive neutrinos and warm dark matter, showcasing its potential for efficient and accurate parameter inference.

 - **Abstract**
 We present photometric observations of the BL Lacertae object S5 0716+714 with a temporal resolution of 120 s in the Sloan i' and r' bands. These observations were conducted using the Comet Search Program telescope at Xingming Observatory from 2018 December 22 to 2020 February 15, and more than 5600 effective images were obtained on each filter across 79 nights. Additionally, we compiled long-term variability data spanning 34 yr in the optical UBVRI bands. Using the power-enhanced F-test and nested ANOVA test, we found intraday variability (IDV) on 31 nights and possible IDV on 20 nights in the i' band. Similarly, IDV was detected on 35 nights in the r' band, while possible IDV was observed on 22 nights. The minimum variability timescale is 7.33 minutes, and the estimated black hole masses are (0.68- 5.12)*10^8 Msun. The spectral variability and long-term optical light curves reveal a bluer-when-brighter trend on intraday timescales. The long-term optical flux density and spectral index exhibit periodic variability with a timescale of about 1038 days. An anticorrelation between optical flux and spectral index was observed, with a time delay of -140 days. Variability across different optical bands exhibited a strong correlation, with no discernible time lag. From the IDV, spectral variability, correlation, and time delays between different bands, we conclude that these radiation characteristics may result from the shock-in-jet model scenario.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations and simulations of coronal rain show that as cold and dense plasma falls through the corona it initially undergoes acceleration by gravity before the downward velocity saturates. Simulations have shown the emergence of an unexpected relation between terminal velocity of the rain and density ratio that has not been explained. Our aim is to explain this relation. In this paper we develop a simple point-mass model to understand how the evolution of the ambient corona moving with the coronal rain drop can influence the falling motion. We find that this simple effect results in the downward speed reaching a maximal value before decreasing, which is consistent with simulations with realistic coronal rain mass. These results provide an explanation for the scaling of the maximum downward speed to density ratio of the rain to the corona and as such provide a new tool that may be used to interpret observations.

 - **Abstract**
 We have presented a new approach to separate small spectral $\mu$ and $y$ distortions of the CMB from foreground components with poorly defined spectral shapes. Our linear method, called the Least Response Method (LRM), is based on the idea of simultaneously minimizing the response to all possible foregrounds and photon noise while maintaining a constant response to the useful signal. We compared our approach with the mILC method, which is a modification of the Internal Linear Combination previously used for CMB anisotropy maps, and proved the advantages of LRM. In addition, we found the optimal temperature of the telescope optical system for any experiments related to the study of the CMB $\mu$ distortions.

 - **Abstract**
 The detection of spectral bands at 3.06 um by MicrOmega, combined with the chemical identification of other NH-containing organic molecules in Ryugu samples, suggests the presence of potential NH-bearing compounds. However, the chemical forms of these NH-rich compounds, whether associated with N-rich organics, ammonium (NH4+) salts, NH4 or NH-organics-bearing phyllosilicates, or other forms, remain to be better understood. In this study, we report the characterization of two Ryugu particles (C0050 and C0052) using multi-scale infrared (mm-reflectance, micro-FTIR, and nano-AFM-IR) and NanoSIMS techniques to constrain the nature and origin of NH-bearing components in the Ryugu asteroid. Our findings show that Ryugu's C0052 particle contains rare, micrometer-sized NH-rich organic compounds with peaks at 1660 cm-1 (mainly due to C=O stretching of the amide I band) and 1550 cm-1 (mainly due to N-H bending vibration mode of the amide II band), indicative of amide-related compounds. In contrast, these compounds are absent in C0050. Notably, nitrogen isotopic analysis reveals that these amides in C0052 are depleted in 15N (d15N = -215 +/- 92 permil), confirming their indigenous origin, while carbon and hydrogen isotopic compositions are indistinguishable from terrestrial values within errors (d13C = -22 +/- 52 and dD = 194 +/- 368 permil). The amides detected in C0052 could have formed through hydrothermal alteration from carboxylic acids and amines precursors on the Ryugu's parent planetesimal. Alternatively, they could have originated from the irradiation of 15N-depleted N-bearing ice by UV light or galactic cosmic rays, either at the surface of the asteroid in the outer Solar System or on mantle of interstellar dust grains in the interstellar medium. Amides delivered to early Earth by primitive small bodies, such as asteroid Ryugu, may have played a crucial role in prebiotic chemistry.

 - **Abstract**
 Abundances of five elements, Na, Mg, Al, Si, and Sr, are investigated for 44 very metal-poor stars (-4.0 < [Fe/H] < -1.5) in the Galactic halo system based on an Local Thermodinamic Equilibrium (LTE) analysis of high-resolution near-infrared spectra obtained with the Infrared Doppler instrument (IRD) on the Subaru Telescope. Mg and Si abundances are determined for all 44 stars. The Si abundances are determined from up to 29 lines, which provide reliable abundance ratios compared to previous results from a few optical lines. The Mg and Si of these stars are over-abundant, relative to iron, and are well-explained by chemical-evolution models. No significant scatter is found in the abundance ratios of both elements with respect to iron, except for a few outliers. The small scatter of the abundance ratios of these elements provides constraints on the variations of stellar and supernova's yields at very low metallicity. Al abundances are determined for 27 stars from near-infrared lines (e.g., 1312nm), which are expected to be less affected by non-LTE (NLTE) effects than optical resonance lines. The average of the [Al/Fe] ratios is close to the solar value, and no dependence on metallicity is found over -3.0 < [Fe/H] < -2.0. Na abundances are determined for 12 stars; they exhibit Solar abundance ratios and no dependence on metallicity. The Sr abundances determined from the Sr II triplet are significantly higher than those from the optical resonance lines obtained by previous studies for our sample. This discrepancy shows a clear dependence on temperature and surface gravity, supporting models that predict large NLTE effects on the near-infrared lines for metal-poor red giants.

 - **Abstract**
 We present metallicities derived from a sample of eleven M dwarfs belonging to wide binary systems with warmer FG primary companions observed by the high-resolution (R=22,500) near-infrared SDSS-IV APOGEE spectra. Using a plane-parallel one-dimensional local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) abundance analysis, we determine effective temperatures ($T_{\rm eff}$) based on the abundance equilibrium from the Fe I, FeH, OH, and H$_2$O spectral lines. We obtained three $T_{\rm eff}$ scales based on these lines and found that, regardless of the chosen $T_{\rm eff}$ scale, the M dwarf metallicities agree well with those of the warmer primaries, where the upper mean abundance difference limit is 0.04 $\pm$ 0.06. This good agreement confirms that FeH lines are a reliable indicator of $T_{\rm eff}$ in the $H-$band spectra.

 - **Abstract**
 Titan has a climate system with similarities to Earth, including the presence of a thick atmosphere made up of several atmospheric layers. As on Earth, Titan's climate is influenced by several factors: the gaseous species making up the atmosphere, the energy deposited on the satellite, and solid organic aerosols. Indeed, numerous observations have revealed the presence of solid particles in the form of an opaque orange haze in Titan's atmosphere, influencing radiation balance and atmospheric dynamics, for example. However, the influence of these suspended solid particles seems to evolve according to the atmospheric altitude where they are located, certainly testifying to the presence of organic solids with different physico-chemical properties. At present, it is suspected that several populations/classes of atmospheric aerosols may form following different chemical pathways, and that aerosols undergo growth processes that modify their properties. We propose the calculation of an uptake coefficient between six neutral gaseous products (C2H2, HCN, C2H6, C2H3N, HC3N, C2N2) and the surface of the Titan aerosol analogues produced in this study.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent cosmological observations suggest that the dark energy equation of state may have changed in the latter stages of cosmic history. We introduce a quintessence scenario, termed bounded dark energy, capable of explaining this feature in a technically natural way. Our approach is motivated from a bottom-up perspective, based on the concept of mirage cut-off, where we demonstrate the stability of the quintessence potential against large quantum corrections. At the same time, the bounded dark energy framework aligns well with top-down considerations motivated from quantum gravity arguments. We employ both human-driven insights and machine learning techniques to identify explicit realizations of bounded dark energy models. We then perform an analysis based on Markov Chain Monte-Carlo to assess their predictions against CMB, galaxy surveys, and supernova data, showing that bounded dark energy provides a good fit to current observations. We also discuss how upcoming measurements can further test and refine our proposal.

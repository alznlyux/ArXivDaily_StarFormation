 - **Abstract**
 We present atmospheric retrievals from Keck/KPIC phase II observations of the ultra-hot Jupiter KELT-20/MASCARA-2~b. Previous free retrievals of molecular abundances for ultra-hot Jupiters have been impacted by significant model biases due to variations in vertical abundance profiles, which we address by including molecular dissociation into our retrieval framework as an additional free parameter. We measure the abundance of CO ($\rm \log CO_{MMR} = -2.5^{+0.6}_{-0.5}$) and obtain a lower limit on the abundance of H$_2$O ($\rm \log H{_2}O_{MMR} = -1.5^{+0.8}_{-1.0}$, $>-3.0$ at 95\% confidence) in the atmosphere of \keltb. These abundances yield an atmospheric $\rm C/O = 0.1^{+0.4}_{-0.1}$ ($\rm C/O < 0.9$ at 95\% confidence) and suggest a metallicity approximately solar to $10\times$ solar. H$_2$O is dissociated at pressures below $\log P_{\rm H_2O} = -1.2^{+0.5}_{-0.7}$ bar, roughly consistent with predictions from chemical equilibrium models, and suggesting that the retrieved composition is not a result of assumptions about the vertical mixing profiles. We also constrain the rotational velocity of \keltb\ to $v\sin i = 7.5\pm0.7$ \kms, suggesting the presence of a jet comparable to the sound speed in the direction of the planet's rotation, assuming the actual rotation of the planet is tidally locked.

 - **Abstract**
 Large-scale HI surveys and their cross-correlations with galaxy distributions have immense potential as cosmological probes. Interpreting these measurements requires theoretical models that must incorporate redshift-space distortions (RSDs), such as the Kaiser and fingers-of-God (FoG) effect, and differences in the tracer and matter distributions via the tracer bias. These effects are commonly approximated with assumptions that should be tested on simulated distributions. In this work, we use the hydrodynamical simulation suite IllustrisTNG to assess the performance of models of $z \leq 1$ HI auto and HI-galaxy cross-power spectra, finding that the models employed by recent observations introduce errors comparable to or exceeding their measurement uncertainties. In particular, neglecting FoG causes $\gtrsim 10\%$ deviations between the modeled and simulated power spectra at $k \gtrsim 0.1$ $h$ / Mpc, larger than assuming a constant bias which reaches the same error threshold at slightly smaller scales. However, even without these assumptions, models can still err by $\sim 10\%$ on relevant scales. These remaining errors arise from multiple RSD damping sources on HI clustering, which are not sufficiently described with a single FoG term. Overall, our results highlight the need for an improved understanding of RSDs to harness the capabilities of future measurements of HI distributions.

 - **Abstract**
 Late infall events challenge the traditional view that planet formation occurs without external influence. Here we present deep ALMA $^{12}$CO $J=2-1$ and SO $J_{N}=5_6-4_5$ observations toward AB Aurigae, a Class II disk system with strong signs of gravitational instability and ongoing planet formation. By applying Keplerian and anti-Keplerian masks, we separate disk-like and non-disk-like motions of $^{12}$CO, considering the two outputs as the 'disk' and 'exo-disk' (out of disk) emission components, respectively. The disk component of $^{12}$CO extends to $\sim 1600$ au in radius and exhibits a stunningly rich architecture of global spiral structure. The exo-disk emission consists predominantly of three spiral structures -- S1, S2 and S3 -- whose projections are co-spatial with the disk. We successfully reproduce their trajectories with a ballistic accretion flow model, finding that S1 and S2 (both redshifted) are infalling toward the disk from in front, and S3 (blueshifted) is infalling from behind. Where the terminal ends of S1 and S2 become indistinguishable from the disk, we observe a brightness peak in SO emission $2.5\times$ the azimuthal average of a background SO ring. This merging zone lies within a relatively confined region $15-100$ degrees east of north, and between $\sim150-300$ au from the star, at scales relevant to where planet candidates have been previously identified. The AB Aur system provides a unified picture of late infall inducing replenishment of the disk, triggering gravitational instability, and modifying the conditions of forming planets.

          Enceladus's Limit Cycle

 - **Abstract**
 Enceladus exhibits some remarkable phenomena, including water geysers spraying through surface cracks, a global ice shell that is librating atop an ocean, a large luminosity, and rapid outward orbital migration. Here we model the coupled evolution of Enceladus's orbit and interior structure. We find that Enceladus is driven into a periodic state: a limit cycle. Enceladus's observed phenomena emerge from the model, and the predicted values for the orbital eccentricity, libration amplitude, shell thickness, and luminosity agree with observations. A single limit cycle lasts around ten million years, and has three distinct stages: (1) freezing, (2) melting, and (3) resonant libration. Enceladus is currently in the freezing stage, meaning that its ice shell is getting thicker. That pressurizes the ocean, which in turn cracks the shell and pushes water up through the cracks. In this stage the orbital eccentricity increases, as Saturn pushes Enceladus deeper into resonance with Dione. Once the eccentricity is sufficiently high, tidal heating begins to melt the shell, which is the second stage of the cycle. In the third stage the shell remains close to 3km thick. At that thickness the shell's natural libration frequency is resonant with the orbital frequency. The shell's librations are consequently driven to large amplitude, for millions of years. Most of the tidal heating of Enceladus occurs during this stage, and the observed luminosity is a relic from the last episode of resonant libration.

          The properties of supermassive stars in galaxy merger driven direct collapse I: models without rotation

 - **Abstract**
 The formation of the most massive quasars observed at high redshifts requires extreme accretion rates ($>1$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$). Inflows of $10-1000$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ are found in hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy mergers, leading to the formation of supermassive discs (SMDs) with high metallicities ($>$ Z$_\odot$). Supermassive stars (SMSs) born in these SMDs could be the progenitors of the most extreme quasars. Here, we study the properties of non-rotating SMSs forming in high metallicity SMDs. Using the stellar evolution code GENEC, we compute numerically the hydrostatic structures of non-rotating SMSs with metallicities $Z=1-10$ Z$_\odot$ by following their evolution under constant accretion at rates $10-1000$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. We determine the final mass of the SMSs, set by the general-relativistic (GR) instability, by applying the relativistic equation of adiabatic pulsations to the hydrostatic structures. We find that non-rotating SMSs with metallicities $Z=1-10$ Z$_\odot$ accreting at rates $10-1000$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ evolve as red supergiant protostars until their final collapse. All the models reach the GR instability during H-burning. The final mass is $\sim10^6$ M$_\odot$, nearly independently of the metallicity and the accretion rate.

          Enceladus's Tidal Heating

 - **Abstract**
 Saturn raises a time-dependent tide on its small moon Enceladus, due to the eccentricity of the orbit. As shown in a companion paper (Goldreich et al.), the resulting tidal heating drives Enceladus into a limit cycle, in which its eccentricity and shell thickness vary in tandem, on a timescale of ~ 10 Myr. The limit cycle explains a variety of observed phenomena on Enceladus, including its large luminosity and cracked ice shell. Here we derive the tidal heating rate needed for that study, starting from a simple first-principles derivation of Enceladus's tidal response. Enceladus is comprised of three layers: a rocky core, an outer ice shell, and an ocean sandwiched in between. Tides force the shell to librate and distort, which generates heat. We calculate the libration amplitude and tidal heating rate by minimizing the sum of elastic and gravitational energies. The final expressions are analytic, and account for the finite hardness of the shell, and for resonant libration. Although we specialize to Enceladus, our approach may be extended to other bodies that have a similar three layer structure, such as Europa and Titan.

          The landscape of binary core-collapse supernova progenitors and the late emergence of Wolf-Rayet winds

 - **Abstract**
 The majority of core-collapse supernova (CCSN) progenitors are massive stars in multiple systems, and their evolution and final fate are affected by interactions with their companions. These interactions can explain the presence of circumstellar material in many CCSNe, and the inferred low mass in stripped-envelope supernova progenitors. Through binary interactions, stars can gain mass, lose mass, or merge, impacting their final properties. Specific sub-types of binary interaction products have been investigated but few detailed full population models exist. Using {thousands of} detailed simulations with updated prescriptions for binary interactions and winds at Milky Way and Magellanic Clouds metallicities, we follow the evolution of single massive stars, primaries in interacting binaries and coalescence products following common envelope evolution. We also follow the evolution of the surviving secondary star, with a compact companion formed from the evolutionary end of the primary star or alone if the system was disrupted in the first supernova. The endpoints of our simulations map the rich landscape of CCSN progenitors, and provide detailed mass-loss history and progenitor structures. We identify an important evolutionary phase for stripped-envelope supernova progenitors, in which the wind mass-loss rate of stars stripped by binary interaction rapidly increases in their final evolutionary stages, after core helium burning. These strong winds would give rise to a Wolf-Rayet (WR) spectral appearance, though only for a few millennia, in contrast to hundreds of millennia for their more massive WR counterparts. Such lightweight WR stars in binaries can account for observed properties of type Ib/c supernovae.

 - **Abstract**
 The red hypergiant VY CMa is remarkable for its very visible record of high mass loss events observed over the range of wavelengths from the optical and infrared to the submillimeter region with ALMA. The SW Clump or SW knots are unique in the ejecta of VY CMa. Except for the central star, they are the brightest sources of dusty infrared emission in its complex ejecta. In this paper we combine the proper motions from the HST images, and infrared fluxes from 2 to 12 microns with the 12CO images from ALMA to determine their ages and mass estimates. The SW knots were ejected more than 200 years ago with an active period lasting about 30 years, and with a total mass in the Clump more than 0.02 Solar masses.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational waves from individually resolved compact object mergers can be used as standard sirens, offering a novel self-calibrating precision probe of cosmology. While the standard siren method has been well-explored, the gravitational-wave background arising from unresolved mergers offers a novel alternative to probing cosmology. We demonstrate that the combination of resolved binary black hole mergers with the unresolved signals composing the stochastic gravitational-wave background can be used to measure cosmological parameters, including the Hubble constant, $H_0$. We apply this ``stochastic siren'' method to existing gravitational-wave data and find that including the current non-detection of the background increases the accuracy at which $H_0$ can be measured, relative to using resolved mergers alone. We also provide projections for upcoming detectors to highlight their ability to probe cosmology with the background. With the anticipated detection of the astrophysical gravitational-wave background, the stochastic siren approach can be expected to improve future standard siren cosmological measurements.

          SPYGLASS. VI. Feedback-Driven Star Formation in the Circinus Complex

 - **Abstract**
 Young associations provide a record that traces the star formation process, and the youngest populations connect progenitor gas dynamics to the resulting stellar populations. We therefore conduct the first comprehensive overview of the Circinus Complex, an under-studied and massive ($\sim$1500 M$_{\odot}$) region consisting of approximately 3100 recently formed stars alongside the Circinus Molecular Cloud (CMC). We find a clear age pattern in the contiguous central region (CirCe), where younger stars are found further from the massive central cluster, and where the velocities are consistent with uniform expansion. By comparing this structure to an analogous STARFORGE simulation, we find that the age structure and dynamics of the association are consistent with star formation in two stages: the global collapse of the parent cloud that builds the $500 M_{\odot}$ central cluster ASCC 79, followed by triggered star formation in a shell swept up after the first massive stars form. We also find that filaments with a range of distances from the central cluster can naturally produce multi-generational age sequences due to differences in feedback strength and exposure. Outlying populations show velocities consistent with formation independent from the CirCe region, but with similar enough velocities that they may be difficult to distinguish from one another later in their expansion. We therefore provide a new alternative view of sequential star formation that relies on feedback from a single central cluster rather than the multiple sequential generations that are traditionally invoked, while also providing insight into the star formation history of older populations.

          Formation of Be star decretion discs through boundary layer effects

 - **Abstract**
 Be stars are rapidly rotating, with angular frequency around $0.7-0.8$ of their Keplerian break up frequency, as a result of significant accretion during the earlier stellar evolution of a companion star. Material from the equator of the Be star is ejected and forms a decretion disc, although the mechanism for the disc formation has remained elusive. We find one-dimensional steady state decretion disc solutions that smoothly transition from a rapidly rotating star that is in hydrostatic balance. Boundary layer effects in a geometrically thick disc which connects to a rotationally flattened star enable the formation of a decretion disc at stellar spin rates below the break up rate. For a disc with an aspect ratio $H/R\approx 0.1$ at the inner edge, the torque from the disc on the star slows the stellar spin to the observed range and mass ejection continues at a rate consistent with observed decretion rates. The critical rotation rate, to which the star slows down to, decreases as the disc aspect ratio increases. More generally, steady state accretion and decretion disc solutions can be found for all stellar spin rates. The outcome for a particular system depends upon the balance between the decretion rate and any external infall accretion rate.

          The Simultaneous Operation of a Controllable Segmented Primary Mirror and Single Conjugate Adaptive Optics System part 1 -- Design Concept and Sensitivity Analysis

 - **Abstract**
 The maintenance of primary mirror segment co-phasing is a critical aspect to the operation of segmented telescopes. However, speckle-based measurements of the phasing of the Keck primary have estimated semi-static surface aberrations of approximately 65 nm rms, which were not sensed by the current phasing control system. We propose directly sensing and controlling the primary via the adaptive optics (AO) system, as a Controllable Segmented Primary (CSP), to actively correct its phasing. We develop a methodology for separating the independent controllable signal of the CSP from the rest of the AO system and show estimations of the achievable measurement precision from models of the Keck-II AO system.

          The Simultaneous Operation of a Controllable Segmented Primary Mirror and Single Conjugate Adaptive Optics System part 2 -- Simulated Operation

 - **Abstract**
 There are scientific and technological needs to improve the co-phasing of the primary mirrors of segmented telescopes. We have developed a methodology for using the wavefront sensor of an adaptive optics (AO) system to disentangle the phase of a Controllable Segmented Primary mirror (CSP) from the residual phase aberrations to be corrected by the rest of the AO system. We show simulations of the Keck-II AO system where we simultaneously control the CSP surface and a single-conjugate AO system using a pyramid wavefront sensor in a low-bandwidth closed loop, resulting in significantly decreased aberrations on the primary and improvements in the performance of the AO system. Analysis of on-sky telemetry data from the Keck-II AO system validates these simulations and shows that accurate measurements of the primary phase can be made in the presence of real atmospheric turbulence. Ultimately, this work suggests that it is feasible to simultaneously monitor and control the CSP with an AO wavefront sensor while in closed-loop operation and that doing so may significantly improve the performance of the AO system.

 - **Abstract**
 Modern X-ray and gamma-ray observatories time-tag detected photons. The distribution of intervals between successive photons may reveal variations of the flux on time scales too short for direct flux measurement of the mean count rate, provided a sufficient number of photons have been detected cumulatively. We demonstrate this with synthetic data and apply to RXTE data from Cyg X-1.

          Convective Overstability in Radially Global Protoplanetary Disks. II. Impact on planetesimal formation

 - **Abstract**
 The Convective Overstability (COS) is a hydrodynamic instability occurring in protoplanetary disk (PPD) regions with an adverse radial entropy gradient. It is a potential driver of turbulence and may influence planetesimal formation. In this second paper of our series, we study the effects of the COS on dust dynamics in radially global PPD simulations, focusing on the mid-plane region, where vertical gravity on the dust is included. Axisymmetric 2D simulations show susceptibility to both the COS and the Vertically Shearing Streaming Instability. For a Stokes number tau = 0.1, strong dust clumping occurs only for highly super-solar initial metallicities Z greater than 0.05. In 3D non-axisymmetric simulations, the COS generates large-scale, long-lived vortices that have the potential to efficiently concentrate dust, with dust accumulation strengthening as tau increases. For tau = 0.01, no strong clumping occurs even at metallicities as high as Z = 0.1, and vortices remain robust and long-lived. At tau = 0.04, strong dust clumping is observed for solar metallicity (Z = 0.01) and higher. For tau = 0.1, clumping occurs even at strongly sub-solar metallicities (Z greater or equal to 0.004), peaking at Z approximately 0.01 to 0.03, including solar values. Under these conditions, vortices weaken significantly and become more spatially extended. At higher metallicities (Z greater or equal to 0.04) with tau = 0.1, large-scale vortex formation is suppressed, leading to nearly axisymmetric dust rings, which can still undergo clumping via the classical Streaming Instability.

 - **Abstract**
 In 1962, Yoshihide Kozai reported his findings on the secular dynamics of asteroids moving in orbits with high inclination and eccentricity. In contrast to the classic understanding of the stability of planetary motion in the solar system, Kozai showed that asteroids can significantly change their orbital shape over a long timescale in an oscillatory manner between nearly circular orbits and highly elliptic orbits. An anti-correlated variation between orbital inclination and eccentricity characterizes this oscillation. The importance of Kozai's work in understanding the dynamical evolution of various systems was recognized decades later, including the fields of irregular satellites of planets, Oort Cloud, extrasolar planets, binary star systems, type Ia supernovae, planet climate, merging black hole systems, and so on.

          Detection of the optical counterpart of the transient ULX NGC300 ULX-1: a nascent black hole - neutron star binary?

 - **Abstract**
 The end points of massive star evolution are poorly known, especially those in interacting binary systems containing compact objects, such as neutron stars or black holes. Such systems are bright in X-rays, and the most luminous among them are called ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs). In this paper, we address the enigmatic NGC 300 ULX-1. It's X-ray activity started in 2010 with the supernova impostor-like event SN 2010da. In the following few years the ULX was powered by persistent super-Eddington accretion but then it dimmed in X-rays. We present the most recent X-ray and optical observations. The Chandra and Swift telescopes confirm that SN 2010da/NGC 300 ULX-1 is not accreting at super-Eddington level anymore. We attribute this switch in accretion regime to the donor star variability and its fast evolution. In order to gain a better understanding of the donor star's nature, we consider its optical light curve on a decade-long time scale and show that the optical counterpart of SN 2010da/NGC 300 ULX-1 dimmed significantly over recent years. The most recent detection in optical by the Gemini telescope reveals that the source is now > 2.5 mag fainter in the r' band compared to the epoch when it was spectroscopically classified as a red supergiant. We discuss the nature of the abrupt changes in the donor star properties, and consider among other possibilities the silent collapse of the donor star into a black hole.

 - **Abstract**
 Type-I X-ray bursts are thermonuclear explosions caused by the unstable burning of accreted material on the surface of neutron stars. We report the detection of seven type-I X-ray bursts from the ultracompact X-ray binary M15 X-2 observed by the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) during its 2022 outburst. We found all the bursts occurred in the soft state and exhibited similar light curve profiles, with no cases of photospheric radius expansion. Time-resolved spectroscopy showed clear deviations from the blackbody model during the first ten seconds of all the bursts. The fits were improved by using the enhanced persistent emission method, which we interpret as evidence of burst-disk interaction. We compared the performance of these models against a neutron star atmosphere model and found it made no significant improvements. After analyzing the burst rise times and fuel composition, we propose that these bursts were powered by the burning of pure helium, confirming the ultracompact nature of the source.

          Supernova remnant candidates identified using MWA Galactic Plane Monitoring over 285deg < l < 70deg and |b| < 16deg

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of Galactic supernova remnants (SNRs) are crucial to understanding supernova explosion mechanisms and their impact on our Galaxy's evolution. SNRs are usually identified by searching for extended, circular structures in all-sky surveys. However, the resolution and sensitivity of any given survey results in selection biases related to the brightness and angular scale of a subset of the total SNR population. As a result, we have only identified 1/3 of the expected number of SNRs in our Galaxy. We used data collected by the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) to perform a visual search for SNR candidates over 285deg < l < 70deg and |b| < 16deg. We then used the Widefield Infrared Survey Explorer to eliminate likely HII regions from our SNR candidate sample. By exploiting the resolution and sensitivity of MWA data, we have successfully detected 10 new candidates using our proposed method. In addition, our method has also enabled us to detect and verify 10 previously known but unconfirmed candidates. The 20 SNR candidates described in the paper will increase the known SNR population in the Galaxy by 7{\%}.

          Extension of the creep tide theory to exoplanet systems with high stellar obliquity. The dynamic tide of CoRoT-3b

 - **Abstract**
 This paper extends the creep tide theory to exoplanetary systems with significant obliquities. The extended theory allows us to obtain the stellar and planetary hydrodynamic equilibrium tides and the evolution of the rotational state of the bodies. The dynamic ellipsoidal figure of equilibrium of the body is calculated taking into account that its reaction to external forces is delayed by its viscosity. The derived equations are used to determine the motion of the tidal bulge of the planetary companion CoRoT-3b (a brown dwarf) and its host star. We show how the tides deform the figure of the companion and how its tidal bulge moves close to the substellar meridian from one hemisphere to another. The stellar lag is mostly positive and is braking the star's rotation.

 - **Abstract**
 The gas-phase abundances of deuterium (D) in the local interstellar medium (ISM) exhibit considerable regional variations. Particularly, in some regions the gas-phase D abundances are substantially lower than the primordial D abundance generated in the Big Bang, after subtracting the astration reduction caused by the Galactic chemical evolution. Deuterated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules have been suggested as a potential reservoir of the D atoms missing from the gas-phase. Recent observations from the James Webb Space Telescope's Near Infrared Spectrograph have revealed the widespread of deuterated PAHs in the Orion Bar through their aliphatic C--D emission at 4.65${\,{\rm \mu m}}$ and possibly aromatic C--D emission at 4.4${\,{\rm \mu m}}$ as well. To examine the viability of deuterated PAHs as the D reservoir, we model the infrared (IR) emission spectra of small PAH molecules containing various aromatic and aliphatic D atoms in the Orion Bar. We find that small deuterated PAHs exhibit a noticeable emission band at 4.4 or 4.65${\,{\rm \mu m}}$ even if they contain only one aromatic or aliphatic D atom. We derive ${N_{\rm D,ali}}/{N_{\rm H}}\approx3.4\%$, the deuteration degree of PAHs measured as the number of aliphatic D atoms (relative to H), from the observed intensity ratios of the 4.65${\,{\rm \mu m}}$ band to the 3.3${\,{\rm \mu m}}$ aromatic C--H band. The deuteration degree for aromatically-deuterated PAHs is less certain as C--N stretch also contributes to the observed emission around 4.4${\,{\rm \mu m}}$. If we attribute it exclusively to aromatic C--D, we derive an upper limit of $\approx14\%$ on the deuteration degree, which is capable of accounting for an appreciable fraction of the missing D budget.

 - **Abstract**
 We present brutus, an open source Python package for quickly deriving stellar properties, distances, and reddenings to stars based on grids of stellar models constrained by photometric and astrometric data. We outline the statistical framework for deriving these quantities, its implementation, and various Galactic priors over the 3-D distribution of stars, stellar properties, and dust extinction (including $R_V$ variation). We establish a procedure to empirically calibrate MIST v1.2 isochrones by using open clusters to derive corrections to the effective temperatures and radii of the isochrones, which reduces systematic errors on the lower main sequence. We also describe and apply a method to estimate photometric offsets between stellar models and observed data using nearby, low-reddening field stars. We perform a series of tests on mock and real data to examine parameter recovery with MIST under different modeling assumptions, illustrating that brutus is able to recover distances and other stellar properties using optical to near-infrared photometry and astrometry. The code is publicly available at this https URL.

 - **Abstract**
 Quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) are very common in black hole accretion systems that are seen from the modulations in luminosity. Many supermassive black hole sources (e.g., RE J1034+396, 1H~0707-495, MCG-6-30-15, 1ES~1927+654, Sgr~A$^*$) have been observed to exhibit QPO-like variability in the range of mHz in different energy bands (e.g., radio, NIR, X-ray). Due to the shorter infalling time, low-angular momentum accretion flows can have resonance close to the black hole, which will raise variability centiHz (cHz) or beyond QPOs for supermassive black holes. In this study, we for the first time show that such resonance conditions can be achieved in simulations of low angular momentum accretion flows onto a black hole. The QPOs could have values beyond $\nu_{\rm QPO}\gtrsim0.1-1\times 10^7M_\odot/M_{\rm BH}\,$cHz and the harmonics have a ratio of 2:1. Hunting down of these cHz QPOs will provide a smoking gun signature for the presence of low-angular momentum accretion flows around black holes (e.g., Sgr~A$^*$, 1ES~1927+654).

 - **Abstract**
 Comet 7P/Pons-Winnecke was observed from the Calar Alto Observatory (Spain) for four months during the 2021 inbound apparition. Broad-band visible images were taken between 1.71 and 1.25 AU pre-perihelion, while long-slit spectrophotometric data were taken at $\sim$ 1.25 AU pre-perihelion. This dataset has been complemented with three $r$-Sloan images observed from Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) to model the physical properties and loss rate of the dust with a forward Monte Carlo dust tail code. The model fits the observed isophotes well for most observations. The peak dust production rate was measured at 83 kg s$^{-1}$, 15 days after perihelion. The particle terminal speed ranges from 3 m s$^{-1}$ for 0.1 m particles to 23 m s$^{-1}$ for 5 $\mu$m particles. Regarding the gas production from spectra, CN and C$_2$ show asymmetric emission between the sunward and antisunward directions beyond the data uncertainties and error propagation, while a clear asymmetry for C$_3$ cannot be definitively claimed. Average production rates for CN, C$_2$, and C$_3$ near 2021 perihelion are 1.15 $\times 10^{24}$, 2.32$\times 10^{24}$, and 1.69$\times 10^{23}$ s$^{-1}$, respectively. The dust-to-gas mass ratio value is estimated to be around 2, suggesting a dust-rich composition. Based on the gas composition and the $Af\rho$ value, we classify 7P/Pons-Winnecke as having a typical composition for Jupiter Family comets, with some C$_3$ depletion. Given the limited previous knowledge, our work contributes to expanding the understanding of the activity and characteristics of 7P/Pons-Winnecke.

 - **Abstract**
 The study of exoplanets has led to many surprises, one of which is the discovery of planets larger than Earth yet smaller than Neptune, super Earths and gas dwarfs. No such planet is a member of the Solar System, yet they appear to be abundant in the local neighbourhood. Their internal structure is not well understood. Super Earths presumably are rocky planets with a thin secondary atmosphere, whereas gas dwarfs have a substantial (by volume) primary H/He atmosphere. However, conflicting evidence exists regarding the presence of a third class of planets, so-called water worlds, which are hypothesised to contain a significant mass fraction of water in condensed or steam form. This study examines the evidence for water worlds and presents a sample of 60 precisely measured small exoplanets (less than 4 Earth radii) orbiting M dwarf stars. We combine observational data and unsupervised machine-learning techniques to classify these planets based on their mass, radius, and density. We individually model the interior of each planet using the ExoMDN code and classify them into populations based on these models. Our findings indicate that the sample divides into two distinct planet populations, with no clear evidence supporting the existence of water worlds in the current dataset.

 - **Abstract**
 Galactic chemical abundances provide crucial insights into fundamental galactic parameters, such as the high-mass slope of the initial mass function (IMF) and the normalization of Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) rates. Constraining these parameters is essential for advancing our understanding of stellar feedback, metal enrichment, and galaxy formation processes. However, traditional Bayesian inference techniques, such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), are computationally prohibitive when applied to large datasets of modern stellar surveys. We leverage simulation-based-inference (SBI) as a scalable, robust, and efficient method for constraining galactic parameters from stellar chemical abundances and demonstrate its the advantages over HMC in terms of speed, scalability, and robustness against model misspecifications. We combine a Galactic Chemical Evolution (GCE) model, CHEMPY, with a neural network emulator and a Neural Posterior Estimator (NPE) to train our SBI pipeline. Mock datasets are generated using CHEMPY, including scenarios with mismatched nucleosynthetic yields, with additional tests conducted on data from a simulated Milky Way-like galaxy. SBI results are benchmarked against HMC-based inference, focusing on computational performance, accuracy, and resilience to systematic discrepancies. SBI achieves a $\sim75,600\times$ speed-up compared to HMC, reducing inference runtime from $\gtrsim42$ hours to mere seconds for thousands of stars. Inference on $1,000$ stars yields precise estimates for the IMF slope ($\alpha_{\rm IMF} = -2.298 \pm 0.002$) and SN Ia normalization ($\log_{10}(N_{\rm Ia}) = -2.885 \pm 0.003$), deviating less than 0.05% from the ground truth. SBI also demonstrates similar robustness to model misspecification than HMC, recovering accurate parameters even with alternate yield tables or data from a cosmological simulation. (shortened...)

 - **Abstract**
 The Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI) is a Compton telescope designed to survey the 0.2-5 MeV sky, consisting of a compact array of cross-strip germanium detectors. As part of its development, in 2016 COSI had a successful 46 day flight on board NASA's Super Pressure Balloon platform. This was a precursor to the COSI Small Explorer (COSI-SMEX) satellite mission that will launch in 2027 into a equatorial low Earth (530 km) orbit. The observation of MeV gamma-rays is dominated by background radiation, especially due to the activation of the detector materials induced by cosmic-ray interactions. Thus, background simulation and identification are crucial for the data analysis. Because the COSI-SMEX detectors will be similar to the ones used for the balloon flight, the balloon measurements provide an important tool for testing and cross-checking our background simulations for the upcoming space mission. In this work we perform Monte Carlo simulations of the background emission from the 2016 COSI balloon flight. Including a phenomenological shape correction, we obtain an agreement with the data at the 10-20% level for energies between 0.1-1.6 MeV, and we successfully reproduce most of the activation lines induced by cosmic ray interactions.

 - **Abstract**
 The abundance ratio of $^{14}$N$/^{15}$N is, in principle, a powerful tool for tracing stellar nucleosynthesis. This work aims to measure and analyze ($^{14}$N/$^{15}$N)$\times$($^{13}$C/$^{12}$C) and $^{14}$N$/^{15}$N abundance ratios in massive star-forming regions across a range of galactocentric distances to provide constraints on galactic chemical evolution (GCE) models. We present H$^{13}$CN and HC$^{15}$N J=2-1 results toward 51massive star-forming regions obtained with the Institut de Radioastronomie Millimétrique (IRAM) 30 meter telescope.\ We used these results to derive ($^{14}$N/$^{15}$N)$\times$($^{13}$C/$^{12}$C) abundance ratios as well as $^{14}$N$/^{15}$N ratios using the double isotope method. We find an overall decreasing trend in the ($^{14}$N/$^{15}$N)$\times$($^{13}$C/$^{12}$C) abundance ratio and an increasing trend in the $^{14}$N$/^{15}$N ratio with increasing galactocentric distance ($D_{\rm GC}$), which provides a good constraint for the GCE model based on high signal to noise ratio measurements. While the predicted ($^{14}$N/$^{15}$N)$\times$($^{13}$C/$^{12}$C) ratios between 6 and 12 kpc determined using current GCE models are consistent with our observational results, the ratios from models for $D_{\rm GC}$ less than 6 kpc are significantly higher than the observational results, which indicates GCE models for $^{14}$N/$^{15}$N and/or $^{13}$C/$^{12}$C ratios need to be updated for at least this range.

          Towards a robust R2D2 paradigm for radio-interferometric imaging: revisiting DNN training and architecture

 - **Abstract**
 The R2D2 Deep Neural Network (DNN) series was recently introduced for image formation in radio interferometry. It can be understood as a learned version of CLEAN, whose minor cycles are substituted with DNNs. We revisit R2D2 on the grounds of series convergence, training methodology, and DNN architecture, improving its robustness in terms of generalisability beyond training conditions, capability to deliver high data fidelity, and epistemic uncertainty. Firstly, while still focusing on telescope-specific training, we enhance the learning process by randomising Fourier sampling integration times, incorporating multi-scan multi-noise configurations, and varying imaging settings, including pixel resolution and visibility-weighting scheme. Secondly, we introduce a convergence criterion whereby the reconstruction process stops when the data residual is compatible with noise, rather than simply using all available DNNs. This not only increases the reconstruction efficiency by reducing its computational cost, but also refines training by pruning out the data/image pairs for which optimal data fidelity is reached before training the next DNN. Thirdly, we substitute R2D2's early U-Net DNN with a novel architecture (U-WDSR) combining U-Net and WDSR, which leverages wide activation, dense connections, weight normalisation, and low-rank convolution to improve feature reuse and reconstruction precision. As previously, R2D2 was trained for monochromatic intensity imaging with the Very Large Array (VLA) at fixed $512 \times 512$ image size. Simulations on a wide range of inverse problems and a case study on real data reveal that the new R2D2 model consistently outperforms its earlier version in image reconstruction quality, data fidelity, and epistemic uncertainty.

 - **Abstract**
 The Solar Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (SUIT) is one of the seven payloads on board Aditya-L1 mission of the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO). SUIT provides full and partial disk images of the Sun in the 200-400 nm wavelength range. This would help us probe the solar atmosphere at different heights and understand the mass and energy transfer process between its layers. For the first time, SUIT will also help us measure spatially resolved solar spectral irradiance at this wavelength band, which is significant for studying the sun-climate relationships. To perform these studies, it is necessary to photometrically calibrate the payload and validate the spectral coverage of the various bandpasses. We perform the photometric calibration and spectral validation of 8 bandpasses using light of known intensity and spectral coverage. For photometric calibration, the telescope throughput is modeled using sun-as-a-star spectrum from SOLSTICE and SOLSPEC. The modeled throughput is compared with in-lab measurements taken with light of known intensity. The ratio of measured photoelectrons gathered with the modeled prediction agree within 20%. For spectral validation, readings are taken across the transmission spectrum of each filter, keeping adjacent readings independent of each other. The relative intensity measured at each wavelength is seen to trace the modeled telescope bandpass for that filter. These tests could not be performed for filters with bandpasses operating below 250 nm (NB01, BB01 and BB02), primarily due to heavy atmospheric attenuation in these wavelengths leading to decreased SNR of the data. The experimentally measured results agree closely with the modeled values, validating SUIT's optical performance and presenting the reliability of the developed throughput model.

 - **Abstract**
 The distribution of dark matter at the galactic center, crucial for indirect searches, remains uncertain. In particular, in the vicinity of the massive black hole in the center of a galaxy where indirect signals may be stronger, the density of a dark matter spike may undergo redistribution. Here we calculate the density surrounding Schwarzschild black holes that originate from diverse initial dark halos and estimate the velocity distribution of dark matter particles. By employing a series of Hernquist and power-law initial dark halos, we obtain a fitting formula between dark matter spikes and black hole masses. The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution is utilized to approximate the velocity distribution of dark matter particles. As an application, taking into account dark matter self-annihilation, we assess the relic densities of dark matter spikes around black holes. We find that the relic spikes for s-wave annihilation are higher than p-wave annihilation, and the relic densities obtained for p-wave annihilation depend on the velocity distribution, varying significantly with distance. The findings shall further provide useful insights for multi-messenger dark matter detections in the future.

 - **Abstract**
 Various theories of dark matter predict distinctive astrophysical signatures in gravitational-wave sources that could be observed by ground- and space-based laser interferometers. Different candidates-including axions, dark photons, macroscopic dark matter, WIMPs, and dark-matter spikes-may appear in interferometer data via their coupling to gravity or the Standard Model, altering the measured gravitational-wave strain in distinct ways. Despite their differences, these candidates share two key features: (1) they can be probed through their effects on gravitational waves from inspiraling compact objects, isolated black holes, and neutron stars, or via direct interactions with detectors, and (2) their signatures likely persist far longer than the seconds-long mergers detected today, necessitating new data analysis methods beyond matched filtering. This review outlines these dark matter candidates, their observational signatures, and approaches for their detection.

          Trust, but verify: Reducing artificial light emissions and monitoring compliance

 - **Abstract**
 In order to reduce light pollution we have to reduce the overall amount of artificial light emissions. This is a consequence of the basic rules governing the propagation of light in the terrestrial environment. In this work I revisit the physical laws causing that (i) "all" artificial light emitted outdoors is lost or pollutant, (ii) the negative effects of light pollution depend monotonically on the local concentration of photons of anthropogenic origin, and (iii) this concentration depends linearly on the total artificial light emissions, weighted by the light pollution propagation functions. Setting total emission limits becomes necessary in order to ensure that the negative effects of light pollution do not surpass red-lines of unacceptable degradation of the natural night. Once these red-lines are socially agreed, monitoring compliance becomes a relevant task. Several complementary methods for assessing total light emissions are being used nowadays, including public inventories of installed lights, direct radiance measurements from ground or low Earth orbit satellites, and scattered radiance measurements using ground based detectors (night sky brightness monitoring). While updated administrative inventories could in principle be trusted, independent verification is a must. The required measurements pose in turn significant challenges: we discuss here how the variability of the terrestrial atmosphere sets a lower limit on the minimum emission changes that can be reliably detected by measurements, and propose some ways to improve this performance.

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce and apply a methodology based on dynamic time warping (DTW) to compare the whole set of gamma-ray light curves reported in the Third Fermi-Large Area Telescope Pulsar Catalogue. Our method allows us to quantitatively measure the degree of global similarity between two light curves beyond comparing indicators such as how many peaks there are, which is their separation, width, and height. Once the morphology of the light curve is showcased via background subtraction, min-max scaler normalization, and rotations are considered to take into account that phase 0 is arbitrary, the level of detail with which light curves of different pulsars appear is revealed. In many cases their similarity is striking and occurs disregarding any other timing, physical, or spectral property. In particular, some MSPs and young pulsars share detailed light curve morphology.

          An SS433 flare caught by TESS. Fast rise times and evidence for a 13 hours quasi-period

 - **Abstract**
 SS433 is an exotic Galactic microquasar in which there is a supercritical inflow of matter into a compact object of likely black hole nature. Here I report on an SS433 flare that occurred during a TESS observation of Sector 54 in June of 2022. The flare lasted for about 10 days and culminated in a flux increase by a factor of three relative to quiescence. The unprecedented continuous photometric coverage of the flare afforded by TESS shows that the flux can rise and fall by up to a factor of two within 4 to 7 hours. Furthermore, there is evidence that the flare peaks occur with a quasi-period $P_{\mathrm{QPO}} = 13.3$ hours. The flare can be most naturally explained by accretion rate ($\dot{M}$) variations due to oscillations in the donor star mass loss rate. We estimate $\dot{M}$ variations up to a factor of two with an increase in the photospheric radius of the accretion disk by about the same factor, implying that a transient ``common envelope'' enshrouds the binary system during the flares. If the flares are due to radial pulsations in the donor star envelope then their quasi-period $P_{\mathrm{QPO}}$ could imply a mean density $\left < \rho \right > \sim 18 \text{ kg} \text{ m}^{-3}$ for the donor star, compared to $\left < \rho_{\mathrm{RL}} \right > = 0.7-1 \text{ kg} \text{ m}^{-3}$ for a synchronized Roche-lobe filling donor star. Another SS433 lightcurve from a Sector 80 TESS observation in 2024 hints that there may be an outflow from behind the the donor star.

          Forming Mercury by a grazing giant collision involving similar mass bodies

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of Mercury still remains poorly understood compared to the other rocky planets of the Solar System. One of the most relevant constraints that any formation model has to fulfill refers to its internal structure, with a predominant iron core covered by a thin silicate layer. This led to the idea that it could be the product of a mantle stripping caused by a giant impact. Previous studies in this line focused on binary collisions involving bodies of very different masses. However, such collisions are actually rare in N-body simulations of terrestrial planet formation, whereas collisions involving similar mass bodies appear to be more frequent. Here, we perform smooth particle hydrodynamics simulations to investigate the conditions under which collisions of similar mass bodies are able to form a Mercury-like planet. Our results show that such collisions can fulfill the necessary constraints in terms of mass (0.055 $M_\oplus$) and composition (30/70 silicate-to-iron mass ratio) within less than 5%, as long as the impact angles and velocities are properly adjusted according to well established scaling laws.

 We describe the basic instrument detrending software for the NIRWALS spectrograph on the SALT telescope. Its basic purpose is to process multiple non-destructive reads of increasing exposure time into a final image reflecting the observed source intensity as expressed in counts (or electrons) per second, including its uncertainty. The output products of this pipeline can then be used to as input for follow-up data processing to apply wavelength solutions and extract fluxes for individual fibers. All pipeline code is implemented in python and can be obtained via common portals such as PyPI and GitHub. Additional information on how to use the code is available online at this http URL

 - **Abstract**
 We perform a model-independent reconstruction of the angular diameter distance ($D_{A}$) using the Multi-Task Gaussian Process (MTGP) framework with DESI-DR1 BAO and DES-SN5YR datasets. We calibrate the comoving sound horizon at the baryon drag epoch $r_d$ to the Planck best-fit value, ensuring consistency with early-universe physics. With the reconstructed $D_A$ at two key redshifts, $z\sim 1.63$ (where $D_{A}^{\prime} =0$) and at $z\sim 0.512$ (where $D_{A}^{\prime} = D_{A}$), we derive the expansion rate of the Universe $H(z)$ at these redshifts. Our findings reveal that at $z\sim 1.63$, the $H(z)$ is fully consistent with the Planck-2018 $\Lambda$CDM prediction, confirming no new physics at that redshift. However, at $z \sim 0.512$, the derived $H(z)$ shows a more than $5\sigma$ discrepancy with the Planck-2018 $\Lambda$CDM prediction, suggesting a possible breakdown of the $\Lambda$CDM model as constrained by Planck-2018 at this lower redshift. This emerging $\sim 5\sigma$ tension at $z\sim 0.512$, distinct from the existing ``Hubble Tension'', may signal the first strong evidence for new physics at low redshifts.

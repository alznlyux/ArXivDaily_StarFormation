- **Abstract**
 Over the past few years, Astrophysics has experienced an unprecedented increase in research output, as is evident from the year-over-year increase in the number of research papers put onto the arXiv. As a result, keeping up with progress happening outside our respective sub-fields can be exhausting. While it is impossible to be informed on every single aspect of every sub-field, this paper aims to be the next best thing. We present a summary of statistics for every paper uploaded onto the Astrophysics arXiv over the past year - 2025. We analyse a host of metadata ranging from simple metrics like the number of pages and the most used keywords, as well as deeper, more interesting statistics like the distribution of journals to which papers are submitted, the most used telescopes, the most studied astrophysical objects including GW, GRB, FRB events, exoplanets and much more. We also indexed the authors' affiliations to put into context the global distribution of research and collaboration. Combining this data with the citation information of each paper allows us to understand how influential different papers have been on the progress of the field this year. Overall, these statistics highlight the general current state of the field, the hot topics people are working on and the different research communities across the globe and how they function. We also delve into the costs involved in publications and what it means for the community. We hope that this is helpful for both students and professionals alike to adapt their current trajectories to better benefit the field.

- **Abstract**
 The catalog of Gravitational Wave (GW) events is rapidly growing, providing key insights into the evolution of massive binaries and compact object formation. However, a key challenge is to explain the origin of exceptional events such as GW190814, among the most asymmetric mass-ratio mergers to date ($q\approx 0.1$). We show that it shares an evolutionary pathway with the most unequal mass Galactic High Mass X-ray Binary (HMXB) 4U 1700-37/ HD 153919. We demonstrate this unique connection by utilizing a rich set of existing observational constraints for the HMXB and compute detailed binary evolution models to explain its formation history. We find that conservative mass transfer, along with a directed natal kick are essential to explain its current state. We show that this system is unlikely to form a GW source due to a failed Common Envelope (CE) phase in the future, in agreement with previous work. With additional models, we show that a similar pathway naturally forms GW190814-like events, provided the first phase of mass transfer remains conservative, and the first-born (lower mass) compact object receives a large natal kick ($\gtrsim 100\,\mathrm{km/s}$) for the subsequent CE phase to be successful and form a asymmetric mass-ratio GW source. Anchored by the number of analogous Galactic HMXBs, we estimate rates for such GW events, which broadly agree with their observed rate. Our work demonstrates a unified formation pathway for highly asymmetric mass-ratio HMXBs and GW events. Moreover, it highlights the critical role of finding and characterizing local analogs in different evolutionary phases, and using them as a bridge to understand the origin of GW sources, especially the outliers like GW190814.

- **Abstract**
 3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object to pass through our Solar System. NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) made dedicated observations of 3I/ATLAS between 15 -- 22 January 2026 (Sector 1751), capturing high-cadence observations at 200s and 20s cadence. We present two High Level Science Products (HLSPs): (1) comet-centered image time series, corrected for background scattered light and stars; and (2) aperture light curves extracted from the corrected images. We created these data products using the official TESS products and they are publicly available at the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST). TESS's high-precision, near-continuous photometry will provide unique insights into the comet's activity following its closest approach to the Sun. The TESS Science Support Center (TSSC) has created these data products to facilitate scientific analyses by the TESS and Solar System communities.

          Cosmological Simulation with Population III Stellar Feedback and Metal Enrichment I: Model Description And Convergence Test

- **Abstract**
 We present a new Pop III + Pop II subgrid framework implemented in the moving-mesh code {\sc arepo}, designed to study the impact of Pop III feedback on star formation in the early universe. The framework combines primordial non-equilibrium chemistry, metal-line cooling, IMF-sampled stellar evolution with SN feedback, and approximate Lyman-Werner (LW) and ionizing radiation transport. We run a suite of $1c{\rm Mpc}/h$ box simulations with different initial conditions and resolutions from $z=127$ to $z=10$. The highest gas mass and spatial resolution in the fiducial simulation reach $\sim10\,{\rm M_{\odot}}$ and $\sim4\,{\rm pc}$, respectively. The model successfully reproduces the UV-inferred Pop II star formation rate density (SFRD) from recent JWST observations across all initial conditions, with only minor variation driven by local halo interactions and LW irradiation. We find that the volume filling factor of metal-enriched gas converges to $\sim1\%$ at $z=10$. Convergence is achieved once subhalos with $M_{\rm subhalo}\gtrsim 10^{6.5}\,{\rm M_{\odot}}$ are resolved, and the total stellar mass at $z=10$ is largely insensitive to initial conditions or the resolution considered in this work. A fiducial simulation requires $\sim 10^4$ CPU hours, making the framework computationally tractable for larger box simulations and enabling future large parameter studies of stellar physics or environment effects such as Pop III IMF variations, X-ray radiation, or the streaming velocity at high redshift.

- **Abstract**
 Ground Level Enhancement (GLE) in large solar energetic particle (SEP) events is indicative of protons accelerated to GeV energies. Almost all GLE events are associated with sustained gamma-ray emission (SGRE) from the Sun because the latter require >300 MeV protons that are readily present during GLEs. Here we report on the 2024 June 8 GLE event, which has the distinction of not being associated with an SGRE event. All the associated phenomena typical of SGRE events were present: a fast and wide CME, a major solar flare, and an intense type II radio bursts that extend from the metric to kilometric wavelength domains. There was a data gap of ~51 min, but the SGRE is expected to last for hours. We suggest the east-west asymmetry in the flow of energetic particles from the shock is likely to be the reason for the lack of SGRE emission.

- **Abstract**
 Despite observational progress in planet formation, the stage in which planetesimals grow into planets remains poorly understood. During this phase, protoplanets may develop gaseous envelopes that are warmer than the surrounding disk gas, potentially providing observable signatures through molecules otherwise depleted in cold regions. In this Letter, we report the detection of the silicon sulfide isotopologues ${\rm ^{28}SiS}\ J{=}16{-}15$ and ${\rm ^{30}SiS}\ J{=}18{-}17$ in the protoplanetary disk around PDS 66 (MP Mus) at a significance of ${\sim}5{-}6\sigma$, using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. These constitute the second and first detections of $\rm ^{28}SiS$ and $\rm ^{30}SiS$ in a protoplanetary disk, respectively. The emission appears as a compact source at $r \simeq 60$ au in the southwestern region of the disk, unresolved with a ${\sim}0.\!\!^{\prime\prime}5$ beam, and shows a velocity consistent with Keplerian rotation, suggesting a protoplanetary origin. By modeling the line fluxes, we constrain the emitting radius to ${\sim}0.5{-}4$ au and estimate an SiS mass of $10^{22}{-}10^{23}$ g, corresponding to at least ${\sim}10\%$ of the silicon contained in local dust grains. Because complete sublimation of a substantial fraction of dust grains by local processes is difficult to achieve, this result instead implies an accumulation of silicon from a larger region. We propose that a circumplanetary envelope surrounding a low-mass protoplanet, where pebble accretion and subsequent sublimation of grains may enhance gaseus silicon abundance with respect to observable dust grains around it, can account for the observed characteristics.

- **Abstract**
 Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are recognized as the primary contributors to the aromatic infrared bands (AIBs) widely observed in space. However, analyzing these AIBs remains challenging because of the immense structural diversity within the PAH family, which makes the computation of reliable reference spectra difficult. To address this, we developed an efficient graph neural network (GNN) framework that can predict PAH absorption spectra up to 10,000 times faster than traditional quantum chemical methods. We evaluated four representative GNN architectures, including graph convolutional network (GCN), graph attention network (GAT), message passing neural network (MPNN), and attentive fingerprint (AFP). The AFP model is found to deliver the best overall performance and is further trained using five different spectral distance metrics as loss functions, among which the Jensen-Shannon divergence yields the most accurate and stable results. The model performs best for PAHs containing 20-40 carbon atoms, while accuracy decreases for larger molecules, reflecting the limited availability of training data. Overall, this framework offers a fast method to generate approximate reference spectra for small- to medium-sized PAHs, supporting future AIB analysis.

- **Abstract**
 We presented the first high-precision, detailed photometric analysis of four W Ursae Majoris (W UMa)-type contact binaries, Linear 10772300, Linear 11150338, Linear 20372537 and DM Cir. In addition to ground-based multiband photometric observations, data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) were employed for the analysis of the DM Cir system. New ephemeris and linear fit to the O-C diagrams were derived using extracted times of minima and additional literature. The light curve modeling was performed using the PHysics Of Eclipsing BinariEs (PHOEBE) Python code and the BSN application, employing a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach. In each systems, the two stellar components exhibited minimal temperature differences ($\Delta T<150$ K), confirming efficient energy exchange within their common convective envelopes. Absolute parameters were estimated using the Gaia Data Release 3 (Gaia DR3) parallax and astrophysical equations. Based on effective temperatures and component masses, two systems were classified as W-subtype systems, while others belonged to the A-subtype. We computed the initial masses of the primary ($M_{1i}$) and secondary ($M_{2i}$) components for four target systems using a method based on the observational properties of overluminous secondary components. We found initial primary masses in the range 0.6-1.0$M_\odot$ and initial secondary masses in the range 0.9-1.7$M_\odot$ with mass loss $<1.0M_{\odot}$. We investigated the relative energy transfer rates ($U_{1}$ and $U_{2}$) and nuclear luminosities ($L_{10}$ and $L_{20}$) based on the physical parameters of 411 W UMa-type contact binaries, including the four systems analyzed in this study, through wide range of mass ratios. The results for all systems provided a comprehensive view of energy transfer behavior throughout different evolutionary stages of contact binaries.

          H$_2$ Ortho-Para Spin Conversion on Inhomogeneous Grain Surfaces. II. impact of the rotational energy difference between adsorbed ortho-H$_2$ and para-H$_2$ and implication to deuterium fractionation chemistry

- **Abstract**
 We investigate how the H$_2$ ortho-to-para ratio (OPR) and dueterium fractionation in star-forming regions are affected by nuclear spin conversion (NSC) on dust grains. Particular focus is placed on the rotational energy difference between ortho-H$_2$ (o-H$_2$) and para-H$_2$ (p-H$_2$) on grain surfaces. While the ground state of o-H$_2$ has a higher rotational energy than that of p-H$_2$ by 170.5 K in the gas phase, this energy difference is expected to become smaller on solid surfaces, where interactions between the surface and adsorbed H$_2$ molecules affect their rotational motion. A previous study by Furuya et al. (2019) developed a rigorous formulation of the rate for the temporal variation of the H$_2$ OPR via the NSC on grains, assuming that adsorbed o-H$_2$ has higher rotational energy than adsorbed p-H$_2$ by 170.5 K, as in the gas phase. In this work, we relax the assumption and re-evaluate the rate, varying the rotational energy difference between their ground states. The re-evaluated rate is incorporated into a gas-ice astrochemical model to study the evolution of the H$_2$ OPR and the deuterium fractionation in prestellar cores and the outer, cold regions of protostellar envelopes. The inclusion of the NSC on grains reduces the timescale of the H2 OPR evolution and thus the deuterium fractionation, at densities of >10$^4$ cm$^{-3}$ and temperatures of <14-16 K (depending on the rotational energy difference), when the ionization rate of H$_2$ is 10$^{-17}$ s$^{-1}$.

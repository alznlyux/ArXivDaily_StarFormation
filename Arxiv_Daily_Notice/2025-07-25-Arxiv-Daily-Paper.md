          From Extraterrestrial Microbes to Alien Intelligence: Rebalancing Astronomical Research Priorities

 - **Abstract**
 We examine the funding disparity in astronomical research priorities: the Habitable Worlds Observatory is planned to receive over $10 billion over the next two decades whereas extraterrestrial intelligence research receives nearly zero federal funding. This imbalance is in contrast to both scientific value and public interest, as 65% of Americans and 58.2% of surveyed astrobiologists believe extraterrestrial intelligence exists. Empirical psychological research demonstrates that humanity possesses greater resilience toward extraterrestrial contact than historically recognized. Contemporary studies reveal adaptive responses rather than mass panic, conflicting with the rationale for excluding extraterrestrial intelligence research from federal funding since 1993. The response to the recent interstellar object 3I/ATLAS exemplifies consequences of this underinvestment: despite discovery forecasts of a new interstellar object every few months for the coming decade, no funded missions exist to intercept or closely study these visitors from outside the Solar System. We propose establishing a comprehensive research program to explore both biosignatures and technosignatures on interstellar objects. This program would address profound public interest while advancing detection capabilities and enabling potentially transformative discoveries in the search for extraterrestrial life. The systematic exclusion of extraterrestrial intelligence research represents institutional bias rather than scientific limitation, requiring immediate reconsideration of funding priorities.

 - **Abstract**
 The Galactic Center Excess (GCE) remains one of the defining mysteries uncovered by the Fermi $\gamma$-ray Space Telescope. Although it may yet herald the discovery of annihilating dark matter, weighing against that conclusion are analyses showing the spatial structure of the emission appears more consistent with a population of dim point sources. Technical limitations have restricted prior analyses to studying the point-source hypothesis purely spatially. All spectral information that could help disentangle the GCE from the complex and uncertain astrophysical emission was discarded. We demonstrate that a neural network-aided simulation-based inference approach can overcome such limitations and thereby confront the point source explanation of the GCE with spatial and spectral data. The addition is profound: energy information drives the putative point sources to be significantly dimmer, indicating either the GCE is truly diffuse in nature or made of an exceptionally large number of sources. Quantitatively, for our best fit background model, the excess is essentially consistent with Poisson emission as predicted by dark matter. If the excess is instead due to point sources, our median prediction is ${\cal O}(10^5)$ sources in the Galactic Center, or more than 35,000 sources at 90% confidence, both significantly larger than the hundreds of sources preferred by earlier point-source analyses of the GCE.

          Recurrent Cometary Activity Discovered on Quasi-Hilda Jupiter Family Comet 362P/(457175) 2008 GO98

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of recurrent activity on quasi-Hilda comet (QHC) 362P/(457175) 2008 GO98. The first activity epoch was discovered during the perihelion passage of 362P. The first activity epoch was discovered during the perihelion in 2016 (Garcia-Migani & Gil-Hutton 2018), so we were motivated to observe it for recurrent cometary activity near its next perihelion passage (UT 2024 July 20). We obtained observations with the Lowell Discovery Telescope (LDT), the Astrophysical Research Consortium (ARC) telescope, and the Vatican Advanced Technology Telescope (VATT) and identified a second activity epoch when 362P had a true anomaly (v) as early as 318.1 deg. We conducted archival searches of numerous repositories and identified images obtained with Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) MegaCam, Dark Energy Camera (DECam), Pan-STARRS 1, SkyMapper, Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), and Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope (LCOGT) network data. Using these data, we identified activity from a previously unreported timespan, and we did not detect activity when 362P was away from perihelion, specifically 83 deg < v < 318 deg. Detection of activity near perihelion and absence of activity away from perihelion suggest thermally-driven activity and volatile sublimation. Our dynamical simulations suggest 362P is a QHC and it will remain in a combined Jupiter-family comet (JFC) and quasi-Hilda orbit over the next 1 kyr, though it will become increasingly chaotic nearing the end of this timeframe. Our backward simulations suggest 362P may have migrated from the orbit of a Long Period Comet (~53%) or Centaur (~32%), otherwise it remained a JFC (~15%) over the previous 100 kyr. We recommend additional telescope observations from the community as 362P continues outbound from its perihelion on UT 2024 July 20, as well as continued observations for a third activity epoch.

          EWOCS-IV: 1Ms ACIS Chandra observation of the supergiant B[e] star Wd1-9

 - **Abstract**
 Supergiant B[e] (sgB[e]) stars are exceptionally rare objects, with only a handful of confirmed examples in the Milky Way. The evolutionary pathways leading to the sgB[e] phase remain largely debated, highlighting the need for additional observations. The sgB[e] star Wd1-9, located in the massive cluster Westerlund 1 (Wd1), is enshrouded in a dusty cocoon--likely the result of past eruptive activity--leaving its true nature enigmatic. We present the most detailed X-ray study of Wd1-9 to date, using X-rays that pierce through its cocoon with the aim to uncover its nature and evolutionary state. We utilize 36 Chandra observations of Wd1 from the 'Extended Westerlund 1 and 2 Open Clusters Survey' (EWOCS), plus eight archival datasets, totalling 1.1 Ms. This dataset allows investigation of long-term variability and periodicity in Wd1-9, while X-ray colours and spectra are analysed over time to uncover patterns that shed light on its nature. Wd1-9 exhibits significant long-term X-ray variability, within which we identify a strong 14-day periodic signal. We interpret this as the orbital period, marking the first period determination for the system. The X-ray spectrum of Wd1-9 is thermal and hard (kT approximately 3.0 keV), resembling the spectra of bright Wolf-Rayet (WR) binaries in Wd1, while a strong Fe emission line at 6.7 keV indicates hot plasma from a colliding-wind X-ray binary. Wd1-9, with evidence of past mass loss, circumbinary material, a hard X-ray spectrum, and a newly detected 14-day period, displays all the hallmarks of a binary--likely a WR+OB--that recently underwent early Case B mass transfer. Its sgB[e] classification is likely phenomenological reflecting emission from the dense circumbinary material. This places Wd1-9 in a rarely observed phase, possibly revealing a newly formed WN star, bridging the gap between immediate precursors and later evolutionary stages in Wd1.

 - **Abstract**
 Star formation from metal-free gas, the hallmark of the first generation of Population III stars, was long assumed to occur in the very early Universe. We report the discovery of MPG-CR3 (Metal-Pristine Galaxy COSMOS Redshift 3; hereafter CR3), an extremely metal-poor galaxy at redshift $z= 3.193\pm0.016$. From JWST, VLT, and Subaru observations, CR3 exhibits exceptionally strong Ly$\alpha$, H$\alpha$, and He I $\lambda$10830 emission. We measure rest-frame equivalent widths of EW$_0$(Ly$\alpha$) $\approx822$ Angstrom and EW$_0$(H$\alpha$) $\approx2814$ Angstrom, among the highest seen in star-forming systems. No metal lines, e.g. [O III] $\lambda\lambda4959,5007$, C IV $\lambda\lambda1548,1550$, are currently detected at statistically significant level, placing a 2-$\sigma$ abundance upper limit of 12+log(O/H) < 6.52 ($Z < 8\times10^{-3}\ Z_\odot$). The observed Ly$\alpha$/H$\alpha$ flux ratio is $\approx13.9$, indicating negligible dust attenuation. Spectral energy distribution modeling with Pop III stellar templates indicates a very young ($\sim2$ Myr), low-mass ($M_* \approx 6.1\times 10^5 M_\odot$) stellar population. Further, the photometric redshifts reveal that CR3 could reside in a slightly underdense environment ($\delta \approx -0.12$). CR3 provides evidence that first-generation star formation could persist well after the epoch of reionization, challenging the conventional view that pristine star formation ended by $z\gtrsim6$.

          Not-quite-primordial black holes seeded by cosmic string loops

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic strings appear in many well-motivated extensions to the standard model of particle physics. If they exist, an abundant population of compact objects known as cosmic string loops permeate the Universe at all times, providing a secondary source of density perturbations that are large amplitude and non-gaussian in nature. In general, these loops are not stationary in the rest frame of the dark matter, thus their relative velocities will typically seed both spherical and filamentary overdensities in the matter era. Building upon previous work, we provide an improved framework to compute the complete halo mass function for these string seeded overdensities, valid for any loop velocity distribution. Using this mass function, we also compute the subset of halos capable of undergoing a direct collapse, forming a population of black holes with initial mass $10^{4-5} \, M_{\odot}$ at high redshifts. Interestingly, for reasonable values of the string parameters, one can reproduce the abundance of ``Little Red Dots" as inferred by JWST.

          Collapsar Disk Outflows III: Detectable Neutrino and Gravitational Wave Signatures

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the neutrino and gravitational wave (GW) signals from accretion disks formed during the failed collapse of a rotating massive star (a collapsar). Following black hole formation, a neutrino-cooled, shocked accretion disk forms, which displays non-spherical oscillations for a period of seconds before becoming advective and exploding the star. We compute the neutrino and GW signals (matter quadrupole) from collapsar disks using global axisymmetric, viscous hydrodynamic simulations. The neutrino signal with typical energies of O$(10)$ MeV is maximal during the neutrino-cooled (NDAF) phase that follows shock formation. This phase lasts for a few seconds and is easily detectable within O$(10-100)$ kpc by the IceCube Neutrino Telescope. Additional neutrino signatures from a precursor equatorial shock and by stochastic accretion plumes during the advective phase are detectable within the galaxy. The GW signal during the NDAF phase is detectable in the galaxy by current and next-generation ground-based observatories. The explosion (memory) GW signal is similar to that of standard core-collapse supernovae and can be probed with a deci-Hertz space-based detector. Shock oscillations during the NDAF phase impart time variations with frequency O$(10-100)$ Hz to the neutrino and GW signals, encoding information about the shock dynamics and inner disk. These time variations can be detectable in neutrinos by IceCube within O$(1-10)$ kpc depending on progenitor model, flavor transformation scenario, and detailed properties of the angular momentum transport mechanism.

          On the incidence of weak and strong Mg II absorbers towards the Flat and Steep Spectrum Radio quasars

 - **Abstract**
 The incidence rate of Mg II absorbers per unit redshift path (dN/dz) towards quasar sightlines has been used to probe the interaction between quasar jets and surrounding gas clouds. Studies using core- and lobe-dominated samples found a higher dN/dz for strong Mg II absorbers (rest equivalent width, W_r(2796) >= 1.0 A) in velocity offsets ranging from 5000 km/s < beta * c < 60000 km/s (with beta = v/c), toward core-dominated sources. In this study, we applied a stringent spectral index criterion: alpha_radio < -0.7 for steep-spectrum radio quasars (SSRQs) and alpha_radio > -0.3 for flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs). Using this, we assembled the largest sample to date: 441 FSRQs and 464 SSRQs with suitable optical spectra to study both strong absorbers and weak (0.3 A < W_r(2796) < 1.0 A) Mg II absorbers. We conducted a detailed comparison of absorbers' incidence rate and offset velocity distributions. Our main findings are: (i) For both weak and strong absorbers, we found no significant excess in dN/dz towards FSRQ compared to SSRQ sightlines. (ii) The dN/dbeta distribution of Mg II absorbers along FSRQs and SSRQs are statistically similar. (iii) The cumulative distribution of weak Mg II absorbers is slightly lower for beta < 0.3, but shows an excess at higher beta. This suggests that, while intrinsic Mg II absorber abundance is comparable along both sightlines, FSRQs' more aligned relativistic jets cluster weak absorbers at high beta, consistent with the scenario of jet-driven acceleration of smaller gas clumps.

          Probing the polarized emission from the accretion-powered pulsar 4U 1907+09 with IXPE

 - **Abstract**
 We present observations of the accretion-powered X-ray pulsar (XRP) 4U 1907+09, conducted with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) that delivers the first high-quality polarization measurements of this source. 4U 1907+09 was observed twice during its brightest periods close to the periastron. We observe a stronger polarization in the first observation, with the phase-averaged polarization degree (PD) of $6.0 \pm 1.6\%$ and polarization angle (PA) of $69^\circ \pm 8^\circ$. In contrast, the second observation provides weaker constraints on the polarimetric properties, with a PD=$2.2 \pm 1.6\%$ and a PA=$46^\circ \pm 23^\circ$, as determined from the spectral-polarimetric analysis. Combining the data from both observations results in a PD=$3.7 \pm 1.1\%$ and a PA=$63^\circ \pm 9^\circ$. We detect an energy-dependent PA in the phase-averaged analyses with a significance of 1.7 $\sigma$. In the phase-resolved analyses, we observe a potential PA rotation by approximately $90^\circ$ between adjacent energy bands (4--5 and 5--6 keV) within the single phase bin of 0.25--0.375. We also investigate the influence of short flares on the polarization properties of this source. The results suggest that flares do not significantly affect the energy-phase-dependent PA, implying that the pulsar's geometry remains stable during flare events.

 - **Abstract**
 We present deep H$\alpha$ and [O III] images of the ejecta rich nebulosity associated with the suspected runaway and binary Wolf-Rayet star WR~71 (HD 143414). In H$\alpha$ emission, the nebula appears as a crescent shaped, broken ring of clumpy emission some $9' \times 13'$ in angular size centered to the south and west of the WR star. At a Gaia estimated distance of 4.27 kpc, the nebula has physical dimensions of $11 \times 16$ pc making it one of the larger known ejecta rich WR ring nebulae. Our [O III] image also show considerable surrounding faint nebulosity much of which may be unrelated to the WR star. A comparison of the nebula's optical appearance with that seen in WISE 22 $\mu$m data shows infrared coincidence with the nebula's brightest [O III] emission features. Deep H$\alpha$ and [O III] images like those presented here suggests that new and substantially deeper imaging reconnaissance of WR star nebulae compared to earlier surveys may lead to additional WR ring nebula detections, thereby enhancing our understanding on the frequency and formation of WR ring nebulae.

 - **Abstract**
 Discrepancies between distance measurements and $\Lambda$CDM predictions reveal notable features in the distance-redshift relation, possibly suggesting the presence of an evolving dark energy component. Given the central role of the Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric in modeling cosmological distances, we investigate here whether these features instead point to a possible departure from the fundamental FLRW symmetries. Exploiting the transverse and line-of-sight distances provided by baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO) observations, we demonstrate that observed distances hint at a slight but systematic preference for an anisotropic expansion rate emerging regardless of the dark energy model considered. Leveraging this non-FLRW feature, we investigate an inhomogeneous extension of the $\Lambda$CDM model that naturally provides an anisotropic expansion rate. Our analysis demonstrates that models featuring spherical overdensities can explain BAO, supernova, and cosmic microwave background data, providing fits statistically indistinguishable from those obtained with a phantom dark energy scenario. When Pantheon+ data is considered, our analysis challenges the FLRW framework at $2.8\sigma$ and yields scenarios that can be interpreted as subtle but non-negligible deviations from the FLRW metric. When DESY5 supernovae are considered instead, deviations are notably more significant, yielding scenarios that mildly violate the Copernican principle and exclude the FLRW assumption at $5.2\sigma$. Overall, our results motivate a more in-depth investigation of whether the perfectly homogeneous and isotropic FLRW paradigm can still be assumed to accurately predict cosmological distances in the era of precision cosmology.

          CU-JADE: A Method for Traversing Extinction Jumps along the Line-of-Sight

 - **Abstract**
 Although interstellar dust extinction serves as a powerful distance estimator, the solar system's location within the Galactic plane complicates distance determinations, especially for molecular clouds (MCs) at varying distances along the line of sight (LoS). The presence of complex extinction patterns along LoS introduces degeneracies, resulting in less accurate distance measurements to overlapping MCs in crowded regions of the Galactic plane. In this study, we develop the CUSUM-based Jump-point Analysis for Distance Estimation (CU-JADE), a novel method designed to help mitigate these observational challenges. The key strengths of CU-JADE include: (1) sensitivity to detect abrupt jumps in $Distance$-$A_{\lambda}$ ($D$-$A$) datasets, (2) minimal systematic errors as demonstrated on both mock and observed data, and (3) the ability to combine CUSUM analysis with multi-wavelength data to improve the completeness of distance measurements for nearby gas structures, even for extinction values as low as $\Delta A_{V} \gtrsim 0.15$ mag. By combining CO survey data with a large sample of stars characterized by high-precision parallaxes and extinctions, we uncovered the multi-layered molecular gas distribution in the high-latitude Cepheus region. We also determined accurate distances to MCs beyond the Cygnus Rift by analyzing the intricate structure of gas and extinction within the Galactic plane. Additionally, we constructed a full-sky 3D extinction map extending to 4 kpc, which provides critical insights into dense interstellar medium components dominated by molecular hydrogen. These results advance our understanding of the spatial distribution and physical properties of MCs across the Milky Way.

          Variational autoencoder for generating realistic $N$-body simulations for dark matter halos

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we explore the use of a variational autoencoder (VAE), a deep generative model, to compress and generate images of dark matter density fields from $\Lambda$CDM like cosmological simulations. The VAE learns a compact, low-dimensional representation of the large-scale structure, enabling both accurate reconstruction and generation of statistically realistic samples. We evaluated the generated images by comparing their power spectra to those of real simulations and the theoretical $\Lambda$CDM prediction, finding strong agreement with the state-of-the-art simulations. In addition, the VAE provides a fast and scalable method for generating synthetic cosmological data, making it a valuable tool for data augmentation. These capabilities can accelerate the development and training of more advanced machine learning models for cosmological analysis, particularly in scenarios where large-scale simulations are computationally expensive. Our results highlight the potential for generative artificial intelligence as a practical bridge between physical modeling and modern deep learning in cosmology.

          Numerical Study of Bar Suppression in Galaxy Models Due to Disc Heating

 - **Abstract**
 The process of bar formation, evolution and destruction is still a controversial topic regarding galaxy dynamics. Numerical simulations show that these phenomena strongly depend on physical and numerical parameters. In this work, we study the combined influence of the softening parameter, $\epsilon$ and disc mass fraction, $m_{\mathrm{d}}$ on the formation and evolution of bars in isolated disc-halo models via $N$-body simulations with different particle resolutions. Previous studies indicate that the bar strength depends on $m_{\mathrm{d}}$ as $\propto m_{\mathrm{d}}^{-1}$, which is seen as a delay in bar formation. However, the distorsion parameter, $\eta$, which measures the bar's momentum through time, shows that an increase in $m_{\mathrm{d}}$ does not always induce a delay in bar formation. This suggests that $\epsilon$ interact to either enhance or weaken the bar. Moreover, numerical heating dominates in models with small softening values, creating highly accelerated particles at the centre of discs, regardless of $m_{\mathrm{d}}$ or resolution. These enhanced particle accelerations produce chaotic orbits for $\epsilon \leq 5\,$pc, resulting in bar suppression due to collisional dynamics in the centre. In our high resolution models ($N \approx 10^{7}$), small softening values are incapable of reproducing the bar instability. The role of disc mass is as follows: increasing $m_{\mathrm{d}}$ for moderate $\epsilon$ ($\geq 10\,$pc) reduces the amount of drift in the acceleration profile, without affecting the bar's behaviour. Models with lower $m_{\mathrm{d}}$ values coupled with small softening values, have an excess of highly accelerated particles, introducing unwanted effects into otherwise reliable simulations. Finally, we show that the evolution of the disc's vertical acceleration profile is a reliable indicator of numerical heating introduced by $\epsilon$ and the bar.

 - **Abstract**
 The X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM) is the seventh Japanese X-ray observatory whose development and operation are in collaboration with universities and research institutes in Japan, the United States, and Europe, including JAXA, NASA, and ESA. The telemetry data downlinked from the satellite are reduced to scientific products using pre-pipeline (PPL) and pipeline (PL) software running on standard Linux virtual machines (VMs) for the JAXA and NASA sides, respectively. OBSIDs identified the observations, and we had 80 and 161 OBSIDs to be reprocessed at the end of the commissioning period and performance verification and calibration period, respectively. The combination of the containerized PPL utilizing Singularity of a container platform running on the JAXA's "TOKI-RURI" high-performance computing (HPC) system and working disk images formatted to ext3 accomplished a 33x speedup in PPL tasks over our regular VM. Herein, we briefly describe the data processing in XRISM and our porting strategies for PPL in the HPC environment.

          Re-examining Super-Nyquist Frequencies of 68 $δ$ Scuti Stars Utilizing the Kepler Long Cadence Photometry

 - **Abstract**
 The high-precision and long-duration photometry provided by the $Kepler$ mission has greatly advanced frequency analyses of a large number of pulsating stars, a fundamental step in asteroseismology. For $\delta$ Scuti stars, analyses are typically confined to frequencies below the Nyquist frequency. However, signals above this limit can be reflected into the sub-Nyquist range, especially in long-cadence data, where they may overlap with genuine pulsation modes and lead to misinterpretation. To address this issue, a recently proposed method -- the sliding Lomb-Scargle periodogram (sLSP) -- can effectively distinguish real frequencies from aliased ones. In this study, we compiled a sample of 68 $\delta$ Scuti stars whose frequency analyses were based on the $Kepler$ photometry. Using the sLSP method, we systematically examined the 1,406 reported frequencies in the literature. As a result, we identified 6 previously unrecognized reflected super-Nyquist frequencies in four stars: KIC 3440495, KIC 5709664, KIC 7368103, and KIC 9204718. We have once again demonstrated the ability of the sLSP method to detect and correct such artifacts. This technique improves the reliability of frequency selection, thereby enhancing the accuracy of asteroseismic interpretation and stellar modeling for the pulsating stars.

 - **Abstract**
 We aim to construct a comprehensive global multi-scale kinematic equilibrium radiative-transfer model for the pre-transitional disc of DoAr 44 (Haro 1-16, V2062 Oph) in the Ophiuchus star-forming region. This model integrates diverse observational datasets to describe the system, spanning from the accretion region to the outer disc. Our analysis utilises a large set of observational data, including ALMA continuum complex visibilities, VLTI/GRAVITY continuum squared visibilities, closure phases, and triple products, as well as VLT/UVES and VLT/X-shooter H-alpha spectra. Additionally, we incorporated absolute flux measurements from ground-based optical observatories, Spitzer, IRAS, the Submillimeter Array, the IRAM, or the ATCA radio telescopes. These data sets were used to constrain the structure and kinematics of the object through radiative-transfer modelling. Our model reveals that the spectral line profiles are best explained by an optically thin spherical inflow/outflow within the co-rotation radius of the star, exhibiting velocities exceeding 380 km/s. The VLTI near-infrared interferometric observations are consistent with an inner disc extending from 0.1 to 0.2 au. The ALMA sub-millimetre observations indicate a dust ring located between 36 and 56 au, probably related to the CO2 condensation line. The global density and temperature profiles derived from our model provide insight into an intermediate disc, located in the terrestrial planet-forming zone, which has not yet been spatially resolved.

 - **Abstract**
 The study of pulsar glitches provides a unique window into the internal structure and dynamic processes of neutron stars. PSR J0007+7303, a very bright gamma-ray pulsar, is the first pulsar discovered by the Fermi-LAT telescope. In this paper, we present the 15 years of timing results of this pulsar using the Fermi-LAT data. We identified nine glitches, five of which are newly discovered. Among these, two are small glitches, occurring between the three previously reported ones, while the other four are large glitches. The glitches exhibit fractional frequency changes ranging from 15 x 10^-9 to 1238 x 10^-9, with intervals of approximately 1-2 years between events. Uniquely, this pulsar shows no exponential recovery behavior following any glitch, setting it apart from most glitching pulsars. Furthermore, no significant changes were observed in the gamma-ray pulse profile, flux, or phase-averaged spectra before and after glitches, indicating the stability of the pulsar's emission properties despite internal changes. A parametric analysis of the glitches yielded a fractional moment of inertia of the crustal superfluid involved in glitches as 1.06 percent, which matches extremely well with previous statistical work if the non-dissipative entrainment effect is not considered and strongly supports the internal origin of these glitches. These results highlight the distinct glitch behavior of PSR J0007+7303 and offer valuable insights into the crust-superfluid interaction in neutron stars. The physical origin of no exponential recovery is also discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent results from DESI BAO measurements, together with Planck CMB and Pantheon+ data, suggest that there may be a `phantom' phase ($w_{\rm de}<-1$) in the expansion of the Universe. This inference follows when the $w_0, w_a$ parametrization for the dark energy equation of state $w_{\rm de}$ is used to fit the data. Since phantom dark energy in general relativity is unphysical, we investigate the possibility that the phantom behaviour is not intrinsic, but effective -- due to a non-gravitational interaction between dark matter and non-phantom dark energy. To this end, we assume a physically motivated thawing quintessence-like form of the intrinsic dark energy equation of state $w_{\rm de}$. Then we use a $w_0, w_a$ model for the \emph{effective} equation of state of dark energy. We find that the data favours a phantom crossing for the effective dark energy, but only at low significance. The intrinsic equation of state of dark energy is non-phantom, without imposing any non-phantom priors. A nonzero interaction is favoured at more than $3\sigma$ at $z\sim0.3$. The energy flows from dark matter to dark energy at early times and reverses at later times.

          Bridging the gap: consistent modeling of protoplanetary disk heating and gap formation by planet-induced spiral shocks

 - **Abstract**
 A giant planet embedded in a protoplanetary disk excites spiral density waves, which steepen into shocks as they propagate away from the planet. These shocks lead to secular disk heating and gap opening, both of which can have important implications for the evolution of solids near the planet. To date, these two effects have largely been modeled independently. In this study, we present a self-consistent model that unifies these processes by linking shock heating and angular momentum deposition through the entropy jumps across the spiral shocks. We show that the model accurately reproduces the temperature and surface density profiles around the planet's orbit, as obtained from two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations with standard $\alpha$ viscosity and $\beta$ thermal relaxation prescriptions. Furthermore, by incorporating an empirically derived scaling law for the radial distribution of the entropy jump, we construct a fully analytic model that self-consistently predicts the temperature and surface density structures of disks hosting a giant planet. This work represents a first step toward understanding how early-formed giant planets influence the formation of second-generation planets and planetesimals in their vicinity.

          Variable QPO lags and reduced coherence between the disc and corona in MAXI J1820+070

 - **Abstract**
 Quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) are observed in the hard state of many black hole X-ray binaries. Although their origin is unknown, they are strongly associated with the corona, of which the geometry is also subject to discussion. We present a thorough spectral-timing analysis of QPOs and broadband noise in the high-inclination BHXRB MAXI J1820+070, using the rich NICER data set of the source in the bright hard state of its outburst in 2018. We find that there is a large QPO hard lag between soft energy bands with significant disc emission and harder coronal power-law bands, which is absent when measuring lags between energy bands dominated by the coronal emission. The QPO lags between a soft band (with significant disc emission) and harder coronal power-law bands vary significantly with power-law flux, on time-scales of (tens of) seconds or a few QPO cycles, especially at QPO frequencies $\lesssim0.3$ Hz. At the same time, the QPO is found to be related to a decreased coherence between energy bands with significant disc emission and harder bands both at and below the QPO frequency, suggesting the QPO mechanism filters out part of the variability. Similar patterns in the frequency-dependent lags and coherence are observed in the BHXRB MAXI J1803-298, which is a (dipping) high-inclination source, but not in the low-inclination source GX 339-4. We suggest that these findings may be evidence of changes in the vertical extent of the corona on time-scales slightly longer than the QPO cycle.

 - **Abstract**
 Markarian 421 (Mrk 421) is the closest and one of the brightest high-frequency peaked blazars, located at a redshift of z = 0.031. It is a strong source of gamma rays, and its broadband emission has been extensively studied over the years through multi-wavelength observations from various telescopes. Mrk 421 has been a target of observational campaigns conducted by the SST-1M telescopes - two single-mirror small-size Cherenkov telescopes at Ondrejov Observatory, Prague, Czech Republic. These telescopes operate in mono and stereoscopic modes, utilizing the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Technique (IACT) to detect Very High Energy (VHE) gamma rays in the 1-300 TeV energy range. We present recent SST-1M observations, data analysis, and the results of preliminary physical modeling of Mrk 421's emission mechanisms.

 - **Abstract**
 Polar mesospheric clouds provide clues to physicochemical processes in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere. However, the heterogeneous nucleation and growth processes of water ice under polar mesospheric conditions are poorly understood, especially at the nanoscale. This study used reflection high energy electron diffraction and infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy to analyze the structure of vapor-deposited ice at polar mesospheric temperature (120 K) under vapor pressure conditions. The ice appeared to grow in three steps during vapor deposition, being amorphous water for the first 15 nm, then cubic ice up to 50 nm, and finally hexagonal ice subsequently. This three step growth suggests that the three observed phases can coexist in polar mesospheric clouds, depending on the thickness of water ice. The finding of the three-step growth also shows that the Ostwald rule of stages can hold for vapor deposited ice at low temperature.

 - **Abstract**
 The IceCube Upgrade Camera System is a novel calibration system designed to calibrate the IceCube detector by measuring the optical properties of the Antarctic ice. The system comprises nearly 2,000 cameras and illumination LEDs, which are present on every D-Egg and mDOM, the newly designed optical modules for the IceCube Upgrade. These units, deployed across the IceCube Upgrade volume, will capture transmission and reflection images that can be used to characterize the optical properties of both the refrozen ice within drill holes and the bulk ice between strings. Additionally, the images can aid in determining the positions of the optical modules the camera systems are mounted on. To maximize the systems performance, various image analysis methodologies have been explored, ranging from classical maximum likelihood estimation to AI-based approaches using neural networks. In this study, we present preliminary results on the performance of these methods based on images generated by a simulation tool developed specifically for this system.

 - **Abstract**
 The Effective Field Theory (EFT) of Dark Energy (DE) is a model independent framework that allows for the description of a wide class of dark energy and modified gravity models. This is achieved by extending the Hilbert Einstein action through the introduction of time dependent functions. However, the choice of these functions and thus the operator basis is not unique. In this paper, we propose a physically motivated constraint based on the continuity equation, leading to a continuity equation compatible (CEC) basis that ensures a clear physical interpretation of the background EFT operators.

 - **Abstract**
 We present compelling observational evidence supporting G178.28-00.61 as an early-stage candidate for Cloud-Cloud Collision (CCC), with indications of the formation of an S-shaped filament, evenly-separated dense cores, and young star clusters. The observations of CO molecular line emission demonstrate the existence of two interacting molecular clouds with systemic velocities of 0.8 km/s and -1.2 km/s, respectively. The convergence zone of these two clouds reveals an S-shaped filament in the JCMT 850 micron continuum image, suggesting cloud interaction. In line with expectations from CCC simulations, broad bridging features are discernible in the position-velocity diagrams. An elevated concentration of identified Class I and II young stellar objects along the filament at the intersection area further supports the hypothesis of a collision-induced origin. This observation could be explained by a recent MHD model of CCC (Kong et al. 2024), which predicts a similar morphology, scale, density, and unbound status, as well as the orientation of the polarization.

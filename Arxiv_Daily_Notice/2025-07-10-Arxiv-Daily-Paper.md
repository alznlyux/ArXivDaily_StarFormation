 - **Abstract**
 Optical observations of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) contemporaneous with their prompt high-energy emission are rare, but they can provide insights into the physical processes underlying these explosive events. The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite's (TESS) large field of view and continuous observation capabilities make it uniquely positioned to detect and characterize prompt optical flashes from GRBs. In this work, we fit phenomenological models to the gamma-ray through optical spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of 24 bursts with arcsecond-level localizations that fell within the TESS field of view between 2018 July and 2024 December. In four cases, the extrapolation of the high-energy SED agrees with the observed optical flux to within 1-$\sigma$. In one case, there is a significant excess of optical flux relative to the extrapolation. In two cases, upper limits from TESS did not constrain the optical portion of the SED. In the remaining 17 cases, the optical flux is overpredicted by the extrapolation from high energies. This discrepancy could be explained by dust extinction in the host galaxy.

          The Possibility of Hydrogen-Water Demixing in Uranus, Neptune, K2-18b and TOI-270d

 - **Abstract**
 The internal structures of Uranus and Neptune remain unknown. In addition, sub-Neptunes are now thought to be the most common type of exoplanets. Understanding the physical processes that govern the interiors of such planets is therefore essential. Phase separation between hydrogen and water may occur in cold, water-rich intermediate-mass planets. We assess whether it could occur in Uranus, Neptune, K2-18\,b and TOI-270\,d, and investigate its effect on the planetary evolution and inferred internal structure. We couple planetary evolution models with recent \textit{ab initio} calculations of the hydrogen-water phase diagram, allowing for temperature shifts to account for uncertainties in miscibility gaps. We find that demixing may occur and could lead to a complete depletion of water in the outermost regions of Uranus and Neptune. Temperature offsets of up to 1100~K lead to a depleted region comprising as much as 16\% of the planet's mass, and an increase in planetary radius by nearly 20\%. For K2-18\,b, our models suggest that hydrogen-water demixing is ongoing and may explain the absence of water features in its JWST spectrum. A temperature offset of 500~K is required to get a complete depletion of water in the atmosphere of K2-18\,b. TOI-270\,d may also have experienced hydrogen-water demixing. When applying a similar temperature offset on the phase diagram as for K2-18\,b, we find a partial depletion of water in the atmosphere of TOI-270\,d, consistent with JWST's detection of water. Hydrogen-water immiscibility may play a key role in shaping the structure and evolution of both Solar System giant planets like Uranus and Neptune, and cold/temperate exoplanets such as K2-18\,b and TOI-270\,d. Accounting for such internal processes is crucial to accurately interpret atmospheric observations from current (e.g., JWST) and upcoming (e.g., ARIEL) missions.

          The Structure of the Relativistic Fe Line in GX 340+0 as Viewed with XRISM/Resolve, NICER, and NuSTAR

 - **Abstract**
 We present a 152 ks XRISM/Resolve observation of the persistently accreting Z source GX 340+0. Simultaneous observations also occurred with NuSTAR and NICER for 22.47 ks and 2.7 ks, respectively. The source covered the normal branch to the flaring branching during the observations. The data from all three missions were modeled concurrently for each spectral branch. The superior energy resolution of XRISM/Resolve reveals structure within the iron emission line complex regardless of spectral state. We model the reprocessed Fe K line with a reflection model tailored for thermal illumination of the accretion disk by a neutron star. The currently available model encompasses the broad components, but narrow emission features remain at the ~5% level. These remaining features may be described by the presence of an ionized plasma in the system as has been observed in the Z source Cygnus X-2, but subsequent updates to the reflection model code may be able to explain these features.

          Bouncing Grains Keep Protoplanetary Disks Bright

 - **Abstract**
 Proto-planetary disks display the so-called size-luminosity relation, where their mm-wavelength fluxes scale linearly with their emitting areas. This suggests that these disks are optically thick in mm-band, an interpretation further supported by their near-black-body spectral indexes. Such characteristics are seen not only among disks in very young star-forming regions like Lupus (1-3 Myrs), but, as we demonstrate here, also among disks in the much older Upper Scorpius region (5-11 Myrs). How can disks shine brightly for so long, when grain growth and subsequent radial drift should have quickly depleted their solid reservoir? Here, we suggest that the "bouncing barrier" provides the answer. Even colliding at very low speeds (below 1cm/s), grains already fail to stick to each other but instead bounce off in-elastically. This barrier stalls grain growth at a near-universal size of $\sim 100 \mu m$. These small grains experience much reduced radial drift, and so are able to keep the disks bright for millions of years. They are also tightly coupled to gas, offering poor prospects for processes like streaming instability or pebble accretion. We speculate briefly on how planetesimals can arise in such a bath of 100-micron grains.

 - **Abstract**
 The recent detection of fast-moving stars in the core of Omega Centauri ($\omega$ Cen), the most massive globular cluster (GC) in the Milky Way, has provided strong evidence for the presence of an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH). As $\omega$ Cen, is likely the accreted nucleus of a dwarf galaxy, this IMBH also represents a unique opportunity to study BH seeding mechanisms and their potential role in the formation of supermassive BHs. We present Monte Carlo $N$-body models of $\omega$ Cen with detailed treatments for the loss cone dynamics involving stars, binaries, and compact objects. Starting with BH seeds of $500-5000 \, M_{\odot}$ (consistent with runaway collisions of massive stars), our cluster models grow IMBHs with masses of $\sim50{,}000 \, M_{\odot}$ after 12 Gyr, while successfully reproducing the present-day surface brightness and velocity dispersion profiles of $\omega$ Cen. We find a population of fast stars similar to those observed in the core of $\omega$ Cen, with the fastest stars originating from binaries that were tidally disrupted by the IMBH. The IMBH growth is primarily driven by mergers with $30-40 \, M_{\odot}$ BHs, suggesting a present-day IMBH-BH merger rate of $\sim(4-8)\times10^{-8}~\rm{yr}^{-1}$ in $\omega$ Cen-like GCs. Our models also predict a similar rate of tidal disruption events ($\sim5\times10^{-8}~\rm{yr}^{-1}$) which, depending on the frequency of $\omega$ Cen-like GCs per galaxy, may represent anywhere from $0.1\%$ to $10\%$ of the observed TDE rate.

 - **Abstract**
 The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a cubic-kilometer Cherenkov array deployed in the deep, glacial ice at the geographic South Pole. An important feature of the instrumented ice are undulations of layers of constant optical properties over the footprint of the detector. During detector construction, these layers were mapped using stratigraphy measurements obtained from a stand-alone laser dust logger. While this system is very precise, its cost does not scale to the instrumented volume envisioned for the proposed IceCube-Gen2 Observatory. Here, we explore the possibility of obtaining equivalent stratigraphy data from camera footage recorded during the deployment of IceCube more than a decade ago. If successful, this could be an alternative technique to be considered for IceCube-Gen2.

 - **Abstract**
 IceCube is a neutrino observatory located at the South Pole that uses Antarctic ice as a medium for detection of Cherenkov photons. As such, analysis of the data relies on our understanding of the properties of ice within and around the instrumented volume. Over the years we have made significant progress in understanding the glacial ice and now have a comprehensive model that covers many of the relevant aspects of the photon propagation in it. In this report we give a historical overview of the ice description within the IceCube detector, list some of the remaining issues, and assess how much more improvement is still needed. As the IceCube Upgrade is expected to be installed in less than a year, with several new types of calibration devices aiming to further our understanding of ice, this is the perfect time to review the current state of the ice model.

          Parsec-scale SiO emission in the Galactic Center

 - **Abstract**
 The central 5 parsecs of our Galactic Center is rich in various molecular tracers. The region is observed to be hot, highly ionized, and volatile, resulting in complex chemistry and kinematics. Countless molecular observations of the central region orbiting the central super-massive black hole Sgr A* have revealed a stable grouping of clouds with a disk-like structure known as the circumnuclear disk (CND) orbiting Sgr A* between 1.5 and 3 pc. The CND houses the densest population of gas outside the ionized streams in the minispiral falling onto Sgr A*. However, the small-scale kinematics of the clouds and gas are poorly understood in this region. In this paper, we report single dish SiO (1-0) observations of the central 5 pc surrounding Sgr A* taken with the Green Bank Telescope. Most of the SiO (1-0) traces the southern streamer and Sgr A East-neither of which are associated with the CND. However, one region in the CND, known as the NE Arm, shows high-intensity SiO emission unlike in the rest of the CND, indicating the NE Arm as a candidate region of either cloud-cloud collision or early star formation. Further high resolution observations of the region are needed to distinguish between the two scenarios.

 - **Abstract**
 We present Kurucz-a1, a physics-informed neural network (PINN) that emulates 1D stellar atmosphere models under Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), addressing a critical bottleneck in differentiable stellar spectroscopy. By incorporating hydrostatic equilibrium as a physical constraint during training, Kurucz-a1 creates a differentiable atmospheric structure solver that maintains physical consistency while achieving computational efficiency. Kurucz-a1 can achieve superior hydrostatic equilibrium and more consistent with the solar observed spectra compared to ATLAS-12 itself, demonstrating the advantages of modern optimization techniques. Combined with modern differentiable radiative transfer codes, this approach enables data-driven optimization of universal physical parameters across diverse stellar populations-a capability essential for next-generation stellar astrophysics.

          Supernovae from stellar mergers and accretors of binary mass transfer: Implications for Type IIP, 1987A-like and interacting supernovae

 - **Abstract**
 As most massive stars are born in binary and other multiple-star systems, many are expected to exchange mass with a companion star or merge with it during their lives. This means that most supernovae (SNe) are from such binary products. Here, we focus on hydrogen-rich Type II SNe from accretors of binary mass transfer and stellar mergers. We compute various SN properties such as the explosion energies, nickel yields, and neutron star (NS) kick velocities, but also consider NS masses. We find tight correlations between these parameters and, e.g., the central specific entropy and core compactness. However, there is no obvious relation between these explosion properties and the evolutionary history of the pre-SN stars. We find linear relations between the nickel mass and the SN explosion energy and the NS remnant mass. We further group our models into progenitors of SNe IIP, SN 1987A-like and interacting SNe, predict their SN and SN-progenitor properties and compare to observations. Accretors of binary mass transfer and stellar mergers naturally produce SNe IIP with long plateau durations from progenitors with relatively small CO-cores but large envelope masses (c.f. SN 2015ba). Our models give rise to tight relations between the plateau luminosity and the nickel mass as well as the SN ejecta velocity as inferred observationally for SNe IIP. We speculate that cool/red supergiants at $\log\,L/L_\odot\,{\geq}\,5.5$ encounter enhanced mass loss due to envelope instabilities and could then explode in interacting SNe IIn. The rate of such SNe from our models seems compatible with observations. Some of our binary models explode as $10^6\,L_\odot$ blue supergiants that may have encountered enhanced and/or eruptive mass loss shortly before their SNe and could thus help understand interacting SNe such as SN 1961V and SN 2005gl but also superluminous Type II SNe such as SN 2010jl.

          Wakes from Companion Interactions in Type Ia Supernovae Nebular Emission Line Profiles

 - **Abstract**
 Thermonuclear supernovae (SNe) are the result of the nuclear transformation of carbon/oxygen (C/O) white dwarfs (WDs) to the radioactive element $^{56}\mathrm{Ni}$ and intermediate mass elements (IMEs) like Ca, Ar, etc. Most progenitor scenarios involve a companion star which donates matter to the exploding white dwarf, implying a fundamental prediction: the formation of a wake in the explosive ejecta as it runs into and moves past the companion star. This wake leaves an indelible imprint on the ejecta's density, velocity, and composition structure that remains fixed as the ejecta reaches homologous expansion. We simulate the interaction of the ejecta and Roche-lobe filling donor in a double degenerate double detonation Type Ia progenitor scenario and explore the detectability of this imprint in late-time nebular phase spectroscopy of Type Ia SNe under the assumption of local heating ($t > 200$ days). At these times, the velocity profiles of forbidden emission lines reflect the velocity distribution of all of the ejecta and the critical electron density for that forbidden line. We explicitly calculate line shapes for the [Co III] $11.89 \mu\mathrm{m}$ line that traces the initial $^{56}\mathrm{Ni}$ distribution and the [Ar III] $8.99 \mu\mathrm{m}$ line, which traces a typical intermediate mass element. We predict the viewing angle dependence of the line shape, present a tool to quickly calculate optically thin line shapes for various 3D density-velocity profiles and discuss JWST observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Only 40 exoplanetary systems with five or more planets are currently known. These systems are crucial for our understanding of planet formation and planet-planet interaction. The M dwarf L 98-59 has previously been found to show evidence of five planets, three of which are transiting. Our aim is to confirm the fifth planet in this system and to refine the system characteristics namely minimum masses, radii and the orbital parameters of the planets around L 98-59. We reanalysed RV and activity data from HARPS and ESPRESSO alongside TESS and HST transit data using a joint model. The parameter space was sampled using the dynesty nested sampler. We confirm the previously known fifth planet in the system's habitable zone with an orbital period of $23.07\pm0.08\,d$, a minimum mass of $3.0\pm0.5\,M_{\oplus}$ and an effective temperature of 289 K. We find an additional planet candidate in the RV data with an orbital period of $1.7361^{+0.0007}_{-0.0008}\,d$ and a minimum mass of $0.58\pm0.12\,M_{\oplus}$. This candidate (L 98-59.06) has a statistical significance between $2.9\sigma$ and $4.2\sigma$, details depending on the modelling of stellar variability. Moreover, we present evidence for a stellar rotation period of $76\pm4\,d$.

          Optical detection of the X-ray flash in the very fast nova V1674 Her: Optical contribution of the irradiated accretion disk

 - **Abstract**
 V1674 Her is one of the fastest and brightest novae, characterized by dense optical photometry in the pre-maximum phase, a rise from $g=17$ to 7 mag, in one-fourth of a day. We present a composite theoretical $V$ light curve model of its early rising phase starting from a quiescent brightness of $g=19.2$ mag. Our light curve model consists of a hot and bright white dwarf (WD) and irradiated accretion disk and companion star. We found that the earliest optical detection of ASAS-SN $g$ band brightness of $g=17.0$ at $t=0.014$ day from the onset of thermonuclear runaway can be explained with the irradiated accretion disk and companion star in the X-ray flash phase of a $1.35 ~M_\odot$ WD. This is the first detection in optical of an X-ray flash phase of a nova. Optically thick winds emerge from the WD photosphere at $t=0.04$ day, and optical flux is dominated by free-free emission from optically-thin ejecta just outside the WD photosphere. Our free-free emission model $V$ light curve reasonably reproduces the dense $g$ light curve of Evryscope that spans from $g=14.8$ (at 0.078 day) to $g=7.1$ (at 0.279 day), including a sudden change of slope in the $g$ light curve from slow to rapid rise at $g=14.3$ on day $0.1$. There is no indication of shocking power during the rising phase from $g=14.8$ to 7.1.

          A Detailed Analysis of the Milky Way Warp Based on Classical Cepheids

 - **Abstract**
 Classical Cepheids (CCs) are important probes for the large-scale warp structure of the Milky Way. Using Gaia DR3 CCs, we establish an optimal time-dependent warp model, where the warp height increases with radius following a power-law, the line of nodes (LONs) exhibit linear twisting with radius, following a leading spiral pattern, and the LONs undergo prograde evolution over time. Structurally, we identify significant warp features in the $5-9$ kpc region of the Galactic disk, where the warp model performs better than the flat model. Beyond 15 kpc, the model with the second Fourier term does not fit the observations well, whereas the model with twisted LONs better matches the data. Kinematically, we derived expressions for the vertical velocities using direct differentiation and then calculated the precession rates for each CC. Our results intuitively indicate a nearly uniform and low warp precession rate of $\omega = 4.86 \pm (0.88)_{stat} \pm (2.14)_{sys}$ km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$ beyond 12.5 kpc, in agreement with classical kinematic estimates. Based on these findings, we propose a simple yet comprehensive time-dependent warp model, $Z_{w}(t) = 0.00019R^{3.08}\sin(\phi - (3.87R-41.79 + 4.86t))$, which provides a unified framework for describing both the geometric and kinematic evolution of the Galactic warp. We analyzed the impact of the adopted solar vertical velocity on the inferred warp precession rate and confirmed the reliability of the measured precession rate. In addition, we found that extinction treatment affects the warp amplitude in the inner disk, while its influence on the outer disk warp structure and the precession rate is negligible.

          Power Law Plateau Inflation and Primary Gravitational Waves in the light of ACT

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate Power-Law Plateau (PLP) inflation in standard gravity and its consistency with ACT DR6 data. While many inflationary models, including the Starobinsky inflation, are disfavored by ACT observations, the PLP potential remains viable across a broad range of its parameters. Then, the dynamics of the reheating phase are investigated, where we mainly focus on the reheating temperature and its relationship with the inflationary phase and primordial gravitational waves. Incorporating the overproduction of the primordial gravitational waves can affect the effective number of relativistic species during the bounce. The constraint data on $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ can impose a lower bound on the reheating temperature. This constraint will be more efficient for a stiff equation of state. It is determined that for $\omega_{re} > 0.58$, this constraint would be efficient. Combining the result of the reheating temperature and the inflationary phase, it is concluded that to have both a viable result standing in $1\sigma$ of ACT DR6 and also to satisfy the reheating lower bound, the total number of e-folds during the inflationary phase should be $N_k \lesssim 62$. Higher e-folds of expansion result in a reheating temperature below the bound, which is disfavored. Finally, for the constraint values of the reheating temperature, the energy spectrum of the gravitational waves has been explored. The results indicate that there is a higher chance of detection for lower reheating temperatures and higher reheating equation of state.

 - **Abstract**
 The detection of transient phenomena such as Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs), Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), stellar flares, novae, and supernovae, alongside novel cosmic messengers like high-energy neutrinos and gravitational waves, has transformed astrophysics in recent years. Maximizing the discovery potential of multi-messenger and multi-wavelength follow-up observations, as well as serendipitous detections, requires a tool that rapidly compiles and contextualizes relevant information for each new event. We present Astro-COLIBRI, an advanced platform designed to meet this challenge. Astro-COLIBRI integrates a public RESTful API, real-time databases, a cloud-based alert system, and user-friendly clients (a website and mobile apps for iOS and Android). It processes astronomical alerts from multiple streams in real time, filtering them based on user-defined criteria and placing them in their multi-wavelength and multi-messenger context. The platform offers intuitive data visualization, a quick summary of relevant event properties, and an assessment of observing conditions at numerous observatories worldwide. We here describe its architecture, data resources, and main functionalities. We highlight the automatic collection of photometric data from a variety of large scale optical surveys, a recently added feature that significantly improves the capabilities of the Astro-COLIBRI platform.

 - **Abstract**
 The Dark MAtter Particle Explorer (DAMPE) instrument is a space-born cosmic-ray detector, capable of measuring ion fluxes up to $\sim$500 TeV/n. This energy scale is made accessible through its calorimeter, which is the deepest currently operating in orbit. Saturation of the calorimeter readout channels start occurring above $\sim$100 TeV of incident energy, and can significantly affect the primary energy reconstruction. Different techniques, analytical and machine-learning based, have been developed to tackle this issue, focusing on the recovery of single-bar deposits, up to several hundreds of TeV. In this work, a new machine-learning technique is presented, which profit of a unique model to correct the total deposited energy in DAMPE calorimeter. The described method is able to generalise its corrections for different ions and extend the maximum detectable incident energy to the PeV scale.

          Pulsar+escape: the recipe for LHAASO sources ?

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of our Galaxy at very-high and ultra-high photon energies have revealed a rich population of sources, many of which have significant angular extension and/or are positionally coincident with energetic pulsars. We assessed whether the properties of these gamma-ray emitters are consistent with the predictions of a model for the non-thermal leptonic emission of a pulsar wind nebula expanding within a supernova remnant, including the possibility of particle escape across the different components of the system up to the ambient medium. We used a multi-zone model framework that describes the transport and radiation of a population of ultra-relativistic electron-positron pairs. The dynamics of the system is retrieved from numerical hydrodynamics simulations, which allows to follow the evolution through advanced stages. Model predictions for typical parameter setups are compared to source catalogs issued by the H.E.S.S. and LHAASO collaborations. If particles remain confined in the nebula, 1-100TeV emission is only partially consistent with the properties of observed sources in terms of surface brightness, angular extent, and photon index. In particular, the systems spend a long time in a bright and soft state that has no equivalent in observations. Conversely, including the possibility of energy-dependent particle escape across the object results in a much better agreement, both in the 1-10TeV range explored with H.E.S.S. or LHAASO-WCDA, and in the 20-100TeV range explored by LHAASO-KM2A. Emission components with intermediate to low brightnesses and large to very large sizes result from particles trapped in the remnant or escaped in the surrounding medium. Particle escape, clearly seen in the form of misaligned jets or halos around middle-aged pulsars, is a very important process in much younger systems with 1-100kyr ages, and shapes their appearance as TeV/PeV sources.

 GRANDProto300 is one of the prototype experiments of the Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection. It will feature about 300 radio antenna detectors in Xiaodushang in Dunhuang, China, covering a total geometrical area of about 200 km$^2$. A main scientific goal of GRANDProto300 is the study of cosmic rays in the transition region ($10^{17}\, {\rm eV} < E < 10^{18.5}\, {\rm eV}$). Our study calculates the exposure of GRANDProto300 to cosmic rays and estimates the number of cosmic-ray events to be detected during a fixed observation period. The trigger efficiency reaches 50, 80, and 90% at $10^{17.5}$, $10^{17.9}$, and $10^{18.3}\, {\rm eV}$, respectively. The exposure of GRANDProto300 is 50 km$^2$ day sr at around $10^{17.5}$ eV, and the expected number of observed cosmic rays with energies above $10^{17}$ eV and zenith angles above 65$^{\circ}$ is about 130 events per day. GRANDProto300 will be able to measure the cosmic-ray energy spectrum in $10^{17.2}\, {\rm eV} < E < 10^{19.5}\, {\rm eV}$ through one-year observation, with a statistical precision about five times better than the previous spectral measurement by a mono-fluorescence detector of the Telescope Array Low-Energy Extension. The statistical uncertainty in the measurement of the mean depth of the air-shower maximum $X_{\rm max}$ is about five times better than the previous measurements using radio detectors at $10^{17.5}$ eV; systematic uncertainties should be a dominant contribution limiting our interpretation of the chemical composition of cosmic rays in the transition region.

 - **Abstract**
 Characterizing the astrophysical neutrino flux with the IceCube Neutrino Observatory traditionally relies on a binned forward-folding likelihood approach. Insufficient Monte Carlo (MC) statistics in each bin limits the granularity and dimensionality of the binning scheme. A neural network can be employed to optimize a summary statistic that serves as the input for data analysis, yielding the best possible outcomes. This end-to-end optimized summary statistic allows for the inclusion of more observables while maintaining adequate MC statistics per bin. This work will detail the application of end-to-end optimized summary statistics in analyzing and characterizing the galactic neutrino flux, achieving improved resolution in the likelihood contours for selected signal parameters and models.

 - **Abstract**
 The dehydrogenated cation of methylated benzene is known to exist in two isomeric forms: benzylium and tropylium. Structurally similar forms have been proposed for the -H cations of methylated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, but their spectroscopic characterization remains limited, and their photophysical properties are still poorly understood. Previous studies identified 2-naphthylmethylium and benzyltropylium as specific long-lived isomers of the -H fragment of methylnaphthalene cations. Here, we investigate the photodissociation spectroscopy and photoprocessing of gas-phase C$_{11}$H$_9^+$ ions in the visible range. Experiments are conducted using the versatile laboratory astrophysics setup PIRENEA, which enables studies over long timescales ($\sim$1000 s) and allows photoprocessing to be combined with ion-molecule reaction experiments. We confirm the presence of 2-naphthylmethylium and benzyltropylium and additionally identify 1-naphthylmethylium, previously undetected in experiments. Moreover, we present the first complete quantitative analysis of the relative abundances of these isomers and provide clear evidence of interconversion among the three long-lived species. These isomerization processes occur below the dissociation threshold, a finding supported by molecular dynamics simulations. The photophysical properties of C$_{11}$H$_9^+$ isomers -- including isomerization and fluorescence -- make them intriguing candidates for consideration in astrophysical environments exposed to mild UV irradiation (h$\nu$ < 7 eV). Moreover, their detection via rotational spectroscopy in such regions is facilitated by their closed-shell electronic structure.

 - **Abstract**
 Models of astrophysical convection, such as mixing length theory, typically assume that the heat transport is independent of microphysical diffusivities. Such 'diffusion-free' behaviour is, however, not observed in numerical simulations employing standard fixed-flux or fixed-temperature boundary conditions, except possibly in extreme parameter regimes that are computationally expensive to achieve. Recent numerical and experimental work has suggested that internally heated and cooled convection can exhibit diffusion-free scalings in more numerically accessible regimes. Here, we present direct numerical simulations of 2.5D Cartesian rotating thermal convection driven by an internal heating and cooling function. The use of distributed heating and cooling functions alleviates sharp thermal boundary layers that would otherwise be present, allowing the flows to be simulated with modest computational resources. We show that for high Rossby numbers this set-up recovers mixing length theory scalings for the heat transport. The velocity amplitudes, in contrast, are observed to display diffusion-limited scalings. By comparing against boundary driven rotating convection, we show that internally heated cases have a larger fraction of their thermal dissipation occuring in the bulk of the fluid. We suggest this is connected to the increased convective efficiency observed in these cases. Our results indicate that 2.5D internally heated convection can be used as a computationally inexpensive test-bed to investigate some aspects of diffusion-free heat transport.

          Planet-disc interactions around eccentric binaries and misaligned ring formation

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the evolution of a giant planet that interacts with a circumbinary disc that orbits a misaligned binary by means of analytic models and hydrodynamical simulations. Planet-disc interactions lead to mutual tilt oscillations between the planet and the disc. Even if circumbinary gas discs form with an isotropic mutual misalignment to the binary, planet-disc interactions can cause giant planets to evolve towards coplanar or polar alignment. For a low-mass disc, the binary dominates the dynamical evolution of the planet leading to a wide range of circumbinary planet inclinations. For a high-mass disc, the disc dominates the dynamical evolution of the planet and planet inclinations move towards coplanar or polar alignment to the binary orbit, depending upon the initial disc inclination and the binary eccentricity. In addition, for a high-mass disc ($\sim 50\, M_{\rm p}$) and a high initial disc inclination, the planet can undergo Kozai-Lidov oscillations that can result in the planet being ejected from the system. For initially highly misaligned systems, the non-coplanarity of the planet and the disc can lead to long-lived inner misaligned disc rings that can become highly eccentric.

 - **Abstract**
 The Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND) aims to detect radio signals from extensive air showers (EAS) caused by ultra-high-energy (UHE) cosmic particles. Galactic, hardware-like, and anthropogenic noise are expected to contaminate these signals. To address this problem, we propose training a supervised convolutional network known as an encoder-decoder. This network is used to learn a coded representation of the data and remove specific features from it. This denoiser is trained using high-fidelity air shower simulations specifically tailored to replicate the characteristics of signals detected by GRAND. In this contribution, we describe our machine-learning model and report initial results demonstrating the sensitivity enhancement resulting from our denoising algorithm when applied to realistically simulated GRAND signals with varying signal-to-noise ratios.

          TNO colours provide new evidence for a past close flyby of another star to the Solar System

 - **Abstract**
 Thousands of small bodies, known as trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs), orbit the Sun beyond Neptune. TNOs are remnants of the planets' formation from a disc of gas and dust, so it is puzzling that they move mostly on eccentric orbits inclined to the planetary plane and show a complex red-to-grey colour distribution. A close stellar flyby can account for the TNOs' dynamics, but it is unclear if this can also explain the correlation between their colours and orbital characteristics. Assuming an initial red-to-grey colour gradient in the disc, our numerical study finds that the spiral arms induced by the stellar flyby simultaneously lead to the observed TNOs' colour patterns and orbital dynamics. The combined explanation of these TNO properties strengthens the evidence for a close flyby of another star to the young Solar System. Our study predicts that (1) small TNOs beyond 60 au will mostly be grey, and (2) retrograde TNOs will lack the colour most common to high-inclination TNOs. The anticipated TNO discoveries by the Vera Rubin telescope will be able to test these predictions. A confirmed flyby would allow us to reveal the chemical composition of the Solar System's primordial disc.

 - **Abstract**
 GRANDProto300 (GP300) is a prototype array of the GRAND experiment, designed to validate the technique of autonomous radio-detection of astroparticles by detecting cosmic rays with energies between 10$^{17}$-10$^{18.5}$ eV. This observation will further enable the study of the Galactic-to-extragalactic source transition region. Since November 2024, 46 out of 300 antennas have been operational and collecting data stably. We present our cosmic-ray search pipeline, which involves several filtering steps: (1) coincidence search for signals triggering multiple antennas within a time window, (2) directional reconstruction of events, (3) exclusion of clustered (in time and space) noise events, (4) polarization cut, (5) selection based on the size of the footprint, and (6) other more arbitrary cuts in this preliminary stage, including visual cuts. The efficiency of the pipeline is evaluated and applied to the first batch of data, yielding a set of cosmic-ray candidate events, which we present.

          Effects of Lorentz invariance violation on particle and photon production in astrophysical sources

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the impact of Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) on radiation processes in astrophysical sources, focusing on synchrotron and inverse Compton interactions. We derive modified expressions for radiated power and photon energy under LIV assumptions and incorporate them into first-order Fermi acceleration models. Our analysis reveals energy thresholds beyond which LIV significantly alters particle dynamics and photon spectra, introducing non-physical divergences that highlight limitations in perturbative approaches. We model synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) emission in the presence of LIV and assess its consequences for photon fluxes from blazars, including Markarian 501 and the BL Lac population. LIV introduces distinct high-energy emission regions that deviate from standard expectations. Comparisons with observational data, particularly upper limits from the Pierre Auger Observatory, suggest that future multi-messenger observations could constrain LIV parameters through the non-detection of such excesses.

 - **Abstract**
 We present new UBV photometric observations (2009-2024) of the carbon-rich post-AGB star IRAS 22272+5435 (V354 Lac), combined with our data spanning over 30 years (1991-2024). The star shows pulsations with two closely spaced periods, 127 and 132 d, which cause brightness variations of variable amplitude. We also detect low-amplitude oscillations with a 661-day period, of uncertain origin. Color analysis reveals both temperature variations during pulsations and spectral anomalies. For the first time, we analyze long-term JHKLM photometry (1994-2024), showing increased KLM-band brightness from 1996 to 2004 - likely due to dust emission following a sudden mass ejection. The absence of strong optical variability suggests either a large angle between the ejection direction and the line of sight or a low optical depth of the ejected material. We discuss possible mechanisms and observational signatures of this dust-formation event.

 - **Abstract**
 Recently, IceCube has observed an excess of astrophysical neutrinos from the Galactic plane. Such a signal may indicate the presence of individual sources or a diffuse neutrino flux from the interactions of Galactic, hadronic cosmic rays. We consider the prospect of neutrino production in galactic X-ray binary systems. A model for neutrino production in the variable jets of these systems is discussed, and how such information may be incorporated within searches for astrophysical neutrinos from these sources. Two ongoing studies are presented on behalf of the IceCube Collaboration using 13 years of cascades and track-like events. In the first study, recently published model predictions are used to motivate the analysis of five selected black-hole X-ray binaries. Gamma-ray data from Fermi-LAT, as well as X-ray data from Swift/BAT and MAXI are used to search for temporal correlations between radiative cycles of the disk-jet system and potential neutrino emission. In the second study, a wider selection of variable X-ray binaries and their Swift/BAT light curves is considered and a stacking search is used to constrain the contribution of this source population to the Galactic neutrino flux.

          The Bispectrum of Intrinsic Alignments: II. Precision Comparison Against Dark Matter Simulations

 - **Abstract**
 We measure three-dimensional bispectra of halo intrinsic alignments (IA) and dark matter overdensities in real space from N-body simulations for halos of mass $10^{12}-10^{12.5} M_\odot /h$. We show that their multipoles with respect to the line of sight can be accurately described by a tree-level perturbation theory model on large scales ($k\lesssim 0.11\,h$/Mpc) at $z=0$. For these scales and in a simulation volume of 1 Gpc/$h$, we detect the bispectrum monopole $B_{\delta\delta E}^{00}$ at $\sim 30\sigma$ and the two quadrupoles $B_{\delta \delta E}^{11}$ and $B_{\delta \delta E}^{20}$ at $\sim 25\sigma$ and $\sim 15\sigma$, respectively. We also report similar detection significances for the lowest order multipoles of $B_{\delta EE}$ and $B_{EEE}$, although these are largely driven by stochastic contributions. We show that the first and second order EFT parameters are consistent with those obtained from fitting the IA power spectrum analysis at next-to-leading order, without requiring any priors to break degeneracies for the quadratic bias parameters. Moreover, the inclusion of higher multipole moments of $B_{\delta\delta E}$ greatly reduces the errors on second order bias parameters, by factors of 5 or more. The IA bispectrum thus provides an effective means of determining higher order shape bias parameters, thereby characterizing the scale dependence of the IA signal. We also detect parity-odd bispectra such as $B_{\delta \delta B}$ and $B_{\delta EB}$ at $\sim 10 \sigma$ significance or more for $k<0.15\,h$/Mpc and they are fully consistent with the parity-even sector. Furthermore, we check that the Gaussian covariance approximation works reasonably well on the scales we consider here. These results lay the groundwork for using the bispectrum of IA in cosmological analyses.

 - **Abstract**
 Astrophysical neutrinos provide crucial insights into their sources and play a key role in multi-messenger astronomy. The neutrino flavor composition at Earth allows us to probe the mechanisms of neutrino production and cosmic ray acceleration, as well as the properties of the environments in which they originate. Understanding the flavor composition also offers a unique opportunity to test new physics in the neutrino sector. The IceCube Neutrino Observatory consists of 1 km$^3$ of ice instrumented with photomultipliers that detect neutrinos through Cherenkov radiation from their interaction products. Different neutrino interactions result in distinct event topologies, such as tracks, cascades, and double cascade events, which allow for the identification of the interacting neutrino type and measurement of the flavor composition of the astrophysical neutrino flux. In this contribution we present the results of the measurement of the flavor ratio of the High-Energy Starting Event Selection based on 12 years of data, a high-purity sample of neutrino interactions that occur inside the detector. In addition, we discuss various methods that could further improve the analysis in the future.

          Measuring cosmic baryon density with FRB and GW data

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/
 - **Abstract**
 The dispersion measure (DM) analysis of extragalactic fast radio bursts (FRBs) has accounted for all cosmic baryons but remains limited by systematic uncertainties from various parameter degeneracies. We show that the prominent degeneracy between the baryon density ($\Omega_{\rm b}$) and the Hubble constant ($H_0$) can be disentangled through an independent $H_0$ value uniquely inferred from the absolute luminosity distance measurements of gravitational-wave (GW) standard sirens. By combining $104$ localized FRBs with $47$ GW events, we obtain a robust, late-Universe measurement of \ob $=0.0488\pm0.0064$ ($1\sigma$), in concordance with early-Universe observations of CMB + BBN. Notably, incorporating GW data helps not only avoid biases induced by the $H_0$ tension, but also mitigate those from the parameters of diffuse baryon fraction and DM distribution models. Although the current precision ($\sim 13\%$) is limited by sample size, the growing detections of both FRBs and GWs will make their synergy a powerful probe of low-redshift cosmology.

 - **Abstract**
 Accurate reconstruction of the electric field produced by extensive air showers is essential for the radio-detection technique, as the key parameters of interest of the primary particles that generated the showers are the amplitude, polarization, frequency spectrum, and energy fluence carried by the electric field at each receiving radio antenna. Conventional electric-field reconstruction methods primarily focus on antennas with two horizontal polarizations. In this work, we introduce an analytic $\chi^2$ minimization method that is applicable to both two and three polarizations. This solution has been verified for simple and realistic antenna responses, with a particular focus on inclined air showers. Our method achieves standard deviations better than 4\% and 6\% for the estimation of the Hilbert peak envelope amplitude of the electric field and the energy fluence, respectively, with an antenna-response-dependent bias. Additionally, we have studied the dependence of the method with arrival direction showing that it has a good performance in the zenith range from 63$^\circ$ up to 80$^\circ$. This work also demonstrates that incorporating vertically polarized antennas enhances the precision of the reconstruction, leading to a more accurate and reliable electric-field estimation for inclined air showers.

          History of UHECR production in Centaurus A

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of the UHECR continues to puzzle, however, an excess of detection in the direction of the radio galaxy Centaurus A (Cen A) raises the possibility of this object being the first UHECR source identifiable. Cen A is known to be currently active, and also exhibits known past episodes of high activity. In this work, we investigate whether the known activity episodes in Cen A may be related to the excess events in the \textit{Centaurus region}. Analysing the energy of the events and the overall mass composition of UHECR, we report that an activity in the last $\sim30$ Myr is necessary to explain the excess of events. This period perfectly fits with the timescale where the transition regions and the Giant Lobes must be energized, as revealed by radio and $\gamma$ ray observations.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we derive upper limits on the physical energy-density fraction today of cosmological gravitational waves, denoted by $\Omega_{\rm{gw}}h^{2}$, by combining \emph{Planck} \& ACT \& SPT CMB data with DESI BAO data. In the standard cosmological model, we establish 95\% CL upper limits of $\Omega_{\rm{gw}}h^{2} < 1.0 \times 10^{-6}$ for adiabatic initial conditions and $\Omega_{\rm{gw}}h^{2} < 2.7 \times 10^{-7}$ for homogeneous initial conditions. In light of dynamical dark energy, we get $\Omega_{\rm{gw}}h^{2} < 7.2 \times 10^{-7}$ (adiabatic) and $\Omega_{\rm{gw}}h^{2} < 2.4 \times 10^{-7}$ (homogeneous). We also project the sensitivity achievable with LiteBIRD \& CMB Stage-IV measurements of CMB and CSST observations of BAO, forecasting 68\% CL uncertainties of $\sigma = 2.4 \times 10^{-7}$ (adiabatic) and $\sigma = 0.9 \times 10^{-7}$ (homogeneous) for ${\Omega_{\rm{gw}}h^{2}}$. The constraints provide critical benchmarks for exploring the cosmological origins of gravitational waves within the frequency band $f \gtrsim 10^{-15}$\,Hz and potentially enable joint analysis with direct gravitational-wave detection sensitive to this regime.

          Improvements in the Reconstruction of IceCube Realtime Alerts

 - **Abstract**
 In 2016, the IceCube Neutrino Observatory launched its realtime program. When a neutrino candidate of likely astrophysical origin is detected, a public alert is issued, typically within one minute. These alerts allow the astrophysical community to follow up on the region of the sky where the neutrino likely originated. Initially, the system issued around six track-signature alerts per year, with a highlight being IceCube-170922A, which was later associated with the flaring blazar TXS 0506+056. Since 2019, IceCube has expanded the selection criteria for neutrino candidates, increasing the track alert rate to around 30 per year with additional alerts for cascade signatures of probable astrophysical origin implemented in 2020. This work describes several improvements in the reconstruction of track alerts, which were introduced into the realtime stream in 2024, and details the two algorithms that are alternately used for reconstruction, depending on the reconstructed muon energy. The improvements result in more precise directional localizations, with a factor of 5 (4) reduction in the 50% (90%) contour area. Systematic errors affecting the reconstructions, such as the ice model or the geometry of the detector, have also been investigated to ensure statistical coverage. In addition to its application in the realtime stream, the improvements described here are also being applied to historical alerts with an updated catalog of track alerts forthcoming.

 - **Abstract**
 This study employs well-localized fast radio bursts (FRBs) to constrain cosmological parameters using two model-independent methods: the reconstruction of the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ with an artificial neural network and cosmography. By integrating FRB data with type Ia supernovae (SNe), BAO from DESI DR2, and cosmic chronometers (CC), we derive constraints on the Hubble constant ($H_0$), deceleration parameter ($q_0$), and jerk parameter ($j_0$). For the reconstruction method, our MCMC analysis with FRB-only provides $H_0 = 69.9 \pm 5.8 \, \text{km} \, \text{s}^{-1} \, \text{Mpc}^{-1}$, corresponding to a precision of $\sim 8\%$. A joint analysis with FRB+SNe+DESI gives $H_0 = 68.85_{-0.48}^{+0.47} \, \text{km} \, \text{s}^{-1} \, \text{Mpc}^{-1}$, reaching a precision below 1\%. The cosmographic approach with FRBs alone provides $H_0 = 65.83_{-4.87}^{+3.77} \, \text{km} \, \text{s}^{-1} \, \text{Mpc}^{-1}$, $q_0 = -0.45_{-0.31}^{+0.26}$, and $j_0 = 1.17_{-0.58}^{+0.70}$ with a precision for the Hubble constant of $\sim 6\%$. Besides, the DESI DR2 dataset yields $H_0 = 65.20_{-1.28}^{+1.29} \, \text{km} \, \text{s}^{-1} \, \text{Mpc}^{-1}$, $q_0 = -0.29\pm 0.07$, and $j_0 = 0.58_{-0.04}^{+0.03}$, indicating an accuracy of $\sim 2\%$ for the Hubble constant. Combining the FRB, SNe, DESI, and CC datasets provide tighter constraints, e.g., $H_0 = 67.88_{-0.53}^{+0.52} \, \text{km} \, \text{s}^{-1} \, \text{Mpc}^{-1}$, $q_0 = -0.42_{-0.03}^{+0.02}$, and $j_0 = 0.56 \pm 0.02$. Notably, these findings provide a statistically significant indication of deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM prediction of $j_0 = 1$, suggesting possible departures from standard cosmology at a $1\sigma$ confidence level. They also confirm a model-independent accelerated expansion ($q_0 < 0$), demonstrating the potential of FRBs as valuable cosmological probes.

 The Sloan Digital Sky Survey-V (SDSS-V) is pioneering panoptic spectroscopy: it is the first all-sky, multi-epoch, optical-to-infrared spectroscopic survey. SDSS-V is mapping the sky with multi-object spectroscopy (MOS) at telescopes in both hemispheres (the 2.5-m Sloan Foundation Telescope at Apache Point Observatory and the 100-inch du Pont Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory), where 500 zonal robotic fiber positioners feed light from a wide-field focal plane to an optical (R$\sim 2000$, 500 fibers) and a near-infrared (R$\sim 22,000$, 300 fibers) spectrograph. In addition to these MOS capabilities, the survey is pioneering ultra wide-field ($\sim$ 4000~deg$^2$) integral field spectroscopy enabled by a new dedicated facility (LVM-I) at Las Campanas Observatory, where an integral field spectrograph (IFS) with 1801 lenslet-coupled fibers arranged in a 0.5 degree diameter hexagon feeds multiple R$\sim$4000 optical spectrographs that cover 3600-9800 angstroms. SDSS-V's hardware and multi-year survey strategy are designed to decode the chemo-dynamical history of the Milky Way Galaxy and tackle fundamental open issues in stellar physics in its Milky Way Mapper program, trace the growth physics of supermassive black holes in its Black Hole Mapper program, and understand the self-regulation mechanisms and the chemical enrichment of galactic ecosystems at the energy-injection scale in its Local Volume Mapper program. The survey is well-timed to multiply the scientific output from major all-sky space missions. The SDSS-V MOS programs began robotic operations in 2021; IFS observations began in 2023 with the completion of the LVM-I facility. SDSS-V builds upon decades of heritage of SDSS's pioneering advances in data analysis, collaboration spirit, infrastructure, and product deliverables in astronomy.

          Very Late Afterpulses and Search for the Neutron Echo in IceCube

 - **Abstract**
 While high-energy astrophysical neutrinos are well-established, their flavor composition remains relatively unconstrained. In IceCube, long muon tracks from $\nu_\mu$ charged-current interactions are easily identified but the detector geometry does not allow sufficient resolution to distinguish cascade-type events. The Neutron Echo - a delayed light signal in the detector from neutron capture and de-excitation - can probe the shower's hadronic content and thus the underlying interaction. A significant background arises from late PMT afterpulses, which are temporally coincident with the physics signal. The traditional IceCube data acquisition system has a limited readout window with significant deadtime between triggers, which is insufficient to capture the late pulses. A recently developed deadtime-free readout mode, with an extended window, enables their detection. An observed excess in the delayed time spectrum over the background would be compatible with the Neutron Echo hypothesis. In this contribution, we summarize the physics scope of delayed signals, discuss the timing spectrum of signal and PMT background, highlight the capabilities of the new system for recording late pulses, and emphasize the potential of IceCube for particle identification through delayed signals.

          Influence of interstellar environment near the solar system on cosmic-ray spectra and dipole anisotropy

 - **Abstract**
 Properties of interstellar environment near the solar system have been probed by missions like IBEX, Voyager over the last two decades. Although it has been well recognized that properties of cosmic rays up to the PeV energy can be affected by the local interstellar environment, detailed modeling has not been done. We show that a three component model for the cosmic ray proton and helium spectra from GV to several PV can naturally explain the energy dependence of the dipole anisotropy of cosmic ray fluxes by considering effects of the local interstellar environment on cosmic ray transport, addressing the so-called cosmic ray anisotropy problem. In particular, it is shown that the dipole amplitude and position angle below $\sim 100$ TeV are very sensitive to the velocity of the heliosphere in the local interstellar cloud and the motion of the local interstellar cloud in the local standard of rest. Better measurement of cosmic ray flux anisotropy by experiments like LHAASO and properties of the local interstellar environment by future missions like IMAP will be able to test this model.

          Impact of Hole-ice Calibration on High Energy Event Reconstruction with the IceCube Upgrade

 - **Abstract**
 The IceCube Upgrade, currently under construction at the geographic South Pole, is the next development stage of the IceCube detector. It will consist of seven new columns of novel optical sensors and advanced calibration devices densely deployed at the centre of the existing array. The sensors are frozen into the ice in boreholes created by hot water drilling. The refreezing forms hole ice around modules with optical properties that differ from the surrounding glacial ice. A key objective of the IceCube Upgrade is to enhance our understanding of the optical properties of both bulk ice and refrozen hole ice. Precise ice modelling is crucial for the directional reconstruction of TeV-PeV neutrinos, as resolutions at such high energies can be strongly impacted by uncertainties in ice properties and optical sensor response. An improved directional reconstruction performance will translate to a boost in neutrino source sensitivities using IceCube data collected over the last 12 years. In this contribution, we present the expected improvements in reconstruction performance resulting from advances in hole-ice modelling and the resulting impact on IceCube's sensitivity to astrophysical neutrino sources across three distinct event samples.

          All-Sky Cosmic-Ray Anisotropy Update at Multiple Energies

 - **Abstract**
 We present preliminary results on an updated full-sky analysis of the cosmic-ray arrival direction distribution with data collected by the High-Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) Observatory and IceCube Neutrino Observatory with complementary field of views covering a large fraction of the sky. This study extends the energy range to higher energies. The HAWC Observatory, located at 19$^{\circ}$N has analyzed 8 years of cosmic-ray data over an energy range between 3.0 TeV and 1.0 PeV and confirms an energy-dependent anisotropy in the arrival direction distribution of cosmic rays seen by other experiments. Combined with recently published results from IceCube with 12 years of data, the combined sky maps with 93\% coverage of the sky -- between 70$^{\circ}$N and 90$^{\circ}$S -- and the corresponding angular power spectra largely eliminate biases that result from partial sky coverage.

          The cosmic-ray sea explains the Galactic $γ$-ray and $ν$ diffuse emissions from GeV to PeV

 - **Abstract**
 The LHAASO collaboration has recently released the spectrum and the angular distribution of the gamma-ray Galactic diffuse emission from 1 TeV to 1 PeV measured with the Kilometer-2 Array (KM2A) and the Water Cherenkov Detector Array (WCDA). We show that those data are in remarkably good agreement with a set of pre-existing models that assume the emission to be produced by the Galactic population of cosmic rays if its spectral shape traces that measured by CALET, DAMPE as well as KASCADE at higher energies. No extra-components besides the CR sea is needed to explain LHAASO results. Spatial dependent CR transport models, although not required to reproduce LHAASO results, are in better agreement with them respect to conventional ones and needed to consistently reproduce Fermi-LAT and neutrino data.

          Ray-tracing Fast Radio Bursts Through IllustrisTNG: Cosmological Dispersion Measures from Redshift 0 to 5.5

 - **Abstract**
 The dispersion measures (DMs) of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) arise predominantly from free electrons in the large-scale structure of the Universe. The increasing number of FRB observations have started to empirically constrain the distribution of cosmic baryons, making it crucial to accurately forward model their propagation within cosmological simulations. In this work, we present a method for measuring FRB DMs in IllustrisTNG that continuously traces rays through the simulation while reconstructing all traversed line segments within the underlying Voronoi mesh. Leveraging this technique, we create over $20$ publicly available DM catalogs, including a full-sky DM map observed from a Milky Way-like environment. Our method addresses a problem in previous TNG-based studies, in which a sparse snapshot sampling in the path integral leads to a misestimation of the standard deviation and higher moments of the DM distribution $p(\rm{DM}|z)$ by over $50\%$. We show that our results are consistent with the most recent observational data from the DSA-110, ASKAP, and CHIME. We offer a functional form for $p(\rm{DM}| z)$ that provides very good fits across all redshifts from $0$ to $5.5$, showing that the previously proposed log-normal distribution is not well matched to the data. We find that using simulation box sizes smaller than $35\,h^{-1}\,$Mpc or resolutions with baryonic masses of less than $5\times10^{8}\,h^{-1}\,M_{\odot}$ can distort the derived DM signal by more than $8\%$. Our findings provide new insights into how the cosmic web shapes FRB signals, and highlight the importance of accurate methodology when comparing cosmological simulations against observations.

          Search for GeV-PeV neutrinos from nova T Coronae Borealis with IceCube

 - **Abstract**
 The widely anticipated outburst of recurrent nova T Coronae Borealis (T CrB), which is near the end of its 80-year cycle, provides an excellent opportunity to search for neutrinos from novae. Novae are an energetic class of transients, which have been studied for hundreds of years. Because many of them are located nearby, novae provide an excellent astrophysical laboratory to study shock-powered emission in our own backyard. Several recent novae have previously been detected in GeV gamma rays, and the 2021 outburst of RS Ophiuchi was detected up to TeV energies, with evidence for a hadronic origin of the observed emission. Previous searches for GeV-TeV neutrinos from novae, predicted to occur alongside their gamma-ray emission, have been performed using data from the IceCube Neutrino Observatory. However, no significant neutrino signals from novae have yet been observed. We present plans for follow-up of T CrB in real time with IceCube, using datasets spanning GeV to PeV neutrino energies. Due to its closer distance and higher optical flux, which has been well measured in two historical eruptions, the expected neutrino signal from T CrB is several times stronger than that from RS Ophiuchi. Furthermore, T CrB is located in the Northern sky at a declination where IceCube's sensitivity is an additional factor of a few better than at the location of RS Ophiuchi, which is beneficial to this search.

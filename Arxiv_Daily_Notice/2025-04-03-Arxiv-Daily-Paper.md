          The Remarkable Late-Time Flux Excess in Hubble Space Telescope Observations of the Type Iax Supernova 2012Z

 - **Abstract**
 Type Iax supernovae (SNe Iax) are thermonuclear explosions of white dwarfs, peculiar and underluminous compared to the normal type Ia supernovae. Observations of SNe Iax provide insight into the physics of white-dwarf explosions and suggest that some may not be terminal events. Late-time photometry ($\sim$1400 days post-peak) of the type Iax SN 2012Z, the only white dwarf supernova with a pre-explosion detection of a progenitor system, revealed a flux excess that may be explained by a gravitationally bound remnant driving a radioactively powered wind. We present further late-time Hubble Space Telescope photometry of SN 2012Z, $\sim$2500 days after the explosion, and find that the SN is still brighter than, but trending towards, the pre-explosion flux. Additionally, we observe that the excess F555W flux seen in previous data has grown more pronounced. The color of the excess flux disfavors a light echo or interaction with the circumstellar material. The decline rate of the excess flux is consistent with energy deposition from $^{55}$Fe, but the luminosity is higher than expected from models of the ejecta, further suggesting evidence for a bound remnant. Combining our data with future observations should allow for the detection of emission from the ejecta shock-heating of the companion helium star seen in the progenitor system.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The Coronagraphic Instrument (CGI) on the Roman Space Telescope aims for unprecedented contrast for direct imaging of exoplanets, serving as a critical tech demo for future missions like the Habitable Worlds Observatory. This requires advanced wavefront sensing and control (WFS&C), including pair-wise (PW) probing for electric field estimation in the focal plane. Optimizing PW probe designs is vital to enhance performance and reduce overheads. Aims. We investigate different probe designs for PW probing in the context of Roman CGI. We compare classic sinc-sinc-sine probes, previously introduced single-actuator probes, and newly proposed sharp sinc probes in terms of effectiveness in focal-plane modulation, resilience to non-linearities, and overall impact on convergence and contrast. Methods. We conducted experiments on the THD2 testbed, configured to emulate Roman CGI with a custom Hybrid Lyot Coronagraph. We evaluated the three probe designs through WFS&C experiments using PW probing for estimation and electric field conjugation for wavefront correction. Simulations and hardware tests assessed contrast convergence and the impact of non-linear terms at varying probe amplitudes. We also explored low-flux scenarios to demonstrate the use of high-amplitude probes in reducing exposure times or closing the loop on faint targets. Results. Single-actuator probes emerged as the most effective, with faster convergence and reduced non-linear effects at high amplitudes. Sharp sinc probes performed moderately well but were less robust than single actuators. High-amplitude single-actuator probes showed advantages in dark-hole digging under low-flux, through faster iterations without significant degradation in contrast. The THD2 testbed, operating at contrasts analogous to Roman CGI, validated our results and underscored its role as a critical platform for advancing WFS&C techniques.

 - **Abstract**
 Bootstrap techniques relying on the constraints imposed by Extended Galilean Invariance (EGI), have proved to be very useful in the context of perturbation theory of the Large Scale Structure (LSS). It has been formulated in both the Eulerian as well as Lagrangian space. While the Eulerian bootstrap formalism has been successfully applied to both tracer and matter kernels, the application of bootstrap methods in Lagrangian space has so far been restricted to matter. Up to third order, it has been shown that implementing EGI constraints in Eulerian space fully reproduces the bias expansion for tracers. Previous studies have demonstrated that time non-locality affects the bias expansion in a non-trivial way starting from fifth order. Motivated by this fact, we extend the bootstrap approach upto fifth order in both Eulerian and Lagrangian space and demonstrate that it fully captures the time non-local effects. For this, we generalize the Lagrangian bootstrap for tracers, and found that it agrees with the corresponding results obtained in Eulerian space. One of the major challenges in implementing EGI constraints in Eulerian space, is to systematically find out all the "spurious poles" and make them vanish. We have proposed a method that bypasses this difficulty making the procedure tractable at higher orders. From Lagrangian perspective, we have identified coefficients in the tracer kernel whose ratios are independent of tracer properties and may serve as direct probes of the underlying cosmology.

 - **Abstract**
 Organosulfur species are potential major carriers of sulfur in the interstellar medium, as well as interesting ingredients in prebiotic chemistry. The most fundamental question regarding these species is under which conditions they reside in the gas versus solid phase. Here, we characterize the thermal desorption kinetics, binding energies, and entrapment of the organosulfur methyl mercaptan (CH$_3$SH, or MeSH) in different ice environments, comparing them with those of methanol (CH$_3$OH, or MeOH) ices. The derived multi-layer (pure MeSH-MeSH) and sub-monolayer (layered MeSH-H$_2$O) binding energies are surprisingly similar, corresponding to snow line locations where the disk midplane temperature is ~105 K. In both H$_2$O-dominated and more realistic H$_2$O:CO$_2$-dominated ices, 100% of the MeSH is entrapped, almost exclusively desorbing at the molecular volcano desorption peak, indicating that MeSH is retained at the water snow line if initially mixed with water ice during formation. Additionally, the presence of MeSH in an ice mixture enhances the entrapment of CO$_2$ and MeOH (up to 100%) until the onset of volcano desorption; without MeSH, both desorb at their respective pure desorption temperatures and also co-desorb with water. Compared to MeOH, MeSH binds less well to water, explaining why MeSH escapes during water ice crystallization rather than co-desorbing with water. These results show the larger relative size of MeSH compared to MeOH significantly impacts its ability to bind to water and its entrapment efficiency. Therefore, molecular size plays an important role in the adsorption and retention of S-bearing organics and, in turn, other volatiles in ices.

 - **Abstract**
 Eclipsing binary stars with Delta Scuti components are exceptional systems for gaining a deeper understanding of stellar systems. WY Leo is one such system, exhibiting Delta Scuti-type oscillations. However, it has not been extensively studied in the literature. WY Leo was observed by Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), providing two sectors of high-quality photometric data. This study focuses on the photometric analysis of WY Leo. Binary modeling was performed, and the system's fundamental stellar parameters, such as mass and radius, were determined. The pulsational properties of WY Leo were also investigated, revealing that the more luminous star exhibits Delta Scuti type oscillations with a period of 0.052 days. The position of the primary component was examined on the HR diagram, and it was found to lie within the Delta Scuti instability strip.

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxy groups are essential for studying the distribution of matter on a large scale in redshift surveys and for deciphering the link between galaxy traits and their associated halos. In this work, we propose a widely applicable method for identifying groups through machine learning techniques in real space taking into account the impact of redshift distortion. Our methodology involves two neural networks: one is a classification model for identifying central galaxy groups, and the other is a regression model for predicting the mass of these groups. Both models input observable galaxy traits, allowing future applicability to real survey data. Testing on simulated datasets indicates our method accurately identifies over $92\%$ of groups with $\mathrm{M}_{vir} \geq 10^{11}h^{-1}\mathrm{M}_\odot$, with $80\%$ achieving a membership completeness of at least $80\%$. The predicted group masses vary by less than 0.3 dex across different mass scales, even in the absence of a priori data. Our network adapts seamlessly to expand to sparse samples with a flux limit of $m_{r} < 14$, to high redshift samples at $z=1.08$, and to galaxy samples from the TNG300 hydrodynamical simulation without further training. Furthermore, the framework can easily adjust to real surveys by training on redshift distorted samples without needing parameter changes. Careful consideration of different observational effects in redshift space makes it promising that this method will be applicable to real galaxy surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 Astronomy, a captivating field that draws upon science, mathematics, and engineering, has traditionally relied on visual representations to convey the wonders of the cosmos. While this approach effectively engages the sighted population, the use of imagery can exclude individuals with blindness or visual impairment (B/VI). Astronomical research is incorporated into press releases, media, outreach efforts, and educational systems aimed at enhancing public interest and often skill in science, but visual materials can hamper a population with B/VI. This paper explores the potential of 3D printing as an assistive technology providing an alternative to imagery. We produced textured 3D prints of astronomical research data from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). Useability assessment of materials is an important phase of production before integration into structured programs, and we used a multi-phased approach in our prior research to create and test appropriate textures for 3D astronomical prints. This paper describes the last step of reviewing our 3D prints through informal useability sessions with diverse individuals. The assessment indicated our 3D prints provide reliable, informative representations of astronomical data appropriate for public use especially for public information, outreach programs, and science education for individuals with BVI.

          The Receding Cosmic Shoreline of Mid-to-Late M Dwarfs: Measurements of Active Lifetimes Worsen Challenges for Atmosphere Retention by Rocky Exoplanets

 - **Abstract**
 Detecting and characterizing the atmospheres of terrestrial exoplanets is a key goal of exoplanetary astronomy, one that may now be within reach given the upcoming campaign to conduct a large-scale survey of rocky M-dwarf worlds with the James Webb Space Telescope. It is imperative that we understand where known planets sit relative to the cosmic shoreline, the boundary between planets that have retained atmospheres and those that have not. Previous works modeled the historic XUV radiation received by mid-to-late M-dwarf planets using a scaling relation calibrated using more massive stars, but fully convective M dwarfs display unique rotation/activity histories that differ from Sun-like stars and early M dwarfs. We synthesize observations of the active lifetimes of mid-to-late M dwarfs to present an updated estimate of their historic XUV fluence. For known planets of inactive, mid-to-late M dwarfs, we calculate a historic XUV fluence that is 2.1-3.1 times the canonical XUV scaling relation on average, with the larger value including corrections for the pre-main-sequence phase and energetic flares. We find that only the largest terrestrial planets known to orbit mid-to-late M-dwarfs are likely to have retained atmospheres within the cosmic shoreline paradigm. Our calculations may help to guide the selection of targets for JWST and may prove useful in interpreting the results; to this end, we define a novel Atmosphere Retention Metric (ARM) that indicates the distance between a planet and the cosmic shoreline, and tabulate the ARM for known mid-to-late M-dwarf planets.

 - **Abstract**
 The planetary nebula NGC 6720, also known as the ``Ring Nebula", is one of the most iconic examples of nearby planetary nebulae whose morphologies present a challenge to our theoretical understanding of the processes that govern the deaths of most stars in the Universe that evolve on a Hubble time. We present new imaging with JWST of the central star of this planetary nebula (CSPN) and its close vicinity, in the near- to mid-IR wavelength range. We find the presence of a dust cloud around the CSPN, both from the spectral energy distribution at wavelengths >~5 micron, as well as radially-extended emission in the 7.7, 10 and 11.3 micron images. From modeling of these data, we infer that the CSPN has a luminosity of 310 Lsun and is surrounded by a dust cloud with a size of ~2600 au, consisting of relatively small amorphous silicate dust grains (radius ~0.01 micron) with a total mass of 1.9 x 10^(-6) M_earth. However, our best-fit model shows a significant lack of extended emission at 7.7 micron -- we show that such emission can arise from a smaller (7.3 x 10^(-7) M_earth) but uncertain mass of (stochastically-heated) ionized PAHs. However, the same energetic radiation also rapidly destroys PAH molecules, suggesting that these are most likely being continuously replenished, via the outgassing of cometary bodies and/or the collisional grinding of planetesimals. We also find significant photometric variability of the central source that could be due to the presence of a close dwarf companion of mass < ~0.1 Msun.

          Planets in Globular Clusters?

 - **Abstract**
 The discovery of planets around PSR~1257+12 suggests that planetary systems may be detected around the recycled pulsars found in globular clusters. Planetary systems in dense clusters have lifetimes to disruption due to perturbations by passing stars comparable to or shorter than the pulsar lifetime, and observations of planets in the cores of clusters may reveal planetary systems formally dynamically unstable on time scales short compared to the characteristic age, $\tau_c$, of the system. Planets formed around cluster pulsars will most likely be restricted to semi--major axis of $\sim 0.1-1.0\, AU$, while "scavenged" planets may be observed in wider orbits, with no stable systems expected in the densest clusters. Observation is most probable in the cluster rich high--density pre-core collapse clusters such as 47Tuc. Detection of planets around cluster pulsars can constrain planet formation mechanisms, in particular the effects of low metallicity on planet formation in disks.

 - **Abstract**
 Studying the atomic-to-molecular transition is essential for understanding the evolution of interstellar medium. The linear edge of Taurus molecular cloud, clearly identified in the $^{13}$CO(1-0) intensity map, serves as an ideal site for investigating this transition. Utilizing the Arizona Radio Observatory Sub-Millimeter Telescope, we obtained mapping observations of CO(2-1), $^{13}$CO(2-1), and CO(3-2) across this linear edge. The intensity ratio between CO(2-1) and $^{13}$CO(2-1) indicates a lower limit of the $^{12}C/^{13}C$ ratio of $54\pm 17$. Based on multi-transition observations of CO and $^{13}$CO, we performed Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) fit of the physical properties across this edge using non-Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium analysis with the RADEX code, based on the Large velocity Gradient (LVG) assumption. The number density profile exhibits a pronounced jump coinciding with the H$_2$ infrared emission peak. The cold HI gas within the molecular cloud, manifested as HI-Narrow Self-Absorption (HINSA) features, is detected along the cloud edge. Our quantitative comparison with numerical simulations provides tentative evidence that shocks induced by colliding gas flows may contribute to the atomic-to-molecular phase transition observed along the linear edge.

          Demonstration of Plate Analysis, an algorithm for precise relative astrometry

 - **Abstract**
 Astrometry plays a crucial role in understanding the structure, dynamics, and evolution of celestial objects by providing precise measurements of their positions and motions. We propose a new approach to wide-field, relative astrometry, Plate Analysis. Plate Analysis is an innovative algorithm that estimates stellar coordinates and corrects geometric distortion based on precise reference sources, without relying on dedicated calibration fields. It is implemented as a probabilistic framework using Stochastic Variational Inference to efficiently optimize the numerous parameters involved in the model. The methodology was tested through a simplified simulation designed after the Galactic center survey of the JASMINE mission. This simulation, called the JASMINE mini-mock survey, covered three years of observation with 100 satellite orbits, providing a comprehensive dataset for evaluating the performance of Plate Analysis. Although the observation model incorporated more than 30,000 parameters, the parameters were efficiently optimized through Plate Analysis. The results showed that the estimated coordinates closely match the expected stellar motions, with an average positional error of about $70\,\mathrm{\mu as}$. These findings validate the potential of Plate Analysis for precise wide-field astrometric applications, offering significant insights into improving the accuracy of stellar dynamics measurements.

 - **Abstract**
 The nature of progenitors of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) and their explosion mechanism remain unclear. It has been suggested that SNe Ia may be resulted from thermonuclear explosions of hybrid carbon-oxygen-neon white dwarfs(CONe WDs) when they grow in mass to approach the Chandrasekhar mass limit by accreting matter from a binary main-sequence (MS) companion. In this work, we combine the results of detailed binary evolution calculations with population synthesis models to investigate the rates and delay times of SNe Ia in the CONe WD + MS channel at low metallicity environment of Z = 0.0001. For a constant star formation rate of 5 M_sun yr-1, our calculations predict that the SN Ia rates in the CONe WD + MS channel at low metallicity of Z = 0.0001 is about 0.11 - 3.89 * 10-4 yr-1. In addition,delay times in this channel cover a wide range of 0.05 - 2.5 Gyr. We further compare our results to those given by previous study for the CONe WD + MS channel with higher metallicity of Z = 0.02 to explore the influence of metallicity on the results. We find that these two metallicity environments give a slight difference in rates and delay times of SNe Ia from the CONe WD + MS channel, although SNe Ia produced at low metallicity environment of Z = 0.0001 have relatively longer delay times.

 - **Abstract**
 In various types of supernovae (SNe), strong interaction between the SN ejecta and circumstellar material (CSM) has been reported. This raises questions on their progenitors and mass-loss processes shortly before the explosion. Recently, the bright long-lived Type~II SN 2021irp was proposed to be a standard Type II SN interacting with disk-like CSM. The observational properties suggest that the progenitor was a massive star in a binary system and underwent a mass-ejection process due to the binary interaction just before the explosion. Here, we study the diversity of the observational properties of bright long-lived Type II (21irp-like) SNe. We analyse the diversity of their CSM properties, in order to understand their progenitors and mass-loss mechanisms and their relations with the other types of interacting SNe. We performed photometry, spectroscopy, and/or polarimetry for four 21irp-like SNe. Based on these observations as well as published data of SN~2021irp itself and well-observed bright and long-lived type II SNe including SNe~2010jl, 2015da and 2017hcc, we discuss their CSM characteristics. This sample of SNe shows luminous and long-lived photometric evolution, with some variations in the photometric evolution (from $\sim-17$ to $\sim-20$ absolute mag in the $r$/$o$ band even at $\sim 200$ days after the explosion). They show photospheric spectra characterized mainly by Balmer lines for several hundreds of days, with some variations in the shapes of the lines. They show high polarization with slight variations in the polarization degrees with rapid declines with time (from $\sim3-6$ \% before the peak to $\sim1$ \% at $\sim200$ days after the peak). The observational properties are consistent with the disk-CSM-interaction scenario, i.e., typical Type~II SNe interacting with disk-like CSM.

 - **Abstract**
 Warming Mars' surface could be a step toward making it suitable for life, but would represent a major science and engineering challenge. To warm Mars using engineered aerosol, particles released locally must disperse globally. The winds that transport aerosol respond to the aerosol's radiative forcing, implying strong radiative-dynamical feedbacks. Using a plume-tracking climate model without a water cycle, we investigate radiative-dynamical feedback from surface release of two particle compositions: graphene (which attenuates UV) and aluminum. Both compositions can give fast global warming of ~30 K. We infer that 2 liters/second release rate of graphene made from Mars' atmosphere via CO2-electrolysis could double Mars' greenhouse effect (+5 K). Self-lofting helps particles rise and spread. The Hadley cell strengthens under warming, aiding mixing. Warming can be focused in latitude by tuning particle size. Within our model, Mars radiative-dynamical feedbacks enable engineered-aerosol warming. Challenges remain, including functionalization, agglomeration, dry-deposition experiments, and modeling water cycle feedbacks.

 - **Abstract**
 We report our photometric and spectroscopic observations and analysis of the 2024 eclipse of the symbiotic binary V1413 Aquilae. We found the system in a visually bright state and the eclipse time of minimum consistent with the published ephemeris. The eclipse profile showed that the hot component was an extended object rather than an isolated white dwarf. By analyzing the eclipse profile we estimated the orbital inclination to be 67.9°, the radius of the extended hot component surrounding the white dwarf to be 39.3 Rsun, and that the red giant star was probably filling its Roche Lobe. From our flux calibrated spectra, we determined the brightest component of the system to be the hot component whose continuum and emission lines together are responsible for 83% of the V-band light. The circumbinary nebula and its emission lines contribute over 14%, while the red giant is responsible for less than 3%. Our spectra revealed a rich harvest of low ionization emission lines. By measuring how flux in these emission lines varied through the eclipse, we have provided information which should prove useful for future modelling of this symbiotic system.

          An advanced pulse-avalanche stochastic model of long gamma-ray burst light curves

 - **Abstract**
 A unified explanation of the variety of long-duration gamma-ray burst (GRB) light curves (LCs) is essential for identifying the dissipation mechanism and possibly the nature of their central engines. In the past, a model was proposed to describe GRB LCs as the outcome of a stochastic pulse avalanche process, possibly originating from a turbulent regime, and it was tested by comparing average temporal properties of simulated and real LCs. Recently, we revived this model and optimised its parameters using a genetic algorithm (GA), a machine-learning-based approach. Our findings suggested that GRB inner engines may operate near a critical regime. Here we present an advanced version of the model, which allows us to constrain the peak flux distribution of individual pulses, and evaluate its performance on a new dataset of GRBs observed by the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM). After introducing new model parameters and a further comparison metric, that is the observed signal-to-noise (S/N) distribution, we test the new model on three complementary datasets: CGRO/BATSE, Swift/BAT, and Fermi/GBM. As in our previous work, the model parameters are optimised using a GA. The updated sets of parameters achieve a further reduction in loss compared to both the original model and our earlier optimisation. The different values of the parameters across the datasets are shown to originate from the different energy passbands, effective areas, trigger algorithms, and, ultimately, different GRB populations of the three experiments. Our results further underpin the stochastic and avalanche character of the dissipation process behind long GRB prompt emission, with an emphasis on the near-critical behaviour, and establish this new model as a reliable tool for generating realistic GRB LCs as they would be seen with future experiments.

MST generates hundreds of thousands of transient alerts every night, approximately 99\% of which are false alarms, posing a significant challenge to its scientific goals. To mitigate the impact of false positives, we propose a deep learning-based solution and systematically evaluate thirteen convolutional neural networks. The results show that ResNet achieves exceptional specificity (99.70\%), EfficientNet achieves the highest recall rate (98.68\%), and DenseNet provides balanced performance with a recall rate of 94.55\% and specificity of 98.66\%. Leveraging these complementary strengths, we developed a bagging-based ensemble classifier that integrates ResNet18, DenseNet121, and EfficientNet\_B0 using a soft voting strategy. This classifier achieved the best AUC value (0.9961) among all models, with a recall rate of 95.37\% and specificity of 99.25\%. It has now been successfully deployed in the MST real-time data processing pipeline. Validation using 5,000 practically processed samples with a classification threshold of 0.798 showed that the classifier achieved 88.31\% accuracy, 91.89\% recall rate, and 99.82\% specificity, confirming its effectiveness and robustness under real application conditions.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper provides a comprehensive introduction to the Mini-SiTian Real-Time Image Processing pipeline (STRIP) and evaluates its operational performance. The STRIP pipeline is specifically designed for real-time alert triggering and light curve generation for transient sources. By applying the STRIP pipeline to both simulated and real observational data of the Mini-SiTian survey, it successfully identified various types of variable sources, including stellar flares, supernovae, variable stars, and asteroids, while meeting requirements of reduction speed within 5 minutes. For the real observational dataset, the pipeline detected 1 flare event, 127 variable stars, and 14 asteroids from three monitored sky regions. Additionally, two datasets were generated: one, a real-bogus training dataset comprising 218,818 training samples, and the other, a variable star light curve dataset with 421 instances. These datasets will be used to train machine learning algorithms, which are planned for future integration into STRIP.

 - **Abstract**
 The SiTian project, with its vast field of view, will become an ideal platform for asteroid scientific research. In this study, we develop a pipeline to analyze the photometry of asteroids and derive their periods from the data collected by the SiTian pathfinder project Mini-SiTian (MST). The pipeline is applied to the MST f02 region, a MST test region with a sky area of $2.29^{\circ} \times 1.53^{\circ}$. Rotation periods of 22 asteroids are derived by the obtained light curves analysis. Among them, there are 8 asteroids available in the Asteroid Lightcurve Photometry Database (ALCDEF), and 6 of them with more photometric points ($>$200) have similar period parameters as the ones in ALCDEF. Additionally, the periods for 14 of these asteroids are newly obtained and are not listed in ALCDEF. This study demonstrates the feasibility of asteroid photometric research by the SiTian project. It shows that future observations from the SiTian project will provide even more photometry of asteroids, significantly increasing the number of available light curves. The potential vast photometric data of asteroids will help us to further understand the physics of asteroids, their material composition, and the formation and evolution of the solar system.

 The SiTian project, designed to utilize 60 telescopes distributed across multiple sites in China, is a next-generation time-domain survey initiative. As a pathfinder for the SiTian project, the Mini-SiTian (MST) has been proposed and implemented to test the SiTian's brain and data pipeline, and to evaluate the feasibility of its technology and science cases. Mounted at the Xinglong Observatory, the MST project comprises three 30 cm telescopes and has been operated since Nov. 2022. Each telescope of the MST possesses a large field of view, covering $2.29^{\circ}$ $\times$ $1.53^{\circ}$ FOV, and is equipped with $g'$, $r'$ and $i'$ filters, respectively. Acting as the pioneer of the forthcoming SiTian project, the MST is dedicated to the discovery of variable stars, transients, and outburst events, and has already obtained some interesting scientific results. In this paper, we will summarize the first-two-year operation of the MST project.

 The SiTian Project represents a groundbreaking initiative in astronomy, aiming to deploy a global network of telescopes, each with a 1-meter aperture, for comprehensive time-domain sky surveys. The network's innovative architecture features multiple observational nodes, each comprising three strategically aligned telescopes equipped with filters. This design enables three-color (g, r, i) channel imaging within each node, facilitating precise and coordinated observations. As a pathfinder to the full-scale project, the Mini-SiTian Project serves as the scientific and technological validation platform, utilizing three 30-centimeter aperture telescopes to validate the methodologies and technologies planned for the broader SiTian network. This paper focuses on the development and implementation of the Master Control System (MCS),and the central command hub for the Mini-SiTian array. The MCS is designed to facilitate seamless communication with the SiTian Brain, the project's central processing and decision-making unit, while ensuring accurate task allocation, real-time status monitoring, and optimized observational workflows. The system adopts a robust architecture that separates front-end and back-end functionalities.A key innovation of the MCS is its ability to dynamically adjust observation plans in response to transient source alerts, enabling rapid and coordinated scans of target sky regions...(abridged)

 - **Abstract**
 As a pathfinder of the SiTian project, the Mini-SiTian (MST) array, employed three commercial CMOS cameras, represents a next-generation, cost-effective optical time-domain survey project. This paper focuses primarily on the precise data processing pipeline designed for wide-field, CMOS-based devices, including the removal of instrumental effects, astrometry, photometry, and flux calibration. When applying this pipeline to approximately 3000 observations taken in the Field 02 (f02) region by MST, the results demonstrate a remarkable astrometric precision of approximately 70--80\,mas (about 0.1\,pixel), an impressive calibration accuracy of approximately 1\,mmag in the MST zero points, and a photometric accuracy of about 4\,mmag for bright stars. Our studies demonstrate that MST CMOS can achieve photometric accuracy comparable to that of CCDs, highlighting the feasibility of large-scale CMOS-based optical time-domain surveys and their potential applications for cost optimization in future large-scale time-domain surveys, like the SiTian project.

 - **Abstract**
 The Mini-SiTian project, which is the pathfinder for the SiTian project, utilizes three 30 cm telescopes equipped with commercial CMOS cameras (ZWO ASI6200MM Pro) to simulate large-area time-domain survey. Due to the avoidance of the traditional mechanical shutter, the CMOS camera is favorable in time-domain survey projects. In the future, the SiTian telescope array will employ a two-by-two scientific-grade mosaic CMOS camera to survey a 10,000-degree square area every 30 minutes. Therefore, the performance of CMOS directly determines the detection capability of SiTian telescopes for transient sources, and a comprehensive understanding of the performance of CMOS cameras is crucial. In this research, laboratory testing was conducted to thoroughly evaluate three cameras by assessing several critical parameters, including bias stability, dark current, pixel anomalies, linearity, gain, and read noise. We find exceptional short-term bias stability with standard deviations below 0.02 ADU, negligible dark current of approximately 0.002 e$^{-}$ pixel$^{-1}$ s$^{-1}$ at $0^\circ\text{C}$, and excellent linearity with nonlinearity consistently below $\pm$ 0.5\%, and a small proportion (0.06\% to 0.08\%) of pixels with anomalous responses. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates uniform gain values across all cameras, ranging from 0.252 to 0.255 e$^{-}$ ADU$^{-1}$, with low readout noise, measured to be below 1.6 e$^{-}$ using conventional methods. We also propose a novel method for pixel-level gain and read noise calculation for CMOS sensors, which revealed a narrow gain distribution and a low median read noise of 1.028 e$^-$ for one of the cameras. The laboratory testing of the ZWO ASI6200MM Pro cameras indicates their potential to meet the requirements of time-domain surveys for the Mini-SiTian project.

 Time-domain astronomy is one of the most important areas. Large sky area, deep-field, and short timescale are the priority of time-domain observations. SiTian is an ambitious ground-based project processing all sky optical monitoring, aiming for sky-survey timescale of less than 1 day. It is developed by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, an integrated network of dozens of 1-m-class telescopes deployed worldwide. The Mini-SiTian Telescope Array is carried out for demonstrations on optical design, group scheduling, and software pipeline developments, to overcome the high technical and financial difficulties of SiTian project. One array contains three 300 mm F/3 telescope, with FOV of 5 degrees over 400-1000 nm wavelength range. The Mini-SiTian Telescope Array is now under commissioning in Xinglong Observatory, and a perfect platform for technical research and educational purposes.

 Writing proposals and job applications is arguably one of the most important tasks in the career of a scientist. The proposed ideas must be scientifically compelling, but how a proposal is planned, written, and presented can make an enormous difference. This Perspective is the third in a series aimed at training the writing skills of professional astronomers. In the first two papers we concentrated on the writing of papers, here we concentrate on how proposals and job applications can be optimally written and presented. We discuss how to select where to propose or apply, how to optimise your writing, and add notes on the potential use of artificial intelligence tools. This guide is aimed primarily at more junior researchers, but we hope that our observations and suggestions may also be helpful for more experienced applicants, as well as for reviewers and funding agencies.

 - **Abstract**
 Sonification, or conveying data using non-verbal audio, is a relatively niche but growing approach for presenting data across multiple specialist domains including astronomy, climate science, and beyond. The STRAUSS Python package aims to provide such a tool, which builds upon previous approaches to provide a powerful means to explore different ways of expressing data, with fine control over the output audio and its format. STRAUSS is a free, open source (FOSS) package, designed to allow flexible and effective sonification to be integrated into data workflows, in analogy to widely used visualisation packages. The remit of STRAUSS is broad; it is intended to be able to bridge between ad-hoc solutions for sonifying very particular datasets, and highly technical compositional and sound-design tools that are not optimised for sonification, or may have a steep learning curve. The code offers a range of approaches to sonification for a variety of contexts (e.g. science education, science communication, technical data analysis, etc). To this end, STRAUSS is packaged with a number of examples of different sonification approaches, and preset configurations to support "low-barrier, high-ceiling" approach. STRAUSS has been used to produce both educational resources and analysis tools.

 - **Abstract**
 The standard model of cosmology has provided a good phenomenological description of a wide range of observations both at astrophysical and cosmological scales for several decades. This concordance model is constructed by a universal cosmological constant and supported by a matter sector described by the standard model of particle physics and a cold dark matter contribution, as well as very early-time inflationary physics, and underpinned by gravitation through general relativity. There have always been open questions about the soundness of the foundations of the standard model. However, recent years have shown that there may also be questions from the observational sector with the emergence of differences between certain cosmological probes. In this White Paper, we identify the key objectives that need to be addressed over the coming decade together with the core science projects that aim to meet these challenges. These discordances primarily rest on the divergence in the measurement of core cosmological parameters with varying levels of statistical confidence. These possible statistical tensions may be partially accounted for by systematics in various measurements or cosmological probes but there is also a growing indication of potential new physics beyond the standard model. After reviewing the principal probes used in the measurement of cosmological parameters, as well as potential systematics, we discuss the most promising array of potential new physics that may be observable in upcoming surveys. We also discuss the growing set of novel data analysis approaches that go beyond traditional methods to test physical models. [Abridged]

 - **Abstract**
 We study the dynamics of Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker models where a dark energy component with a quadratic equation of state (EoS) nonlinearly interacts with cold dark matter. Thus, two energy scales naturally come into play: $\rho_*$ is the scale at which the nonlinearity of the EoS becomes relevant; $\rho_i$ is the energy scale around which the interaction starts to play an important role in the dynamics. Our focus is to understand whether there are parameter ranges for this system that can produce non-singular bouncing and emergent cosmologies for any initial condition. We complete a dynamical systems analysis, and find the parameter range such that trajectories always expand from a high energy non-singular de Sitter state. For flat and negative curvature models this de Sitter state is represented by a fixed point, the asymptotic past from which the universe emerges from. We find a subset of positive curvature models that during contraction get arbitrarily close to the de Sitter state, thus having a quasi-de Sitter bounce, then emerge from the bounce and expand, evolving toward spatial flatness. We find that the dimensionless parameter $q\equiv \rho_*/\rho_i$, which measures the relative strength of the nonlinear terms in the system, plays a crucial role in the topology of the phase space. When $q < 3$, some trajectories expand toward a singularity, while others evolve toward a low energy cosmological constant at late-times, with a subset going through a decelerated matter dominate era before the final acceleration. When $q > 3$, all trajectories are non-singular, and evolve toward a late-time cosmological constant. We find a subclass in this case in which all trajectories have at least one decelerated matter dominated phase, and accelerate at late-times.

          Quantifying the scale of star formation across the Perseus spiral arm using young clusters around Cas OB5

 - **Abstract**
 Cas OB5 is an OB association located at a distance of 2.5-3 kpc that intercepts the Perseus spiral arm. It carries a moderate amount of reddening ($A_V \sim$ 2-3 mag) and contains several well-known open clusters within its boundaries, such as King 12, NGC 7788, and NGC 7790. The availability of modern clustering algorithms, together with \textit{Gaia} DR3 kinematics and complementary spectroscopic data, makes it a suitable site for studies of Galactic structure. We seek to quantify the spatial scale of star formation in the spiral arms, using Cas OB5 as a pilot target before extending our study to more distant and extinguished regions of the Galaxy. We selected 129,695 candidate OBA stars in a 6x8 deg$^2$ region around Cas OB5. We applied a spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting process to this sample to derive the physical parameters. Through this process, we found 56 379 OBA stars, which we then clustered using HDBSCAN. We identified 17 open clusters inside this area, four of which appear to form a coherent structure that we identify as Cas OB5. Nevertheless, our findings suggest that these clusters belong to two different age groups despite sharing a similar position and kinematics. Spectroscopic observations confirm the youth of NGC 7788 (10-15 Myr) compared to NGC 7790 ($110\pm15\:$Myr). We have determined a spatial scale for star formation of a few tens of pc to a few hundreds of pc, comparing the clustered to the diffuse population of Cas~OB5 across this part of the Perseus arm. A spectroscopic analysis was required to complement the clustering algorithm, so that we could separate younger OCs (tracers of the spiral arm) from older ones. These results highlight the need to combine these techniques to fully disentangle the Milky Way structure.

          Probing the Distance Duality Relation with Machine Learning and Recent Data

 - **Abstract**
 The distance duality relation (DDR) relates two independent ways of measuring cosmological distances, namely the angular diameter distance and the luminosity distance. These can be measured with baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) and Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), respectively. Here, we use recent DESI DR1, Pantheon+, SH0ES and DES-SN5YR data to test this fundamental relation. We employ a parametrised approach and also use model-independent Generic Algorithms (GA), which are a machine learning method where functions evolve loosely based on biological evolution. When we use DESI and Pantheon+ data without Cepheid calibration or big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN), there is a $2\sigma$ violation of the DDR in the parametrised approach. Then, we add high-redshift BBN data and the low-redshift SH0ES Cepheid calibration. This reflects the Hubble tension since both data sets are in tension in the standard cosmological model $\Lambda$CDM. In this case, we find a significant violation of the DDR in the parametrised case at $6\sigma$. Replacing the Pantheon+ SNe Ia data by DES-SN5YR, we find similar results. For the model-independent approach, we find no deviation in the uncalibrated case and a small deviation with BBN and Cepheids which remains at 1$\sigma$. This shows the importance of considering model-independent approaches for the DDR.

          Updating the Ephemeris and Physical Properties of Five Long-period Transiting Exoplanets Using TESS and CHEOPS

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/
 - **Abstract**
 The transiting long-period exoplanets are the most interesting follow-up targets for the next-generation instruments, using the most sophisticated observational techniques. However, the scarcity in their transit events often leads to larger uncertainties in their known ephemeris, also resulting in larger biases in their known physical properties in many cases. In this work, I have used the newer publicly available observations from TESS and CHEOPS for five very interesting long-period transiting exoplanets, i.e., HD95338 b, TOI-2134 c, K2-290 c, TOI-1898 b, and TOI-813 b, combined with the previously reported observations, to reanalyze their transit properties and estimate the updated ephemeris. The analyses also incorporated a critical noise treatment algorithm, which uses well-tested techniques such as wavelet denoising and Gaussian process regression, to effectively reduce the impact of various noise components present in the lightcurves on the estimated parameters. The study has resulted in a more precise estimation of ephemeris for all the targets, with the precision in the estimated periods being better than 5 seconds, except for TOI-813 b, for which the precision in the estimated period is better than 21 seconds. The other transit parameters also got updated, with statistically significant improvements seen in most of the cases, the major notable improvements being in the estimated value of the impact parameter of TOI-1898 b, the orbital semi-major axis of TOI-2134 c, and the radius of HD95338 b. Although long-period exoplanets are expected to show more significant transit timing variations in the presence of other undetected planetary mass objects, no such variations were recorded for these targets.

 - **Abstract**
 The vertical metallicity gradient of the Galactic disk offers valuable insights into the disk's formation and chemical evolution over time. We utilized the LAMOST-LRS young stellar sample to investigate this gradient and found that it approaches zero as stellar effective temperature (or age) increases (or decreases) across various Galactocentric distances. To validate this result, we analyzed 295 open clusters younger than 3 Gyr and 976 classical cepheids within the Galactic disk. The findings confirmed that, within a given narrow age range, the vertical metallicity gradient is effectively zero. This relationship between metallicity and age supports the ``upside-down'' disk formation theory, as it indicates that the youngest and most metal-rich stars dominate the midplane, while older and more metal-poor stars formed at larger vertical heights and currently tend to be at these heights. Overall, our results align well with theoretical predictions, offering further insight into the chemical evolution and structural properties of the Milky Way.

 - **Abstract**
 Galactic diffuse gamma-ray flux measured by the Tibet AS{\gamma} experiment and the total Galactic gamma-ray flux measured by Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) are found to be consistent, within the statistical and systematic uncertainties, for the inner Galactic Plane region in the sub-PeV energy range (E > 10^14 eV). The result suggests that the sub-PeV Galactic gamma-ray flux is dominated by the diffuse emission. On the other hand, the LHAASO observations suggest that the sub-PeV gamma-ray sources presented in the first LHAASO catalog possibly give a significant contribution to the total sub-PeV Galactic gamma-ray emission ($\approx$ 60%). However, the estimate must be regarded as a conservative upper limit. In fact, current gamma-ray observations imply that many of the sub-PeV gamma-ray sources detected by LHAASO have a cutoff or significant softening in their energy spectra in the several tens of TeV energy range, and the resolved-source contribution to the total sub-PeV Galactic gamma-ray emission should be much lower than the above estimate. More sophisticated discussion about the origin of the sub-PeV Galactic gamma-ray emission requires detailed spectral studies of the individual gamma-ray sources and an accurate estimate of the contamination of the source fluxes from the diffuse emission.

 The nature and formation history of our Galaxy's largest and most enigmatic stellar cluster, known as Omega Centauri (ocen) remains debated. Here, we offer a novel approach to disentangling the complex stellar populations within ocen based on phylogenetics methodologies from evolutionary biology. These include the Gaussian Mixture Model and Neighbor-Joining clustering algorithms applied to a set of chemical abundances of ocen stellar members. Instead of using the classical approach in astronomy of grouping them into separate populations, we focused on how the stars are related to each other. In this way, we could identify stars that likely formed in globular clusters versus those originating from prolonged in-situ star formation and how these stars interconnect. Our analysis supports the hypothesis that ocen might be a nuclear star cluster of a galaxy accreted by the Milky Way with a mass of about 10^9M_sun. Furthermore, we revealed the existence of a previously unidentified in-situ stellar population with a distinct chemical pattern unlike any known population found in the Milky Way to date. Our analysis of ocen is an example of the success of cross-disciplinary research and shows the vast potential of applying evolutionary biology tools to astronomical datasets, opening new avenues for understanding the chemical evolution of complex stellar systems.

 - **Abstract**
 External photoevaporation is one of the dominant mechanisms for mass loss from protoplanetary discs. However this mass loss is theoretically expected to depend upon the microphysical properties of protoplanetary discs, which are currently poorly constrained in observations. In this work we explore the impact of microphysics on the bulk evolution of discs. The polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) abundance, and the extent to which grain growth has occurred in the disc have profound effects on the strength of mass loss rates due to external photoevaporation, which in turn can have a significant impact on the disc evolution, impacting disc radii and accretion rates over time. The strongest sensitivity is to whether grain growth has occurred in the disc, which reduces the amount of dust entrained in the wind to shield the disc, thus increasing the rate at which gas is lost. Additionally, larger PAH abundances result in stronger heating and higher mass loss rates, but to a lesser extent than grain growth. We find that plausible variations in the PAH abundance and disc dust evolution can leave observable differences in disc populations. This work highlights the importance of obtaining observational constraints of the microphysical properties of protoplanetary discs. Future observations from JWST should soon be able to provide these constraints.

 - **Abstract**
 Acoustic oscillations in stars are sensitive to stellar interiors. Frequency differences between overtone modes -- large separations -- probe stellar density, while differences between low-degree modes -- small separations -- probe the sound speed gradient in the energy-generating core of main sequence Sun-like stars, and hence their ages. At later phases of stellar evolution, characterised by inert cores, small separations are believed to lose much of their power to probe deep interiors and simply become proportional to large separations. Here, we present clear evidence of a rapidly evolving convective zone as stars evolve from the subgiant phase into red giants. By measuring acoustic oscillations in 27 stars from the open cluster M67, we observe deviations of proportionality between small and large separations, which are caused by the influence of the bottom of the convective envelope. These deviations become apparent as the convective envelope penetrates deep into the star during subgiant and red giant evolution, eventually entering an ultra-deep regime that leads to the red giant branch luminosity bump. The tight sequence of cluster stars, free of large spreads in ages and fundamental properties, is essential for revealing the connection between the observed small separations and the chemical discontinuities occurring at the bottom of the convective envelope. We use this sequence to show that combining large and small separations can improve estimations of the masses and ages of field stars well after the main sequence.

 - **Abstract**
 Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) has long been recognized as an observable low-energy signature of quantum gravity. In spite of a great effort to detect LIV effects, so far only lower bounds have been derived. The high energy photons from the gamma ray burst GRB 221009A have been detected by the LHAASO collaboration and one at ${\cal E} \simeq 251 \, \rm TeV$ by the Carpet collaboration using a partial data set. Very recently, the Carpet collaboration has completed the full data analysis, reporting further support for their previously detected photon now at ${\cal E} = 300^{+ 43}_{- 38} \, {\rm TeV}$, which manifestly clashes with conventional physics. Taking this result at face value, we derive the first evidence for LIV and we show that such a detection cannot be explained by axion-like particles (ALPs), which allow for the observation of the highest energy photons detected by LHAASO. We also outline a scenario in which ALPs and LIV naturally coexist. If confirmed by future observations our finding would represent the first positive result in quantum gravity phenomenology.

 - **Abstract**
 DESTINY+ is an upcoming JAXA Epsilon medium-class mission to flyby multiple asteroids including Phaethon. As an asteroid flyby observation instrument, a telescope mechanically capable of single-axis rotation, named TCAP, is mounted on the spacecraft to track and observe the target asteroids during flyby. As in past flyby missions utilizing rotating telescopes, TCAP is also used as a navigation camera for autonomous optical navigation during the closest-approach phase. To mitigate the degradation of the navigation accuracy, past missions performed calibration of the navigation camera's alignment before starting optical navigation. However, such calibration requires significant operational time to complete and imposes constraints on the operation sequence. From the above background, the DESTINY+ team has studied the possibility of reducing operational costs by allowing TCAP alignment errors to remain. This paper describes an autonomous optical navigation algorithm robust to the misalignment of rotating telescopes, proposed in this context. In the proposed method, the misalignment of the telescope is estimated simultaneously with the spacecraft's orbit relative to the flyby target. To deal with the nonlinearity between the misalignment and the observation value, the proposed method utilizes the unscented Kalman filter, instead of the extended Kalman filter widely used in past studies. The proposed method was evaluated with numerical simulations on a PC and with hardware-in-the-loop simulation, taking the Phaethon flyby in the DESTINY+ mission as an example. The validation results suggest that the proposed method can mitigate the misalignment-induced degradation of the optical navigation accuracy with reasonable computational costs suited for onboard computers.

          Tidal interaction can stop galactic bars: on the LMC non-rotating bar

 - **Abstract**
 Context: Using Gaia DR3 data, Jiménez-Arranz et al. (2024a) computed the LMC bar pattern speed using three different methods. One of them suggested that the LMC might be hosting a bar that barely rotates, and is slightly counter-rotating with respect to the LMC disc, with a pattern speed of $\Omega_p = -1.0 \pm 0.5$ km/s/kpc. Aims: To confirm that tidal interactions can trigger the LMC hosting a non-rotating bar due to its interaction with the SMC, which could cause the LMC bar to slow down significantly until it (momentarily) stops. Methods: We analyse a subset of models (K9 and K21) from the KRATOS suite (Jiménez-Arranz et al. 2024b) where we detected non-rotating bars. We make use of two different methods to track the evolution of the bar pattern speed: the program this http URL (Dehnen et al. 2023), and temporal finite-differences of the change rate the bar major axis' phase angle. Results: In the second LMC-SMC-like pericenter passage of K9, the bar of the LMC-like galaxy weakens to almost disappear and regenerates with a pattern speed that suffers a slowdown from $\Omega_p \sim 20$ km/s/kpc to $\Omega_p \sim 0$ km/s/kpc in less than 75 Myr. Then, the bar rotates at less than $\Omega_p \sim 3-5$ km/s/kpc for around 100 Myr, until it recovers the initial (before interaction) pattern speed of $\Omega_p \sim 10$ km/s/kpc. The results for the K21 simulation are comparable. Conclusions: This work is the first direct evidence that galactic bars can be slowed down or even stopped by tidal interaction, which strengthens the possibility of the LMC hosting a non-rotating bar, and can add an alternative formation scenario for observed slow-rotating bars.

          Synchro-curvature description of γ-ray light curves and spectra of pulsars: concurrent fitting

 - **Abstract**
 We present a concurrent fitting of spectra and light curves of the whole population of detected gamma-ray pulsars. Using a synchro-curvature model we compare our theoretical output with the observational data published in the Third Fermi Pulsar Catalog, which has significantly increased the number of known gamma-ray pulsars. Our model properly fits all the spectra and reproduces well a considerable fraction of light curves. Light curve fitting is carried out with two different techniques, whose strong points and caveats are discussed. We use a weighted reduced \{chi}^2 of light curves in time domain, and the Euclidean distance of the Fourier transform of the light curves, i.e. transforming the light curves to the frequency domain. The performance of both methods is found to be qualitatively similar, but individual best-fit solutions may differ. We also show that, in our model based on few effective parameters, the light curve fitting is basically insensitive to the timing and spectral parameters of the pulsar. Finally, we look for correlations between model and physical parameters, and recover trends found in previous studies but without any significant correlation involving geometrical parameters.

          Interference with Gravitational Instability: Hot and Fuzzy Dark Matter

 - **Abstract**
 Wave or fuzzy dark matter produced with high momenta behaves in many ways like hot particle dark matter while also possessing seemingly different phenomenology due to wave interference. We develop wave perturbation theory to show that white noise density fluctuations generated by the interference of high-momenta waves are gravitationally unstable in the usual way during matter domination above the free streaming scale and stabilize below the free streaming scale, much like the analogous effects for massive neutrinos in hot dark matter. We verify and illustrate these effects in the density power spectra of Newtonian Schrödinger-Poisson simulations. In the cosmological context, this would cause a gradual suppression of the initial white noise isocurvature perturbations below the free streaming scale at matter radiation equality, unlike cold dark matter isocurvature fluctuations, and virial stability of dark matter halos.

 - **Abstract**
 Halo bias links the statistical properties of the spatial distribution of dark matter halos to those of the underlying dark matter field, providing insights into clustering properties in both general relativity (GR) and modified-gravity scenarios such as $f(R)$ models. While the primary halo mass-dependent bias has been studied in detailed, the secondary bias, which accounts for the additional dependencies on other internal halo properties, can offer a sensitive probe for testing gravity beyond the $\Lambda$CDM model. To quantify any potential deviations between $\Lambda$CDM and $f(R)$ gravity models in halo clustering, at both the primary and secondary level, as well as in the distributions of halo properties in the cosmic web. Using $N$-body simulations of $f(R)$ gravity models, we assess the scaling relations and the primary and secondary bias signals of halo populations on the basis of a halo-by-halo estimator of large-scale effective bias. Our analysis is performed using halo number density as the independent variable. The relative difference in the effective bias between the $f(R)$ models and $\Lambda$CDM is sensitive, albeit slightly, to the power index of modified gravity. The largest deviations from GR are measured for low-mass halos, where the average bias at fixed number density decreases by up to 5\% for fixed scaling indices. We also show that the scaling relations for some environmental properties, including neighbour statistics, Mach number and local overdensity, exhibit small but non-negligible deviations (~3-5\%) from GR for a wide range of number densities. Our results also suggests that the properties of halos in sheets and voids show the largest departures from GR (> 10\% in some cases). In terms of secondary bias, we do not find any statistically significant deviations with respect to $\Lambda$CDM for any of the properties explored in this work.

#### Title:
          Exoplaneteers Keep Overestimating Sigma Significances

 - **Abstract**
 Astronomers, and in particular exoplaneteers, have a curious habit of expressing Bayes factors as frequentist sigma values. This is of course completely unnecessary and arguably rather ill-advised. Regardless, the practice is common - especially in the detection claims of chemical species within exoplanet atmospheres. The current canonical conversion strategy stems from a statistics paper from Sellke et al. (2001), who derived an upper bound on the Bayes factor between the test and null hypotheses, as a function of the $p$-value (or number of sigmas, $n_{\sigma}$). A common practice within the exoplanet atmosphere community is to numerically invert this formula, going from a Bayes factor to $n_\sigma$. This goes back to Benneke & Seager (2013) -- a highly cited paper that introduced Bayesian model comparison as a means of inferring the presence of specific chemical species -- in an attempt to calibrate the Bayes factors from their technique for a community that in 2013 was more familiar with frequentist sigma significances. However, as originally noted by Sellke et al. (2001), the conversion only provides an upper limit on $n_\sigma$, with the true value generally being lower. This can result in inflations of claimed detection significances, and this note strongly urges the community to stop converting to $n_\sigma$ at all and simply stick with Bayes factors.

          Variable Modified Newtonian Mechanics VII: Supermassive Black Hole at very high redshift

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of Supermassive Black Hole (SMBH) at very high redshift hosted by massive galaxy provide a challenge to the SMBH and massive galaxy formation models which are predicated on the Lambda CDM model that predicts a Hubble constant currently in tension with late time observations. In a gravitational system with two asymptotic solutions such as a central mass in an expanding cosmological background or an expanding background with radiation and baryons, we find that a particle's free falling speed resulting from adding the free falling speeds due to the asymptotic solutions is also a theoretically viable solution [1]-[2]. In this work, we use this new model to examine the SMBH formation time-line and find that the change in the redshift-cosmological time relation provides sufficent cosmological time for the formation of SMBHs at high redshifts. We also find that the Hubble parameter-redshift relation in this model is consistent with late time observation at z<1.

          Multi-cloud crushing -- the collective survival of cold clouds in galactic outflows

 - **Abstract**
 The ram-pressure acceleration of cold gas by hot outflows plays a crucial role in the dynamics of multiphase galactic winds. Recent numerical studies incorporating radiative cooling have identified a size threshold for idealized cold clouds to survive within high-velocity outflows. This study extends the investigation to a more complex morphology of cold gas as observed in the interstellar medium. We conduct three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of ensembles of individual spherical clouds to systematically explore under which conditions the cold clouds can survive. We find that cloud ensembles can survive collectively -- even when individual clouds, if isolated, would be rapidly destroyed. Our results indicate that, besides the morphology, factors such as tight packing, small inter-cloud distance and higher fragmentation facilitate survival. We propose a novel multi-cloud survival criterion that accounts for collective properties of the cloud system, including total gas mass and the geometric configuration based on an effective volume filling fraction of the cold gas $F_V$. This fraction is computed by constructing a composite volume from individual enclosing conical boxes aligned with the wind, incorporating spatial overlap and cloud-tail spreading. The box dimensions scale with the critical survival radius $r_{\rm crit}$ from the single-cloud criterion. We find a universal threshold $F_{V,{\rm crit}}\approx 0.24$ that robustly separates surviving from destroyed systems across diverse geometric configurations. Our findings emphasize the critical importance of initial cloud distribution and fragmentation in governing the long-term evolution and survival of cold gas structures, providing insight into observed multiphase outflows and CGM dynamics.

          Kinematic Evidence for Bipolar Ejecta Flows in the Galactic SNR W49B

 - **Abstract**
 W49B is a unique Galactic supernova remnant with centrally peaked, "bar"-like ejecta distribution, which was once considered evidence for a hypernova origin that resulted in a bipolar ejection of the stellar core. However, chemical abundance measurements contradict this interpretation. Closely connected to the morphology of the ejecta is its velocity distribution, which provides critical details for understanding the explosion mechanism. We report the first-ever observational constraint on the kinematics of the ejecta in W49B using the Resolve microcalorimeter spectrometer on the X-ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM). Using XRISM/Resolve, we measured the line-of-sight velocity traced by the Fe He$\alpha$ emission, which is the brightest feature in the Resolve spectrum, to vary by $\pm$300 km s$^{-1}$ with a smooth east-to-west gradient of a few tens of km s$^{-1}$ pc$^{-1}$ along the major axis. Similar trends in the line-of-sight velocity structure were found for other Fe-group elements Cr and Mn, traced by the He$\alpha$ emission, and also for intermediate-mass elements Si, S, Ar, and Ca, traced by the Ly$\alpha$ emission. The discovery of the east-west gradient in the line-of-sight velocity, together with the absence of a twin-peaked line profile or enhanced broadening in the central region, clearly rejects the equatorially expanding disk model. In contrast, the observed velocity structure suggests bipolar flows reminiscent of a bipolar explosion scenario. An alternative scenario would be a collimation of the ejecta by an elongated cavity sculpted by bipolar stellar winds.

          A Reassessment of the Pantheon+ and DES 5YR Calibration Uncertainties: Dovekie

 - **Abstract**
 Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) are crucial tools to measure the accelerating expansion of the universe, comprising thousands of SNe across multiple telescopes. Accurate measurements of cosmological parameters with SNe Ia require a robust understanding and cross-calibration of the telescopes and filters. A previous cross-calibration effort, 'Fragilistic', provided 25 photometric systems, but offered no public code or ability to add new surveys. We provide an open-source cross-calibration solution, available at this https URL . Using the Pan-STARRs (PS1) and Gaia all-sky telescopes, we characterise the measured filters from 11 photometric systems, including CfA, PS1, Foundation, DES, CSP, SDSS, and SNLS, using published observations of field stars. For the first time, we derive uncertainties on effective filter transmissions and modify filters to match the data. With the addition of direct observations of DA white dwarfs (Boyd et al. 2025), we simultaneously cross-calibrate our zeropoints across photometric systems and propagate to cosmology. With improved uncertainties from DA WDs, we find improvements to the calibration systematic uncertainty of x1.5 for the Pantheon+ (Brout et al. 2022) sample with a new systematic photometric uncertainty = 0.016 for FlatwCDM, and modest improvements to that of the DES5YR analysis. We find good agreement with previous calibration, and show that even these small calibration changes can be amplified by up to a factor of x6 in the inferred SN Ia distances, driven by calibration sensitivity in the colour-luminosity relations and SALT training. Initial results indicate that these changes cause dmu/dz = 0.025 and change the recovered value of Omega_M in LCDM by ~0.01. These may have a potentially larger impact in w0/wa space and inferences about evolving dark energy. We pursue this calculation in an ongoing full re-analysis of DES.

 - **Abstract**
 Tidal disruption events (TDEs) have been proposed as valuable laboratories for studying dormant black holes. However, progress in this field has been hampered by the limited number of observed events. In this work, we present TDECat, a comprehensive catalogue of 134 confirmed TDEs (131 optical TDEs and 3 jetted TDEs) discovered up to the end of 2024, accompanied by multi-wavelength photometry (X-ray, UV, optical, and IR) and publicly available spectra. We also study the statistical properties, spectral classifications, and multi-band variability of these events. Using a Bayesian Blocks algorithm, we determine the duration, rise time , decay time, and their ratio for 103 flares in our sample. We find that these timescales follow a log-normal distribution. Furthermore, our spectral analysis shows that most optical TDEs belong to the TDE-H+He class, followed by the TDE-H, TDE-He, and TDE-featureless classes, which is consistent with expectations from main sequence star disruption. Using archival observations, we identify four new potentially repeating TDEs, namely AT 2024pvu, AT 2022exr, AT2021uvz, and AT 2019teq, increasing the number of known repeating events. In both newly identified and previously known cases, the secondary flares exhibit a similar shape to the primary. We also examine the IR and X-ray emission from the TDEs in our catalogue, and find that 14 out of the 18 IR events have associated X-ray emission, strongly suggesting a potential correlation. Finally, we find that for three subsamples (repeating flares, IR-, and X-ray-emitting events), the spectral classes are unlikely to be randomly distributed, suggesting a connection between spectral characteristics and multi-wavelength emission. TDEcat enables large-scale population studies across wavelengths and spectral classes, providing essential tools for navigating the data-rich era of upcoming surveys such as the LSST.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the discovery of three sub-Neptune planets around TOI-1117, a Sun-like star with mass $0.97\pm0.02M_{\odot}$, radius $1.05\pm0.03R_{\odot}$, age $4.42\pm1.50$ Gyr and effective temperature $5635\pm62$ K. Light curves from TESS and LCOGT show a transiting sub-Neptune with a $2.23$ day period, mass $M_b=8.90_{-0.96}^{+0.95}M_{\oplus}$ and radius $R_b=2.46_{-0.12}^{+0.13}R_{\oplus}$. This is a rare 'hot Neptune' that falls within the parameter spaces known as the 'Neptunian Desert' and the 'Radius Valley'. Two more planetary signals are detected in HARPS radial velocities, revealing two non-transiting planets with minimum masses $M_c=7.46_{-1.62}^{+1.43}M_{\oplus}$ and $M_d=9.06_{-1.78}^{+2.07}M_{\oplus}$, and periods of $4.579\pm0.004$ and $8.67\pm0.01$ days. The eccentricities were poorly constrained by the HARPS data, with upper limits $e_b=0.11$, $e_c=0.29$, and $e_d=0.24$. However, dynamical simulations of the TOI-1117 system, suggest that the orbits must be nearly circular to be stable. The simulations also show that TOI-1117b and c are likely to be in a near 2:1 resonance. The multi-planet nature of TOI-1117 makes it a more complex case for formation theories of the Neptunian Desert and Radius Valley, as current theories such as high-eccentricity migration are too turbulent to produce a stable, non-eccentric, multi-planet system. Moreover, analysis of TOI-1117b's photoevaporation history found rocky core and H/He atmosphere models to be inconsistent with observations, whilst water-rich scenarios were favoured.

 - **Abstract**
 In the identification of new planetary candidates in transit surveys, the employment of Deep Learning models proved to be essential to efficiently analyse a continuously growing volume of photometric observations. To further improve the robustness of these models, it is necessary to exploit the complementarity of data collected from different transit surveys such as NASA's Kepler, Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), and, in the near future, the ESA PLAnetary Transits and Oscillation of stars (PLATO) mission. In this work, we present a Deep Learning model, named DART-Vetter, able to distinguish planetary candidates (PC) from false positives signals (NPC) detected by any potential transiting survey. DART-Vetter is a Convolutional Neural Network that processes only the light curves folded on the period of the relative signal, featuring a simpler and more compact architecture with respect to other triaging and/or vetting models available in the literature. We trained and tested DART-Vetter on several dataset of publicly available and homogeneously labelled TESS and Kepler light curves in order to prove the effectiveness of our model. Despite its simplicity, DART-Vetter achieves highly competitive triaging performance, with a recall rate of 91% on an ensemble of TESS and Kepler data, when compared to Exominer and Astronet-Triage. Its compact, open source and easy to replicate architecture makes DART-Vetter a particularly useful tool for automatizing triaging procedures or assisting human vetters, showing a discrete generalization on TCEs with Multiple Event Statistic (MES) > 20 and orbital period < 50 days.

          Post-common Envelope Evolution of Helium-core White Dwarfs

 - **Abstract**
 Helium-core white dwarfs (He WDs) formed through common envelope (CE) evolution offer valuable insight into binary interaction channels and compact remnant formation. Their cooling rates critically impact both detectability and age estimates in close binaries. Compared to He WDs formed via stable Roche-lobe overflow (SRLOF), those from the CE channel undergo markedly different mass-loss histories, resulting in distinct post-CE evolutionary behavior. We explore how the mass of the residual hydrogen envelope (Mh) shapes the cooling evolution of CE He WDs, focusing on the role of the bifurcation point in setting Mh and enabling residual hydrogen burning. Using the LPCODE stellar evolution code, we computed models of He WDs with masses from 0.20 to 0.42 solar masses, evolving from post-CE conditions to the white dwarf cooling track. Two evolutionary branches emerge: (i) non-flashing sequences, which cool rapidly with negligible hydrogen burning, and (ii) flashing sequences, where hydrogen shell flashes alter the envelope structure prior to cooling. Minimal-envelope models cool within 5-130 million years for effective temperatures between 12,000 and 27,000 K, and reach in approx. 300 million years at lower temperatures, remaining much younger than SRLOF counterparts. In contrast, models with more hydrogen retain active nuclear burning, delaying cooling and yielding ages of several billion years. Flashing sequences prolong the pre-white dwarf phase, though still shorter than in SRLOF evolution. The value of Mh also affects WD mass and surface gravity estimates, introducing systematic shifts with respect to SRLOF WDs. Our results show that CE He WDs follow distinct evolutionary paths, with important implications for interpreting the nature and fate of compact binaries hosting He WDs.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the X-ray polarization observation of G21.5-0.9, a young Galactic supernova remnant (SNR), conducted with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) in October 2023, with a total livetime of approximately 837 ks. Using different analysis methods, such as a space-integrated study of the entire region of the PWN and a space-resolved polarization map, we detect significant polarization from the pulsar wind nebula (PWN) at the center of the SNR, with an average polarization degree of ~10% oriented at ~33° (north through east). No significant energy-dependent variation in polarization is observed across the IXPE band (2-8 keV). The polarization map, corrected for the effect of polarization leakage, reveals a consistent pattern in both degree and angle, with little change across the nebula. Our findings indicate the presence of a highly polarized central torus, suggesting low levels of turbulence at particle acceleration sites. Unlike Vela, but similar to the Crab Nebula, we observe substantial differences between radio and X-ray polarization maps. This suggests a clear separation in energy of the emitting particle populations and hints at an important, yet poorly understood, role of instabilities in the turbulence dynamics of PWNe.

 - **Abstract**
 The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has surveyed nearly the entire sky in Full-Frame Image mode with a time resolution of 200 seconds to 30 minutes and a temporal baseline of at least 27 days. In addition to the primary goal of discovering new exoplanets, TESS is exceptionally capable at detecting variable stars, and in particular short-period eclipsing binaries which are relatively common, making up a few percent of all stars, and represent powerful astrophysical laboratories for deep investigations of stellar formation and evolution. We combed Sectors 1-82 of TESS Full-Frame Image data searching for eclipsing binary stars using a neural network that identified ~1.2 million stars with eclipse-like features. Of these, we have performed an in-depth analysis on ~60,000 targets using automated methods and manual inspection by citizen scientists. Here we present a catalog of 10001 uniformly-vetted and -validated eclipsing binary stars that passed all our ephemeris and photocenter tests, as well as complementary visual inspection. Of these, 7936 are new eclipsing binaries while the remaining 2065 are known systems for which we update the published ephemerides. We outline the detection and analysis of the targets, discuss the properties of the sample, and highlight potentially interesting systems. Finally, we also provide a list of ~900,000 unvetted and unvalidated targets for which the neural network found eclipse-like features with a score higher than 0.9, and for which there are no known eclipsing binaries within a sky-projected separation of a TESS pixel (~21 arcsec).

 - **Abstract**
 Population synthesis simulations of compact binary coalescences~(CBCs) play a crucial role in extracting astrophysical insights from an ensemble of gravitational wave~(GW) observations. However, realistic simulations are costly to implement for a dense grid of initial conditions. Normalizing flows can emulate the distribution functions of a simulated population of binary parameters and thereby enable empirical constraints on the astrophysical initial conditions and branching fractions of various formation channels given data from a catalog of GW observations. They can also be used for data amplification in sparse regions of the CBC parameter space to guide the development of phenomenological population models for rarely synthesizable systems with components in theorized mass gaps, without having to simulate a prohibitively large number of binaries. But flow predictions are wrought with uncertainties, especially for sparse training sets. In this work I develop a method for quantifying and marginalizing uncertainties in the emulators by introducing the Bayesian Normalizing flow, a conditional density estimator constructed from Bayesian neural networks. Using the exact likelihood function associated with density estimators I sample the posterior distribution of flow parameters with suitably chosen priors to quantify and marginalize over flow uncertainties. I demonstrate the accuracy, calibration, and data-amplification impacts of the estimated uncertainties for simulations of binary black hole populations formed through common envelope evolution. I outline applications of the methodology in simulation-based inference from growing GW catalogs and sketch other uses for general simulation-based approaches in GW astronomy.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comparative observational data analysis of two DBI-type k-essence scalar field models for late-time cosmic acceleration: one treats dark energy with standard matter, while the other unifies dark energy and dark matter within a single scalar field, each governed by distinct non-canonical Lagrangians. The background dynamics are formulated via modified Friedmann and scalar field equations, constrained by Pantheon+ SNe Ia, Hubble, and BAO data, using Bayesian inference (NUTS in NumPyro) and a neural network-based emulator for efficiency. Introducing a nuisance parameter $\mu_0$ improves the robustness and interpretability of key cosmological parameters, particularly $H_0$, $r_d$, and $\Omega_{d0}$ by absorbing residual systematics, thereby mitigating the Hubble tension. The deceleration parameter $q(z)$ is computed for both models, revealing key differences in cosmic acceleration history: Model I yields a present value $q^{Bayes}_0=-0.589$ or $q^{ML}_0=-0.559$ with transition redshift $z^{Bayes}_{trans}=0.740$ or $z^{ML}_{trans}=0.686$, closely aligning with $\Lambda$CDM predictions, while Model II shows a stronger present acceleration $q^{Bayes}_0=-0.893$ or $q^{ML}_0=-0.819$ but with a later transition at $z^{Bayes}_{trans}=0.605$ or $z^{ML}_{trans}=0.564$, indicating a steeper late time evolution. Based on $\chi^2$, $\chi^2_\nu$, AIC, and BIC statics, Model II performs worse than Model I despite its conceptual appeal. Finally, Symbolic regression (GPlearn) is performed to reconstructs $\omega_{eff}(z)$. Our analysis shows that Model I is statistically favored across all metrics and offers a physically consistent alternative to $\Lambda$CDM, capable of addressing the Hubble tension.

 - **Abstract**
 We present two NuSTAR observations of the X-ray transient, MAXI J1752$-$457, following a superburst which was observed by MAXI/GSC in November, 2024. NuSTAR follow-up confirmed that MAXI J1752$-$457 is coincident with the previously observed Einstein Probe source, EP240809a. We performed a spectral analysis of the source during both NuSTAR observations, and we confirm that the hard X-ray spectra are consistent with the inclusion of a spherical blackbody component. At about 79 hours after the onset of the superburst, we find a blackbody temperature of $kT_\mathrm{bb}=0.60\pm0.1$ keV and $R_\mathrm{bb}/D_{8}=6.0^{+0.4}_{-0.3}$ km (not including corrections for scattering in the neutron star atmosphere), where $D_{8}$ is the source distance, which is not yet known, in units of 8 kpc. Furthermore, we report a hard X-ray excess which is fit well by a power law with photon index $\Gamma\approx4$, much steeper than those typically seen during accretion onto neutron stars at similar luminosities. We infer that the electron energy distribution in the Comptonizing medium which gives rise to the power law component differs significantly compared to purely accretion-powered neutron star transients even several days after the onset and rapid decay of superbursts. We also performed an energy-resolved timing analysis which showed that the source variability was dominated by red noise in the Comptonization component, suggesting coupling with an accretion disk, rather than being seeded by thermal emission from the neutron star surface.

 - **Abstract**
 We search for Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) using the spectral lag data for GRB 190114C using frequentist analysis, where we deal with the astrophysical nuisance parameters using profile likelihood. For this use case, we find a global minima for the $\chi^2$ as a function of energy scale of LIV ($E_{QG}$), well below the Planck scale. The best-fit $2\sigma$ central intervals for $E_{QG}$ are given by $2.81^{+0.96}_{-0.72}\times 10^{14}$ GeV and $9.10^{+2.59}_{-0.64}\times 10^{5}$ for linear and quadratic LIV, respectively and agree with the Bayesian estimates hitherto obtained in a previous work. Therefore, the results from frequentist analysis GRB 190114C agrees with Bayesian analysis and presents yet another proof of principles applications of profile likelihood in the search for LIV.

 - **Abstract**
 The KM3NeT research infrastructure comprises two neutrino telescopes located in the deep waters of the Mediterranean Sea, namely ORCA and ARCA. KM3NeT/ORCA is designed for the measurement of neutrino properties and KM3NeT/ARCA for the detection of high\nobreakdashes-energy neutrinos from the cosmos. Neutrinos are indirectly detected using three\nobreakdashes-dimensional arrays of photo\nobreakdashes-sensors which detect the Cherenkov light that is produced when relativistic charged particles emerge from a neutrino interaction. The analogue pulses from the photo\nobreakdashes-sensors are digitised offshore and all digital data are sent to a station on shore where they are processed in real time using a farm of commodity servers and custom software. In this paper, the design and performance of the software that is used to filter the data are presented. The performance of the data filter is evaluated in terms of its purity, capacity and efficiency. The purity is measured by a comparison of the event rate caused by muons produced by cosmic ray interactions in the Earth's atmosphere with the event rate caused by the background from decays of radioactive elements in the sea water and bioluminescence. The capacity is measured by the minimal number of servers that is needed to sustain the rate of incoming data. The efficiency is measured by the effective volumes of the sensor arrays.

 - **Abstract**
 The architectures of exoplanet systems are likely set during the initial planet-formation phase in the circumstellar disk. To understand this process, we have to study the earliest phases of planet formation. Complex sub-structures, believed to be driven by embedded planets, have been detected in a significant portion of disks observed at high angular resolution. We aim to extend the sample of such disks to low stellar masses and to connect the disk morphology to the expected proto-planet properties. We resolve the disk in the 2MASSJ16120668-3010270 system for the first time in scattered near-infrared light on scales of 10 au using VLT/SPHERE and reveal an exceptionally structured disk. We find an inner disk (inside 40 au) with two spiral arms, separated by a gap from an outer ring. By comparison with hydrodynamic models, we find that these structures are consistent with the presence of an embedded gas giant with a mass range between 0.1 and 5 MJup depending on the employed model. Our SPHERE observations find a tentative candidate point source within the disk gap, which may be consistent with this mass range if it indeed traces thermal emission by an embedded planet. This interpretation is somewhat strengthened by the proximity of this signal to compact mm continuum emission in the disk gap, which may trace circumplanetary material. It is, however, unclear if this tentative companion candidate could be responsible for the observed disk gap size, given its close proximity to the inner disk. The 2MASSJ16120668-3010270 system is one of only a few systems that shows this exceptional morphology of spiral arms located inside a scattered light gap and ring. We speculate that this may have to do with a higher disk viscosity compared with other systems such as PDS 70.

 - **Abstract**
 X-ray spectral fitting in high-energy astrophysics can be reliably accelerated using Machine Learning. In particular, Simulation-based Inference (SBI) produces accurate posterior distributions in the Gaussian and Poisson regime for low-resolution spectra, much faster than other exact approaches such as Monte Carlo Markov Chains or Nested Sampling. We now aim to highlight the capabilities of SBI for high-resolution spectra, as what will be provided by the newAthena X-ray Integral Field Unit (X-IFU). The large number of channels encourages us to use compressed representations of the spectra, taking advantage of the likelihood-free inference aspect of SBI. Two compression schemes are explored, using either simple summary statistics, such as the counts in arbitrary bins or ratios between these bins. We benchmark the efficiency of these approaches using simulated X-IFU spectra with various spectral models, including smooth comptonised spectra, relativistic reflexion models and plasma emission models. We find that using simple and meaningful summary statistics is much more efficient than working directly with the full spectrum, and can derive posterior distributions comparable to those from exact computation using nested sampling. Multi-round inference converges quickly to the good solution. Amortized single round inference requires more simulations, hence longer training time, but can be used to infer model parameters from many observations afterwards. Information from the emission lines must be accounted for using dedicated summary statistics. SBI for X-ray spectral fitting is a robust technique that delivers well calibrated posteriors. This approach shows great promises for high-resolution spectra, offering its potential for the scientific exploitation of the X-IFU. We now plan to apply it to the current era of high-resolution telescopes, and further challenge this approach with real data.

 - **Abstract**
 As a soft X-ray imager with unprecedentedly large field of view, EP/WXT has detected many (fast) X-ray transients, whose nature is very intriguing. Whether there is gamma-ray counterpart for the X-ray transient provides important implications for its origin. Some of them have been reported to be associated with GRB, however, a systematic study on the gamma-ray emission of these X-ray transients is lacking. In this work, we implemented a comprehensive targeted search for gamma-ray counterparts to 63 X-ray transients reported by EP/WXT during its first year of operation, using the dedicated multiple-instrument search pipeline, ETJASMIN, with GECAM-B, GECAM-C, Fermi/GBM, and \textit{Insight}-HXMT data. We find that 14 out of 63 (22\%) EP/WXT X-ray transients have gamma-ray counterparts. For other transients, ETJASMIN pipeline provided upper limit of gamma-ray emission, which is more stringent than that given by individual instrument. Moreover, we investigated the properties of the X-ray transients and their gamma-ray counterparts, and explored the relation between the x-ray transient and gamma-ray counterpart.

 - **Abstract**
 Current gravitational-wave data reveal structures in the mass function of binary compact objects. Properly modelling and deciphering such structures is the ultimate goal of gravitational-wave population analysis: in this context, non-parametric models are a powerful tool to infer the distribution of black holes from gravitational waves without committing to any specific functional form. Here, we aim to quantitatively corroborate the findings of non-parametric methods with parametrised models incorporating the features found in such analyses. We propose two modifications of the currently favoured PowerLaw+Peak model, inspired by non-parametric studies, and use them to analyse the third Gravitational Wave Transient Catalogue. Our analysis marginally supports the existence of two distinct, differently redshift-evolving subpopulations in the black hole primary mass function, and suggests that, to date, we are still unable to robustly assess the shape of the mass ratio distribution for symmetric ($q>0.7$) binaries.

 - **Abstract**
 The inner ~200 pc region of the Milky Way contains a nuclear stellar disc and a nuclear star cluster that are embedded in the larger Galactic bar. These stellar systems overlap spatially, which makes it challenging to separate stars that belong to the nuclear stellar systems, to deduce their internal dynamics, and to derive the central Galactic potential. Discrete stellar kinematics probe the mass distribution of a stellar system, and chemical tracers such as stellar metallicity can further separate multiple stellar populations that can have distinct kinematic properties. We took advantage of the information provided by discrete stellar kinematics and the metallicity in the Galactic centre using discrete chemo-dynamical modelling. We fitted axisymmetric Jeans models to discrete data of 4,600 stars. We fitted the stars as either one population plus a background component or as two populations plus a background that represents the bar. We tested the robustness of the inferred gravitational potential against a varying mass of the supermassive black hole, including dark matter, or a radially varying mass-to-light ratio. We obtained robust results on the fit with a single population and a background component. We obtained a supermassive black hole mass of (4.35$\pm 0.24) \times 10^6$ M$_\odot$, and we find that a dark matter component and radial variation in the mass-to-light ratio are negligible. We derived the enclosed mass profile of the inner ~60 pc and found a lower mass than reported in the literature in the region of ~5-30 pc. In our two-population fit, we found a high-[M/H] population that contributes more than 90% to the total stellar density. The properties of the high-[M/H] population are consistent with in situ formation after gas inflow from the Galactic disc via the bar. The distinct kinematic properties of the low-[M/H] population indicate a different origin. [abridged]

          The jet-feedback mechanism in common envelope evolution of planetary nebula progenitors

 - **Abstract**
 Using the stellar evolution code MESA, we mimic the negative jet feedback mechanism in common envelope evolution (CEE) of low-mass main sequence stars, M2=0.1-0.3Mo, spiraling inward inside the envelopes of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) or red giant branch (RGB) stars and find that the jets reduced the envelope density, therefore the jets' power, by a factor of ~0.5/(M2/0.1Mo). We mimic the energy that the jets deposit into the envelope by depositing energy into the outer envelope, a process that inflates the envelope, therefore reducing the density in the vicinity of the main sequence star, the accretion rate, and the jets' power. In deriving this expression for the negative jet feedback coefficient, we assume that the actual mass accretion rate is a fraction 0.2-0.5 of the classical Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton mass accretion rate and that the jets carry a fraction 0.25-0.5 of the accretion energy onto the main sequence star. Our study is another step in establishing the major role of jets in the onset and early phase of CEE, a possible grazing envelope evolution phase, and in transient events, such as luminous red novae, which these processes can power.

 - **Abstract**
 Leptonic one-zone radiation models are commonly used to describe multi-wavelength data and explore the physical properties of high-energy sources, such as active galactic nuclei. However, these models often require a large number of free parameters. In the context of possible parameter degeneracy and the complex landscape of the parameter space, we study how the choice of the fitting procedure impacts the characterization of the source properties. Furthermore, we examine how the data coverage and the uncertainties associated to the data influence the model parameter degeneracy. We generated simulated spectral energy distribution datasets with different properties, which we then fit with a numerical model. The model describes the relevant radiation processes with seven free parameters. We compare different optimization algorithms and study the parameter degeneracy using t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding. Additionally, we applied the same fitting procedures to the observational data of two sources, Mrk 501 and PKS 0735+178. We demonstrate significant degeneracies in the seven-dimensional parameter space of the one-zone leptonic models caused by the incomplete wavelength coverage of the data. Given the same goodness-of-fit function, the best-fit result depends on the choice of the minimization algorithm. Source properties extracted from the best-fit solution to realistic datasets cannot be interpreted as the only solution due to significant degeneracies of the model parameters. Adding new energy ranges (e.g. MeV) and regular source monitoring would allow to reduce gaps in the data and significantly decrease the parameter degeneracy.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent studies suggest that the density structure of turbulent molecular clouds in the Milky Way and the Andromeda galaxy, M31, aligns with expectations from hydrostatic equilibrium (HE) and virial equilibrium (VE). This study extends the study of the M31 clouds by matching their observed surface densities to a spatially-averaged solution of the Lane-Emden equation. The results affirm that the M31 molecular clouds exhibit density profiles expected from HE, further supporting the earlier conclusion that VE holds at all radii within the clouds. This study also discusses HE in the context of the turbulent interstellar medium, considering energy balance, cloud lifetimes, and the pressure of the interstellar medium. A comparison between the Galactic and extragalactic clouds indicates that both share similar dynamical states. These findings contribute to a broader understanding of the interplay between turbulence, gravitational stability, and cloud evolution in the molecular interstellar medium.

 - **Abstract**
 The interstellar hydride hydroxyl (OH) is a potential tracer of CO-dark molecular gas. We present new absorption line observations of OH at 18-cm wavelength towards four continuum sources. We compare these to the [CII] line at 1.9 THz obtained with SOFIA, observations of the neutral atomic hydrogen 21 cm line with the VLA, and CO lines obtained with APEX. We trace OH over a large range of molecular hydrogen column densities, and derive OH abundances with respect to molecular and total hydrogen column densities. Increased sensitivity and spectral resolution allowed us to detect weak and narrow features. We identify only one OH absorption component out of 23 without CO counterpart, yet several with intermediate molecular gas fractions. A potential association of [CII] 158 mu m emission with an OH absorption component is seen toward one sightline. Our results confirm that OH absorption traces molecular gas across diffuse and dense environments of the interstellar medium. At the sensitivity limits of the present observations our detection of only one CO-dark molecular gas feature appears in agreement with previous studies. We conclude that if OH absorption was to be used as a CO-dark molecular gas tracer, deeper observations or stronger background targets are necessary to unveil its full potential as a CO-dark molecular gas tracer, and yet it will never be an exclusive tracer of CO-dark molecular gas. For OH hyperfine-splitting transitions in the vicinity of photodissociation regions in W43-South, we detect a spectral and spatial offset between the peak of the inversion of the OH 1612 MHz line and the absorption of the OH 1720 MHz line on the one hand, and the absorption of the OH main lines on the other hand, which provides additional constraints on the interpretation of the OH 18 cm line signatures typical of HII regions.

 Venus has regained attention on the international stage with the approval of three new missions by ESA and NASA. As the twin sister of Earth, Venus exhibits a distinct atmosphere, which casts a veil of mystery over the planetary evolution and is of great scientific significance. One of the most important components of Venus-the cloud-is believed to have significantly regulated its climate evolution and affect the environmental habitability. However, due to sparse in-situ measurements and the limitation of remote sensing, properties of these clouds remain largely unknown. Based on research conducted in past decades, this article reviews the observational structure of cloud properties, the progress of microphysical and simplified cloud model developments, and perspectives of future directions of this research field. Several possible solutions to the challenges associated with the coupling effect, ultraviolet absorption, and habitability are proposed and discussed in details, providing insights for future Venus' explorations.

 Primordial black holes (PBHs) constitute a compelling dark matter candidate whose gravitational effects could significantly influence early cosmic structure formation. We investigate the impact of PBHs on Population III star formation through detailed $N$-body and hydrodynamic simulations, extending beyond previous semi-analytical approaches. Our results reveal a mass-dependent dichotomy in PBH effects: massive PBHs ($M_{\rm PBH} \gtrsim 10^2 M_\odot$) with sufficient abundance can accelerate structure formation and shift Pop III formation to higher redshifts, potentially conflicting with observational constraints from high-redshift galaxy surveys. Conversely, lower-mass PBHs can induce tidal disruption of gas-rich minihalos, suppressing star formation and delaying the cosmic dawn depending on their abundance. We quantify these competing effects to derive new constraints on the PBH mass function and their contribution to the total dark matter density, with implications for forthcoming observations with the James Webb Space Telescope and 21-cm cosmology experiments.

 We present the validation of TOI-2407 b, a warm Neptune-sized planet with a radius of 4.26 $\pm$ 0.26 R$_\oplus$, orbiting an early M-type star with a period of 2.7 days and an equilibrium temperature of 705 $\pm$ 12 K. The planet was identified by TESS photometry and validated in this work through multi-wavelength ground-based follow-up observations. We include an observation with the novel CMOS-based infrared instrument SPIRIT at the SPECULOOS Southern Observatory. The high-precision transit data enabled by CMOS detectors underscore their potential for improving the detection and characterisation of exoplanets orbiting M-dwarfs, particularly in the infrared, where these stars emit most of their radiation. TOI-2407 b lies within the boundaries of the period-radius Neptune desert, an apparent scarcity of Neptune-sized planets at short orbits. Further characterisation of TOI-2407 b, such as radial velocity measurements, will refine its position within planetary demographic trends. This system also provides a comparison case for the well-studied Neptune-sized planet Gliese 436 b, of similar radius, period and stellar type. Comparison studies could aid the understanding of the formation and evolution of Neptune-like planets around M-dwarfs.

 - **Abstract**
 New generation galaxy surveys targeting constraints on local primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG) demand $N$-body simulations that accurately reproduce its effects. In this work, we explore various prescriptions for the initial conditions of simulations with PNG, aiming to optimise accuracy and minimise numerical errors, particularly due to aliasing. We have used $186$ runs that vary the starting redshift, LPT order, and non-Gaussianities ($f^{\rm local}_{\rm NL}$ and $g^{\rm local}_{\rm NL}$). Starting with $3$LPT at a redshift as low as $z_{\rm ini}\simeq 11.5$ reproduces to $<1 \%$ the power spectrum, bispectrum and halo mass function of a high-resolution reference simulation. The aliasing induced by the PNG terms in the power spectrum produces a $ \leq 3 \%$ excess small-scale power at the initial conditions, dropping below $0.1\%$ by $z=0$. State-of-the-art initial condition generators show a sub-percent agreement. We show that initial conditions for simulations with PNG should be established at a lower redshift using higher-order LPT schemes. We also show that removing the PNG aliasing signal is unnecessary for current simulations. The methodology proposed here can accelerate the generation of simulations with PNG while enhancing their accuracy.

 - **Abstract**
 The properties of satellite halos provide a promising probe for dark matter (DM) physics. Observations motivate current efforts to explain surprisingly compact DM halos. If DM is not collisionless but has strong self-interactions, halos can undergo gravothermal collapse, leading to higher densities in the central region of the halo. However, it is challenging to model this collapse phase from first principles. To improve on this, we seek to better understand numerical challenges and convergence properties of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) N-body simulations in the collapse phase. Especially we aim for a better understanding of the evolution of satellite halos. To do so, we run SIDM N-body simulations of a low mass halo in isolation and within an external gravitational potential. The simulation setup is motivated by the perturber of the stellar stream GD-1. We find that the halo evolution is very sensitive to energy conservation errors, and a too large SIDM kernel size can artificially speed up the collapse. Moreover, we demonstrate that the King model can describe the density profile at small radii for the late stages that we have simulated. Furthermore, for our highest-resolved simulation (N = 5x10^7) we make the data public. It can serve as a benchmark. Overall, we find that the current numerical methods do not suffer from convergence problems in the late collapse phase and provide guidance on how to choose numerical parameters, e.g. that the energy conservation error is better kept well below 1%. This allows to run simulations of halos becoming concentrated enough to explain observations of GD-1 like stellar streams or strong gravitational lensing systems.

 We discuss the model of astrophysical emission at millimeter wavelengths used to characterize foregrounds in the multi-frequency power spectra of the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) Data Release 6 (DR6), expanding on Louis et al. (2025). We detail several tests to validate the capability of the DR6 parametric foreground model to describe current observations and complex simulations, and show that cosmological parameter constraints are robust against model extensions and variations. We demonstrate consistency of the model with pre-DR6 ACT data and observations from Planck and the South Pole Telescope. We evaluate the implications of using different foreground templates and extending the model with new components and/or free parameters. In all scenarios, the DR6 $\Lambda$CDM and $\Lambda$CDM+$N_{\rm eff}$ cosmological parameters shift by less than $0.5\sigma$ relative to the baseline constraints. Some foreground parameters shift more; we estimate their systematic uncertainties associated with modeling choices. From our constraint on the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich power, we obtain a conservative limit on the duration of reionization of $\Delta z_{\rm rei} < 4.4$, assuming a reionization midpoint consistent with optical depth measurements and a minimal low-redshift contribution, with varying assumptions for this component leading to tighter limits. Finally, we analyze realistic non-Gaussian, correlated microwave sky simulations containing Galactic and extragalactic foreground fields, built independently of the DR6 parametric foreground model. Processing these simulations through the DR6 power spectrum and likelihood pipeline, we recover the input cosmological parameters of the underlying cosmic microwave background field, a new demonstration for small-scale CMB analysis. These tests validate the robustness of the ACT DR6 foreground model and cosmological parameter constraints.

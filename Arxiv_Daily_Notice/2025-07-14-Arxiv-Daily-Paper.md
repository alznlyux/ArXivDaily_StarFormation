 - **Abstract**
 The identification of stellar structures in the Galactic halo, including stellar streams and merger remnants, often relies on the dynamics of their constituent stars. However, this approach has limitations due to the complex dynamical interactions between these structures and their environment. Perturbations such as tidal forces exerted by the Milky Way, the potential escape of stars, and passages through the Galactic plane can result in the loss of dynamical coherence of stars in these structures. Consequently, relying solely on dynamics may be insufficient for detecting such disrupted or dispersed remnants. We combine chemistry and dynamics, integrated through a system of neural networks, to develop a clustering method for identifying accreted structures in the Galactic halo. We developed an integrated approach combining Siamese neural networks (SNNs), graph neural networks (GNNs), autoencoders, and the OPTICS algorithm to create a comprehensive procedure named CREEK. This method is designed to uncover stellar structures in the Galactic halo. Initially, CREEK was trained on known globular clusters (GCs) and then applied to the dataset to identify stellar streams. CREEK successfully recovered 80% of the GCs present in the APOGEE dataset, re-identified several known stellar streams, and identified a potential new stream. Additionally, within highly populated stellar structures, CREEK can identify substructures that exhibit distinct chemical compositions and orbital energies. This approach provides an objective data-driven method for selecting stars associated with streams and stellar structures in general.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic inflation provides a compelling framework for explaining several observed features of our Universe, but its viability depends on an efficient reheating phase that converts the inflaton's energy into Standard Model particles. This conversion often proceeds through non-perturbative mechanisms such as parametric resonance, which is described by Hill's equation. In this work, we investigate how stochastic fluctuations in the parameters of Hill's equation can influence particle production during reheating. We show that such fluctuations can arise from couplings to light scalar fields, and can significantly alter the stability bands in the resonance structure, thereby enhancing the growth of fluctuations and broadening the region of efficient energy transfer. Using random matrix theory and stochastic differential equations, we decompose the particle growth rate into deterministic and noise-induced components and demonstrate analytically and numerically that even modest noise leads to substantial particle production in otherwise stable regimes. These results suggest that stochastic effects can robustly enhance the efficacy of reheating across a wide swath of parameter space, with implications for early Universe cosmology, UV completions involving multiple scalar fields, and the resolution of the cosmological moduli problem.

 - **Abstract**
 Central to our understanding of stellar evolution and its impact on processes in our Galaxy and across the Universe is the study of mass loss. While the general framework is well established, recent JWST observations of objects like NGC 3132 have revealed intricate nebular structures, suggesting complex mass-loss processes likely driven by multiple star system at its core. These findings pose new challenges for the currently available investigation tools. The primary goal of this study is the first detailed comparison of the physical properties and chemical composition obtained for NGC 3132, based on the latest detailed 3D model and observations from MUSE, JWST and Spitzer. We evaluate the reliability of the traditional empirical method and photoionization model for abundances estimations, both based on the same available high-quality, spatially resolved observations. We find that the model and empirical method yield consistent results for the integrated total properties such as Te, ne and chemical abundances. However, when applied to simulated observations from the model, the empirical method fails to recover the model input abundances, providing only an approximate estimate. This discrepancy arises in part from the loss of information when summing fluxes over regions which have complex ionisation structures. This discrepancy in the case of oxygen has been estimated to be up to 35%. Moreover, the latest IR data reveal a spatial correlation between H2, c(Hb) as well as the [8.0]/[4.5] IRAC ratio. Finally, new clumps are discovered in [Ni II] 7378 Å, [Fe II] 8617 Åand [Fe III] 5270 Åemission lines.

 - **Abstract**
 One of the most commonly observed solar radio sources in the metric and decametric wavelengths is the solar noise storm. These are generally associated with active regions and are believed to be powered by the plasma emission mechanism. Since plasma emission emits primarily at the fundamental and harmonic of the local plasma frequency, it is significantly affected by density inhomogeneities in the solar corona. The source can become significantly scatter-broadened due to the multi-path propagation caused by refraction from the density inhomogeneities. Past observational and theoretical estimates suggest some minimum observable source size in the solar corona. The details of this limit, however, depends on the modeling approach and details of the coronal turbulence model chosen. Hence pushing the minimum observable source size to smaller values can help constrain the plasma environment of the observed sources. In this work, we for the first time, use data from the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope in the 250--500 MHz band, to determine multiple instances of very small-scale structures in the noise storms. We also find that these structures are stable over timescales of 15--30 minutes. By comparing the past observations of Type III radio bursts and noise storms, we hypothesize that the primary reason behind the detection of these small sources in noise storm is due to the local environment of the noise storm. We also build an illustrative model and propose some conditions under which the minimum observable source size predicted by theoretical models, can be lowered significantly.

          Measuring the Neutrino Flux in Segments along the Galactic Plane with IceCube

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-ray emission from the plane of the Milky Way is understood as partly originating from the interaction of cosmic rays with the interstellar medium. The same interaction is expected to produce a corresponding flux of neutrinos. In 2023, IceCube reported the first observation of this galactic neutrino flux at 4.5$\sigma$ confidence level. The analysis relied on neutrino flux predictions - based on gamma ray observations - to model the expected neutrino emission from the galactic plane. Three signal hypotheses describing different possible spatial and energy distributions were tested, where the single free parameter in each test was the normalization of the neutrino flux. We present first results of an analysis that can improve the characterization of Galactic neutrino emission by dividing the galactic plane into segments in galactic longitude. An unbinned maximum-likelihood analysis is used that can fit the spectral index and the flux normalization separately in each segment. While gamma ray telescopes can not differentiate between hadronic and leptonic emission, neutrino production must come from hadronic processes. Measuring a spectral index can further help to understand the contribution of unresolved neutrino sources inside the galactic plane. This work uses a full-sky cascade dataset and provides model-independent insight into the variation of the neutrino flux and energy distribution from different regions of the galactic plane.

          JWST Discovery of Warm Dust in the Circumgalactic Medium of the Makani Galaxy

 - **Abstract**
 We report the detection of near- and mid-infrared emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) out to ~ 35 kpc in the Makani Galaxy, a compact massive galaxy with a record-breaking 100-kpc scale starburst-driven wind at redshift z = 0.459. The NIRCam and MIRI observations with JWST take advantage of a coincidental match between the PAH spectral features at 3.3, 7.7, and (11.3 + 12.2) microns in Makani and the bandpasses of the MIRI and NIRCam filters. The warm dust is not only detected in the cool-gas tracers of the galactic wind associated with the more recent (7 Myr) starburst episode, but also in the outer warm-ionized gas wind produced by the older (0.4 Gyr) episode. The presence of PAHs in the outer wind indicates that the PAHs have survived the long (R/v ~ 10^8 yrs) journey to the halo despite the harsh environment of the galactic wind. The measured F1800W/F1130W flux ratios in the unresolved nucleus, inner halo (R = 10 - 20 kpc), and outer halo (R = 20 - 35 kpc), tracers of the PAH (11.3 + 12.2)/7.7 ratios, indicate decreasing starlight intensity incident on the PAHs, decreasing PAH sizes, and increasing PAH ionization fractions with increasing distance from the nucleus. These data provide the strongest evidence to date that the ejected dust of galactic winds survives the long journey to the CGM, but is eroded along the way.

 - **Abstract**
 The recent discovery of the third interstellar object (3I/ATLAS) expands the known census from two to three and significantly improves statistical inferences regarding the underlying galactic population. 3I/ATLAS exhibits detectable activity that may increase as the object approaches perihelion. In this paper, we argue that the cometary activity likely significantly contributes to 3I/ATLAS's brightness, since the nuclear size of 3I/ATLAS assuming an asteroidal reflectance implies an untenable interstellar object mass per star. 3I/ATLAS exhibits an excess velocity of $v_\infty=58$ km/s relative to the Sun which is significantly larger than that of 1I/`Oumuamua or 2I/Borisov. This velocity implies that 3I/ATLAS is relatively old in comparison to previous interstellar objects. Here, we calculate the posterior distribution of ages implied by the kinematics of the interstellar objects and find that 3I/ATLAS is likely $\sim3-11$ Gyr old, assuming that the interstellar object and stellar age-velocity relations are equivalent. We also calculate the distribution of host star metallicities and find that 3I/ATLAS likely originated in a lower-metallicity system than the previous interstellar objects. These results show that interstellar object formation is likely efficient at low metallicities and early in the history of the Galaxy. Finally, we estimate and approximate interstellar object formation rate throughout Galactic history implied by these three objects.

          The Blue Lurker WOCS 14020: A Long-Period Post-Common-Envelope Binary in M67 Originating from a Merger in a Triple System

 - **Abstract**
 We present Hubble Space Telescope far-ultraviolet (FUV) spectra of a blue-lurker$-$white-dwarf (BL-WD) binary system in the 4 Gyr open cluster M67. We fit the FUV spectrum of the WD, determining it is a C/O WD with a mass of $0.72^{+0.05}_{-0.04}$ M$_\odot$ and a cooling age of $\sim400$ Myr. This requires a WD progenitor of $\sim3$ M$_\odot$, significantly larger than the current cluster turnoff mass of 1.3 M$_\odot$. We suggest the WD progenitor star formed several hundred Myr ago via the merger of two stars near the turnoff of the cluster. In this scenario, the original progenitor system was a hierarchical triple consisting of a close, near-equal-mass inner binary, with a tertiary companion with an orbit of a few thousand days. The WD is descended from the merged inner binary, and the original tertiary is now the observed BL. The likely formation scenario involves a common envelope while the WD progenitor is on the AGB, and thus the observed orbital period of 359 days requires an efficient common envelope ejection. The rapid rotation of the BL indicates it accreted some material during its evolution, perhaps via a wind prior to the common envelope. This system will likely undergo a second common envelope in the future, and thus could result in a short-period double WD binary or merger of a 0.72 M$_\odot$ C/O WD and a 0.38 $M_\odot$ Helium WD, making this a potential progenitor of an interesting transient such as a sub-Chandrasekhar Type Ia supernova.

 - **Abstract**
 Searches for astrophysical neutrino sources in IceCube rely on an unbinned likelihood that consists of an energy and spatial component. Accurate modeling of the detector, ice, and spatial distributions leads to improved directional and energy reconstructions, resulting in increased sensitivity. In this work, we utilize our best knowledge of the detector ice properties and detector calibrations to reconstruct in-ice particle showers. The spatial component of the likelihood is parameterized either by a 2D Gaussian or a von Mises Fisher (vMF) distribution at small and large angular uncertainties, respectively. Here, we use a gradient-boosted decision tree with a vMF spatial likelihood loss function, reparameterized through two coordinate transformations, to predict per-event point spread functions (PSF). Additionally, we discuss the search for PeV cosmic ray sources using the IceCube Multi-Flavor Astrophysical Neutrino (ICEMAN) sample. Our search contains both an analysis of individual neutrino sources coincident with greater than 100 TeV gamma-ray sources and also a stacking analysis. We outline the prospects for extended neutrino emission originating from the Cygnus Cocoon region.

 - **Abstract**
 The IceCube Neutrino Observatory has measured an isotropic astrophysical neutrino flux through various detection channels for over 12 years. IceCube has also detected neutrino emission from the Galactic plane at the 4.5$\sigma$ significance level compared to a background-only hypothesis, testing three models of Galactic diffuse emission: Fermi-LAT $\pi^0$, KRA$_{\gamma}^{5}$, KRA$_{\gamma}^{50}$. We present an analysis combining 3 detection channels: throughgoing tracks, starting tracks and cascades. The throughgoing track sample is restricted to the northern sky to reduce atmospheric backgrounds, while the starting track and cascade samples reduce the atmospheric neutrino backgrounds in the southern sky by vetoing accompanying muons. We will use this combination of event samples from 12.1 years of data to measure the Galactic neutrino spectrum in the TeV to PeV energy range and independently for multiple galactic regions in a model independent procedure. We will simultaneously measure the isotropic cosmic neutrino flux.

          Development of a laser stabilized on an ultra-stable silicon cryogenic Fabry-Perot cavity for dark matter detection

 - **Abstract**
 Astrophysical observations suggest the existence of an unknown kind of matter in the Universe, in the frame of the $\Lambda$CDM model. The research field of dark matter covers an energy scale going from massive objects to ultra-light scalar fields, which are the focus of the present work. It is supposed that ultra-light scalar fields affect the length of objects, whereas the speed of light stays unchanged. It follows that Fabry-Perot cavities are ideal tools for ultra-light dark matter detection since the fluctuations in the length of a cavity can be detected on the frequency of the laser stabilized to it. At FEMTO-ST, we have set up an ultra-stable silicon cavity suitable for a test of detection of ultra-light dark matter in an energy range close to 10$^{-10}$ eV. Our 14 cm cavity is composed of two mirrors optically bonded to an ultra-rigid spacer, with each element made in single-crystal of silicon, and cooled at 17 K in order to cancel the first order thermal expansion coefficient of the silicon spacer. The projected fractional frequency stability of the laser is $3 \times 10^{-17}$, mainly limited by the thermal noise of the amorphous dielectric reflective coatings. To reach this remarkable stability, several effects have to be reduced below the thermal noise limit. While the contribution of the residual amplitude modulation is now acceptable, we are currently implementing a laser power lock with residual fluctuations lower than 3~nW and a piezoelectric-based servo loop to actively reduce the vibration noise that has to be inferior to $-110 \textrm{~dB(m s}^{-2})^2/\textrm{Hz}$ at 1 Hz. Here, we present both the status of the development of our ultra-stable laser and the mechanical response of the cavity in the presence of ultra-light dark matter.

          Detecting Intermediate-mass Black Holes Using Miniature Pulsar Timing Arrays in Globular Clusters

 - **Abstract**
 Theoretical models predict that intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) exist in globular clusters (GCs), but observational evidence remains elusive. Millisecond pulsars (MSPs), which are abundant in GCs and have served as precise probes for gravitational waves (GWs), offer a unique opportunity to detect potential IMBH binaries in GCs. Here, we consider the possibility of using multiple MSPs in a GC to form a miniature pulsar timing array (PTA), so as to take advantage of their correlated timing residuals to search for potential IMBH binaries in the same cluster. Our semi-analytical calculations reveal that nearby IMBH binaries around MSPs in GCs could induce microsecond-level timing residuals. In GCs like $\omega$ Centauri and M15, favorable configurations are found which could lead to the detection of binaries with mass ratios $q\gtrsim0.1$ and orbital periods of a few days. We estimate that future higher-precision timing programs could achieve $100$-nanosecond sensitivity, substantially expanding the searchable parameter space and establishing mini-PTAs as powerful detectors of IMBHs.

          GW231123: a Binary Black Hole Merger with Total Mass 190-265 $M_{\odot}$

 - **Abstract**
 On 2023 November 23 the two LIGO observatories both detected GW231123, a gravitational-wave signal consistent with the merger of two black holes with masses $137^{+22}_{-17}\, M_\odot$ and $103^{+20}_{-52}\, M_\odot$ (90\% credible intervals), at luminosity distance 0.7-4.1 Gpc and redshift of $0.39^{+0.27}_{-0.24}$, and a network signal-to-noise ratio of $\sim$22.5. Both black holes exhibit high spins, $0.9^{+0.10}_{-0.19}$ and $0.80^{+0.20}_{-0.51}$ respectively. A massive black hole remnant is supported by an independent ringdown analysis. Some properties of GW231123 are subject to large systematic uncertainties, as indicated by differences in inferred parameters between signal models. The primary black hole lies within or above the theorized mass gap where black holes between 60-130 $M_\odot$ should be rare due to pair instability mechanisms, while the secondary spans the gap. The observation of GW231123 therefore suggests the formation of black holes from channels beyond standard stellar collapse, and that intermediate-mass black holes of mass $\sim$200 $M_\odot$ form through gravitational-wave driven mergers.

          Evidence of .Ia Supernova Detonations in 3D Hydrodynamical Simulations of Double Degenerate Mergers

 - **Abstract**
 We report detailed 3D simulations of 1.1 $\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ Oxygen-Neon (ONe) white dwarfs (WDs) merging with a 0.35 $\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ helium WD, conducted with the moving-mesh hydrodynamic code AREPO. The simulations utilise self-consistent chemical profiles for the primary WD which were generated by a stellar evolution code incorporating the effects of semi-degenerate carbon burning. We find that a helium detonation is ignited at the base of the helium layer, starting a thermonuclear runaway which encircles the WD and ejects material as a sub-luminous supernovae. Our canonical simulation, (C-120), ejects 0.103 $\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ of primarily $^{4}\mathrm{He}$, $^{28}\mathrm{Si}$, and $^{32}\mathrm{S}$, after which the primary begins accreting again from the surviving secondary. Our results depend qualitatively on the "inspiral time" simulation parameter, which describes the length of a period of accelerated angular momentum loss. For example, the binary does not survive when inspiral time is too long. We compare the results using our self-consistent chemical profiles to a constant-composition WD structure and find the same explosion pattern when the inspiral time is short. However, we are able to obtain a typical Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) which destroys the primary by using the constant-composition structure and long inspiral. The shock-convergence in this simulation follows the "x-scissor mechanism" described by Gronow et al. in 2020, and causes a secondary detonation due to higher temperatures and higher number density of $^{12}\mathrm{C}$ at the convergence site. These results highlight the potential for unrealistic outcomes when conducting simulations that incorporate unrealistically large enhancements in angular momentum losses and (or) non-realistic chemical structures for the primary WD.

 - **Abstract**
 The maximum grain size in protoplanetary disks is a critical parameter for planet formation, as the efficiency of mechanisms like streaming instability and pebble accretion depend on grain size. Even young class 0/I objects, such as HL Tau, show substructures in their disks, indicating the potential for early planet formation. In this study, we investigated the grain size in the dust surrounding the class I object WL 17 using the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array. Observations were conducted across seven frequency bands (Q, Ka, K, Ku, X, C, and S bands) ranging from 2 to 48 GHz, corresponding to wavelengths of 15 cm to 6.3 mm, with a spatial resolution exceeding 0\farcs5. While the ring structure at 0\farcs1 of WL 17 remains unresolved in our data, its emission is clearly detected at all observed frequencies, except at 2 GHz. To estimate the maximum grain size ($a_{\rm max}$) within the ring, we compared the observed spectral energy distribution (SED) with theoretical SEDs calculated for various $a_{\rm max}$ values using radiative transfer models. Assuming the dust opacity follows the DSHARP model, our analysis suggests that certain structures internal to the ring achieved a maximum grain size of approximately 4.2 mm. Additionally, we discuss the gravitational stability of the ring and the potential planetary core mass that could form through pebble accretion within the structure.

 - **Abstract**
 The supernova remnant (SNR) RCW86 is among the few SNRs with Balmer-emission lines containing broad and narrow spectral components that trace fast, non-radiative shocks in partially-ionized gas.\ These are invaluable laboratories for collisionless shock physics, especially for poorly-understood phenomena like electron-ion equilibration, and shock precursors. Here we present the first $\sim$0.3 pc spatial scale integral field unit (IFU) observations of the southwestern RCW86 shock, obtained as part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-V Local Volume Mapper (SDSS-V LVM). The forward shock, clearly visible as thin filaments in narrowband images, have broad H$\alpha$ components, indicating shock velocities varying from 500--900 km/s in the south to 1000--1500 km/s in the north. The varying velocity widths and broad-to-narrow intensity ratios show that electrons and ions have lower equilibration ($T_e/T_p \rightarrow 0.1$) in faster ($>$800 km/s) shocks, in line with previous studies. The broad components are generally redshifted from the narrow components by $\lesssim$100 km/s, likely due to shock-obliquity or non-Maxwellian post-shock distributions. We observe high extinction-corrected Balmer-decrements of 3--5 in the narrow components, indicating that conversion of Ly$\beta$ photons to H$\alpha$ is more efficient than Ly$\gamma$ to H$\beta$. Broad HeII$\lambda$4686 was marginally ($\gtrsim$2$\sigma$) detected in the southern shock, meaning the shock is impacting gas with high ($>$30--100\%) neutral fraction. We also find the first evidence of an intermediate H$\alpha$ component in RCW86, with $\Delta$V(FWHM) = 193--207 km/s, likely due to a neutral precursor. We also briefly discuss the southwestern radiative shock, and lay out the exciting future of studying astrophysical shocks with LVM.

          Evaluating the Limits of Rotation Period Recovery through Gyrochronology Criteria

 - **Abstract**
 Contamination from nearby sources often compromises stellar rotation periods derived from photometric light curves, particularly in data with large pixel scales such as TESS. This problem is compounded when both the target and contaminant are intrinsically variable, a scenario that challenges deblending algorithms, which often assume constant contaminants. We assess the reliability of rotation period detections using wide binary systems, whose components share a common age and rotational history. By applying gyrochronology constraints, we identify period combinations that yield consistent ages between components, helping to isolate true rotation signals. Simulating blends with degraded Kepler data, our method recovers correct rotation periods with an 88\% success rate for periods $<12$ days, where TESS detections are most reliable. Applying this framework to nearly 300 wide binaries observed by TESS, we find that despite significant contamination, a subset of pairs shows consistent gyrochronological ages. We establish a practical detection threshold for TESS blended observations, finding that periods shorter than $\sim8$ days are reliably recovered, while those longer than $\sim10$ days become significantly more challenging and often remain unresolved. As expected, rotation periods are more often recovered when the highest-amplitude periodogram peak is linked to the brighter star and the second to the dimmer star, although many cases deviate from this pattern, indicating it cannot always be assumed. Our results highlight the limitations of standard deblending methods and demonstrate that astrophysical constraints, such as gyrochronology, provide a valuable tool for extracting reliable rotation periods from complex photometric blends.

 - **Abstract**
 The X-ray transient source EP240309a/EP\,J115415.8$-$501810 was first detected by the Wide-Field X-ray Telescope (WXT) on board Einstein Probe (EP) during the commissioning phase. Subsequent optical observations confirmed it as a Cataclysmic Variable of the intermediate polar type with a 238.2\,s spinning white dwarf in a $\sim$3.76\,hr orbit. We report on the source discovery and follow-up studies made with the Follow-up X-ray Telescope (FXT) of EP. A periodic variation of 231\,s is detected in the 0.3$-$2\,keV band, while no obvious pulsation appears in the 2$-$10\,keV band. The spectral analysis shows that the X-ray emission could be described by an absorbed bremsstrahlung model with $kT$\textgreater\,11\,keV. The partial covering absorption, with an hydrogen column density $N_H$ = 2.0$\times 10^{22}\,\rm cm^{-2}$ and covering fraction around 0.9, is much larger than the interstellar absorption along the line of sight. According to the distance $d = 309.5$\,pc obtained from Gaia parallax, we estimate that the luminosity of this source in the 0.3$-$10\,keV range is $\sim 2\times10^{32}$\,erg\,s$^{-1}$. In addition, phase-resolved spectral analysis reveals that the detected periodic variation is mainly caused by the change in the absorption column density. In this scenario the spin modulation arises due to absorption from the pre-shock accretion flow of the X-ray emitting pole, while the optical radiation is modulated at the orbital side band ($\omega_{\rm spin} - \Omega_{\rm orbit}$) due to reprocessing in regions within the binary system. Due to its unusual transient behaviour for an intermediate polar, we have also searched for radio signals similar to those observed in the new class of long period transients. We derived upper limits with ASKAP (200--300\,$\mu$Jy\,beam$^{-1}$ between 800--1500 MHz) and MWA (40--90\,mJy\,beam$^{-1}$ between 80--300 MHz).

 - **Abstract**
 Cubesats present unique opportunities for observational astronomy in the modern era. They are useful in observing difficult-to-access wavelength regions and long-term monitoring of interesting astronomical sources. However, conventional telescope designs are not necessarily the best fit for restricted envelope of a Cubesat. Additionally, fine-pointing stability on these platforms is difficult due to the low mass of the spacecraft and special allocations within the optical design are needed to achieve stable pointing. We propose afocal telescope designs as the framework to realise imagers and low-resolution spectrographs on Cubesat platforms. These designs help reduce the number of components in the optical chain and aim to improve throughput and sensitivity compared to conventional designs. Additionally, they also provide a fine steering mechanism within a collimated beam section. Fine beam steering within the collimated beam section avoids issues of image degradation due to out-of-plane rotation of the image plane or offset in the rotation axis of the mirror. This permits the use of simple and mostly off-the-shelf tip-tilt mirrors for beam steering. The designs discussed here also allow for a standard telescope design to be used in many instrument types; thus reducing the complexity as well as the development time and cost. The optical design, performance and SNR estimations of these designs along with some interesting science cases are discussed. A number of practical aspects in implementation such as guiding, tolerancing, choice of detectors, vibration analysis and laboratory test setups are also presented.

 - **Abstract**
 We have obtained spectroscopic observations for four short-period variable objects detected in ZTF, Gaia, and Pan-STARRS (ZGP) data and classified as Blue Large-Amplitude Pulsators (BLAPs) in McWhirter and Lam (2022): ZGP-BLAP-03, ZGP-BLAP-04, ZGP-BLAP-10, and ZGP-BLAP-15. The variables have periods between 46 and 56 min, full amplitudes of 0.13-0.22 mag in the $r$ band, and light curve shapes typical for radially pulsating stars. Three of them were found at high galactic latitudes (|$b$|>30 deg). We have identified object ZGP-BLAP-03 as an early F-type star, while objects ZGP-BLAP-04 and ZGP-BLAP-15 as low-metallicity late A-type stars. These are the three objects found at high galactic latitudes and located several kiloparsecs from the Sun. Thus, they are SX Phoenicis-type variable stars residing in the Galactic halo. In the case of low-latitude object ZGP-BLAP-10, we report the presence of helium lines in its spectrum and atmospheric parameters in agreement with known BLAPs. This and other results indicate that BLAPs are absent in metal-poor environments.

 - **Abstract**
 The discovery of quasars and their supermassive black holes (SMBHs) over $10^{9} M_{\odot}$ merely hundreds of millions of years after the Big Bang generates tension with the idea of Eddington-limited accretion and pressures the community into exploring the concept of massive black hole seeds and/or super-Eddington accretion. The observation that many black holes have reached supermassive status while obeying the Eddington limit is puzzling as accretion models are not spherically symmetric. We address this issue by illustrating the physics behind a picture of inner disk accretion involving a geometrically thick, hot quasi-spherical flow and argue that such an inner region provides the radiation that instantiates the Eddington limit. Given the energetics of the inner disk edge, we show how the characteristic electron cross-section drops below its Thomson value, allowing black holes to grow rapidly despite being Eddington-limited. Indeed, after implementing a modified cross-section calculated via the Klein-Nishina Formula, we find that SMBH formation time drops by up to $47\%$. In this context, we show how a $10^{9} M_{\odot}$ black hole can form from a seed $10 M_{\odot}$ black hole within $500$ Myr by way of accretion and mergers. While our picture is over-simplified and contrived in a number of ways that we discuss, we suggest that our scenario is interesting in that it offers a solution to two issues at the intersection of astrophysics and cosmology, namely the reason the Eddington limit is obeyed and how some black holes have grown rapidly despite that limit.

 - **Abstract**
 The accuracy of state-of-the-art Extreme Precision Radial Velocity (EPRV) spectrographs depends on the access to extremely precise and stable wavelength calibration sources. There are several available calibration sources (e.g., emission lamps, laser frequency combs, reference cavities) that can be used to calibrate an astronomical spectrograph. However, the calibration as it is currently performed is always 'local'. In the proposed talk we will present the NuAncestor concept that proposes an accurate (absolute) and common wavelength calibration for astronomical high-resolution, high-precision spectrographs by embarking an optical frequency comb on-board a satellite equipped with an actively pointing telescope and precision orbitography. This calibration satellite shall be available and serve EPRV spectrographs in all major observatories around the world.

 - **Abstract**
 An innovative optical module (OM) with segmented light-sensitive area has been developed for IceCube-Gen2 that will take neutrino astronomy at the South Pole to the next level. It builds on the successful features of the mDOM and D-Egg modules of IceCube Upgrade while adapting to the smaller borehole diameter of IceCube-Gen2. The newly developed OM, which is being tested in IceCube Upgrade, serves as a prototype for the planned mass production of about 10,000 OMs for IceCube-Gen2. To simplify the assembly process, important changes were made to the design, in particular to integrate the new gel pad concept. This replaces the 3D-printed support structure of the mDOM while maintaining through total internal reflection the increased light collection efficiency of the reflector rings. In addition, the design features local generation of high voltage for each photomultiplier tube (PMT) via a Cockcroft-Walton circuit and the full digitization of the signal on each PMT base with a sampling rate of 60 MSpS. This significantly reduces the complexity of the mainboard so that it fits into the limited space available. This article describes the development status and presents the performance of the first prototypes.

 - **Abstract**
 IceCube measured the diffuse astrophysical neutrino flux for all flavors up to PeV energies. The high energy (TeV-PeV) IceCube cascade sample is particularly effective at selecting electron and tau neutrinos. We present the results of Single Power Law (SPL) and Broken Power Law (BPL) flux measurements based on 11 years of cascade data. From this cascade sample, we study the identification of high energy (~100 TeV) tau neutrinos by detecting a double cascade signature produced by a charged-current neutrino interaction and the subsequent decay of the tau lepton. A Boosted Decision Tree (BDT) is employed to search for the double cascade signature, achieving a significantly improved signal-to-background ratio of 9:1 compared to previous analyses. The selected sample has a tau-neutrino purity of approximately 90% and a weighted mean reconstruction error on the tau decay length of about 4m. We present sensitivities for a maximum likelihood fit of the flavor composition and constraints on the astrophysical neutrino flavor ratios using this sample in combination with IceCube's northern muon neutrino-induced track sample.

 - **Abstract**
 A precise understanding of the optical properties of the instrumented Antarctic ice sheet is crucial to the performance of optical Cherenkov telescopes such as the IceCube Neutrino Observatory and its planned successor, IceCube-Gen2. One complication arising from the large envisioned footprint of IceCube-Gen2 is the larger impact of the so-called ice tilt. It describes the undulation of ice layers of constant optical properties within the detector. In this contribution, we will describe the project to build a co-deployed laser dust logger. This is a device to measure the stratigraphy of impurities in the ice to derive the ice tilt. It consists of a light source that will be co-deployed with the photosensor modules, meaning it is part of the deployment string and operated during the deployment of the detector. The newly developed device will be tested during the deployment of the IceCube Upgrade in the 2025/26 austral summer to pave the way for IceCube-Gen2.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the relationship between the gamma-ray emission measured with Fermi-LAT and radio signatures of coronal shock waves in four behind-the-limb (BTL) solar flares. All events were associated with metric type II radio burst. Both start and end times of the radio bursts were synchronized with the gamma-ray emission. The type II bursts associated with the BTL gamma-ray flares had higher speeds and lower formation heights than those of an average sample. These findings support the notion that the highly relativistic ions that produce the gamma-rays in BTL flares are accelerated at CME-driven propagating coronal shock waves rather than in large-scale coronal loops.

 We present the discovery and confirmation of the ultra-short period (USP) planet TOI-2431 b orbiting a nearby ($d\sim36$ pc) late K star ($T_{\mathrm{eff}}$ = $4109 \pm 28 \, {\rm K}$) using observations from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), precise radial velocities with the NEID and the Habitable-zone Planet Finder (HPF) spectrographs, as well as ground-based high contrast imaging from NESSI. TOI-2431 b has a period of 5 hours and 22 minutes, making it one of the shortest-period exoplanets known to date. TOI-2431 b has a radius of $1.536 \pm 0.033\, \rm{R_\oplus}$, and a mass of $6.2 \pm 1.2\, \rm{M_\oplus}$, suggesting it has a density compatible with an Earth-like composition and, due to its high irradiation, is likely a 'lava-world' with a $T_{\mathrm{eq}}$ = $2063 \pm 30 \, {\rm K}$. We estimate that the current orbital period is only 30% larger than the Roche-limit orbital period, and that it has an expected orbital decay timescale of only $\sim$31 Myr. Finally, due to the brightness of the host star ($V = 10.9$, $K = 7.6$), TOI-2431 b has a high Emission Spectroscopy Metric of 27, making it one of the best USP systems for atmospheric phase-curve analysis.

          Beyond LambdaCDM: How the Hubble tension challenges early universe physics

 - **Abstract**
 Differences in the values of the Hubble constant obtained from the local universe and the early universe have resulted in a significant tension. This tension signifies that our understanding of cosmology (physical processes and/or cosmological data) is incomplete. Some of the suggested solutions include physics of the early Universe. In this paper we aim to investigate common features of various early universe solutions to the Hubble constant tension. The physics of the early universe affects the size of the sound horizon which is probed with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data. Within the standard model, the size of the horizon (within limits of current measurements) is affected by processes that could occur between (approximately) 1 day after the Big Bang and the last scattering instant. We focus on simple extensions incorporating Early Dark Energy (EDE) and show how such a model affects the inferred values of the Hubble constant. We compare this model to LambdaCDM models using MCMC analysis, likelihoods over the parameter space and Bayesian evidence. The MCMC analysis shows that EDE leads to a decrease in the size of the sound horizon that is consistent with H0 = 73.56 km/s/Mpc but we also show that MCMC analysis favours increasing redshift and proportion of EDE. The Bayesian evidence favours our EDE model for very narrow, finely-tuned parameter space. The LambdaCDM model used for comparison has good evidence across a wide parameter space. We interpret this as an indication that more sophisticated models are required. We conclude that if the Hubble tension were to be related to the physics of the early universe, EDE could be used as a window to explore conditions of the early universe and extend our understanding of that era.

          Determination of the energy scale of cosmic ray measurements using the Auger Engineering Radio Array

 - **Abstract**
 The accurate determination of the absolute energy scale in cosmic ray measurements is both a challenging and fundamentally important task. We present how measurements of radio pulses from extensive air showers with the Auger Engineering Radio Array, combined with per-event simulations of radio emission using the CoREAS extension of CORSIKA, allow us to determine the energy scale of cosmic rays between $3\cdot 10^{17}$\,eV and several $10^{18}$\,eV. Our analysis accounts for many factors, each of which is controlled on the 5\% level or better. The absolute calibration of the antennas and the entire analog signal chain builds on a Galactic calibration in combination with a detailed understanding of the antenna-gain patterns. Additional key elements include compensation for temperature-dependent signal amplification, continuous detector health monitoring, an active veto for thunderstorm conditions, an unbiased event reconstruction, and per-event atmospheric modeling in the simulations. The analysis benefits from a high-statistics dataset of over 800 measured cosmic ray showers. We describe our analysis method, perform multiple cross-checks, and evaluate systematic uncertainties. We find that absolute energies determined with AERA are 12\% higher than those established with the Auger Fluorescence Detector, a result well in agreement within systematic uncertainties and thus a strong independent confirmation of the absolute energy scale of the Pierre Auger Observatory.

 Since 2021, the Open Data Portal has provided access to the Pierre Auger Observatory's data for both the scientific community and the general public. The data release process has been in place since the Observatory's foundation. It continues to be strengthened as outlined in the approved policy and the Observatory's Data Management Plan. More than 80 000 cosmic-ray events above $10^{17}$ eV, detected with the surface and fluorescence detectors, have been released at various levels, from calibrated traces to high-level reconstruction parameters. Additionally, atmospheric data and low-energy particle counting rates have been made available for space weather studies. The Collaboration is committed to releasing FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data, along with accompanying software and detailed documentation, enabling users to perform their own queries and analyses for both research and educational purposes. These datasets have already served as a basis for several scientific papers and have been widely used in various outreach activities. After 20 years of stable data acquisition, the Pierre Auger Collaboration will disclose 30% of the cosmic ray events above $2.5 \cdot 10^{18}$ eV collected with the main surface detector array between 2004 and 2022, corresponding to an exposure of about 24 000 km$^2$ sr yr, together with events detected with the fluorescence detector and used for energy calibration. This release will provide an unprecedented public dataset for ultra-high-energy cosmic rays, enabling in-depth studies of their properties. Together with the published catalog of the 100 most energetic events recorded, this initiative represents the Pierre Auger Collaboration's strong commitment to distributed and collective knowledge, sharing progress with the entire scientific community.

 - **Abstract**
 The Auger Engineering Radio Array (AERA) consists of 153 autonomous antenna stations deployed over 17 km^2 to measure the radio emission from extensive air showers initiated by cosmic rays with energies between 0.1 and 10 EeV in the 30 to 80 MHz frequency band. It operates in coincidence with the other detectors of the Pierre Auger Observatory particularly the Surface Detector (SD) and the Fluorescence Detector (FD). As the largest cosmic-ray radio detector worldwide before the recent Observatory upgrade AugerPrime, AERA has played a pioneering role in the development of radio technique for cosmic rays, providing complementary measurements and serving as a testbed for ideas that motivated the build-up of a new Radio Detector (RD) as part of AugerPrime. We report on measurements of the depth of the shower maximum using the radio footprint, demonstrating compatibility and competitive resolution with established FD results. An absolute calibration of AERA is achieved by monitoring the sidereal modulation of the diffuse Galactic radio emission for nearly a decade, confirming the long-term stability of a radio detector with no significant aging effects observed. This stability suggests that radio detectors could also be used to monitor potential aging effects in other detector systems. Additionally, we investigate the muon content of inclined air showers using hybrid SD-AERA events. Our results indicate that the muon content in measured data is consistent with expectations for iron nuclei as predicted by current-generation hadronic interaction models, confirming the well-known muon deficit for the first time with radio data. These findings reinforce the value of radio detection for cosmic-ray studies and provide a foundation for the next generation of analyses with the AugerPrime RD.

 - **Abstract**
 Although dark matter (DM) comprises 84\% of the matter content of the Universe, its nature remains unknown. One broad class of particle DM motivated by extensions of the Standard Model (SM) is weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs). Generically, WIMPs will scatter off nuclei in large celestial bodies such as the Sun, thus becoming gravitationally bound. Subsequently, WIMPs can annihilate to stable SM particles, ultimately releasing most of their energy as high-energy neutrinos which escape from the Sun. Thus, an excess of neutrinos from the Sun's direction would be evidence for WIMPs. The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is well-suited to such searches since it is sensitive to WIMPs with masses in the region preferred by supersymmetric extensions of the SM. I will present the results of IceCube's most recent solar WIMP search, which includes all neutrino flavors, covers the WIMP mass range from 20 GeV to 10 TeV, and has world-leading sensitivity over this entire range for most channels considered.

 - **Abstract**
 While IceCube's detection of astrophysical neutrinos at energies up to a few PeV has opened a new window to our Universe, much remains to be discovered regarding these neutrinos' origin and nature. In particular, the difficulty of differentiating electron- and tau-neutrino charged-current (CC) events limits our ability to measure precisely the flavor ratio of this flux. The Tau Air-Shower Mountain-Based Observatory (TAMBO) is a next-generation neutrino observatory capable of producing a high-purity sample of tau-neutrino CC events in the energy range from 1 PeV--100 PeV, i.e. just above the IceCube measurements. An array of water Cherenkov tanks and plastic scintillators deployed in the Colca Canyon will observe the air-shower produced when a tau lepton, produced in a tau-neutrino CC interaction, emerges from the opposite face and decays in the air. In this contribution, I will present the performance studies for TAMBO -- including the expected rates, effective areas, and discrimination potential -- as well as the simulation on which these studies are based.

          A thermonuclear supernova interacting with hydrogen- and helium-deficient circumstellar material. SN 2020aeuh as a SN Ia-CSM-C/O?

 - **Abstract**
 Identifying the progenitors of thermonuclear supernovae (Type Ia supernovae; SNe Ia) remains a key objective in contemporary astronomy. The rare subclass of SNe Ia that interacts with circumstellar material (Type Ia-CSM) allows for studies of the progenitor's environment before explosion, and generally favours single-degenerate progenitor channels. The case of SN Ia-CSM PTF11kx clearly connected thermonuclear explosions with hydrogen-rich CSM-interacting events, and the more recent SN 2020eyj connected SNe Ia with helum-rich companion progenitors. Here we present a study of SN 2020aeuh, a Type Ia-CSM with delayed interaction. We analyse photometric and spectroscopic data that monitor the evolution of SN 2020aeuh and compare its properties with those of peculiar SNe Ia and core-collapse SNe. At early times, the evolution of SN 2020aeuh resembles a slightly overluminous SN Ia. Later, the interaction-dominated spectra develop the same pseudocontinuum seen in Type Ia-CSM PTF11kx and SN 2020eyj. However, the later-time spectra of SN 2020aeuh lack hydrogen and helium narrow lines. Instead, a few narrow lines could be attributed to carbon and oxygen. We fit the pseudobolometric light curve with a CSM-interaction mode, yielding a CSM mass of 1-2 M$_{\odot}$. We propose that SN 2020aeuh was a Type Ia supernova that eventually interacted with a dense medium which was deficient in both hydrogen and helium. Whereas previous SNe Ia-CSM constitute our best evidence for nondegenerate companion progenitors, the CSM around SN 2020aeuh is more difficult to understand. We include a hydrodynamical simulation for a double-degenerate system to showcase how the dynamical evolution of such a progenitor scenario could produce the CSM observed around SN 2020aeuh. It is clear that SN 2020aeuh challenges current models for stellar evolution leading up to a SN Ia explosion.

 The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is currently the largest and most sensitive detector for astrophysical neutrinos and has pioneered the field of high-energy neutrino astronomy. Despite being designed with the primary goal of identifying astrophysical TeV neutrinos and their corresponding sources, recent studies, utilising the DeepCore subdetector, have shown IceCube's proficiency in being sensitive to astrophysical neutrinos at GeV energies. Currently, there is a gap in sensitivity between the supernova detection system at MeV energies and the lowest-energy triggering events around 1 GeV. In this contribution, we present the ongoing efforts to cover this gap and increase the sensitivity of IceCube to sub-GeV astrophysical neutrinos. Despite high background rates, we show how the complimentary use of manifold and supervised machine learning can make IceCube sensitive to neutrinos from transient sources down to energies of 100 MeV.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the spectrum of cosmic rays with energies above 2.5 EeV measured at the Pierre Auger Observatory after 19 years of operation, covering the period before the AugerPrime upgrade. Two independent event sets from the surface array of 1500 m-spaced detectors are combined, yielding a total exposure of approximately 100,000 km$^2$ sr yr. The first set includes events with zenith angles less than 60$^\circ$, while the second consists of events between 60$^\circ$ and 80$^\circ$, for which azimuthal asymmetries must be accounted for in the energy estimator. The threshold energy is chosen to ensure a trigger efficiency of the surface detector greater than 97%, thus minimizing composition biases. The energy scale is determined using high-quality fluorescence measurements, providing calorimetric estimates without reliance on simulations. A statistically successful combination is achieved within the uncorrelated systematic uncertainties of the individual spectra. All spectra are consistent when analyzing potential declination dependences, except for a mild modulation expected from the previously reported dipolar anisotropy. In particular, this statement applies to the northernmost declination band [+25$^\circ$,+45$^\circ$], where only contribute events with zenith angles between 60$^\circ$ and 80$^\circ$. Beyond the firmly established ankle and suppression spectral features, the combined spectrum across declinations $-90^\circ$ to +45$^\circ$ provides high-precision measurements of the instep feature with more than 5$\sigma$ confidence.

 - **Abstract**
 The interaction of cosmic rays with celestial bodies such as the Moon or the Sun produces a shadow in the arrival direction distribution of the cosmic rays reaching the Earth. Such deficits from an isotropic flux have been observed by astroparticle observatories below energies of $10^{15}\,$eV. Above this energy, measurements were limited due to the low number of events as a result of the steeply falling cosmic-ray flux with energy. With more than 10.6 million events recorded during 20 years of operation of the Pierre Auger Observatory, we report the first observation of the shadow of the Moon at an average energy of $7\times10^{17}\,$eV with a maximum significance above 3$\sigma$. The shadow is an end-to-end check that the celestial directions are correctly reconstructed from the air shower data, and it is used here to derive the effective angular resolution for this dataset. Additionally, we present the results of a similar study on the shadow of the Sun.

 - **Abstract**
 The Schrödinger-Poisson formalism has found a number of applications in cosmology, particularly in describing the growth by gravitational instability of large-scale structure in a universe dominated by ultra-light scalar particles. Here we investigate the extent to which the behaviour of this and the more general case of a Schrödinger-Newton system, can be described in terms of classical fluid concepts such as viscosity and pressure. We also explore whether such systems can be described by a pseudo-Reynolds number as for classical viscous fluids. The conclusion we reach is that this is indeed possible, but with important restrictions to ensure physical consistency.

          A new type-1 transition in NGC 1346 revealed by (spectro)polarimetry

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first photo- and spectropolarimetric observations of the changing-look active galactic nucleus NGC~1346 taken with the Perkins telescope (November 2022, March 2025) and VLT/FORS2 (August and September 2024), which have revealed a new spectral transition. We find that NGC~1346 has reverted to its former (2001) type-1 spectral state after having been a type-2 active galactic nucleus from 2004 to 2022. More and more intense broad H$\beta$ (3720 $\pm$ 310 km.s$^{-1}$ full width at half maximum) and H$\alpha$ (2985 $\pm$ 230 km.s$^{-1}$) emission lines appeared between August and September 2024, suggesting that the broad-line region (BLR) is increasingly irradiated. The strong blueshift of the Balmer lines ($\sim$ 1600 km.s$^{-1}$) indicates that the gas is moving toward the observer, possibly due to a radiation-driven outflow. The strong difference between 2022's ($\sim$ 3\%) and 2024-2025's de-biased polarization ($\le$ 0.5\%), the blueing of the spectra between August and September 2024, and the slow rise in the integrated flux between 2022 and 2025 argue against asymmetric or temporary obscuration by a cloud passing in front of the line of sight. Two options, either a re-illumination of the BLR or a tidal disruption event, can explain the observed properties of NGC~1346. Timely follow-up observations taken while the phenomenon is still ongoing are needed to determine which of the two solutions is the correct one.

 - **Abstract**
 We report on the follow-up observations with XMM-Newton of two X-ray binary candidates identified in the first eROSITA all-sky survey data (eRASS1), 1eRASS J061330.8+160440 and 1eRASS J161201.9-464622. Based on the obtained results, in particular, the observed X-ray spectra and lack of pulsations, as well as properties of the identified optical counterparts, we conclude that both candidates are unlikely to be XRBs. Based on LAMOST optical spectroscopy and SED fit results for 1eRASS J061330.8+160440 we classify it as an M0 chromospherically active subgiant star. ZTF and TESS photometry reveal highly significant period for this object of 7.189 days, which likely attributed to starspot(s). On the other hand, SALT follow-up spectroscopy of 1eRASS J161201.9-464622 solidly classifies this source as a bright novalike cataclysmic variable (CV), the second discovered with eROSITA. A persistent 4.802 h signal is found across all three available TESS observations, and is tentatively identified as the orbital period of the binary. Follow-up high-speed photometry and time-resolved spectroscopy are required to confirm the derived orbital modulation.

 - **Abstract**
 Antares is the closest red supergiant (RSG) to Earth. The discovery of linear polarization in the atomic lines of the star opens the path to produce direct images of the photosphere, hence probing the dynamics at the surface. We analyze this linear polarization signals following the same scheme as has been previously done for the RSG Betelgeuse, and find that they are comparable in all its details. This allows us to use the same models for the analysis of these polarization signals in both stars. We found that as in Betelgeuse, the linear polarization signal of Antares is due to the depolarization of the continuum combined with brightness inhomogeneities. This allows us to produce images of the photosphere of star. We show that in Antares, convective cells can last several months and occupy roughly 30\% of the stellar radius for the largest ones.

 - **Abstract**
 The Calorimetric Electron Telescope (CALET), in operation on the International Space Station since 2015, collected a large sample of cosmic-ray (CR) iron and sub-iron events over a wide energy interval. In this paper we report an update of our previous measurement of the iron flux and we present - for the first time - a high statistics measurement of the spectra of two sub-iron elements Cr and Ti in the energy interval from 10 to 250 GeV/n. The analyses are based on 8 years of data. Differently from older generations of cosmic-ray instruments which, in most cases, could not resolve individual sub-iron elements, CALET can identify each nuclear species from proton to nickel (and beyond) with a measurement of their electric charge. Thanks to the improvement in statistics and a more refined assessment of systematic uncertainties, the iron spectral shape is better resolved, at high energy, than in our previous paper and we report its flux ratio to chromium and titanium. The measured fluxes of Cr and Ti show energy dependences compatible with a single power law with spectral indices $-2.74 \pm 0.06$ and $-2.88 \pm 0.06$, respectively.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the growth of cosmic structures in the thermodynamically consistent generalised mass-to-horizon entropic cosmology (MHEC). For the Bekenstein case the entropic energy density augments the Friedmann equations without modifying the Hawking temperature and automatically satisfies the Clausius relation, thereby avoiding the inconsistencies that afflicted earlier entropy-force models. We then derive the linear perturbation equations, emphasising the distinction between a fully perturbed interaction term and the common approximation in which the perturbation is neglected. Numerical solutions show that fully perturbed follows the LCDM matter-growth history within the current growth uncertainties. Our results demonstrate that MHEC matches both background and growth probes as well as LCDM without extra free parameters, providing a viable entropic explanation for recent accelerated expansion of the Universe.

 - **Abstract**
 We used multiple epochs of high-contrast imaging spectrophotometric observations to determine the atmospheric characteristics and thermal evolution of two previously detected benchmark L dwarf companions, HD 112863 B and HD 206505 B. We analyzed IRDIS and IFS data from VLT/SPHERE of each companion, both of which have dynamical masses near the stellar-substellar boundary. We compared each companion with empirical spectral standards, as well as constrained their physical properties through atmospheric model fits. From these analyses, we estimate that HD 112863 B is spectral type $\rm{L}3\pm1$ and that HD 206505 B is spectral type $\rm{L}2\pm1$. Using the BT-Settl atmospheric model grids, we find a bimodal solution for the atmospheric model fit of HD 112863 B, such that $T_{\rm{eff}}=1757^{+37}_{-36}$ K or $2002^{+23}_{-24}$ K and $\log{g}=4.973^{+0.057}_{-0.063}$ or $5.253^{+0.037}_{-0.033}$, while for HD 206505 B, $T_{\rm{eff}}=1754^{+13}_{-13}$ K and $\log{g}=4.919^{+0.031}_{-0.029}$. Comparing the bolometric luminosities of both companions with evolutionary models imply that both companions are likely above the hydrogen burning limit.

Its main component consists of a cubic-kilometer array of optical sensors deployed deep in the Glacial ice designed for the detection of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos. A surface array for cosmic ray air shower detection, IceTop, and a denser inner subdetector, DeepCore, significantly enhance the capabilities of the observatory, making it a multipurpose facility. This list of contributions to the 39th International Cosmic Ray Conference in Geneva, Switzerland (July 15-24, 2025) summarizes the latest results from IceCube covering a broad set of key questions in physics and astrophysics. The papers in this index are grouped topically to highlight IceCube contributions related to high-energy neutrino and multi-messenger astrophysics, atmospheric fluxes, cosmic-ray physics, low-energy neutrino transients, physics beyond the Standard Model, detector calibration and event reconstruction, and the status and performance of the IceCube Upgrade, a dense sensor infill complemented by calibration devices to be deployed by the end of 2025.

          Interpreting Hubble tension with a cascade decaying dark matter sector

 - **Abstract**
 Hubble tension can be alleviated by altering either early- or late-time $\Lambda$CDM. So far, extensive studies have shown that only early dark energy or ad hoc combinations of those two-fold effects can reduce the tension to $3\sigma$ or lower. In this work, we improve the later solution by considering a cascade decaying dark matter sector, where a parent particle produces relativistic dark matter in the early Universe and the dark matter subsequently decays to neutrinos in the late-time Universe. We parametrize this model with four model parameters, carry out a Markov Chain Monte Carlo fit to Planck 2018+BAO+Pantheon data sets, and compare it to Big Bang Nucleosynthesis limits, neutrino flux bounds, and Planck and SDSS data about matter power spectra. Within parameter regions reducing the Hubble tension to $3.2\sigma$ and compatible with the existing constraints, the main phenomenological features include a larger $S_{8}\sim 0.84$, smaller $n_{s}\sim 0.95$ and larger matter power spectra relative to the $\Lambda$CDM, which are left for future tests.

 - **Abstract**
 The cosmography known as the Padé polynomials has been widely used in the reconstruction of luminosity distance, and the orders of Padé polynomials influence the reconstructed result derived from Padé approximation. In this paper, we present a more general scheme of selecting optimal Padé polynomial for reconstruction of luminosity distance based on 10-fold cross-validation. Then the proposed scheme is applied to Pantheon+ dataset. The numerical results clearly indicate that the proposed procedure has a remarkable ability to distinguish Padé approximations with different orders for the reconstruction of the luminosity distance. We conclude that the (2,1) Padé approximation is the optimal approach that can well explain Pantheon+ data at low and high red-shifts. Future applications of this scheme could help choose the optimal model that is more suitable for cosmological observation data at hand and gain a deeper understanding of the universe.

          IceCube searches for GeV neutrino counterparts associated with high-energy starting events

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of the astrophysical neutrino flux observed by IceCube is largely unknown. To help decipher its astrophysical origin, we propose an IceCube analysis that conducts follow-up searches for GeV neutrinos associated with neutrino events above 60 TeV, which are known to have a high probability to be of astrophysical origin. It could not only identify a new component of the astrophysical neutrino flux, but also characterize how its spectrum extrapolates from GeV to PeV energies. This would in turn give valuable insights into the internal processes of neutrino sources. Astrophysical transients, such as collapsars, have been proposed as sources of time-correlated GeV- and high-energy neutrinos. Conducting this search in such short time scales allows for a substantial reduction in the dominant background rate for GeV neutrino candidate events. We introduce the statistical method and sensitivity of this search as well as dedicated data quality checks. None of the searches yield statistically significant results, and we present the first limits on GeV neutrino emission associated to VHE neutrino events at short time scales.

          Unambiguous GeV gamma-rays from molecular clouds illuminated by particles diffusing from the adjacent supernova remnant G335.2+0.1 that is confined in an expanding bubble

 - **Abstract**
 We report the detection of GeV gamma-ray emission likely associated with supernova remnant (SNR) G335.2+0.1 and the finding of a molecular cloud ($\sim20$--$30^\prime$ in angular size) that is very likely in physical contact with the SNR and responsible for the gamma-ray emission. Using the 16.8 yr Fermi-LAT data, an extended emission, with a significance of 13.5 $\sigma$ and a radius 0.24° in 0.2--500 GeV in the uniform-disk model, was found to the adjacent east of the SNR. With archival Mopra CO-line data, a large molecular clump at local-standard-of-rest velocity $\sim-48$ to $-43$ km s$^{-1}$ was revealed appearing coincident with the gamma-ray source. The SNR was found located in a cavity encircled by a 'C'-shaped ring-like molecular shell at $-45$ to $-43$ km s$^{-1}$. This morphological agreement, together with the position-velociy diagrams made along lines cutting across the cavity, suggests that the SNR was evolving in the expanding molecular bubble created by the stellar wind of the progenitor with a mass $\gtrsim 15 M_{\mathrm{sun}}$. The giant molecular cloud, visible at around $-46$ km s$^{-1}$, and the associated SNR are thus estimated to lie at a kinematic distance of 3.1 kpc, with the HI absorption taken into account. We suggest that the SNR has entered the radiative phase after the blastwave recently struck the cavity wall. With the evolutionary scenario of the SNR, we demonstrate that the gamma-ray emission reported here can be naturally interpreted by the hadronic interaction between the accelerated protons that escaped from the SNR shock and the eastern large molecular clump.

 The upgrade of Pierre Auger Observatory, AugerPrime, is a multi-hybrid system designed to improve the sensitivity and precision of ultra-high-energy cosmic ray measurements. It includes scintillator detectors positioned both atop the enhanced Water-Cherenkov detectors and buried nearby for direct muon measurements, along with radio and fluorescence detectors. In this contribution, we present an overview of the monitoring tools developed for all the components of AugerPrime, focusing on real-time performance assessment and long-term stability metrics. By continuously tracking key parameters, we can identify potential issues early, enabling timely interventions and improving overall data quality. These strategies are crucial for maintaining the long-term reliability of the measurements taken at the Auger Observatory and providing high-quality data for cosmic ray research in the coming decades.

 - **Abstract**
 Cometary impacts have been invoked as an atmosphere-independent method of stockpiling hydrogen cyanide (HCN), a key prebiotic feedstock molecule, into environments favourable for the onset of prebiotic chemistry on the early Earth. This work revisits the prospects for cometary delivery of HCN through new impacts simulations of idealised cometary bodies using the shock physics code iSALE combined with simple chemical modelling. Using temperature and pressure profiles for material within spherical, non-porous comets with a high resolution of Lagrangian tracer particles, we assess the survival rate of HCN across a range of impact velocities, sizes and angles, assuming both steady state and equilibrium chemistry. We find that HCN survival is extremely limited at impact velocities above the escape velocity of the Earth, unless the impact occurs at extreme obliquity ($\theta \sim 15^\circ$). We present a parametrisation of the survival of HCN as a function of impact velocity, angle, and cometary diameter, which provides an upper limit to survival in more realistic scenarios to aid with future studies investigating the role of comets in the origins of life. Although successful HCN delivery may be possible in our idealised model, we neglect to consider the effect of atmospheric passage and our results suggest that delivery alone is not likely to be sufficient for the onset of prebiotic chemistry.

 - **Abstract**
 The Pierre Auger Observatory is a hybrid detector designed to observe and study ultra-high-energy particles of extraterrestrial origin. With its 27 fluorescence telescopes and over 1600 autonomously operating water-Cherenkov detectors spread over an area of 3000 km$^2$, it is world-leading in terms of exposure to cosmic rays and offers an unparalleled window into the physical processes that happen at energy scales unattainable by particle accelerators on Earth. Measurement information of candidate air-shower events from all associated detectors and telescopes is collected at a central data-acquisition system located in the nearby town of Malargüe, and processed for higher-level physics analysis. On top of this, data for monitoring the long-term stability and operation of the observatory is forwarded to the central server as well. In this work, we briefly review the central data-acquisition system of the Pierre Auger Observatory. We examine the rates, efficiencies, and purity of detected events for Phase II of the Pierre Auger Observatory and compare them to performance parameters during Phase I. We detail challenges in the event detection up until now and present recent changes in the central data acquisition system and local station software that aim to streamline the data acquisition chain.

 - **Abstract**
 Neutrino observations are crucial for multi-messenger astronomy, but currently limited by effective area and atmospheric background. However, while other telescopes must point their limited field of view, IceCube can perform full-sky realtime follow-up of astrophysical transient sources with high uptime. For this, IceCube uses its Fast Response Analysis (FRA), which can provide results from an unbinned maximum likelihood analysis within tens of minutes of an astrophysical transient. Besides manually selected transient candidates, it also routinely scans areas of the sky compatible with gravitational wave alerts from LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA and the IceCube event singlets most likely to originate from an astrophysical source. Currently the analysis uses TeV muon neutrino candidate events whose signature permits especially precise angular reconstruction, selected and reconstructed at the South Pole and transmitted with low-latency over satellite. Recently, different event selections are also being included in IceCube analyses. These efforts include the follow-up of gravitational wave events with GeV neutrinos detected by IceCube-DeepCore and the observation of the Galactic plane with cascade events produced by all neutrino flavors. If made available on a day-scale latency, these event selections can also be used in FRAs. Moreso, multiple event samples can be combined in a Fast Response Analysis that is sensitive to a broader energy range of a neutrino transient spectrum and ensures the inclusion of all neutrino flavors. We present the analysis method and technical aspects of such an extension of the existing framework. This includes a proposed new pipeline allowing the inclusion of the more computationally-intensive reconstruction methods used by the aforementioned event selections. The extension is validated using example analyses implemented in this framework. (abbreviated)

 - **Abstract**
 The IceCube Neutrino Observatory has provided new insights into the high-energy universe, in particular, unveiling neutrinos from the galactic plane. However, galactic neutrino sources are still unresolved. The recent detection of multi-PeV photons by LHAASO from the Cygnus region highlights its potential as a galactic neutrino source. Additionally, LHAASO, HAWC, and HESS have reported over forty galactic gamma-ray sources with energies above 100 TeV. Detecting neutrinos correlated with high-energy gamma-ray sources would provide compelling evidence of cosmic-ray acceleration in these galactic sources. In this work, we compile a 12.3-year, full-sky, all-flavor dataset, the IceCube Multi-Flavor Astrophysics Neutrino sample (ICEMAN). ICEMAN is the combination of three largely independent neutrino samples of different event morphologies and builds upon the previous work of the DNN-based cascade sample, Enhanced Starting Track Event Selection, and the Northern Track sample. Recent improvements in ice modeling and detector calibration are also incorporated into the cascade reconstruction. In addition to revisiting the galactic plane, we adopt two different analysis methods to search for galactic PeVatrons. First, we use a template-based approach to probe the Cygnus Cocoon region. Second, we use a point source hypothesis to find correlations between IceCube neutrinos and gamma-ray sources detected at energies greater than 100 TeV.

 - **Abstract**
 Transient sources are among the preferred candidates for the sources of high-energy neutrino emission. Intriguing examples so far include blazar flares and tidal disruption events coincident with IceCube neutrinos. Here, we report the first all-flavor, all-sky time-dependent search for neutrino sources by combining IceCube throughgoing tracks, starting tracks and cascades. Throughgoing tracks provide the best sensitivity in the Northern Sky, while cascades have worse angular resolution but yield better sensitivity in the Southern Sky than tracks. The relatively new starting tracks sample has reduced contamination from atmospheric muons. This analysis takes advantage of the strengths of each of the datasets, combining them for increased statistics and obtaining the best accessible all-sky sensitivity for transient searches. In this search, we look for unbound $E^{-\gamma}$ power-law sources, as well as $E^{-2}$ sources with low and high-energy exponential cutoffs, optimizing the sensitivity for the duration of the flares.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a preliminary catalog of compact binary merger candidates from the ongoing fourth observing run (O4) of Advanced LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA, based on an analysis of public alerts distributed through GraceDB as of May 2025. We developed and applied methods to estimate the source-frame chirp mass for each candidate by utilizing information from public data products, including source classification probabilities, sky localizations, and observatory status. Combining our O4 analysis with previous catalogs, we provide updated estimates for the local merger rate density. For sources with chirp mass characteristic of binary neutron stars ($[1, 1.5]\,M_\odot$), we find a rate of $56^{+99}_{-40}$ $\textrm{Gpc}^{-3}\,\textrm{yr}^{-1}$. For systems in the expected neutron star--black hole chirp mass range ($[1.5, 3.5]\,M_\odot$), the rate is $36^{+32}_{-20}$ $\textrm{Gpc}^{-3}\,\textrm{yr}^{-1}$, and for heavier binary black holes ($[3.5, 100]\,M_\odot$), we estimate a rate of $19^{+4}_{-2}$ $\textrm{Gpc}^{-3}\,\textrm{yr}^{-1}$. This work provides an early glimpse into the compact binary population being observed in O4; we identify a number of high-value candidates up to signal-to-noise $\sim 80$, which we expect to enable precision measurements in the future.

 - **Abstract**
 The IceAct telescopes are Imaging Air Cherenkov telescopes installed as part of the IceCube Neutrino Observatory at the geographic South Pole. They consist of a 61 pixel camera and are small and robust to withstand the harsh environmental conditions. IceAct detects Cherenkov light produced by cosmic-ray particles with energies above approximately 10\,TeV interacting inside the atmosphere, which is complementary to the measurement of the air shower at the surface by IceTop and the high-energy muons in the deep ice. Two telescopes have been taking data since 2019 with a conservative estimated duty cycle of around 10\%. A graph neural network is used to reconstruct the basic air shower properties, like geometry and primary energy. This work focuses on the current progress in analyzing the energy spectrum of cosmic rays using IceAct data.

 - **Abstract**
 Non-relativistic effective field theories (NREFTs) play a crucial role in various areas of physics, from cold atom experiments to cosmology. In this paper, we present a systematic framework for deriving NREFTs from relativistic theories with generic self-interactions. Our approach allows for (but is not limited to) non-power-law potentials (such as those arising from dilatons or axions) or potentials that are non-analytic around the classical vacuum (such as those with logarithmic radiative corrections). These are of theoretical and phenomenological interest but have largely been unexplored in the non-relativistic regime. NREFTs are typically viewed as approximations for systems with low velocities, weak couplings, and small field amplitudes. The latter assumption is relaxed in our approach, as long as the mass term remains dominant (ensuring the validity of the non-relativistic limit). Additionally, we establish an effective fluid description for the non-relativistic scalar field, identifying key quantities such as energy density, pressure, and sound speed. To enable cosmological applications, we extend our formalism to account for the expanding universe, providing a reliable tool for investigating ultra-light dark matter models with arbitrary self-interactions. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of our NREFT in analyzing solitons, which is also relevant to cosmology for studying celestial objects such as boson stars and the cores of dark matter halos.

          The Effective Field Theory of Large Scale Structure for Mixed Dark Matter Scenarios

 - **Abstract**
 We initiate a systematic study of the perturbative nonlinear dynamics of cosmological fluctuations in dark sectors comprising a fraction of non-cold dark matter, for example ultra-light axions or light thermal relics. These mixed dark matter scenarios exhibit suppressed growth of perturbations below a characteristic, cosmologically relevant, scale associated with the microscopic nature of the non-cold species. As a consequence, the scale-free nonlinear solutions developed for pure cold dark matter and for massive neutrinos do not, in general, apply. We thus extend the Effective Field Theory of Large Scale Structure to model the coupled fluctuations of the cold and non-cold dark matter components, describing the latter as a perfect fluid with finite sound speed at linear level. We provide new analytical solutions wherever possible and devise an accurate and computationally tractable prescription for the evaluation of the one-loop galaxy power spectrum, which can be applied to probe mixed dark matter scenarios with current and upcoming galaxy survey data. As a first application of this framework, we derive updated constraints on the energy density in ultra-light axions using a combination of Planck and BOSS data. Our refined theoretical modeling leads to somewhat weaker bounds compared to previous analyses.

          Multi-frequency analysis of the ALMA and VLA high resolution continuum observations of the substructured disc around CI Tau. Preference for sub-mm-sized low-porosity amorphous carbonaceous grains

 - **Abstract**
 (Abridged) We present high angular resolution and sensitivity ALMA 3.1 mm and VLA 9.1 mm observations of the disc around CI Tau. These new data were combined with similar-resolution archival ALMA 0.9 and 1.3 mm observations and new and archival VLA 7.1 mm, 2.0, 3.0, and 6.0 cm photometry to study the properties of dust in this system. At wavelengths <3.1 mm, CI Tau's continuum emission is very extended and highly substructured (with three gaps, four rings, and two additional gap-ring pairs identified by non-parametric visibility modelling). Instead, the VLA 9.1 mm data are dominated by a bright central component, only partially (< 50%) due to dust emission, surrounded by a marginally detected, faint, and smooth halo. We fitted the ALMA and VLA 9.1 mm data together, adopting a physical model that accounts for the effects of dust absorption and scattering. For our fiducial dust composition ("Ricci" opacities), we retrieved a flat maximum grain size distribution across the disc radius of $(7.1\pm0.8)\times10^{-2}$ cm, that we tentatively attributed to fragmentation of fragile dust or bouncing. We tested, for the first time, the dependence of our results on the adopted dust composition model to assess which mixture can best reproduce the observations. We found that the "Ricci" opacities work better than the traditionally adopted "DSHARP" ones, while graphite-rich mixtures perform significantly worse. We also show that, for our fiducial composition, the data prefer low-porosity (< 70%) grains, in contrast with claims of highly porous aggregates in younger sources, which we tentatively justified by time-dependent compaction. Our results are in line with constraints from disc population synthesis models and naturally arise from CI Tau's peculiar spectral behaviour, making this disc an ideal target for deeper cm-wavelength and dust polarisation follow-ups.

 - **Abstract**
 We measure the amplitude of matter fluctuations over a wide range of redshifts by combining CMB lensing observations from ACT DR6 and $\textit{Planck}$ PR4 with the overdensity of quasars from Quaia, a $\textit{Gaia}$ and $\textit{unWISE}$ quasar catalog. Our analysis includes the CMB lensing power spectrum from ACT DR6, the auto-correlation of two Quaia quasar samples centered at $z \simeq 1.0$ and $z \simeq 2.1$, and their cross-correlations with CMB lensing from both ACT DR6 and $\textit{Planck}$ PR4. By performing a series of contamination and systematic null tests, we find no evidence for contamination in the lensing maps, contrary to what was suggested in previous Quaia cross-correlation analyses using $\textit{Planck}$ PR4 CMB lensing data. From the joint analysis of the quasar auto- and cross-correlations with CMB lensing, and including BOSS BAO data to break the degeneracy between $\Omega_m$ and $\sigma_8$, we obtain $\sigma_8 = 0.802^{+0.045}_{-0.057}$, consistent with $\Lambda$CDM predictions from $\textit{Planck}$ primary CMB measurements. Combining the CMB lensing auto-spectrum with the cross-correlation measurement improves the constraint on $\sigma_8$ by $12\%$ relative to the lensing auto-spectrum alone, yielding $\sigma_8 = 0.804 \pm 0.013$. This dataset combination also enables a reconstruction of structure growth across redshifts. We infer a $12\%$ constraint on the amplitude of matter fluctuations at $z > 3$, with a measurement at the median redshift of the signal of $\sigma_8(\tilde{z}=5.1) = 0.146^{+0.021}_{-0.014}$, consistent with $\textit{Planck}$ at the $1.4\sigma$ level. These results provide one of the highest redshift constraints on the growth of structure to date.

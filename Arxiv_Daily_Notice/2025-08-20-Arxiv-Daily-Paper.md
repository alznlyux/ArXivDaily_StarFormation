          From ANN to BNN: Inferring Reionization Parameters using Uncertainty-aware Emulators of 21-cm Summaries

 - **Abstract**
 Inferring astrophysical parameters from radio interferometric observations of the redshifted 21-cm signal from the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) is a challenging yet crucial task. The 21-cm signal from EoR is expected to be highly non-Gaussian; therefore, we need to use higher-order statistics, e.g., bispectrum. Moreover, the forward modeling of the signal and its statistics for a varying set of model parameters requires rerunning the simulations many times, which is computationally very expensive. To overcome this challenge, many artificial neural network (ANN) based emulators have been introduced, which produce the 21-cm summaries in a fraction of the time. However, ANN emulators have a drawback: they can only produce point-value predictions; thus, they fail to capture the uncertainty associated with their predictions. Therefore, when such emulators are used in the Bayesian inference pipeline, they cannot naturally propagate their prediction uncertainties to the estimated model parameters. To address this problem, we have developed Bayesian neural network (BNN) emulators for the 21-cm signal statistics, which provide the posterior distribution of the predicted signal statistics, including their prediction uncertainty. We use these BNN emulators in our Bayesian inference pipeline to infer the EoR parameters through 21-cm summaries of the mock observation of 21-cm signal with telescopic noise for $1000$ hr of SKA-LOW observation. We show that BNN emulators can capture the prediction uncertainty for the 21-cm power spectrum and bispectrum, and using these emulators in the inference pipeline provides better and tighter constraints on them. We reduced the training dataset and showed that, for smaller training datasets, BNN outperforms the ANN emulators. We also show that using the bispectrum as a summary statistic gives better constraints on EoR parameters than the power spectrum.

          The New Status Qvo? SN 2021qvo is Another 2003fg-like Type Ia Supernova with a Rising Light-Curve Bump

 - **Abstract**
 In recent years, multiple Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) have been observed with "bumps" in their rising light curves shortly after explosion. Here, we present SN 2021qvo: a SN Ia that exhibits a clear early bump in photometry obtained by the Young Supernova Experiment. Photometric and spectroscopic observations of SN 2021qvo show that it has a broader light curve, higher peak luminosity, shallower Si II $\lambda$5972 pseudo-equivalent width, and lower ejecta velocities than normal SNe Ia, which are all consistent with the characteristics of the 2003fg-like (often called "super-Chandrasekhar") SN subtype. Including SN 2021qvo, just four known 2003fg-like SNe Ia have sufficient pre-peak data to reveal a rising light-curve bump, and all four have bump detections. Host-galaxy analysis reveals that SN 2021qvo exploded in a low-mass galaxy ${\rm log}(M_{\ast}/M_{\odot}) = 7.83^{+0.17}_{-0.24}$, also consistent with other members of this class. We investigate the validity of the leading early-bump 2003fg-like SN Ia progenitor model, an interaction between the circumstellar material (CSM) and the SN ejecta, by modeling the early bump and subsequent light-curve evolution of SN 2021qvo with the Modular Open Source Fitter for Transients. We find that the bump can be modeled with a best-fit CSM mass of $\log_{10}(M_\mathrm{CSM}/M_{\odot}) = -2.33^{+0.26}_{-0.15}$. SN 2021qvo adds to the small but growing number of 2003fg-like SNe Ia with rising light-curve bumps; as the number of these SNe Ia with CSM estimates continues to grow, population-level inferences about the CSM distribution will be able to constrain the progenitor scenario for these SNe Ia.

 - **Abstract**
 Ultracompact X-ray binaries (UCXBs) are a subclass of low-mass X-ray binaries characterized by tight orbits and degenerate donors, which pose significant challenges to our understanding of their formation. Recent discoveries of black hole (BH) candidates with main-sequence (MS) or red giant (RG) companions suggest that BH-white dwarf (BH-WD) binaries are common in the Galactic field. Motivated by these observations and the fact that most massive stars are born in triples, we show that wide BH-WD systems can naturally form UCXBs through the eccentric Kozai-Lidov (EKL) mechanism. Notably, EKL-driven eccentricity excitations combined with gravitational wave (GW) emission and WD dynamical tides can effectively shrink and circularize the orbit, leading to mass-transferring BH-WD binaries. These systems represent promising multimessenger sources in both X-ray and GW observations. Specifically, we predict that the wide triple channel can produce $\sim5-45$ ($\sim1-8$) detectable UCXBs in the Milky Way (Andromeda galaxy), including $\sim1$ system observable by the mHz GW detection of LISA. If the final WD mass can reach sufficiently small values, this channel could contribute up to $\sim 10^3$ UCXBs in the Galaxy. Furthermore, the identification of tertiary companions in observed UCXBs would provide direct evidence for this formation pathway and yield unique insights into their dynamical origins.

          Field-level Reconstruction from Foreground-Contaminated 21-cm Maps

 - **Abstract**
 Current and upcoming 21-cm experiments will soon be able to map 21-cm spatial fluctuations in three dimensions for a wide range of redshifts. However, bright foreground contamination and the nature of radio interferometry create significant challenges, making it difficult to access rich cosmological information from the Fourier modes that lie within the "foreground wedge". In this work, we introduce two approaches aiming to reconstruct the full 21-cm density field, including the missing modes in the wedge: (a) a field-level inference under an effective field theory (EFT) framework; (b) a diffusion-based deep generative model trained on simulations. Under the EFT framework, we implement a fully differentiable forward model that maps the initial conditions of matter fluctuations to the observed, foreground-filtered 21-cm maps. This enables a gradient-based sampler to simultaneously sample the initial conditions and bias parameters, allowing a physically motivated mode reconstruction. Alternatively, we apply a variational diffusion model to perform 21-cm density reconstruction at the map level. Our model is trained on semi-numerical simulations over a wide range of astrophysical parameters. Our results from both approaches should provide improved cosmological constraints from the field level and also enable cross-correlation between experiments that have little or no overlapping modes.

 - **Abstract**
 The 21 cm line of neutral hydrogen is a promising probe of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) but suffers from contamination by spectrally smooth foregrounds, which obscure the large-scale signal along the line of sight. We explore the possibility of indirectly extracting the 21 cm signal in the presence of foregrounds by taking advantage of nonlinear couplings between large and small scales, both at the level of the density field and a biased tracer of that field. When combined with effective field theory techniques, bias expansions allow for a systematic treatment of nonlinear mode-couplings in the map between the underlying density field and the 21 cm field. We apply an effective bias expansion to density information generated with $\texttt{21cmFAST}$ using a variety of assumptions about which information can be recovered by different surveys and density estimation techniques. We find that the 21 cm signal produced by our effective bias expansion, combined with our least optimistic foreground assumptions, produces ~30% cross-correlations with the true 21 cm field. Providing complementary density information from high-redshift galaxy surveys yields a cross-correlation of 50-70%. The techniques presented here may be combined with foreground mitigation strategies in order to improve the recovery of the large-scale 21 cm signal.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive analysis of planetary radii ordering within multi-planet systems, namely their ordinal position with respect to their size in a given system, utilizing data from the NASA Exoplanet Archive. In addition, we consider not only the ordinal positions but also the specific period ratios and radius ratios of planetary pairs in multi-planet systems. We explore various dependencies on stellar host type and metallicity, as well as planetary types, and explore the differences between planetary systems with different planet multiplicities and different planetary pairs in the same system. Focusing on Kepler systems with two to four planets, we account for observational biases and uncover a robust trend of smaller inner planets. This trend is particularly pronounced in inner pairs of three-planet systems and exhibits variations in stellar metallicity and planet multiplicity. Notably, we find that the distribution of inner-to-outer planet radii ratios depends on the system's metallicity, suggesting a link between initial conditions and the resulting system architecture. Interestingly, planet pairs in resonance do not exhibit significantly different size ratios compared to non-resonant pairs, challenging current theoretical expectations, again, possibly suggesting that initially resonant systems could have been later destabilized. Our findings align with planet formation and migration models where larger planets form farther out and migrate inward. Importantly, we emphasize the significance of planet ordering as a novel and crucial observable for constraining planet formation and evolution models. The observed patterns offer unique insights into the complex interplay of formation, migration, and dynamical interactions shaping planetary systems.

 - **Abstract**
 This study presents an X-ray spectropolarimetric characterisation of the Z-source GX 340+0 during the normal branch (NB) and compares it with that obtained for the horizontal branch (HB), using IXPE, NICER and NuSTAR observations. The analysis reveals significant polarisation, with polarisation degrees (PD) of ${\sim}1.4$\% in the NB and ${\sim}3.7$\% in the HB, indicating a notable decrease in polarisation when transitioning from the HB to the NB. The polarisation angles show a consistent trend across the states. Spectropolarimetric analysis favours a dependence of the polarisation on the energy. The Comptonised component shows similar polarisation in both the HB and NB and is higher than the theoretical expectation for a boundary or spreading layer. This suggests a contribution from the wind or the presence of an extended accretion disc corona (ADC) to enhance the polarisation. The results obtained here highlight the importance of using polarimetric data to better understand the accretion mechanisms and the geometry of this class of sources, providing insights into the nature of the accretion flow and the interplay between different spectral components. Overall, the findings advance our understanding of the physical processes governing accretion in low-mass X-ray binaries.

 - **Abstract**
 Supersonic isothermal turbulence is ubiquitous in the interstellar medium. This work presents high-resolution AREPO hydrodynamical simulations of isolated shocks moving through supersonic turbulence to study the development and evolution of turbulence in the pre- and post-shock regions. We find that shocks can amplify turbulent energy in the post-shock region while inducing a preferential orientation for the vorticity. This results in the creation of anisotropic turbulence in the post-shock region. Turbulent energy and dissipation are also strongly enhanced near the shock front. By applying typical scalings from the cold neutral medium to simulations, we find that shocks moving into turbulence on the scale of superbubbles can generate compressive flows on the order of $10^{3} M_{\odot}$/Myr. Our results also show good agreement with related studies on turbulent fluctuations generated by shocks in pure fluid mechanics.

 - **Abstract**
 DIPLODOCUS (Distribution-In-PLateaux methODOlogy for the CompUtation of transport equationS) is a novel framework being developed for the mesoscopic modelling of astrophysical systems via the transport of particle distribution functions through the seven dimensions of phase space, including continuous forces and discrete interactions between particles. This first paper in a series provides an overview of the analytical framework behind the model, consisting of an integral formulation of the relativistic transport equations (Boltzmann equations) and a discretisation procedure for the particle distribution function (Distribution-In-Plateaux). The latter allows for the evaluation of anisotropic interactions, and generates a conservative numerical scheme for a distribution function's transport through phase space.

          A $τ$-$DM relation for FRB hosts?

 - **Abstract**
 It has been proposed that measurements of scattering times ($\tau$) from fast radio bursts (FRB) may be used to infer the FRB host dispersion measure (DM) and its redshift. This approach relies on the existence of a correlation between $\tau$ and DM within FRB hosts such as that observed for Galactic pulsars. We assess the measurability of a $\tau - $DM$_{\rm host}$ relation through simulated observations of FRBs within the ASKAP/CRAFT survey, taking into account instrumental effects. We show that even when the FRB hosts intrinsically follow the $\tau - $DM relation measured for pulsars, this correlation cannot be inferred from FRB observations; this limitation arises mostly from the large variance around the average cosmic DM value given by the Macquart relation, the variance within the $\tau - $DM relation itself, and observational biases against large $\tau$ values. We argue that theoretical relations have little utility as priors on redshift, e.g., for purposes of galaxy identification, and that the recent lack of an observed correlation between scattering and DM in the ASKAP/CRAFT survey is not unexpected, even if our understanding of a $\tau - $DM$_{\rm host}$ relation is correct.

 - **Abstract**
 The Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) is one of four science instruments on board the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), which began routine operations in July 2022. As JWST's primary spectroscopic instrument for faint, distant targets, NIRSpec plays a central role in several of the mission's core science goals. Its signature multi-object spectroscopy (MOS) mode enables the simultaneous acquisition of spectra for up to a hundred targets across the field of view, using a micro-shutter array (MSA) comprised of nearly 250,000 individually addressable micro-electromechanical shutters. The MSA is susceptible to occasional electrical shorts, which produce unwanted infrared glow in MOS exposures, rendering them unusable and wasting valuable observatory time. Mitigation requires promptly identifying the affected shutter(s) and masking the corresponding row(s) or column(s) to prevent future activation. However, masking shutters unnecessarily reduces NIRSpec's multiplexing capacity, so it is important to minimize the extent of masking while reliably suppressing the short's effects. More than two years of operations have informed refinements in technical procedures and operational decision-making around short mitigation. This experience also supports new efforts to identify and unmask previously affected rows or columns where shorts have since disappeared, enabling the recovery of multiplexing capacity that would otherwise remain lost. As MSA technology matures toward use in future missions such as the Habitable Worlds Observatory, operational strategies developed for NIRSpec remain relevant beyond JWST. This paper provides an overview of MSA shorts mitigation operations, summarizes shorts observed since the completion of commissioning, and describes the evolving contingency procedures that have enabled continued science productivity from this unique payload.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a calibrated database of reflectance spectra for the solar system planets (i.e., Mercury, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune) and for Titan, spanning from the ultraviolet to the near infrared. We considered data collected over 60 years of planetary observations, employing a broad range of geometries and facilities (spacecraft and ground-based observatories). To correct for differences in observational geometries and data quality, we adopted a two-step calibration process that standardized each spectrum to the planet's geometric albedo values and corrected for planetary heterogeneity and calibration effects. The calibrated datasets were then combined across wavelengths, leading to a reference composite reflectance spectrum for each planet. As a test of this spectral library for exoplanetary research, we simulated direct imaging observations of the Proxima Centauri and HD 219134 systems as solar system analogs, as well as the solar system at a distance of 10 parsecs. We also explored the detection limitations of direct imaging instruments imposed by the inner and outer working angles for Earth and Jupiter-like exoplanets as a function of system distance. Additionally, we used the visible light portion of the results to produce realistic color reconstructions of each planet. Standardizing reflectance spectra in this work improves our baseline for interpreting new reflected light observations of exoplanets through comparative planetology. This spectral library can then serve as a calibrated and validated reference in the modeling and preparation for the characterization of exoplanet atmospheres with future direct imaging missions and for astronomical studies of the solar system.

 - **Abstract**
 Constraining primordial non-Gaussianities (PNGs) in the large-scale cosmic structure (LSS) is an important step in understanding properties of the early universe, specifically in distinguishing between different inflationary models. Measuring PNG relies on evaluating the scale-dependent correlations in the density field. New summary statistics beyond the two- and three-point correlation functions in configuration space and their Fourier-space counterparts, the power- and bi-spectrum may provide increased sensitivity. We introduce a new method for extracting the PNG signal imprinted on the LSS by using the first three Gaussian moments of the normalized correlation in density perturbations, evaluated at varying distance scales. We aim to assess this method's sensitivity to local PNG, parameterized by $f_ {\mathrm{NL}}$. We perform spherical convolutions at a range of scales on dark matter halo simulations to measure the scale-dependent correlations in the density field. From these, we compute the first three moments and compare them to a model expectation vector, parameterized to the second power in $f_{\mathrm{NL}}$. Our method provides about 21% improvement in sensitivity to $f_{\mathrm{NL}}$ with respect to using the two point correlation function alone. Notably, we find that the second moment alone carries nearly as much constraining power as the mean, highlighting the potential of higher-order statistics. Given its simplicity and efficiency, this framework is well-suited for application to current and upcoming large-scale surveys such as DESI.

          Comprehensive Statistical Analysis of Initial Lorentz Factor and Jet Opening Angle of Gamma-Ray Bursts

 - **Abstract**
 The initial Lorentz factor ($\Gamma_{0}$) and jet half-opening angle ($\theta_{\rm jet}$) of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are critical physical parameters for understanding the dynamical evolution of relativistic jets and the true energy release of GRBs. We compile a sample of 89 GRBs that exhibit an onset bump feature in their early optical or GeV light curves, 42 of which also display a jet break feature, and derive their $\Gamma_{0}$ and $\theta_{\rm jet}$ values. Using this sample, we re-eaxmine the correlations between $\Gamma_{0}$ and the prompt emission parameters (isotropic energy $E_{\rm iso}$, peak luminosity $L_{\rm iso}$, and peak energy $E_{\rm p}$). Our results confirm the previously reported $\Gamma_{0}$$-$$E_{\rm iso}$ ($L_{\rm iso}$), $\Gamma_{0}$$-$$E_{\rm p,z}$, and $E_{\rm iso}$ ($L_{\rm iso}$)$-$$E_{\rm p}$$-$$\Gamma_{0}$ relations for both homogeneous interstellar medium (ISM) and wind density profiles (Wind). Notably, we find that the short GRB 090510 complies with the $\Gamma_{0}$$-$$E_{\rm iso}$ relation, but significantly deviates from the $\Gamma_{0}$$-$$L_{\rm iso}$ and $\Gamma_{0}$$-$$E_{\rm p,z}$ relations. We systematically investigate the influence of $\theta_{\rm jet}$ on $\Gamma_{0}$ and find a weak dependence. Additionally, we report, for the first time, three new three-parameter correlations, i.e., $E_{\rm iso}$ (or $L_{\rm iso}$, $E_{\rm p,z}$)$-$$\Gamma_{0}$$-$$\theta_{\rm jet}$ correlations. In addition, we further explore the relations between the initial Lorentz factor and the jet-corrected energy. We also find that the jet-corrected correlations remain significant, suggesting that these relations are intrinsic to the physical nature of GRBs. However, the increased dispersion after correction implies that underlying differences persist among individual GRBs.

 - **Abstract**
 The CCOR Compact Coronagraph is a series of two operational solar coronagraphs sponsored by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). They were designed, built, and tested by the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory (NRL). The CCORs will be used by NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center to detect and track Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) and predict the Space Weather. CCOR-1 is on board the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite -U (GOES-U, now GOES-19/GOES-East). GOES-U was launched from Kennedy Space Flight Center, Florida, on 25 June 2024. CCOR-2 is on board the Space Weather Follow On at Lagrange point 1 (SWFO-L1). SWFO-L1 is scheduled to launch in the fall of 2025. SWFO will be renamed SOLAR-1 once it reaches L1. The CCORs are white-light coronagraphs that have a field of view and performance similar to the SOHO LASCO C3 coronagraph. CCOR-1 FOV spans from 4 to 22 Rsun, while CCOR-2 spans from 3.5 to 26 Rsun. The spatial resolution is 39 arcsec for CCOR-1 and 65 arcsec for CCOR-2. They both operate in a band-pass of 470 - 740 nm. The synoptic cadence is 15 min and the latency from image capture to the forecaster on the ground is less than 30 min. Compared to past generation coronagraphs such as the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO), CCOR uses a compact design; all the solar occultation is done with a single multi-disk external occulter. No internal occulter is used. This allowed a substantial reduction in size and mass compared to SECCHI COR-2, for example, but with slightly lower signal-to-noise ratio. In this article, we review the science that the CCORs will capitalize on for the purpose of operational space weather prediction. We give a description of the driving requirements and accommodations, and provide details on the instrument design. In the end, information on ground processing and data levels is provided.

 - **Abstract**
 Radio waves undergo scattering by small-scale density fluctuations during propagation through the solar-terrestrial environment, substantially affecting the observed characteristics of solar radio bursts. This scattering process can be effectively modeled as photon diffusion in phase space. In this study, we present a comprehensive comparison between the quasilinear diffusion coefficients and those calculated by ray-tracing the photon trajectories in numerically generated, broadband, isotropic density fluctuation fields in both two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) configurations. The comparative analysis demonstrates that for weak scattering, the simulated diffusion coefficients agree well with the quasilinear theoretical predictions. However, when the radio frequency approaches the electron plasma frequency and/or the density fluctuation amplitude becomes significant, photons experience strong scattering. Under such conditions, the quasilinear theory tends to underestimate the scattering strength of photons induced by 2D density fluctuations while overestimating the scattering strength in 3D cases. Furthermore, we implement a group velocity correction to the theoretical diffusion coefficients, based on the effective propagation speed averaged over all test photons. The corrected coefficients provide an accurate quantification of the scattering strength for radio waves propagating through 3D density fluctuations. The physical mechanisms underlying these phenomena are elucidated in the discussion.

          Effects of Dissipation Physics on High-frequency Quasi-periodic Oscillations in Black Hole X-ray Binaries

 - **Abstract**
 We numerically investigate the effects of black hole spin and local dissipation profiles on high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillation (HFQPO) observed in black hole X-ray binaries (BHXB). Our HFQPO power spectra arise from self-consistent calculations that do not rely on ad-hoc assumptions regarding disk geometry. Our models combine radiative transfer and disk vertical structure equations with input motivated by first-principles three-dimensional simulations. We found that HFQPO power spectra may be sensitive to spatial distribution of dissipation rates while the quality factors are more sensitive to black hole spin. We discuss the observational implications of our results in context of steep power law (SPL) spectra from BHXBs that are seen together with HFQPOs, and how QPO properties may be indicators of the underlying physical oscillations.

 In this note, we suggest the possibility that an elucidation of the nature of the numerous Little Red Dots (LRDs) at high redshifts, may facilitate the resolution of another concurrent cosmic puzzle, namely reionization. Specifically, it is hypothesized that intergalactic HI gas is compelled by the tidal field associated with a growing gravitational entropy, in the form of gas streams, into colliding at the LRD sites. The resulting shock heating and compression encourage starburst activities, which subsequently photo-ionize the gas into HII, that in turn shines into the rest-optical via bremsstrahlung radiation within the minimal-timescale-cutoff (i.e., red) regime, before escaping back into the intergalactic space, propelled by the newly fusion-injected energy.

 - **Abstract**
 Since the pioneering detection of gravitational wave (GW) from a binary black hole merger by the LIGO-Virgo collaboration, GW has become a powerful tool for probing astrophysics and cosmology. If compact dark matter (DM) candidates, e.g. primordial black holes, contribute a substantial fraction of the DM component across a broad mass spectrum, their gravitational influence would imprint distinctive micro-lensing signatures on long-wavelength GW signals. In this paper, we propose a systematic method ranging from simulating micro-lensing GWs to constraining population information of compact DM, combining future third-generation ground-based GW detector, i.e. Einstein Telescope, with a hierarchical Bayesian inference framework. This approach enables us to analyze micro-lensing signatures in GW events and probe the potential contribution of compact DM objects to the DM budget of universe. For a population with a power-law mass function, we demonstrate that detecting 8 micro-lensing GW events out of $10^4$ observed binary black holes would constrain the compact DM abundance to $\log_{10}(f_{\rm CO})=-2.76^{+0.16}_{-0.17}$.

 - **Abstract**
 The Resolve soft X-ray spectrometer is the high spectral resolution microcalorimeter spectrometer for the XRISM mission. In the beam of Resolve there is a filter wheel containing \xray{} filters. In the beam also is an active calibration source (the modulated X-ray source (MXS) that can provide pulsed \xray s to facilitate gain calibration. The filter wheel consists of six filter positions. Two open positions, one $^{55}$Fe source to aid in spectrometer characterization during the commissioning phase, and three transmission filters: a neutral density filter, an optical blocking filter, and a beryllium filter. The X-ray intensity, pulse period, and pulse separation of a MXS are highly configurable. Furthermore, the switch--on time is synchronized with the spacecraft's internal clock to give accurate start and end times of the pulses. One of the issues raised during ground testing was the susceptibility of a MXS at high voltage to ambient light. Although measures were taken to mitigate the light leak, the efficacy of those measures must be verified in orbit. Along with an overview of issues raised during ground testing, this article will discuss the calibration source and the filter performance in--flight and compare with the transmission curves present in the Resolve calibration database.

 - **Abstract**
 The carrier of the 21 ${\mu}$m emission feature discovered in a handful of protoplanetary nebulae (PPNe) is one of the most intriguing enigmas in circumstellar chemistry. Investigating the gas-phase molecules in PPNe could yield important hints for understanding the 21 ${\mu}$m feature. In this paper, we report observations of the CS $J = 5 \to 4$ line at 245 GHz and the CO $J = 1 \to 0$ line at 115 GHz toward seven PPNe exhibiting the 21 ${\mu}$m feature. We find that CS is extremely scarce in these PPNe and the CS line is only detected in one source, IRAS Z02229+6208. Based on the assumption of local thermal equilibrium and negligible optical depth, we derive that the CS column densities and fractional abundances relative to H$_{2}$ are $N$(CS) < 9.1 ${\times}$ 10$^{13}$cm$^{-2}$ and $f$(CS) < 8.1 ${\times}$ 10$^{-7}$. A comparison of the CS abundances across different circumstellar envelopes reveals that the variations in CS abundance are complex, depending not only on the evolutionary stages but also on the properties of individual objects.

 - **Abstract**
 $\gamma$-ray pulsar halos, formed by inverse Compton scattering of electrons and positrons propagating in the pulsar-surrounding interstellar medium with background photons, serve as an ideal probe for Galactic cosmic-ray propagation on small scales (typically tens of parsecs). While the associated electron and positron propagation is often modeled using homogeneous and isotropic diffusion, termed here as normal diffusion, the actual transport process is expected to be more complex. This work introduces the Pulsar Halo Emission Computation Tool (PHECT), a lightweight software designed for modeling pulsar halo emission. PHECT incorporates multiple transport models extending beyond normal diffusion, accounting for different possible origins of pulsar halos. Users can conduct necessary computations simply by configuring a YAML file without manual code edits. Furthermore, the tool adopts finite-volume discretizations that remain stable on non-uniform grids and in the presence of discontinuous coefficients. PHECT is ready for the increasingly precise observational data and the rapidly growing sample of pulsar halos.

          X-ray selected broad absorption line quasars in SDSS-V: BALs and non-BALs span the same range of X-ray properties

 - **Abstract**
 Broad absorption line (BAL) quasars are often considered X-ray weak relative to their optical/UV luminosity, whether intrinsically (i.e., the coronal emission is fainter) or due to large column densities of absorbing material. The SDSS-V is providing optical spectroscopy for samples of quasar candidates identified by eROSITA as well as Chandra, XMM or Swift, making the resulting datasets ideal for characterising the BAL quasar population within an X-ray selected sample. We use the Balnicity Index (BI) to identify the BAL quasars based on absorption of the CIV $\lambda\,1549$ emission line in the optical spectra, finding 143 BAL quasars in our sample of 2317 X-ray selected quasars within $1.5\le z \le3.5$. This observed BAL fraction of $\approx$ 6 per cent is comparable to that found in optically selected samples. We also identify absorption systems via the Absorption Index (AI) which includes mini-BALs and NALs, finding 954 quasars with AI $>0$. We consider the CIV emission space (equivalent width vs. blueshift) to study the BAL outflows within the context of the radiatively driven accretion disc-wind model. X-ray selection excludes the highest outflow velocities in emission but includes the full range of absorption velocities which we suggest is consistent with the BAL gas being located further from the X-ray corona than the emitting gas. We observe both X-ray weak and X-ray strong BALs (via the optical-to-X-ray spectral slope, $\alpha_\text{ox}$) and detect little evidence for differing column densities between the BAL and non-BAL quasars, suggesting the BALs and non-BALs have the same shielding gas and intrinsic X-ray emission.

 - **Abstract**
 In 2016, Kepler/K2 detected a system of two sub-Neptunes transiting the star HD 224018, one of them showing a mono-transit event. In 2017, we began a spectroscopic follow-up with HARPS-N to measure the dynamical masses of the planets using radial velocities, and collected additional transit observations using CHEOPS. We measured the fundamental physical parameters of the host star, which is an ``old Sun'' analogue. We analysed radial velocities and photometric time series, also including data by TESS, to provide precise ephemerides, radii, masses, and bulk densities of the two planets, and possibly modeling their internal structure and composition. The system turned out to be more crowded than shown by K2. Radial velocities revealed the presence of two additional bodies: a candidate cold companion on an eccentric orbit with a minimum mass nearly half that of Jupiter (eccentricity $0.60^{+0.07}_{-0.08}$; semi-major axis 8.6$^{+1.5}_{-1.6}$ au), and an innermost super-Earth (orbital period 10.6413$\pm$0.0028 d; mass 4.1$\pm$0.8 Me) for which we discovered previously undetected transit events in K2 photometry. TESS revealed a second transit of one of the two companions originally observed by K2. This allowed us to constrain its orbital period to a grid of values, the most likely being $\sim$138 days, which would imply a mass less than 9 Me, at a 3$\sigma$ significance level. Given the level of precision of our measurements, we were able to constrain the internal structure and composition of the second-most distant planet from the host star, a warm sub-Neptune with a bulk density of 3.9$\pm$0.5 g/cm$^{3}$. HD 224018 hosts three close-in transiting planets in the super-Earth-to-sub-Neptune regime, and a candidate cold and eccentric massive companion. Additional follow-up is needed to better characterise the physical properties of the planets and their architecture.

 - **Abstract**
 The surface of asteroid (25143) Itokawa shows both fresh and mature terrains, despite its short space weathering timescale of approximately 1000 years, as inferred from recent studies. Seismic shaking triggered by the impact that formed the 8-meter Kamoi crater has been proposed as a possible explanation for the diversity. This study aims to examine whether the seismic shaking induced by the impact could account for the observed spatial variations in space weathering and further constrain the internal structure of Itokawa. Assuming that the Kamoi crater was formed by a recent impact, we conducted three-dimensional seismic wave propagation simulations and applied a simplified landslide model to estimate surface accelerations and boulder displacements. Our results show that even a low-energy case (1 % of the nominal seismic energy) produces surface accelerations sufficient to destabilize the surface materials. The simulated boulder displacements are consistent with the observed distribution of space weathering degrees even on the opposite hemisphere. We estimate the seismic diffusivity to be 1000-2000 m2 s-1 and the seismic efficiency to be in the range of 5.0 x 10-8 to 5.0 x 10-7, implying that Itokawa's interior contains blocks tens of meters across and acts as a strongly scattering medium.

          Is Phantom Barrier Crossing Inevitable? A Cosmographic Analysis

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the evolution of dark energy using a model-independent framework based on the cosmographic approach. The main objective of this work is to construct a dynamical dark energy model directly from the kinematic equations of the cosmographic parameters, rather than adopting any arbitrary parametrization of the cosmological parameters. We employ the differential equation for the jerk parameter and map it to an anharmonic oscillator equation. From this, we derive an analytical expression for the equation of state (EoS) of dark energy. Interestingly, this form of the EoS depends on only a single parameter. Using the recently released DESI DR2 BAO data, Pantheon+ supernova dataset, and a compressed Planck likelihood, we constrain the cosmological parameters within this framework. Our results indicate a deviation from the cosmological constant behavior at late times, suggesting a dynamical nature of dark energy. Our findings contradict the DESI DR2 analysis based on the CPL parametrization, as no phantom-barrier crossing is observed in our analysis. This study highlights that model-independent reconstructions rooted in kinematical quantities can provide robust insights into the true nature of dark energy.

 - **Abstract**
 The vertical (Lense-Thirring) precession of the innermost accretion flows has been discussed as a sensitive indicator of the rotational properties of neutron stars (NSs) and their equation of state because it vanishes for a non-rotating star. In this work, we apply the Hartle-Thorne spacetimes to study the frequencies of the precession for both geodesic and non-geodesic (fluid) flows. We build on previous findings on the effect of the NS quadrupole moment, which revealed the importance of the interplay between the relativistic and classical precession. Because of this interplay, the widely used Lense-Thirring metric, linear in the NS angular momentum, is insufficient to calculate the behaviour of the precession frequency across an astrophysically relevant range of NS angular momentum values. We find that even for a moderately oblate NSs, the dependencies of the precession frequency on the NS angular momentum at radii within the innermost accretion region have maxima that occur at relatively low values of the NS angular momentum. We conclude that very different groups of accreting NSs, slow and fast rotators, can display the same precession frequencies. This may explain the lack of evidence for a correlation between the frequencies of the observed low-frequency quasiperiodic oscillations and the NS spin. In our work, we provide a full, general description of precession behaviour, and also examples that assume specific NS and quark star (MIT bag) equation of state. Our calculations are reproducible using the associated Wolfram Mathematica notebook.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent developments in computational power and machine learning techniques motivate their use in many different astrophysical research areas. Consequently, many machine learning models have been trained to classify exoplanet transit signals - typically done by using time series light curves. In this work, we attempt a different approach and try to improve the efficiency of these algorithms by fitting only derived planetary parameters, instead of full time-series light curves. We investigate and evaluate 4 models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and Convolutional Neural Networks) on the KEPLER dataset, using precision-recall trade-off and accuracy metrics. We show that this approach can identify up to about 90% of false positives, implying the planetary parameters encompass most of the relevant information contained in a light curve. Random Forest and Convolutional Neural Networks produce the highest accuracy and the best precision-recall trade-off. We also note that the accuracies as a function of the stellar eclipse flag SS have the best performance.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a detailed spectrophotometric study of nova LMCN 2009-05a, located in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Photometric observations reveal a dust dip in the optical light curve, classifying it as a D-class nova. Light curve analysis yields t2 and t3 decline times of approximately 46 and 80 days, respectively, placing the nova in the category of moderately fast novae. Spectroscopic observations cover multiple phases, including pre-maximum, early decline, and nebular. The spectra are initially dominated by hydrogen Balmer and Fe II lines with P-Cygni profiles, which later transition into pure emission. During the optical minimum, a discrete absorption feature was observed in the H{\alpha} and [O I] line profiles. The physical and chemical properties during the early decline and nebular phases were analyzed using the photoionization code CLOUDY. Dust temperature, mass, and grain size were estimated through spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting to the WISE data. On day 395 post-outburst, we estimate the dust temperature to be approximately 700 K. Additionally, we examined the correlation between dust condensation time (tcond ) and t2 for LMC novae, finding a trend consistent with previous studies of Galactic novae.

 We present the discovery of the unsubstituted polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) phenalene ($c$-C$_{13}$H$_{10}$) in TMC-1 as part of the QUIJOTE line survey. In spite of the low dipole moment of this three-ring PAH we have found a total of 267 rotational transitions with quantum numbers $J$ and $K_a$ up to 34 and 14, respectively, corresponding to 100 independent frequencies. The identification of this new PAH from our survey was based on the agreement between the rotational parameters derived from the analysis of the lines and those obtained by quantum chemical calculations. Subsequent chemical synthesis of this PAH and the investigation of its laboratory microwave spectrum unequivocally support our identification. The column density of phenalene in TMC-1 is (2.8$\pm$1.6)$\times$10$^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$.

 - **Abstract**
 Methylated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) have been hypothesised to be present in the interstellar medium (ISM) through their 3.4 and 6.9 $\mu$m absorption bands. To investigate the hydrogenation of these methylated PAHs, the simplest, toluene ($\mathrm{CH_3C_6H_5}$), was exposed to H-atoms. This demonstrated how the presence of a methyl group changes the reactivity towards atomic hydrogen as compared to benzene and other PAHs and how this may alter its chemistry in the ISM. Toluene was deposited onto a graphite surface in an ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) chamber and then exposed to a H-atom beam. Temperature programmed desorption (TPD) measurements were used to investigate the reaction between H-atoms and toluene and the masses of hydrogenation products were measured with a quadrupole mass spectrometer (QMS). H-atom exposure of toluene leads to superhydrogenation of toluene and the formation of methyl-cyclohexane ($\mathrm{CH_3C_6H_{11}}$) at long exposure times. The initial cross-section of H-addition is lower than that of other PAHs. Methyl-cyclohexane can be further hydrogenated, leading to the detachment of the methyl group and production of cyclohexane ($\mathrm{C_6H_{12}}$) and methane ($\mathrm{CH_4}$). Toluene may be fully hydrogenated through its interaction with H-atoms, although it has a smaller initial cross-section for H-atom addition compared to other PAHs. This likely reflects it having a smaller geometric cross-section and the low flexibility of the benzene ring when undergoing sp$^3$ hybridization. The removal of the methyl group at high H-atom fluences provides a top down formation route to smaller molecules with the possibility of the formation of a radical cyclohexane combining with other species in an interstellar environment to form prebiotic molecules.

          Prospects for Deep-Learning-Based Mass Reconstruction of Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays using Simulated Air-Shower Profiles

 - **Abstract**
 Knowledge of the mass composition of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECR) is crucial to understanding their origins; however, current approaches have limited event-by-event resolution due to high intrinsic fluctuations of variables like $X_{\mathrm{max}}$ and $N_\mu$. With fluorescence telescope measurements of $X_{\mathrm{max}}$ in particular, there are opportunities to improve this situation by leveraging more information from the longitudinal shower development profile beyond just the depth at which its maximum occurs. Although there have been ML studies on extracting composition or mass groups from surface signals, parametrized profiles, or from derived parameters (e.g. $X_{\mathrm{max}}$ distributions), to our knowledge, we present the first study of a deep-learning neural-network approach to directly predict a primary's mass ($\ln A$) from the full longitudinal energy-deposit profile of simulated extensive air showers. We train and validate our model on a large suite of simulated showers, generated with CONEX and EPOS-LHC, covering nuclei from $A = 1$ to $61$, sampled uniformly in $\ln A$. After rescaling, our network achieves a maximum bias better than 0.4 in $\ln A$ on unseen test showers with a resolution ranging between 1.5 for protons and 1 for iron over a large range of noise conditions, corresponding to a proton-iron merit factor of 2.19, outperforming the predictive power of either $X_{\mathrm{max}}$ or $N_\mu$ alone. This performance is only mildly degraded when predictions are made on simulations using the Sibyll-2.3d hadronic interaction model, which was not used in training, showing these features are robust against model choice. Our results suggest that the full shower profile may contain latent composition-sensitive features which have as much discriminating power as $X_{\mathrm{max}}$.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a catalog of 1292 low-mass (M&M) short-period eclipsing binaries observed by the TESS mission. Eclipsing binaries are useful for many aspects of stellar astrophysics, including calibrating stellar models. Catalogs of eclipsing binary properties provide context for population-level inferences. In this work, we present our selection criteria for our catalog, along with steps taken to characterize both the orbital and physical properties of our EBs. We further detail crucial steps in vetting our catalog to ensure that the stars in our catalog have a high likelihood of being true M&Ms. We compare distributions of orbital and physical properties to other relevant datasets. Our sample consists primarily of binaries with short-period, circular orbits and often manifest as high-mass ratio "twin" M&Ms. We find that M&Ms do not exhibit an overdensity of contact binaries, which is different from previous results for solar-type binaries. Further, we find a tidal circularization period of approximately 2.7 days, which is significantly shorter compared to the literature value of 7 days. Finally, we explore the prospects for additional companions to our M&Ms. Future avenues include spectroscopic follow-up of bright M&Ms to better-characterize low-mass stellar properties and a deeper assessment of the presence of tertiary companions.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we investigate the global structural properties and fractality of 1,876 open clusters (OCs) in different environments, including 1,145 singles, 392 pairs, and 339 groups. We analyze cluster mass, age, size, concentration, and fractal structure using the Q parameter and the fractal dimension fdim, and examine their correlations with key physical parameters. Our results reveal systematic environmental trends: clusters in groups are generally younger, less massive, slightly larger, and less centrally concentrated than those in pairs or singles. Fractality is more pronounced in clusters within pairs and groups, with 44% of group clusters exhibiting fractal substructure compared to 38.5% for pairs and 33.2% for singles. Similarly, median fdim values increase from singles (1.13) to pairs (1.16) to groups (1.25), reflecting greater substructure in denser environments. These findings indicate that both intrinsic cluster properties and environmental context significantly influence cluster evolution. More massive clusters tend to evolve toward centrally concentrated, radially symmetric configurations, while less massive clusters retain fractal features for longer periods. Overall, our study demonstrates that open clusters do not evolve in isolation: interactions with the environment play a critical role in shaping their structural evolution and dynamical state.

 We present a cosmological analysis of the third-order aperture mass statistic using Dark Energy Survey Year 3 (DES Y3) data. We perform a complete tomographic measurement of the three-point correlation function of the Y3 weak lensing shape catalog with the four fiducial source redshift bins. Building upon our companion methodology paper, we apply a pipeline that combines the two-point function $\xi_{\pm}$ with the mass aperture skewness statistic $\langle M_{\rm ap}^3\rangle$, which is an efficient compression of the full shear three-point function. We use a suite of simulated shear maps to obtain a joint covariance matrix. By jointly analyzing $\xi_\pm$ and $\langle M_{\rm ap}^3\rangle$ measured from DES Y3 data with a $\Lambda$CDM model, we find $S_8=0.780\pm0.015$ and $\Omega_{\rm m}=0.266^{+0.039}_{-0.040}$, yielding 111% of figure-of-merit improvement in $\Omega_m$-$S_8$ plane relative to $\xi_{\pm}$ alone, consistent with expectations from simulated likelihood analyses. With a $w$CDM model, we find $S_8=0.749^{+0.027}_{-0.026}$ and $w_0=-1.39\pm 0.31$, which gives an improvement of $22\%$ on the joint $S_8$-$w_0$ constraint. Our results are consistent with $w_0=-1$. Our new constraints are compared to CMB data from the Planck satellite, and we find that with the inclusion of $\langle M_{\rm ap}^3\rangle$ the existing tension between the data sets is at the level of $2.3\sigma$. We show that the third-order statistic enables us to self-calibrate the mean photometric redshift uncertainty parameter of the highest redshift bin with little degradation in the figure of merit. Our results demonstrate the constraining power of higher-order lensing statistics and establish $\langle M_{\rm ap}^3\rangle$ as a practical observable for joint analyses in current and future surveys.

 We present a joint cosmological analysis of the two-point correlation function and the aperture-mass skewness measured from the Year 3 data of the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-Y3). The aperture-mass skewness is a compressed representation of three-point shear information, designed to capture non-Gaussian features while keeping the data vector computationally tractable. We find that including the aperture-mass skewness improves the $S_8$-$\Omega_m$ figure of merit by 80% compared to the 2PCF-only case, primarily due to the breaking of degeneracies. Our joint analysis yields a constraint of $S_8=0.736\pm0.020$, which is slightly lower than the two-point-only result and increases the tension with Planck 2018 to 3.2$\sigma$ in the $S_8$-$\Omega_m$ plane. The two- and three-point statistics are found to be internally consistent across redshift bins and angular scales, and we detect no significant intrinsic alignment signal. We also explore extensions to the $w$CDM model and find no evidence for deviations from a cosmological constant. This work demonstrates the feasibility and scientific value of incorporating third-order shear statistics into weak lensing cosmology and provides a practical pathway for similar analyses in future Stage-IV surveys such as LSST, Euclid, and Roman.

          Data Compression with Noise Suppression for Inference under Noisy Covariance

 In many fields including cosmology, statistical inference often relies on Gaussian likelihoods whose covariance matrices are estimated from a finite number of simulations. This finite-sample estimation introduces noise into the covariance, which propagates to parameter estimates, a phenomenon known as the Dodelson-Schneider (DS) effect, leading to inflated uncertainties. While the Massively Optimized Parameter Estimation and Data compression (MOPED) algorithm offers lossless Fisher information-preserving compression, it does not mitigate the DS effect when the compression matrix itself is derived from noisy covariances. In this paper, we propose a modified compression scheme, powered MOPED ($p$-MOPED), which suppresses noise propagation by balancing information retention and covariance estimate noise reduction through a tunable power-law transformation of the sample correlation matrix. We test $p$-MOPED against standard and diagonal MOPED on toy models and on cosmological data from the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam Year 3 weak lensing survey. Our results demonstrate that $p$-MOPED consistently outperforms other approaches, especially in regimes with limited simulations, offering a robust compression strategy for high-dimensional data analyses under practical constraints.

 Age-benchmark brown dwarfs' and planetary-mass objects' spectroscopy is key to characterize substellar evolution. In this paper we present the JHK medium resolution (R~3000) spectra of 25 7-75 M_Jup (spectral types L3.0-M6.0) brown dwarfs and planetary-mass objects in the Orion Nebula Cluster obtained with MOSFIRE installed at the W. M. Keck I telescope. We obtained the spectral types of the targets in our sample using template brown dwarf and planetary-mass objects' spectra. We confirmed their extreme youth (<5 Myr) and membership to the cluster using spectral indices, and the diversity of their spectra even for targets with similar spectral types. Six of our targets presented Pa-beta and Bra-gamma emission lines, suggesting the existence of accreting protoplanetary disks to objects with masses as low as 7 M_Jup. After analyzing the emission lines of those objects, and measuring their accretion rates, we compared them to those of stars, brown dwarfs and planetary-mass objects, confirming that planetary-mass young objects deplete their disks quickly at young ages. Finally, we illustrate the spectral evolution of a 7-10 M_Jup planetary-mass object through its life from 1-3 Myr to 200 Myr old using one of our latest spectra type targets, and other targets from the literature with older age, but similar estimated masses. The spectra are publicly available for the community's use as data behind the figures.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a sub-threshold search for gravitational-wave inspirals from binary neutron stars using data from the first part of the fourth observing run of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration. To enhance sensitivity to this targeted population, we incorporate a redshift-corrected population model based on radio observations of Galactic double neutron star systems. The search identifies a significant trigger with a false-alarm rate of about one per 50 years and a network signal-to-noise ratio of 9.7, which was first reported by the LVK in low-latency processing as S231109ci and subsequently in the GWTC-4.0 catalog as GW231109_235456, a sub-threshold candidate. Accounting for a trials factor of five from the four LVK searches in GWTC-4.0 and this new search, the false-alarm rate of the reported candidate is approximately one per 10 years. If this event is of astrophysical origin, the inferred source properties indicate component masses of 1.40 to 2.24 solar masses for the primary and 0.97 to 1.49 solar masses for the secondary, yielding a total mass of 2.95 (+0.38, -0.07) solar masses. The event was localized to a region of 450 square degrees (90 percent probability) at a luminosity distance of 165 (+70, -69) megaparsecs.

 - **Abstract**
 We seek to quantify the fidelity with which modern population syntheses reproduce observations in view of their use as predictive tools. We compared synthetic populations from the Generation 3 Bern Model of Planet Formation and Evolution (core accretion, solar-type host stars) and the HARPS/Coralie radial velocity sample. We biased the synthetic planet population according to the completeness of the observed data and performed quantitative statistical comparisons and systematically identified agreements and differences. Our nominal population reproduces many of the main features of the HARPS planets: two main groups of planets (close-in sub-Neptunes and distant giants), a bimodal mass function with a less populated `desert', an observed mean multiplicity of about 1.6, and several key correlations. The remaining discrepancies point to areas that are not fully captured in the model. For instance, we find that the synthetic population has 1) in absolute terms too many planets by ~70%, 2) a `desert' that is too deep by ~60%, 3) a relative excess of giant planets by ~40%, 4) planet eccentricities that are on average too low by a factor of about two (median of 0.07 versus 0.15), and 5) a metallicity effect that is too weak. Finally, the synthetic planets are overall too close to the star compared to the HARPS sample. The differences allowed us to find model parameters that better reproduce the observed planet masses, for which we computed additional synthetic populations. We find that physical processes appear to be missing and that planets may originate on wider orbits than our model predicts. Mechanisms leading to higher eccentricities and slower disc-limited gas accretion also seem necessary. We advocate that theoretical models should make a quantitative comparison between the many current and future large surveys to better understand the origins of planetary systems. (Abridged.)

 - **Abstract**
 IceAct is an array of imaging air Cherenkov telescopes located at the ice surface above the IceCube Neutrino Observatory. Each telescope features a silicon photomultiplier based 61 pixel camera and a Fresnel-lens as imaging optic, resulting in a 12-degree field of view. The design is optimized to be operated in harsh environments, particularly at the South Pole. The setup will consist of seven telescopes in a so-called fly's eye configuration, increasing the field of view to 36^\circ, and an additional telescope 200m apart for stereoscopic observations. Rigorous testing procedures have been performed before deployment to ensure that operation under these conditions is possible, e.g. night sky observations and cold temperature tests. Furthermore, on-site calibrations are used to verify the accuracy and reliability of the installation. We derive the geometric alignment of each IceAct telescope by comparing the directional reconstruction of muons measured with IceCube to the corresponding primary particle direction reconstruction from IceAct. This contribution presents these testing procedures. Additionally, we present the on-site alignment calibration, including a Graph Neural Network reconstruction for the primary particle direction in IceAct, verification on Monte Carlo simulation, and the application to a commissioning dataset.

 - **Abstract**
 NASA's Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) aims to achieve starlight suppression to the $10^{-10}$ level for the detection and spectral characterization of Earth-like exoplanets. Broadband ozone absorption features are key biosignatures that appear in the 200-400nm near-ultraviolet (UV) regime. Extending coronagraphy from visible wavelengths to the UV, however, brings with it a number of challenges, including tighter requirements on wavefront sensing and control, optical surface quality, scattered light, and polarization aberrations, among other things. We aim to partially quantify and address these challenges with a combination of modeling, high-resolution metrology to the scales required for UV coronagraphy, and ultimately a demonstration of UV coronagraphy on the Space Coronagraph Optical Bench (SCoOB) vacuum testbed. In these proceedings, we provide a status update on our modeling and contrast budgeting efforts, characterization efforts to understand performance limitations set by key optical components, and our plans to move toward a demonstration of UV coronagraphy.

          An Improved Fit to the Density Distribution in Supersonic Isothermal Turbulence

 - **Abstract**
 The density distribution of supersonic isothermal turbulence plays a critical role in many astrophysical systems. It is commonly approximated by a lognormal distribution with a variance of $\sigma_{s,V}^2 \approx \ln(1 + b^2 M_{\rm V}^2),$ where $s \equiv \ln \rho/\rho_0,$ $M_{\rm V}$ is the rms volume-weighted Mach number, and $b$ is a parameter that depends on the driving mechanism, which can be solenoidal (divergence-free), compressive (curl-free), or a mix of the two. However, this neglects the correlation time of driving ($\tau_{\rm a}$), which plays a key role whenever compressive driving is significant. Here we conduct turbulence simulations spanning a wide range of Mach numbers, $1\lesssim M_{\rm V}\lesssim 10$, driving mechanisms, and $\tau_{\rm a}$ values. In the compressive case, we find that $\sigma_{s,V}^2$ scales approximately linearly with $M_{\rm V},$ and its dependence on $\tau_{\rm a}$ is $\sigma_{s,V}^2 \approx M_{\rm V} [1 + \frac{2}{3}(\lambda_{\rm a} + 1)\Theta(\lambda_{\rm a} + 1)]$, where $\lambda_{\rm a} \equiv \ln(\tau_{\rm a}/\tau_{\rm e})$, $\tau_{\rm e}$ is the eddy turnover time, and $\Theta$ is the Heaviside step function. Mixed-driven turbulence shows a weaker dependence on $\tau_{\rm a},$ and for solenoidally-driven turbulence, $\sigma_{s,V}^2 \approx \frac{1}{3}M_{\rm V}$, independent of $\tau_{\rm a}$ and consistent with the standard expression when $M_V \lesssim 10.$ The volume-weighted mean and skewness also show systematic trends with $M_{\rm V}$ and $\tau_{\rm a}$, deviating from lognormal expectations. For the mass-weighted density distribution, we observe significant broadening and skewness in compressively driven cases, especially at large $\tau_{\rm a}/\tau_{\rm e}$. These results provide a refined framework for modeling astrophysical turbulence.

          Dynamically New Comet C/2025 D1 (Groeller) with Record Perihelion Distance

 - **Abstract**
 We studied C/2025 D1 (Groeller), a long-period comet with an unprecedented perihelion distance of 14.1 au, using archival observations. The data reveals that it had been active at inbound heliocentric distances $r_{\rm H} \gtrsim 20$ au. Initially, the comet intrinsically brightened at $r_{\rm H} \gtrsim 16$ au, with brightening parameters comparable to those of other long-period comets. However, observations after late 2023 showed a gradual decay, despite the inbound trajectory of the comet. To our knowledge, such behaviours have not been observed for other long-period comets at similar heliocentric distances. We speculate that this might be linked to the onset of CO$_{2}$ sublimation and/or crystallisation processes. The surface brightness profile of the coma indicates a steady-state mass loss, implying supervolatile sublimation as the primary driver of the observed activity. Despite changes in the orbital plane angle, the circularly symmetric coma persisted throughout the observed period, indicative of the dominance of large grains in the coma. Assuming the activity trend is independent of bandpass, we found that comet was redder than many other solar system comets. Our model-dependent constraint estimates the nucleus radius to be $\gtrsim\!0.4$ km. We performed astrometric measurements, refined the orbital solution, and derived the original and future orbits of the comet. Our N-body integration, accounting for the Galactic tide, strongly favours that the comet is dynamically new, with its previous perihelion at $\gtrsim\!60$ au from the Sun $\gtrsim\!6$ Myr ago. It is highly likely that the comet will be lost from our solar system after the current apparition.

          Initial conditions for tidal synchronisation of a planet by its moon

 - **Abstract**
 Moons tidally interact with their host planets and stars. A close moon is quickly synchronised by the planet, or becomes captured in a higher spin-orbit resonance. However, the planet requires much more time to significantly alter its rotation rate under the influence of moon-generated tides. The situation becomes more complex for close-in planets, as star-generated tides come into play and compete with the moon-generated tides. Synchronisation of the planet by its moon changes the tidal dynamics of the entire star-planet-moon system and can lead to long-term stable configurations. In this paper, we demonstrate that a certain initial condition must be met for this to occur. Based on the angular-momentum conservation, the derived condition is universal and bears no dependence upon the planet's internal structure or tidal dissipation model. It is applicable to dwindling systems as well as tidally expanding orbits, and to the cases of initially retrograde motion. We present calculations for specific planet-moon systems (Earth and the Moon; Neptune and Triton; Venus and its hypothetical presently-extinct moon Neith; Mars, Phobos, and Deimos; Pluto and Charon), to constrain the dynamically plausible formation and evolution scenarios. Among other things, our analysis prompts the question of whether Pluto and Charon evolved into their current state from an initially more compact configuration (as is commonly assumed) or from a wider orbit -- a topic to be discussed at length elsewhere. Our results are equally applicable to exoplanets. For example, if asynchronous close-in exoplanets are detected, the possibility of tidal synchronisation by an exomoon should be considered.

          Propeller effect in action: unveiling quenched accretion in the transient X-ray pulsar 4U 0115+63

 - **Abstract**
 The Be/X-ray pulsar 4U 0115+63 underwent a type II outburst in 2023. After the outburst, similar to the outbursts in 2015 and 2017, the source decayed into a quiescent state. Two out of three XMM-Newton observations conducted after the 2023 outburst confirmed the source to be in a low-luminosity state at a level of $L_{\rm X} \sim 10^{33}\,\rm erg\,s^{-1}$. X-ray pulsations were detected at $\approx$0.277 Hz in both observations with a pulsed fraction exceeding 50%. The power density spectra show no significant low-frequency red noise in both observations, suggesting that the radiation is not driven by accretion. The energy spectra in this state can be described by a single blackbody component, with an emitting area smaller than the typical size of the polar caps during the accretion phase. Based on the timing and spectral properties, we suggest that the propeller effect is active during the quiescent state, resulting in a total quenching of accretion. We discuss possible mechanisms for the generation of pulsations in this regime and consider the scenario of neutron star crust cooling.

          Stellar halo subtraction alternative for accreting companions' characterization with integral field spectroscopy: Analytical and on-sky demonstration on the PDS70, HTLup, and YSES1 systems

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Medium-resolution IFS, such as MUSE at the VLT, are equipped to detect the emission lines of faint accreting companions when associated with dedicated stellar halo subtraction methods. We recently proposed a new approach based on polynomial modulations of a stellar spectrum estimate across the field of view, with orthogonal polynomials and lines masking. Aims. We seek to highlight and quantify analytically and on real data the benefits of this new approach over the one classically used, particularly with regard to distortions of the extracted spectra. Methods. We carried out analytical calculations based on simple toy models. Simulations of the most extreme situations identified were used to highlight these problems and corrections. Archival VLT/MUSE data of the young PDS70 and HTLup systems were used to vet the detection and characterization capabilities using on-sky observations. New images of the YSES1 planetary system were used to further illustrate the gains. Results. We show that the state-of-the-art method, based on low-pass filtering, can lead to the self-subtraction of the emission lines and modify the neighboring continua. We show that the proposed technique corrects these characterization problems, while maintaining the same detection capabilities. The two protoplanets PDS70 b and c were detected with 5sigma significance. The Halpha line estimate of the HTLup B stellar companion was improved by ~30% for the integrated flux and by ~8% for the 10%-width. As for YSES1 b, we found it uniquely displays a combination of Halpha, Hbeta, CaII H&K triplet, and HeI lines in emission. Conclusions. The proposed method better preserves the spectral information, notably the emission line fluxes and profiles, while achieving similar detection performance. Based on a linear and parametric approach, it can be extended and/or combined with additional faint signal search algorithms.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the aftermath of a giant quiescent solar filament eruption on December 24, 2023. One feature of the eruption is an extensive fan above the filament channel that is about three times as wide as similar structures that appear above active regions (ARs) during solar flares. The fan contains numerous supra-arcade downflows (SADs), and we investigate the largest SADs with continuous Hinode X-ray Telescope (XRT) observations. The measured maximum width of the SADs in this event is at least three times the maximum width of SADs observed in AR flares, whereas the velocities of the largest SADs are similar to the typical values of AR SADs. The kinetic characteristics of the largest SADs observed in this event align with previous model predictions, where SADs originate from the non-linear development of Rayleigh-Taylor type instabilities. In this scenario, the larger system size allows the existence of larger-scale instabilities, while the development of the velocities of these instabilities is expected to be independent of the system size. Compared to AR flares, the temperature and emission measure in this event are lower, and there is less overall radiation, resulting in no evident Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) signature. Similar to those in AR flares, SADs show lower temperatures compared to the surrounding fan plasma. Our observations show that SADs are present in a wide variety of eruptions. The reconnection mechanisms present in quiescent filament eruptions are similar to those driving more compact eruptions originating from ARs.

          Which Solar Latitude Follows the Sunspot Cycle Exactly?

 - **Abstract**
 The large-scale convection in the Sun known as supergranulation is manifested as a network structure on the solar surface. The network cells have an average lifetime of 24 hr, a size of about 30 Mm, and a lane width of about 6 Mm. We have obtained the lane widths and intensities at different latitudes from the Ca {\sc ii} K spectroheliograms from the 100 yr Kodaikanal archival data. We have then calculated the cross correlation function of lane widths and intensities with sunspot number at every latitude from 60$^{\circ}$ N to 60$^{\circ}$ S. The correlation coefficients of the quantities show an approximate North-South symmetry with broad peaks around $\pm$(11--22)$^{\circ}$ latitude with values of about 0.8. The results imply that these latitudes follow the sunspot cycle strongly. The maximum correlation for the lane widths occurs (18$\pm$2)$^{\circ}$ N and (20$\pm$2)$^{\circ}$ S with no phase difference. For intensities, this happens at (13$\pm$2)$^{\circ}$ N and (14$\pm$2)$^{\circ}$ S with a phase difference of 1.25 to 1.5 yr. It is interesting to note that the lane width correlations peak during the solar maximum whereas the intensitiy correlations peak 1.25--1.5 yr after the solar maximum. The results, generally show that no unique latitude exactly follows the solar cycle for all quantities. The results are important in flux transport on the solar surface and have implications for the quiet Sun UV irradiance variations.

          The Hubble constant from the improved lens modeling of cluster-lensed supernova Refsdal with new spectroscopic redshifts and the Jackknife method

 - **Abstract**
 Time-delay cosmology offers an alternative approach to measuring the Hubble constant ($H_0$), which is distinct from the cosmic distance ladder and cosmic microwave background radiation methods. In this study, we present an improved strong lens mass modeling analysis of the cluster-lensed supernova Refsdal, incorporating the latest spectroscopic redshift data from the MUSE on the Very Large Telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope CANUCS/Technicolor. The robustness of our lens models is confirmed using the Jackknife method. From our analysis that considers four lens mass models with different assumptions on profiles of dark matter halos and external perturbations, we derive a constraint on the Hubble constant of $H_0=66.0\pm{4.3}\Mpc$ after combining best-fitted values of the four lens models.

          High Power Accretion in Massive Binary Systems and the Impact of Metallicity

 - **Abstract**
 During a giant eruption of a very massive star in the binary system, the companion star can accrete a large amount of mass that can change its properties and potentially its subsequent evolution. The effect depends on the companion mass, metallicity, the amount of mass it accreted, orbital parameters and other parameters. We simulate individual companion stars assuming they undergo such accretion events. We study the envelope properties of 20 $\rm M_\odot$ and 30 $\rm M_\odot$ single massive stars at different matallicities ($Z= 0.02$, $Z=0.008$ and $Z=0.004$) during accretion at different rates, from $\rm 10^{-5}$ to $\rm 10^{-2}~M_\odot\,yr^{-1}$. For the lower accretion rates we simulate, the stars remains hot, while at higher accretion rates, it becomes cooler and inflates. This behavior is observed in both stars but occurs at different accretion rates. Higher metallicity stars exhibit greater variations in accretion luminosity for the same accretion rate and stellar mass compared to lower metallicity stars. While higher metallicity stars typically have larger stellar envelopes, suggesting smaller variations in luminosity at Galactic metallicity compared to the LMC and SMC, our results show the opposite.

          A massive primordial atmosphere on early Mars

 - **Abstract**
 Mars finished forming while the solar nebula was still present, and acquired its primordial atmosphere from this reservoir. The absence of a detectable cometary xenon signature in the present-day Martian atmosphere suggests that the capture of solar nebular gas was significant enough to dilute later cometary contributions. By quantifying the mass of cometary material efficiently retained on Mars, we place a lower bound on the mass of the primordial Martian atmosphere. To test the robustness of our conclusions, we use cometary bombardment data from two independent studies conducted within a solar system evolutionary model consistent with its current structure. Our calculations show that, even under the most conservative scenario, the minimal mass of the primordial martian atmospheres would yield a surface pressure of no less than 2.9 bar. Such a massive nebular envelope is consistent with recent models in which atmospheric capture is strongly enhanced by the presence of heavier species on Mars - due to outgassing or redox buffering with a magma ocean.

 - **Abstract**
 TOI-1203 is a bright (V=8.6) G3 V star known to host a transiting warm sub-Neptune on a 25.5 d orbit. Here we report on an intensive high-precision radial velocity and photometric follow-up campaign carried out with the HARPS spectrograph and the CHEOPS space telescope. We found that TOI-1203 has an enhancement of $\alpha$ elements relative to iron of [$\alpha$/Fe]=$0.21\pm0.04$. With an age of $\sim$12.5 Gyr, TOI-1203 belongs to the old, $\alpha$-element enhanced stellar population of the galactic thick disk. We spectroscopically confirmed the planetary nature of the 25.5 d sub-Neptune TOI-1203 d, measured its mass ($M_{d}=7.39\pm0.62~M_{\oplus}$) and refined its radius ($R_{d}=2.918_{-0.045}^{+0.046}~R_{\oplus}$). We discovered the presence of an additional transiting super-Earth on a 4.2 d orbit (TOI-1203 b) with a mass of $M_{b}=3.51_{-0.32}^{+0.33}~M_{\oplus}$ and a radius of $R_{b}=1.520_{-0.046}^{+0.045}~R_{\oplus}$. We also revealed the presence of two additional low-mass planets at 13.1 d and 204.6 d (TOI-1203 c and e), with minimum masses of $5.46_{-0.50}^{+0.51}~M_{\oplus}$ and $42.10_{-1.78}^{+1.83}~M_{\oplus}$. We found that the outer planet TOI-1203 e lies on an eccentric orbit with $e_{e}=0.152\pm0.029$. We performed a stability analysis of the system confirming that there are configurations consistent with the observed parameters that are dynamically stable over billion-year timescales. While analyzing the HARPS time series, we discovered that the FWHM of the HARPS cross-correlation function shows a significant long-period signal ($\sim$615 d) that has no counterpart in the radial velocity data or in the remaining HARPS ancillary time series. We significantly detected the same signal in the FWHM of the Th-Ar calibration lines used to compute the nightly wavelength solution, and attributed this systematic effect to a long-term variation of the HARPS instrumental profile.

 The signatures of waves are seen during many high-quality ground-based refractive stellar occultations by solar system atmospheres. We present a new forward-modeling technique for ground-based stellar occultations based on wavelet decomposition. If profiles of refractivity are written as the product of an exponential and a wavelet decomposition, then we can analytically write the profiles of the bending angles and the bending angle derivatives that are needed to calculate occultation light curves. Requiring that the atmosphere is statically stable places limits on the amplitudes of atmospheric waves and their effect on the observed light curve.

 - **Abstract**
 The energy equilibrium between the corona and the underlying disk in a two-phase accretion flow sets a lower limit on the achievable photon index. A slab corona may not explain the hard state observations of X-ray binaries (XRBs). We incorporate energy feedback to the accretion disk resulting from illumination by an extended corona, and vice versa. The interaction between these two components allows for the possibility of finding an energetically self-consistent equilibrium solution for a given disk-corona system. We have upgraded the existing Monte Carlo radiative transfer code, MONK, to incorporate the interaction between the disk and the extended corona within the general relativistic framework. We introduce an albedo parameter to specify the fraction of the incident flux that is reflected by the disk, while the remainder is absorbed and added to the intrinsic dissipation. Reflection is modeled assuming a semi-infinite electron atmosphere. We find global equilibrium solutions by iterating interaction between disk and extended slab corona. A higher black hole spin, higher coronal temperature, and higher albedo all lead to harder spectra. For typical coronal temperatures and disk albedo, the lowest achievable photon index with a static slab corona fully covering the disk is approximately 1.7-1.8. With the upgraded version of MONK, we are now able to achieve global energy equilibrium for a given disk-corona system. This approach holds significant potential for constraining the coronal geometry using not only the observed flux but also polarization. A static slab does not appear to be a favorable coronal geometry for the hard state of XRBs, even when global energy balance is taken into account. In future work, we will explore truncated disk geometries and outflowing coronae as potential alternatives. (shortened)

 - **Abstract**
 The ambipolar electrostatic field has long been recognized as a key driver of ion escape from planetary atmospheres. Elucidating the mechanisms responsible for the generation of this field is critical for understanding atmospheric escape and the evolution of habitability on terrestrial planets. Yet, existing comparisons between ambipolar diffusion theory and in-situ potential measurements have largely neglected the effect of electron heat flow. Confronting the theory incorporating heat-flow effect with in-situ electrical potential data from the \textit{Endurance} sounding rocket mission, we identify observational signatures of electron heat-flow effects. Furthermore, the implications of electron heat-flow effect across terrestrial planets are revealed, focusing on its capacity to resolve the enigma of Venusian electric potential drop anomaly. The anisotropic ion temperatures and the associated enhancement of electron heat-flow effect can explain the anomalous electric potential drop observed in the ionosphere of Venus.

 - **Abstract**
 The main accretion phase of protostars is characterized by the ejection of material in the form of jets/outflows. External UV irradiation can potentially have a significant impact on the excitation conditions within these outflows. High-resolution observations in the mid-infrared allow us to investigate the details of those energetic processes through the emission of shock-excited H$_2$ . Our aim is to spatially resolve H$_2$ and ionic/atomic emission within the outflows of low-mass protostars, and investigate its origin in connection to shocks influenced by external ultraviolet irradiation. We analyze spectral maps of 5 Class I protostars in the Ophiuchus molecular cloud from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Medium Resolution Spectrometer (MIRI/MRS). Four out of five protostars show strong H$_2$, [\ion{Ne}{II}], and [\ion{Fe}{II}] emission associated with outflows/jets. Pure rotational H$_2$ transitions from S(1) to S(8) are found and show two distinct temperature components on Boltzmann diagrams with rotational temperatures of $\sim$500-600 K and $\sim$1000-3000 K respectively. Both $C$-type shocks propagating at high pre-shock densities (n$_\text{H} \ge$10$^4$ cm$^{-3}$) and $J$-type shocks at low pre-shock densities (n$_\text{H} \le$10$^3$ cm$^{-3}$) reproduce the observed line ratios. However, only $C$-type shocks produce sufficiently high column densities of H$_2$, whereas predictions from a single $J$-type shock reproduce the observed rotational temperatures of the gas better. A combination of various types of shocks could play a role in protostellar outflows as long as UV irradiation is included in the models. The origin of this radiation is likely internal, since no significant differences in the excitation conditions of outflows are seen at various locations in the cloud.

 - **Abstract**
 Monitoring the abundance of greenhouse gases (GHGs) such as carbon dioxide (CO$_2$) and methane (CH$_4$) is necessary to quantify their impact on global warming and climate change. Although a number of satellites and ground-based networks measure the total column volume mixing ratio (VMR) of these gases, they rely on sunlight, and column measurements at night are comparatively scarce. We present a new algorithm, Astroclimes, that hopes to complement and extend nighttime CO$_2$ and CH4 column measurements. Astroclimes can measure the abundance of GHGs on Earth by generating a model telluric transmission spectra and fitting it to the spectra of telluric standard stars in the near-infrared taken by ground-based telescopes. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis on an extensive dataset from the CARMENES spectrograph showed that Astroclimes was able to recover the long term trend known to be present in the molecular abundances of both CO$_2$ and CH$_4$, but not their seasonal cycles. Using the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) global greenhouse gas reanalysis model (EGG4) as a benchmark, we identified an overall vertical shift in our data and quantified the long term scatter in our retrievals. The scatter on a 1 hour timescale, however, is much lower, and is on par with the uncertainties on individual measurements. Although currently the precision of the method is not in line with state of the art techniques using dedicated instrumentation, it shows promise for further development.

 - **Abstract**
 There is a long-standing discussion in the astrophysical/astrochemical community as to the structure and morphology of dust grains in various astrophysical environments (e.g., interstellar clouds, protostellar envelopes, protoplanetary and debris disks, and the atmospheres of exoplanets). Typical grain models assume a compact dust core which becomes covered in a thick ice mantle in cold dense environments. In contrast, less compact cores are likely to exhibit porosity, leading to a pronounced increase in surface area with concomitant much thinner ice films and higher accessibility to the bare grain surface. Several laboratory experimental and theoretical studies have shown that this type of dust structure can have a marked effect on several physico-chemical processes, including adsorption, desorption, mobility, and reactivity of chemical species. Porous grains are thus thought to likely play a particularly important and wide-ranging astrochemical role. Herein, we clarify what is meant by porosity in relation to grains and grain agglomerates, assess the likely astrochemical effects of porosity and ask whether a fractal/porous structural/morphological description of dust grains is appropriate from an astronomical perspective. We provide evidence for high porosity from laboratory experiments and computational simulations of grains and their growth in various astrophysical environments. Finally, we assess the observational constraints and perspectives on cosmic dust porosity. Overall, our paper discusses the effects of including porosity in dust models and the need to use such models for future astrophysical, astrochemical and astrobiological studies involving surface or solid-state processes.

 - **Abstract**
 The physical processes behind astrophysical collisionless shocks, such as thermal relaxation and ionization after shock passage, remain poorly understood. To investigate these processes, we analyze the northeastern region of the Cygnus Loop with XMM-Newton. The electron temperature is found to increase towards the interior of the remnant ranging from 0.15-0.19 keV energy range within a spatial scale of 6 arcmin (or 1.27 pc at a distance of 725 pc) from the shock front. This can be explained well by a modified Sedov solution with radiative cooling. We also show that the ionization timescales determined from our spectroscopy are significantly larger than those estimated based on the electron density of the surrounding materials and the shock velocity. This excess can be qualitatively explained by a mixing of inner multiple plasma components with different ionization states due to turbulence.

          Can a gamma-ray dim radio blazar produce a 200-PeV neutrino? The case of PMN J0606$-$0724 and KM3-230213A

 - **Abstract**
 An extremely energetic muon has been recently detected by the Cubic Kilometre Neutrino Telescope (KM3NeT), indicating the observation of a neutrino with the estimated energy of $\left( 2.2^{+5.7}_{-1.0} \right)\times 10^{17}$~eV. Radio blazar PMN~J0606$-$0724, not detected in gamma rays, is located within the reported error region of the neutrino arrival direction, and was flaring at the time of the event. Here we demonstrate that the neutrino could be produced in a photohadronic interaction in its radio core. The necessary proton power is of order of the source's photon luminosity, and protons can be accelerated to the required energies in the core, while high-energy gamma rays cannot leave the source because of intense production of electron-positron pairs. Expected contribution of the population of similar flaring sources matches non-observation of energetic events by other neutrino telescopes.

          CMB Constraints on Quantized Spatial Curvature $Ω_K$ in globally CPT-symmetric universes

 - **Abstract**
 The periodic solution of the Friedmann equation in conformal time, implies that only cosmological perturbations exhibiting corresponding symmetries are physically permissible, leading to a discrete spectrum of allowed wave vectors. Furthermore, in a spatially closed universe, these wave vectors are independently constrained to be integers. Matching these two distinct quantization conditions provides a novel theoretical constraint on the possible values of spatial curvature. In this work, we numerically solve the cosmological perturbation equations, incorporating radiation anisotropy and higher-order Boltzmann terms, to calculate these discrete wave vectors with improved precision. Subsequently, we generate Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) power spectra for different characteristic spacings of these quantized wave vectors. Finally, we apply the constraint to Planck 2018 observational data to determine the cosmological parameters. This analysis yields a discrete set of allowed values for the spatial curvature, $\Omega_K$, including $[-0.076,-0.039, -0.024, -0.016, -0.012, \dots]$.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a first large-scale kinematic map of $\sim$50,000 young OB stars ($T_{\rm eff} \geq 10,000$ K), based on BOSS spectroscopy from the Milky Way Mapper OB program in the ongoing Sloan Digital Sky Survey V (SDSS-V). Using photogeometric distances, line-of-sight velocities and Gaia DR3 proper motions, we map 3D Galactocentric velocities across the Galactic plane to $\sim$5 kpc from the Sun, with a focus on radial motions ($v_R$). Our results reveal mean radial motion with amplitudes of $\pm 30$ km/s that are coherent on kiloparsec scales, alternating between inward and outward motions. These $\bar{v}_R$ amplitudes are considerably higher than those observed for older, red giant populations. These kinematic patterns show only a weak correlation with spiral arm over-densities. Age estimates, derived from MIST isochrones, indicate that 85% of the sample is younger than $\sim300$ Myr and that the youngest stars ($\le 30$ Myr) align well with density enhancements. The age-dependent $\bar{v}_R$ in Auriga makes it plausible that younger stars exhibits different velocity variations than older giants. The origin of the radial velocity features remains uncertain, and may result from a combination of factors, including spiral arm dynamics, the Galactic bar, resonant interactions, or phase mixing following a perturbation. The present analysis is based on approximately one-third of the full target sample. The completed survey will enable a more comprehensive investigation of these features and a detailed dynamical interpretation.

          Primordial Black Hole Formation in a Scalar Field Dominated Universe: Investigation of the Critical nature of the Collapse

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we investigate the critical collapse leading to primordial black hole (PBH) formation in a universe dominated by a self-interacting scalar field with a quartic potential, comparing it to the well-known radiation-dominated case. Using fully relativistic nonlinear numerical simulations in spherical symmetry, based on the Misner--Sharp formalism, we analyze the dynamics near the collapse threshold and track the scaling of the black hole mass. Our results confirm that both the scalar field and radiation cases exhibit type II critical behavior with similar -- though not identical -- critical exponents, differing by about $2\sigma$. This suggests that, while a quartic scalar field effectively mimics a radiation fluid even in the nonlinear collapse regime, small differences in the critical exponent persist. Our findings provide direct numerical evidence for the near universality of the critical exponent in PBH formation, with only mild dependence on whether the collapse is driven by a scalar field or a perfect fluid.

          Statistic of stars with poor astrometric solutions of Gaia DR3 in open star clusters

 - **Abstract**
 We performed counts of stars with poor astrometric solutions of Gaia DR3 in the regions of open star clusters: NGC 188, NGC 1039, NGC 2287, NGC 2301, NGC 2360, NGC 2420, NGC 2527, NGC 2548, NGC 2682 (M 67), NGC 3114, NGC 3766, NGC 5460, NGC 6649. The selection of the possible cluster members is based on the Gaia photometry using the Hess diagram. We look for stars that fall within the region of the Hess diagram plotted from probable cluster members based on Hunt & Reffert data. We take stars with two-parameter solutions, with the parameter RUWE>1.4, as well as with large relative parallax errors that fall within the Hess diagram region for probable cluster members. The radii of clusters based on stars with poor astrometric solutions and the number of such possible cluster members were estimated. The number of stars with poor astrometric solutions relative to the number of stars from the Hunt & Reffert sample N_bad/N varies very widely with a median average of approximately 30%. This means that when one selects probable cluster members based on precise astrometric data from Gaia DR3, an average of about 23% of cluster members may be lost. Among the lost stars there may be a significant number of unresolved binary and multiple systems. We investigated the dependence of the relative number of stars with poor astrometric solutions on the galactic latitude and on the average number density of stars. The brightness functions with and without stars with poor solutions differ significantly in the region of faint stars 14<G<18 mag for clusters with a relative number of possible cluster members with poor astrometric solutions of N_bad/N>=0.15.

 - **Abstract**
 Polarimetric data provide key insights into infrared emission mechanisms in the inner disks of YSOs and the details of dust formation around AGB stars. While polarization measurements are well-established in radio interferometry, they remain challenging at visible and near-infrared due to the significant time-variable birefringence introduced by the complex optical beamtrain. In this study, we characterize instrumental polarization effects within the optical path of the CHARA Array, focusing on the H-band MIRC-X and K-band MYSTIC beam combiners. Using Jones matrix formalism, we developed a comprehensive model describing diattenuation and retardance across the array. By applying this model to an unpolarized calibrator, we derived the instrumental parameters for both MIRC-X and MYSTIC. Our results show differential diattenuation consistent with >= 97% reflectivity per aluminum-coated surface at 45 deg incidence. The differential retardance exhibits small wavelength-dependent variations, in some cases larger than we expected. Notably, telescope W2 exhibits a significantly larger phase shift in the Coude path, attributable to a fixed aluminum mirror (M4) used in place of deformable mirrors present on the other telescopes during the observing run. We also identify misalignments in the LiNbO_3 birefringent compensator plates on S1 (MIRC-X) and W2 (MYSTIC). After correcting for night-to-night offsets, we achieve calibration accuracies of $\pm$ 3.4% in visibility ratio and $\pm$ 1.4 deg in differential phase for MIRC-X, and $\pm$ 5.9% and $\pm$ 2.4 deg, respectively, for MYSTIC. Given that the differential intrinsic polarization of spatially resolved sources, such as AGB stars and YSOs, typically greater than these instrumental uncertainties, our results demonstrate that CHARA is now capable of achieving high-accuracy measurements of intrinsic polarization in astrophysical targets.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the Milky Way disc formation requires characterising its structural and kinematic properties as functions of stellar age. Using red giant stars from APOGEE DR17 and Gaia DR3, we model the age-dependent stellar kinematics with a quasi-isothermal distribution function and fit disc parameters as a function of age using non-parametric splines. We identify a transition from thick to thin disc populations around 10 Gyr ago. Stars older than this have short scale lengths ($\sim$1.7 kpc), typical of the thick disc, while younger stars exhibit increasing scale length with decreasing age, consistent with inside-out formation of the thin disc. This transition coincides with the end of the starburst triggered by the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE) merger. Stars formed around 10 Gyr ago exhibit a dip in scale length, even shorter than that of the thick disc. Comparison with an Auriga simulation suggests that this scale-length dip reflects gas disc shrinking caused by the transition from a cold to hot gas accretion mode. We propose the following disc formation scenario: (1) the thick disc formed under cold-mode accretion; (2) the GSE merger triggered a starburst and increased the total mass of the Galaxy, causing the transition to hot-mode accretion; (3) rapid gas consumption led to temporary shrinking of the star-forming gas disc; and then (4) thin disc grows in an inside-out fashion, as the size of the star-forming gas disc grows via hot-mode smooth gas accretion.

 - **Abstract**
 The young neutron star X-ray binary, Cir X-1, resides within its natal supernova remnant and experiences ongoing outbursts every 16.5 days, likely due to periastron passage in an eccentric orbit. We present the deepest ever radio image of the field, which reveals relativistic jet-punched bubbles that are aligned with the mean axis of the smaller-scale jets observed close to the X-ray binary core. We are able to measure the minimum energy for the bubble, which is around $E_{min}$ = $10^{45} $ erg. The nature and morphological structure of the source were investigated through spectral index mapping and numerical simulations. The spectral index map reveals a large fraction of the nebula's radio continuum has a steep slope, associated with optically thin synchrotron emission, although there are distinct regions with flatter spectra. Our data are not sensitive enough to measure the spectral index of the protruding bubbles. We used the PLUTO code to run relativistic hydrodynamic simulations to try and qualitatively reproduce the observations with a combined supernova-plus-jet system. We are able to do so using a simplified model in which the asymmetrical bubbles are best represented by supernova explosion which is closely followed (within 100 years) by a phase of very powerful jets lasting less than 1000 years. These are the first observations revealing the initial breakout of neutron star jets from their natal supernova remnant, and further support the scenario in which Cir X-1 is a younger relation of the archetypal jet source SS433.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations by JWST reveal an unexpectedly abundant population of rapidly growing supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in the early Universe, underscoring the need for improved models for their origin and growth. Employing new full radiative transfer hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation, we investigate the local and intergalactic feedback of SMBH progenitors for the Population III.1 scenario, i.e., efficient formation of supermassive stars from pristine, undisturbed dark matter minihalos. Our cosmological simulations capture the R-type expansion phase of these Pop III.1 stars, with their H-ionizing photon luminosities of $\sim10^{53}\,{\rm s}^{-1}$ generating HII regions that extend deep into the intergalactic medium, reaching comoving radii of $r_{\rm HII}\sim 1\,{\rm cMpc}$. We vary both the Pop III.1 ionization flux and cosmological formation environments, finding the former regulates their final $r_{\rm HII}$, whereas the latter is more important in setting their formation redshift. We use the results from our radiation-hydrodynamics simulations to estimate the cosmic number density of SMBHs, $n_{\rm SMBH}$, expected from Pop III.1 progenitors. We find $n_{\rm SMBH}\sim10^{-1}\,{\rm cMpc}^{-3}$, consistent with the results inferred from recent observations of the local and high redshift universe. Overall, this establishes Pop III.1 progenitors as viable candidates for the formation of the first SMBHs, and emphasises the importance of exploring heavy mass seed scenarios.

 - **Abstract**
 The IceCube Neutrino Observatory, located at the South Pole, covers a cubic kilometer of Antarctic ice, and is designed to detect astrophysical neutrinos in the TeV-PeV energy range. While IceCube has recently identified a diffuse flux of neutrinos originating from the Galactic Plane, specific sources of astrophysical neutrinos within the Milky Way remain elusive. Hadronic gamma-rays, produced through the decay of neutral pions, are expected to display a characteristic "pion bump" or "spectral break" around 200 MeV. Recent studies by the Fermi-LAT Collaboration highlight 56 sources from the 4FGL Catalog exhibiting a spectral break in the MeV energy range. Detecting astrophysical neutrinos from these sources would provide compelling evidence for cosmic-ray acceleration in their vicinity. In this analysis, we search for astrophysical neutrino emission from 56 sources showing characteristics of a pion bump using 13 years of IceCube data. Our findings could enhance our understanding of potential cosmic-ray acceleration sites in the galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 This study presents preliminary results from the analysis of cosmic-ray anisotropy using air showers detected by the IceTop surface array between 2011 and 2022. With improved statistical precision and updated Monte Carlo simulation events compared to previous IceTop reports, we investigate anisotropy patterns across four energy ranges spanning from 300 TeV to 6.9 PeV. This work extends the measurement of cosmic-ray anisotropy in the southern hemisphere to higher energies than previously achieved with IceTop. Our results provide a foundation for exploring potential connections between the observed anisotropy, the energy spectrum, and the mass composition of the cosmic-ray flux.

 - **Abstract**
 We present near-infrared JHKs and narrow-band H2(1-0) photometric observations of the W51A region, obtained with GTC EMIR, aiming to characterize its young stellar population and provide mass estimates for individual cluster members and the proto-clusters. Our observations reveal over 3000 new sources, out of which 88 are located in the proto-clusters, W51 IRS2 and W51 Main. The average extinction (AV), measured from the J-H color, of sources is 19 AV in W51 IRS2 and 14 AV in W51 Main. We document 17 new instances of H2 emission in the region by utilizing observations from the H2(1-0) narrow-band filter. Despite limited completeness, we estimated masses for each cluster member and estimated the total cluster mass to be in the range of 900-4700 solar masses for W51 IRS2 and 500-2700 solar masses for W51 Main, using an assumed age range of 1-3 Myr. We measured the initial mass function (IMF) in the proto-clusters assuming a range of ages from 1-3 Myr and found that the IMF slopes for both proto-clusters are consistent with the Salpeter IMF in the mass range greater than or equal to 8 solar masses within 1 to 2 sigma.

          A Comprehensive Study of the Energy and Redshift Distributions of the Fast Radio Burst Population Based on the First CHIME/FRB Catalog

 - **Abstract**
 Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are brief, high-energy bursts of radio waves from extragalactic sources, and their origin remains an open question. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive analysis of the FRB population using the first CHIME/FRB catalog, focusing on their energy and redshift distribution, with careful consideration of selection effects. We investigate a range of models, including the Schechter function and the broken power-law function for the energy distribution, and several redshift evolution models, such as the star formation history (SFH) model, as well as models incorporating time delays relative to the SFH or additional redshift evolution factors. Our results indicate that the energy distribution of FRBs is best described by the Schechter function, with a power-law index of $\gamma = -1.49^{+0.37}_{-0.27}$ and a characteristic cutoff energy of $E_\mathrm{c} = 2.82^{+2.43}_{-1.47} \times 10^{41}$ erg. Furthermore, we find no evidence for redshift evolution in the energy distribution of FRBs. In terms of their redshift distribution, our analysis shows that it follows the cosmic SFH, without requiring additional delayed components or redshift evolution factors, suggesting that most FRBs likely originate from young stellar populations. Simultaneously, we infer a local volumetric rate of $\Phi_0 = 4.68^{+4.66}_{-2.39} \times 10^{4} \rm \ Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}$ for $E>10^{39}$ erg. These results, robust against CHIME observational biases, may provide new insights into the underlying properties of the FRB population.

          The Role of Tectonic Luck in Long-Term Habitability of Abiotic Earth-like Planets

 - **Abstract**
 Carbonate-silicate weathering feedback is thought to stabilize Earth's climate on geologic timescales. If climate warms, faster mineral dissolution and increased rainfall speed up weathering, increasing CO2 drawdown and opposing the initial warming. Limits to where this feedback might operate on terrestrial exoplanets with N2-O2-CO2-H2O atmospheres are used to define the 'habitable zone'-the range of orbits around a star where liquid water can be stable on a planet's surface. However, the impacts on long-term habitability of randomly varying volcanic outgassing, tectonic collisions, and tectonic parameters (e.g., number of continental plates, size of plates, plate velocity) remain poorly understood. In this work, we present an idealized and broadly-applicable quasi-2D model of the long-term climate stability of abiotic Earth-twins. The model tracks atmospheric CO2 as 'disks' collide, promoting uplift and supplying new weatherable minerals through erosion. Without resupply, soils become less weatherable and the feedback's strength wanes, making a planet susceptible to catastrophic warming events or hard snowballs where the surface becomes frozen over. We find that tectonic uplift spurred by continental collisions cannot be the sole supplier of weatherable minerals within our model framework, as such climates either become uninhabitably hot (for complex life) as soils become leached of weatherable minerals or experience extreme swings in temperature over short timescales. This conclusion is strengthened when taking into account the destabilizing effects of outgassing variability and increasing stellar luminosity. In addition to frequent collisions, other resupply mechanisms for weatherable minerals, such as wind-driven dust transport, glacial erosion, and/or seafloor weathering, are likely required for long-term stability on Earth-like terrestrial exoplanets.

          XL-Calibur Polarimetry of Cyg X-1 Further Constrains the Origin of its Hard-state X-ray Emission

 - **Abstract**
 The balloon-borne hard X-ray polarimetry mission XL-Calibur observed the Black Hole X-ray Binary (BHXRB) Cygnus X-1 (Cyg X-1) during its nearly six-day Long Duration Balloon (LDB) flight from Sweden to Canada in July 2024. The XL-Calibur observations allowed us to derive the most precise constraints to date of the Polarization Degree (PD) and Polarization Angle (PA) of the hard X-ray emission from a BHXRB. XL-Calibur observed Cyg X-1 in the hard state and measured a $\sim$19-64 keV PD of ($5.0^{+2.7}_{-3.0}$)% at a PA of $-28^{\circ}\pm 17^{\circ}$, with an 8.7% chance probability of detecting larger PDs than the one observed, given an unpolarized signal. The XL-Calibur results are thus comparable to the 2-8 keV PD and PA found by IXPE, with a similar agreement between the hard X-ray PA and the radio jet direction. We also discuss the implications of our polarization measurements in the context of models describing the origin of the broadband X-ray and $\gamma$-ray emission, to which XL-Calibur provides independent constraints on any proposed emission modeling.

          Cosmological Impacts of Black Hole Mergers: No Relief in Sight for the Hubble Tension

 - **Abstract**
 The values of the Hubble constant inferred from local measurements and the cosmic microwave background (CMB) exhibit an approximately 5 sigma tension. Some have suggested this tension is alleviated if matter is converted to dark radiation via dark matter decay. As it is not clear that dark matter decays, we instead examine the effects of converting matter to gravitational radiation via black hole mergers. We consider mergers of supermassive black holes (SMBHs), mergers of stellar-mass black holes, and the formation of SMBHs from mergers of smaller black holes. We find that these processes cannot alleviate the tension, as an unrealistically large merger rate, or an overproduction of SMBHs is required. We also consider whether one can use the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect to constrain mechanisms that form SMBHs from mergers of smaller black holes. We find that this is also too small to be viable.

          Mass Determination of Supermassive Black Holes Governing Evolution of Radio Emitters

 - **Abstract**
 Tidal disruption events (TDEs) involving supermassive black holes (SMBHs) often exhibit radio emission, yet its physical origin remains uncertain, especially in non-jetted cases. In this Letter, we formulate a general dynamical framework for a radio-emitting shell driven by disk winds and expanding through a power-law ambient medium under the influence of SMBH gravity. We derive and classify power-law-in-time solutions to the governing equations in the adiabatic regime. In particular, a universal $t^{2/3}$ scaling emerges naturally when gravitational energy dominates or is comparable to thermal energy, irrespective of the ambient density profile, whereas the classical Sedov-Taylor solution is recovered when gravity is negligible. Our analysis reveals that, in regimes where SMBH gravity governs the shell expansion, the SMBH mass can be inferred from radio observations of the shell. This approach is independent of and complementary to conventional mass estimators, with direct implications for interpreting radio-emitting TDEs and probing SMBH demographics. Our formalism further predicts that 10-100 GHz monitoring with existing and planned facilities can yield SMBH masses within months of disruption, providing a time-domain analogue to reverberation mapping.

 - **Abstract**
 The Crab Pulsar is known to feature plasma lensing events known as echoes. These events show additional components in the pulse profile which are produced by signal that is deflected by ionized nebular material and are therefore delayed relative to the primary emission. We observed the Crab pulsar with \ac{CHIME} during its daily transits, creating an archive of baseband recordings of bright single pulses (known as giant pulses) in the 400$-800\,\unit{MHz}$ band. From these, we produced daily stacks of aligned pulses between late October 2021 and March 2024. We find that in these averages, echoes are readily visible throughout the observation period, and we identify clear groups of echoes with distinct behaviour in terms of their evolution with time and frequency. Many echoes exhibit dispersive delays consistent with being observed through excess column densities relative to the unscattered rays, but we also find two events where the dispersive delays indicate column density deficits. For the first time, we also find echoes for which the line of sight never directly intersects the intervening structures, resulting in events with non-zero minimum delays, of around ${0.5 \rm\,ms}$. The frequency and diversity of the observed echoes make the Crab an excellent target for long-term studies of astrophysical plasma lensing.

 - **Abstract**
 The estimation of CME arrival time strongly depends on the CME propagation models in interplanetary space and the geometrical aspects of the CME model. We conducted ensemble simulations of CMEs propagation with various elliptical cone shapes to study the relation between the CME speed and the optimum cone shape. We numerically searched for the best elliptical aspect ratio of the elliptical cone for each CME in our CME-ICME pair data. We found that the fast CMEs tend to have a higher elliptical aspect ratio (more circular) than the slower CMEs (flattened). Our results suggest that a fast CME gives a stronger push to all directions, which results in a more circular shape of the leading-edge. We believe that this velocity-dependent behavior is related to the different Lorentz force strengths during the early expansion of a CME.

          On the Interpretation of Velocity Residuals in Protoplanetary Disks

 - **Abstract**
 We present a first-order analytical model for line-of-sight velocity residuals, defined as the difference between observed velocities and those predicted by a fiducial model, assuming a flared, nearly axisymmetric disk with the perturbations in disk surface height $\delta h(r)$, inclination $\delta i(r)$, and position angle $\delta\mathrm{PA}(r)$. Introducing projection-deprojection mapping between sky-plane and disk-frame coordinates, we demonstrate that the normalized velocity residuals exhibit Fourier components up to the third harmonic ($\sin3\phi$ and $\cos3\phi$). Moreover, we show that the radial profiles of $\delta h(r)$, $\delta i(r)$, and $\delta\mathrm{PA}(r)$ can be uniquely recovered from the data by solving a linear inverse problem. For comparison, we highlight factors that are not considered in previous models. We also outline how our framework can be extended beyond the first-order residuals and applied to additional observables, such as line intensities and widths.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational waves (GWs) distort galaxy shapes through the tidal effect, offering a novel avenue to probe the nature of gravity. In this paper, we investigate how extra GW polarizations beyond those predicted by general relativity imprint observable signatures on galaxy shapes. Since galaxy shapes are measured as two-dimensional images projected onto the celestial sphere, we present three-dimensional statistical quantities of the projected tidal tensor sourced by the tensor perturbation. We show that the presence of extra polarization modes modifies both the amplitude and angular dependence of the correlation functions. Furthermore, we identify a distinct observational channel for probing parity violation in helicity-two and helicity-one modes. In particular, we show that if they propagate at different speeds, galaxy surveys can disentangle the source of parity violation. Our findings establish a theoretical framework for using upcoming large-scale galaxy surveys to test modified gravity theories through the polarization content of GWs.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an analysis of new multi-wavelength observations of the TeV gamma-ray binary HESS J0632+057, conducted using SALT, Swift, NuSTAR, and VERITAS in 2023--2024. By combining these new data with archival observations, we confirm previous suggestions of orbital variability in the source's X-ray spectrum, including increased X-ray absorption at the orbital phase interval of $\phi\approx0.3\textrm{--}0.4$. The source's X-ray flux within this phase interval seems to have exhibited a significant change on an orbital timescale. Additionally, occasional short-term variations in the X-ray band on a timescale of less than 3 days have been observed. The measured duration of the increased absorbing column density and the flux variability timescales can provide clues about the interaction between the putative pulsar and the Be companion's disk if, as previously suggested, the pulsar crosses the disk at this phase interval. Moreover, the new contemporaneous X-ray and TeV observations around the pulsar-crossing phases revealed independent variability in the X-ray and TeV fluxes, contrary to a previous observation of concurrent flux increases. While these observations alone cannot provide definitive conclusions, we discuss our results in the context of pulsar-disk interaction and intrabinary shock emission scenarios.

          T CrB: overview of the accretion history, Roche-lobe filling, orbital solution, and radiative modeling

 - **Abstract**
 (abridged) We aim to derive a robust estimate of the most important parameters describing the physical nature of T CrB, trace the accretion history onto its white dwarf, and account for the unexpected delay in the occurrence of the new outburst: the SAP prior to 1946 was brighter, and it was followed by the nova eruption within 6 months from its conclusion. This time the 2015-2023 SAP has been fainter and two years past its conclusion no new eruption has yet taken place. During 2005-2025, a period covering SAP and the preceding quiescence, we collected a massive amount of photometric and spectroscopic observations that we have analyzed together with Swift UVOT data. Guided by the results of the orbital solution and in particular by the radiative modeling to which we subjected the whole set of available data, we found for T CrB a binary period of 227.5528 days, an inclination of 61 deg, and masses of 1.35 Msun and 0.93 Msun for the white dwarf and the M3III companion, respectively, making mass transfer dynamically stable. The red giant fills completely its Roche lobe, and at Vrot sin(i)=4.75 +-0.26 km/s it is rotating much slower that the 16 km/s co-rotation value. The ~20 deg azimuth of the hot spot, implied by the hump shaping the optical light curve in quiescence, fixes the outer radius of the disk to 58 Rsun, the same as the canonical value expected from disk theory. In quiescence the disk is cold and mostly neutral. SAP has been caused by an inside-out collapse of the disk, during which the mean accretion rate onto the WD has been ~28x larger than in quiescence. SAP ended in April 2023, but from May 2024 mass-flow has intensively resumed at disk inner radii while the collapse wave reached the outer portions of the disk; the consequent revamp in mass accretion could fill the gap inherited by the fainter 2015-2023 SAP and eventually lead the WD accreted shell to ignition.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the most up-to-date constraints on axion early dark energy (AEDE) from cosmic microwave background (CMB) and baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements. In particular, we assess the impact of data from ground-based CMB experiments, the South Pole Telescope (SPT) and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) -- both with and without $Planck$ -- on constraints on AEDE. We also highlight the impact that BAO information from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) has on these constraints. From CMB data alone, we do not find statistically significant evidence for the presence of AEDE, and we find only moderate reduction in the Hubble tension. From the latest SPT data alone, we find the maximal fractional contribution of AEDE to the cosmic energy budget is $f_{\rm EDE}\,<\,0.12$ at $95\,$% confidence level (CL), and the Hubble tension between the SPT and SH0ES results is reduced to the $2.3\,\sigma$ level. When combining the latest SPT, ACT, and $Planck$ datasets, we find $f_{\rm EDE}\,<\,0.091$ at $95\,$% CL and the Hubble tension at the $3.3\, \sigma$ level. In contrast, adding DESI data to the CMB datasets results in mild preference for AEDE and, in some cases, non-negligible reduction in the Hubble tension. From SPT+DESI, we find $f_{\rm EDE}\,=\,0.081^{+0.037}_{-0.052}$ at $68\,$% CL, and the Hubble tension reduces to $1.5\,\sigma$. From the combination of DESI with all three CMB experiments, we get $f_{\rm EDE}\,=\, 0.071^{+0.035}_{-0.038}$ at $68\,$% CL and a weak preference for AEDE over $\Lambda$CDM. This data combination, in turn, reduces the Hubble tension to $2.3\, \sigma$. We highlight that this shift in parameters when adding the DESI dataset is a manifestation of the discrepancy currently present between DESI and CMB experiments in the concordance model $\Lambda$CDM.

 - **Abstract**
 The X-ray polarimetric observing window re-opening is shedding new light on our current understanding of compact accreting sources. This is true, in particular, for stellar-mass black hole sources observed in the thermally-dominated state, for which the polarization signal is expected to depend on the accretion disk inclination and the black hole spin. Two main effects determine the polarization properties of the accretion disk emission: the absorption and scattering processes occurring before the radiation leaves the disk atmosphere, and the relativistic effects influencing its propagation towards the observer at infinity. In this work, we investigate these effects together considering only the contribution of direct radiation. We analyze how the ionization state of the disk atmosphere, approximated with a constant-density surface layer assumed to be either in collisional ionization equilibrium or photoionization equilibrium, can influence the spectro-polarimetric properties of the radiation at the emitting disk surface. Subsequently we study how these are modified by the propagation in a strong gravitational field.

 - **Abstract**
 The mass composition of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) is usually inferred from the depth of the shower maximum ($X_{\rm{max}}$) of cosmic-ray showers, which is only ambiguously determined by modern hadronic interaction models. We present a data-driven interpretation of UHECRs, the heavy-metal scenario, which assumes pure iron nuclei above $10^{19.6}$ eV ($\approx 40$ EeV) as the heaviest observed mass composition and introduces a global shift in the $X_{\rm{max}}$ scale predicted by the two hadronic interaction models QGSJet II-04 and Sibyll 2.3d. We investigate the consequences of the proposed mass-composition model based on the obtained shifts in the $X_{\rm{max}}$ values, which naturally lead to a heavier mass composition of UHECRs than conventionally assumed. We explore the consequences of our model on the energy evolution of relative fractions of primary species, consequently decomposed energy spectrum, hadronic-interaction studies and the arrival directions of UHECRs. We show that within this scenario, presented recently in Vicha et al 2025 ApJL 986 L34, the cosmic-ray measurements can be interpreted in a more consistent way.

 - **Abstract**
 The formation of Neptune planets with orbital periods less than 10\,days remains uncertain. They might have developed similarly to longer-period counterparts, emerged from rare collisions between smaller planets, or could be the remnant cores of stripped giant planets. Characterizing a large number of them is important to advance our understanding of how they form and evolve. We aimed at confirming the planetary nature and characterizing the properties of a close-in Neptune-type transiting exoplanet candidate revealed by TESS around the star TOI-5795 (V = 10.7 mag), 162 pc away from the Sun. We monitored TOI-5795 with the HARPS spectrograph for two months to quantify periodic variations in radial velocity (RV) to estimate the mass of the smaller companion. We combined these RV and TESS photometry. High-angular-resolution speckle and adaptive optics imaging excluded contamination from nearby sources. We found that the parent star is a metal-poor (${\rm [Fe/H]}=-0.27\pm0.07$), G3\,V star ($T_{\rm eff}=5718\pm50$\,K), with $R_{\star}=1.082\pm0.026\,R_{\sun}$, $M_{\star}=0.901^{+0.055}_{-0.037}\,M_{\sun}$ and $10.2^{+2.5}_{-3.3}$\,Gyr. We estimated that the planet has an orbital period of $P_{\rm orb}=6.1406325 \pm 0.0000054$ days and an orbital eccentricity compatible with zero. Having a mass of $23.66^{+4.09}_{-4.60}\,M_{\oplus}$, a radius of $5.62\pm 0.11\,R_{\oplus}$ and an equilibrium temperature of $1136\pm18$\,K, it can be considered as a hot super-Neptune at the edge of the Neptune desert. We simulated planet-formation processes but found almost no successful matches to the observed planet's mass and orbit, suggesting that post-formation dynamical events may have shaped its current state.

 - **Abstract**
 The estimation of the number of point-sources in the sky is one the oldest problems in astronomy, yet an easy and efficient method for estimating the uncertainty on these counts is still an open problem. Probabilistic cataloging solves the general point-source inference problem, but the trans-dimensional nature of the inference method requires a bespoke approach that is difficult to scale. Here it is shown that probabilistic cataloging can be performed in a fixed-dimensional framework called Parametric Cataloging under mild assumptions on some of the priors. The method requires only a simple reparameterization of the flux coordinates, yielding an accessible method that can be implemented in most probabilistic programming environments. As the parameter space is fixed-dimensional, off the shelf gradient based samplers can be employed which allows the method to scale to tens of thousands of sources.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results of the further investigation of the Class II methanol maser emission in the $14_1 - 14_0$ A$^{-+}$ transition at 349.1 GHz discovered in 2016 in the remarkable core S255IR-SMA1, harboring a $\sim$20 M$_\odot$ protostar NIRS3, which exhibited a disk-mediated accretion burst in 2015. The present study is based on the observations of this object with ALMA in Band 7 at the largest baselines, which provide the angular resolution of $\sim$15 mas. We estimated physical conditions in the region from which comes the maser emission, and in the surroundings, using the presumably quasi-thermal methanol lines in our bands and the CH$_3$CN $19_\mathrm{K} - 18_\mathrm{K}$ line series. The total flux density in the $14_1 - 14_0$ A$^{-+}$ line in 2021 is about two times higher than in 2019. A maser emission of about the same intensity in 2021 is detected for the first time in the $12_1 - 12_0$ A$^{-+}$ transition at 336.9 GHz. The physical conditions in the masering and non-masering regions are similar. The masers are apparently excited by the radiation of the central source. Unfortunately, the existing models cannot adequately take into account this radiation. The $18_{-3}-17_{-4}$ E transition at 345.919 GHz shows characteristics of maser emission, too.

          Jet-Driven Formation of Bipolar Rings in Planetary Nebulae: Numerical Simulations Inspired by NGC 1514

 - **Abstract**
 We conduct three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of jets launched into a dense shell, reproducing two rings in a bipolar structure that resemble the two dusty rings of the planetary nebula (PN) NGC 1514. The scenario we simulate assumes that a strong binary interaction enhanced the mass loss rate from the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stellar progenitor of NGC 1514, and shortly thereafter, the main-sequence companion accreted mass from the AGB star, launching a pair of jets. We find that adiabatic flows, where radiative losses are negligible, produce prominent rings, as observed in the infrared in NGC 1514. In contrast, when radiative cooling is significant, the rings are thin and faint. Our results reinforce the prevailing notion that jets play a substantial role in shaping planetary nebulae (PNe). More generally, as the binary companion to the central star of NGC 1514 avoided common envelope evolution, our results suggest that jets play a major role in many binary systems experiencing stable mass transfer at high rates. This conclusion complements the view that jets play a significant role in unstable mass transfer, specifically in common envelope evolution. Studies of strongly interacting binary systems, whether stable or not, should include jets. If jets continue to be active after ring formation, the outcomes are circum-jet rings, as observed in some other PNe and core-collapse supernova remnants.

 - **Abstract**
 X-ray thermal emission is inherent in neutron-star and black-hole X-ray binary systems. Within these systems, it may reflect from optically thick matter, which will create characteristic observable X-ray spectro-polarimetric features. We compute rest-frame reflection spectra and the corresponding energy-dependent linear polarization degree and angle for (un)polarized single-temperature black-body spectra impinging on a partially ionized constant-density optically thick slab. We use a combination of a Monte Carlo simulation that takes into account scattering, absorption, and spectral lines, with a non-LTE radiative transfer pre-computation of the ionization structure of the slab in photo-ionization equilibrium. We discuss the impact of the reflector's ionization and of the incident spectral shape on the obtained energy dependence of polarization. Despite the presence of highly polarized absorption features and low-polarized spectral lines, an underlying scattering-induced increase of polarization degree with energy in mid to hard X-rays naturally arises due to multiple Compton-scattering energy shifts. Such re-processing effect is particularly apparent in 2-8 keV for steep incident X-ray spectra reflecting from highly-ionized optically thick media. Integration of the resulting local reflection tables in specific large-scale reflection geometries occurring in X-ray binary systems, including relativistic effects, will be presented in a follow-up paper. Nonetheless, we anticipate that the obtained local energy-dependent features will imprint at large distances from the source to the observed X-ray polarization, and could contribute to the observed increase of total polarization degree with energy in 2-8 keV in many accreting systems by the IXPE mission.

 - **Abstract**
 Neutrino-cooled accretion disks can form in the aftermath of neutron-star mergers as well as during the collapse of rapidly rotating massive stars (collapsars) and the accretion-induced collapse of rapidly rotating white dwarfs. Due to Pauli blocking as electrons become degenerate at sufficiently high accretion rates $\dot{M}$, the resulting 'self-neutronization' of the dissociated accreting plasma makes these astrophysical systems promising sources of rapid neutron capture nucleosynthesis (the r-process). We present a one-dimensional general-relativistic, viscous-hydrodynamic model of neutrino-cooled accretion disks around black holes. With collapsars, super-collapsars and very massive star collapse in mind, we chart the composition of the accretion flow and systematically explore different radiatively efficient and inefficient accretion regimes with increasing $\dot M$, across a vast parameter space of $\dot{M}\sim 10^{-6}-10^6 M_\odot \,\text{s}^{-1}$, black hole masses of $M_\bullet\sim 1 - 10^4 M_\odot$ and dimensionless spins of $\chi_\bullet \in [0,1)$, as well as $\alpha$-viscosity values of $\alpha\sim 10^{-3}-1$. We show that these accretion regimes are separated by characteristic thresholds $\dot{M}_{\rm char}$ that follow power laws $\dot M_{\rm char}\propto M_{\bullet}^\alpha \alpha^\beta$ and that can be understood based on analytic approximations we derive. We find that outflows from such disks are promising sites of r-process nucleosynthesis up to $M_\bullet \lesssim 3000 M_\odot$. These give rise to lanthanide-bearing 'red' super-kilonovae transients mostly for $M_\bullet \lesssim 200-500 M_\odot$ and lanthanide suppressed 'blue' super-kilonovae for larger $M_\bullet$. Proton-rich outflows can develop specifically for large black hole masses ($M_\bullet \gtrsim 100 M_\odot$) in certain accretion regimes, which may give rise to proton-rich isotopes via the $\nu$p-process.

 We report the discovery of the ultracool dwarf binary system J1250+0455AB, a low-mass (M$_\odot$$_\mathrm{tot} <$ 0.2 M$_\odot$) system in which the components straddle the M/L dwarf boundary. The binary was resolved through near-infrared adaptive optics imaging with LUCI1-SOUL on the Large Binocular Telescope, revealing a projected angular separation of 0.17 $\pm$ 0.015$\arcsec$, which, combined with a system distance of $71 \pm 5.8$\,pc, corresponds to a physical separation of 12.2 $\pm$ 1.5\,AU at a position angle of 84.8 $\pm$ 0.2°. We estimated the orbital period of J1250+0455AB to be 156 $\pm$ 8\,yr, the bolometric luminosities of the primary and secondary luminosities as $\log (L_\mathrm{bol} / L_\odot) = -3.45 \pm 0.04$ and $-3.58 \pm 0.04$, respectively, with the spectral types of M9 and L0 determined through binary template fitting and spectrophotometric relations. This binary system is part of a hierarchical triple with a separation of 10.44$\arcsec$ from its primary. We estimated the age of the system from the rotational period of the primary star as $0.56^{+0.07}_{-0.06}$ Gyr. Using evolutionary models, for each component we estimate the mass [0.079 $\pm$ 0.002\,M$_\odot$ / 0.072 $\pm$ 0.003\,M$_\odot$], effective temperature [2350 $\pm$ 38\,K / 2200 $\pm$ 43\,K], and radius [0.113 $\pm$ 0.003\,R$_\odot$ / 0.108 $\pm$ 0.002\,R$_\odot$]. Based on the system's binding energy, total mass, and separation, J1250+0455AB is predicted to be a highly stable system, remaining bound for $>$ 10\,Gyr. J1250+0455AB extends the growing population of UCD benchmark systems, providing a new system for refining evolutionary theories at the lowest stellar masses into the substellar regime.

 The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (``Roman'') is a 2.4m space telescope scheduled for a 2026 launch. The Coronagraph Instrument (CGI) on Roman is a technology-demonstration instrument with a coronagraph and, for the first time in space, deformable mirrors and active wavefront control. This paper walks through the algorithmic and system-level architecture of the HOWFSC implementation for CGI, including the use of ground-in-the-loop (GITL) operations to support computationally-expensive operations, and reports on instrument performance measured during thermal vacuum testing in instrument integration and test. CGI achieved better than $5\times10^{-8}$ total raw contrast with two independent coronagraph architectures covering 3-9 and 6-20 $\lambda/D$ between them and a $360^{\circ}$ dark hole on each. The contrast limits appear to be driven by time available for testing, and do not appear to represent a floor in the achievable performance of CGI in flight.

 - **Abstract**
 In the past few decades, large universal structures have been found that challenge the homogeneity and isotropy expected in standard cosmological models. The largest of these, identified as the Hercules-Corona Borealis Great Wall, was found in 2014 in the northern galactic hemisphere in the redshift range of 1.6 < z < 2.1. Subsequent studies used an increasing gamma-ray burst database to show that the cluster was unlikely to have been caused by statistical sampling uncertainties. This study re-examines burst clustering in the northern galactic hemisphere using a recently developed methodology. Evidence is provided that the Hercules-Corona Borealis Great Wall cluster is larger than previously thought, with members potentially spanning the redshift range of 0.33 < z < 2.43. The extension of this cluster's size does not appear to have been due to statistical variations or sampling biases.

 - **Abstract**
 Radiative losses play a critical role in the cooling of plasmas. When chromospheric plasma is sufficiently heated, it can flow into coronal loops which subsequently cool down due to radiation. From observations, we infer that this cooling does not occur uniformly, often resulting in coronal condensations such as coronal rain. To date, coronal condensations have only been found in simulations of steadily-heated loops, and never in impulsively-heated ones. We implement spatiotemporally variable elemental abundances in a radiative hydrodynamic code. Flows, including chromospheric evaporation, directly cause a shift in the local elemental abundances, which then affects the local radiative loss rate. As a consequence, we find that incorporating spatiotemporal low FIP elemental abundances into coronal loop simulations directly causes coronal condensations, which are otherwise absent in impulsively heated loop or flare models. We conclude that spatiotemporal variations in elemental abundances are a fundamental feature of the solar corona, and are therefore necessary to accurately model radiation.

          The Route to Unveil the Cosmic Genealogy of Supermassive Black Hole Binaries Using Nano-Hertz Gravitational Waves and Galaxy Surveys

 - **Abstract**
 The nano-hertz (nHz) stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB), produced by unresolved supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs), offers a unique probe of their cosmic evolution. Using our recently proposed technique, we investigate the prospect of discovering the SMBHB population and its evolution by combining the SGWB signal and its anisotropies with galaxy observation by exploring their cross-correlation. Using a Fisher analysis, we demonstrate that the SGWB power spectrum alone can provide only a weak measurement of the cosmic genealogy of SMBHBs, while the inclusion of the angular power spectrum of SGWB and its cross-correlation with the galaxy distribution can significantly improve our measurement and open a discovery space. With a PTA of 2000 pulsars, achievable in the SKA era, we find that the redshift evolution of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass and galaxy stellar mass can be measured with an SNR up to 4 in the redshift range up to three. The frequency distribution can be constrained with an SNR of approximately up to 80 in the same redshift range at a frequency range accessible from nHz. These SNRs improve further with the increase in the number of pulsars to 5000 expected from SKA. This demonstrates the prospect of answering the decades-long unsolved problem of SMBH growth and evolution over cosmic time and shedding new insights on the standard model of cosmology using synergy between nHz GW and galaxy surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 Planet-forming discs in sufficiently strong UV environments lose gas in external photoevaporative winds. Dust can also be entrained within these winds, which has consequences for the possible solids reservoir for planet formation, and determines the shielding of the disc by the wind. This has previously been studied in 1D models, with predictions for the maximum entrained size, as well as a predicted population of stalled dust of decreasing grain size with distance from the disc. We wrote and tested a new dust particle solver to make the first study of the entrainment and dynamics of dust, using steady state solutions of state-of-the-art 1D and 2D radiation hydrodynamic simulations of externally photoevaporating discs. In our 1D models, we only consider the outer disc at the midplane, verifying previous studies. In our 2D simulations, the wind is launched from the disc surface, as well as the disc edge. In 2D we find that the maximum entrained grain size varies substantially with angle relative to the plane of the disc, from $\sim100$$\mu$m near the disc outer edge down to $\sim1$$\mu$m or even sub-micron in the weaker wind from the disc surface. The gradient of stalled dust seen in 1D also only appears near the disc outer edge in 2D, but not from the disc surface. This agrees qualitatively with observations of silhouette discs in the Orion Nebula Cluster. Despite the spatial variation of the dust, the extinction of the UV radiation remains fairly uniform due to the opacity being dominated by the small grains, and depends more on the dust distribution within the disc itself.

          Asymmetric Signatures of Warps in Edge-on Disks

 - **Abstract**
 Protoplanetary disks observed edge-on commonly show asymmetries that can be caused by shadows cast from a warp. With the growing amount of these observations, methods to constrain warp parameters are urgently needed. In this work, we investigate observational signatures of warps in edge-on disks with the aim to find limits on the observability of warps. We perform radiative transfer simulations in scattered light (near-/mid-infrared) of edge-on disks containing warps of different amplitudes and varying sizes of the misaligned inner region. We analyze the effect of these parameters at 0.8 micron, but also compare models for specific parameters at wavelengths up to 21 micron. In all models, we quantify the apparent asymmetry. We find that under optimal conditions, an asymmetry due to slight warps can be visible. The visibility depends on the viewing angle, as warped disks are not axisymmetric. For optimal azimuthal orientation, misalignments between inner and outer disk regimes as low as 2° can lead to significant asymmetries. On the other hand, we find that larger misalignments of about 10° are needed in order to observe a change in the brightest nebula as a function of wavelength, which is observed in a few protoplanetary disks. In order to link our results to observations, we investigate potential misalignments between the inner and outer disk of edge-on systems showing asymmetries. We compare the jet geometry, which traces the inner region of the disk, to the outer disk orientation and find that a misalignment of a few degrees could be present, such that warped disks could explain the apparent lateral asymmetries. There are many factors that can influence the appearance of the shadows and asymmetries in warped disks. Although it is still challenging to infer exact warp parameters from observations, this work presents a promising step toward better constraints.

          Disentangling the Light Curve of a VIM: A Case Study Using NEOWISE Data

 - **Abstract**
 The data collected by the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE, Wright et al. 2010) and its follow-up Near Earth Object (NEO) mission (NEOWISE, Mainzer et al. 2011) represent a treasure trove for variability studies. However, the angular resolution imposed by the primary mirror implies that close double stars are often unresolved. Then, variability of one or both stars leads to motion of the image centroid along the connecting line. Such an object is known as a "variability-induced mover" (VIM). Knowledge of the angular separation, derived from higher-resolution imaging which resolves both components, allows disentangling of the joint light curve into individual ones. This is illustrated by the case of SPICY 1474 which featured an outburst several years ago. Removal of the contribution of the nearby companion, which led to a dilution of the burst strength, revealed that it was ~0.5 mag brighter than in the joint light curve. A comparison with light curves from unTimely suggests that utilizing the photocenter shift may lead to more reliable results.

 - **Abstract**
 The third science flight of the balloon-borne solar observatory Sunrise carries three entirely new post-focus science instruments with spectropolarimetric capabilities, concurrently covering an extended spectral range from the near ultraviolet to the near infrared. Sampling a larger height range, from the low photosphere to the chromosphere, with the sub-arcsecond resolution provided by the 1-m Sunrise telescope, is key in understanding critical small-scale phenomena which energetically couple different layers of the solar atmosphere. The Sunrise Ultraviolet Spectropolarimeter and Imager (SUSI) operates between 309 nm and 417 nm. A key feature of SUSI is its capability to record up to several hundred spectral lines simultaneously without the harmful effects of the Earth's atmosphere. The rich SUSI spectra can be exploited in terms of many-line inversions. Another important innovation of the instrument is the synchronized 2D context imaging which allows to numerically correct the spectrograph scans for residual optical aberrations. In this work we describe the main design aspects of SUSI, the instrument characterization and testing, and finally its operation, expected performance and data products.

 - **Abstract**
 Power spectra (PS) of high-resolution images of M51 (NGC 5194) taken with the Hubble Space Telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope have been examined for evidence of disk thickness in the form of a change in slope between large scales, which map two-dimensional correlated structures, and small scales, which map three-dimensional correlated structures. Such a slope change is observed here in H-alpha, and possibly Pa-alpha, using average PS of azimuthal intensity scans that avoid bright peaks. The physical scale of the slope change occurs at ~120 pc and ~170 pc for these two transitions, respectively. A radial dependence in the shape of the H-alpha PS also suggests that the length scale drops from ~180 pc at 5 kpc, to ~90 pc at 2 kpc, to ~25 pc in the central ~kpc. We interpret these lengths as comparable to the thicknesses of the star-forming disk traced by HII regions. The corresponding emission measure is ~100 times larger than what is expected from the diffuse ionized gas. PS of JWST Mid-IR Instrument (MIRI) images in 8 passbands have more gradual changes in slope, making it difficult to determine a specific value of the thickness for this emission.

 - **Abstract**
 The evolution of young stars and planet-forming environments is intrinsically linked to their nascent surroundings. This is particularly evident for FU Orionis (FUor) objects$-$a class of young protostars known for dramatic outbursts resulting in significant increases in brightness. We present a case study of V960 Mon, an FUor that has recently been found to show signs of a fragmenting spiral arm, potentially connected to planet formation. Our study explores the large-scale environment ($10^3-10^4$ au) and incorporates ALMA band 3, band 4 and band 6 continuum data, molecular emissions from $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, C$^{18}$O, SiO, DCO$^+$, N$_2$D$^+$ and DCN, alongside optical and near-infrared observations from VLT/MUSE and VLT/SPHERE. We map a region of 20" across where we find tantalizing emissions that provide a unique view of a young group of protostars, including the discovery of a class-0 protostar to the east of the FUor. The $^{12}$CO and SiO tracers suggest that this object is at the base of an outflow, potentially impacting the surrounding medium. The MUSE and SPHERE observations indicate the presence of an elongated feature towards a prominent source to the southeast that may represent interaction between V960 Mon and its surrounding. Moreover, the C$^{18}$O emission overlaps with the clumps of the detected fragmenting spiral arm. These findings provide the strongest evidence to date for a connection between infalling material, fragmentation, and the intensity outburst of a protostar. Our case study highlights the complex interactions between young stars and their surroundings that drive the evolution of the planet forming environment.

          ALMA Observations of Solar Spicules in a Polar Coronal Hole

 - **Abstract**
 We report observations of solar spicules at millimeter wavelengths (mm-$\lambda$) using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). These are supplemented by observations in optical (O), ultraviolet (UV) and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) wavelengths. The observations were made on 2018 December 25 of the northern polar coronal hole. ALMA obtained time-resolved imaging observations at wavelengths of 3 mm (100 GHz; 2~s cadence) and 1.25~mm (239 GHz; $\approx 2$~min cadence) with an angular resolution of $2.2" \times 1.3"$ and $1.5" \times 0.7"$, respectively. Spicules observed at mm-$\lambda$ are easily seen low in the chromosphere whereas spicules in UV bands are seen to extend higher. The spicules observed at mm-$\lambda$ are seen in absorption against coronal EUV emission, allowing us to estimate the column depth of neutral hydrogen. Spicular emission at mm-$\lambda$, due to thermal free-free radiation, allows us to estimate the electron number density as a function of height. We find that spicule densities, inferred from the mm-$\lambda$ data are uniquely insensitive to assumptions regarding the temperature of plasma in spicules. We suggest that the upward mass flux carried by spicules is unlikely to play a significant role in the mass budget of the solar corona and solar wind, and the transport of hot material into the corona by spicules may not play a significant role in coronal heating. However, the possibility that electric currents, fast kink and torsional waves, or other wave modes carried by spicules may play a role in transporting energy into the solar corona cannot be excluded.

 - **Abstract**
 In low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs), accretion flows are often associated with either jet outflows or disk winds. Studies of LMXBs with luminosities up to roughly 20% of the Eddington limit indicate that these outflows generally do not co-occur, suggesting that disk winds might inhibit jets. However, previous observations of LMXBs accreting near or above the Eddington limit show that jets and winds can potentially coexist. To investigate this phenomenon, we carried out a comprehensive multi-wavelength campaign (using VLA, Chandra/HETG, and NICER) on the near-Eddington neutron-star Z source LMXB GX 13+1. NICER and Chandra/HETG observations tracked GX 13+1 across the entire Z-track during high Eddington rates, detecting substantial resonance absorption features originating from the accretion disk wind in all X-ray spectra, which implies a persistent wind presence. Simultaneous VLA observations captured a variable radio jet, with radio emission notably strong during all flaring branch observations-contrary to typical behavior in Z-sources-and weaker when the source was on the normal branch. Interestingly, no clear correlation was found between the radio emission and the wind features. Analysis of VLA radio light curves and simultaneous Chandra/HETG spectra demonstrates that an ionized disk wind and jet outflow can indeed coexist in GX 13+1, suggesting that their launching mechanisms are not necessarily linked in this system.

          Investigating the eccentricity distribution of transiting, long-period giant planets

 - **Abstract**
 Eccentric giant planets are predicted to have acquired their eccentricity through two major mechanisms: the Kozai-Lidov effect or planet-planet scattering, but it is normally difficult to separate the two mechanisms and determine the true eccentricity origin for a given system. In this work, we focus on a sample of 92 transiting, long-period giant planets (TLGs) as part of an eccentricity distribution study for this planet population in order to understand their eccentricity origin. Using archival high-contrast imaging observations, public stellar catalogs, precise Gaia astrometry, and the NASA Exoplanet Archive database, we explored the eccentricity distribution correlation with different planet and host-star properties of our sample. We also homogeneously characterized the basic stellar properties for all 86 host-stars in our sample, including stellar age and metallicity. We found a correlation between eccentricity and stellar metallicity, where lower-metallicity stars ([Fe/H] <= 0.1) did not host any planets beyond e > 0.4, while higher-metallicity stars hosted planets across the entire eccentricity range. Interestingly, we found no correlation between the eccentricity distribution and the presence of stellar companions, indicating that planet-planet scattering is likely a more dominant mechanism than the Kozai-Lidov effect for TLGs. This is further supported by an anti-correlation trend found between planet multiplicity and eccentricity, as well as a lack of strong tidal dissipation effects for planets in our sample, which favor planet-planet scattering scenarios for the eccentricity origin.

          Exploring Statistical Isotropy in Planck Data Release 4: Angular Clustering and Cosmological Parameter Variations Across the Sky

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of small deviations from statistical isotropy in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) - the so-called CMB anomalies - remains an open question in modern cosmology. In this work, we test statistical isotropy in Planck Data Release 4 (PR4) by estimating the temperature and $E$-mode power spectra across independent sky regions. We find that the directions with higher local bandpower amplitudes in intensity are clustered for multipoles between 200 and 2000 with clustering probabilities consistently below 1% for all these scales when compared to end-to-end (E2E) Planck simulations; notably, this range extends beyond that reported in Planck Data Release 3 (PR3). On the other hand, no significant clustering is observed in the polarization $E$-modes. In a complementary analysis, we search for dipolar variations in cosmological parameters fitted using the previously computed power spectra. When combining temperature and polarization power spectra, we identify a potential anomaly in the amplitude of the primordial power spectrum, $A_{s}$, with only 5 out of 600 simulations exhibiting a dipole amplitude as large as that observed in the data. Interestingly, the dipole direction aligns closely with the known hemispherical power asymmetry, suggesting a potential link between these anomalies. All other cosmological parameters remain consistent with $\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}$ expectations. Our findings highlight the need to further investigate these anomalies and understand their nature and potential implications for better understanding of the early Universe.

          A Study of Multiple Molecular Lines at the 3 mm Band toward Gas Infalling Sources

 - **Abstract**
 The study of multiple molecular spectral lines in gas infalling sources can provide the physical and chemical properties of these sources and help us estimate their evolutionary stages. We report line detections within the 3 mm band using the FTS wide-sideband mode of the IRAM 30 m telescope toward 20 gas-infalling sources. Using XCLASS, we identify the emission lines of up to 22 molecular species (including a few isotopologues) and one hydrogen radio recombination line in these sources. H$^{13}$CO$^+$, HCO$^+$, HCN, HNC, c-C$_3$H$_2$, and CCH lines are detected in 15 sources. We estimate the rotation temperatures and column densities of these molecular species using the LTE radiative transfer model, and compare the molecular abundances of these sources with those from nine high-mass star-forming regions reported in previous studies and with those from the chemical model. Our results suggest that G012.79-0.20, G012.87-0.22 clump A and B, and G012.96-0.23 clump A may be in the high-mass protostellar object stage, while sources with fewer detected species may be in the earlier evolutionary stage. Additionally, the CCH and c-C$_3$H$_2$ column densities in our sources reveal a linear correlation, with a ratio of N(CCH)/N(c-C$_3$H$_2$) = 89.2$\pm$5.6, which is higher than the ratios reported in the literature. When considering only sources with lower column densities, this ratio decreases to 29.0$\pm$6.1, consistent with those of diffuse clouds. Furthermore, a comparison between the N(CCH)/N(c-C$_3$H$_2$) ratio and the sources' physical parameters reveals a correlation, with sources exhibiting higher ratios tending to have higher kinetic temperatures and H$_2$ column densities.

          Oligarchic growth of protoplanets in planetesimal rings

 - **Abstract**
 In the standard planet formation scenario, planetesimals are assumed to form throughout the protoplanetary disk and to be smoothly distributed in the radial direction except for the snowline. Planetesimal growth has been investigated using this assumption, and the oligarchic growth model is widely accepted. However, recent simulations of gas and dust evolution have shown that planetesimals form only in radially limited locations -- such as at gas pressure bumps and snowlines -- and are concentrated in ring-like regions. When planetesimals are distributed in a ring-like region, scattered ones leak from the ring edge, resulting in planetesimal diffusion. To investigate protoplanet growth in expanding planetesimal rings, we perform a series of $\textit{ N}$-body simulations. In all the simulations, protoplanet growth is well explained by oligarchic growth, while the ring width expands due to planetesimal scattering by the protoplanets. Massive protoplanets tend to form near the ring center, and protoplanets that form far from the ring center are less massive than those in the center. The scaled orbital separations depend on neither the initial ring width nor on the total mass, and they are consistent with estimates based on the oligarchic growth model and the diffused planetesimal distribution. The width of the expanded planetesimal ring does not depend on its initial width, but it does depend on its total mass. The maximum mass of protoplanets depends strongly on the total ring mass and weakly on its initial width.

          On the evidence of a dark matter density spike around the primary black hole in OJ 287

 - **Abstract**
 The central engine of blazar OJ~287 is arguably the most notable supermassive black hole (SMBH) binary candidate that emits nano-Hertz (nHz) gravitational waves. This inference is mainly due to our ability to predict and successfully monitor certain quasi-periodic doubly peaked high brightness flares with a period of $\sim$12 years from this blazer. The use of post-Newtonian accurate SMBH binary orbital description that includes the effects of higher order GW emission turned out to be a crucial ingredient for accurately predicting the epochs of such Bremsstrahlung flares in our SMBH binary central engine description for OJ~287. It was very recently argued that one should include the effects of dynamical friction, induced by certain dark matter density spikes around the primary SMBH, to explain the {\it observed} decay of SMBH binary orbit in OJ~287. Invoking binary pulsar timing-based arguments, measurements, and OJ~287's orbital description, we show that observationally relevant SMBH binary orbital dynamics in OJ~287 are insensitive to dark matter-induced dynamical friction effects. This implies that we could only provide an upper bound on the spike index parameter rather than obtaining an observationally derived value, as argued by \cite{Chan2024}.

 - **Abstract**
 Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) may have formed in the early Universe due to the collapse of super-horizon curvature fluctuations. Simulations of PBH formation have been essential for inferring the initial conditions that lead to black hole formation and for studying their properties and impact on our Universe. The Misner-Sharp formalism is commonly used as a standard approach for these simulations. Recently, type-II fluctuations, characterized by a non-monotonic areal radius, have gained interest. In the standard Misner-Sharp approach for simulating PBH formation with these fluctuations, the evolution equations suffer from divergent terms (0/0), which complicate and prevent the simulations. We formulate a new approach to overcome this issue in a simple manner by using the trace of the extrinsic curvature as an auxiliary variable, allowing simulations of type-II fluctuations within the Misner-Sharp formalism. Using a set of standard exponential-shaped curvature profiles, we apply our new approach and numerical code based on pseudospectral methods to study the time evolution of the gravitational collapse, threshold values of type A/B PBHs and PBH mass. Interestingly, we identify cases of type-II fluctuations that do not necessarily result in PBH formation.

 We numerically simulate the formation of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) in a radiation-dominated Universe under the assumption of spherical symmetry, driven by the collapse of adiabatic fluctuations, for different curvature profiles $\zeta$. Our results show that the threshold for PBH formation, defined as the peak value of the critical compaction function $\mathcal{C}_{c}(r_m)$ (where $r_m$ is the scale at which the peak occurs), does not asymptotically saturate to its maximum possible value in the type-I region for sufficiently sharp profiles. Instead, the threshold is found in the type-II region with $\mathcal{C}_{c}(r_m)$ being a minimum. We find, for the cases tested, that this is a general trend associated with profiles that exhibit extremely large curvatures in the linear component of the compaction function $\mathcal{C}_{l}(r) \equiv -4r \zeta'(r)/3$ shape around its peak $r_m$ (spiky shapes). To measure this curvature at $r_m$, we define a dimensionless parameter: $\kappa \equiv -r^{2}_m \mathcal{C}_l''(r_m)$, and we find that the thresholds observed in the type-II region occur for $\kappa \gtrsim 30$ for the profiles we have used. By defining the threshold in terms of $\mathcal{C}_{l,c}(r_m)$, we extend previous analytical estimations to the type-II region, which is shown to be accurate within a few percent when compared to the numerical simulations for the tested profiles. Our results suggest that current PBH abundance calculations for models where the threshold lies in the type-II region may have been overestimated due to the general assumption that it should saturate at the boundary between the type-I and type-II regions.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the detection of a potential quasi-periodic signal with a period of $\sim2$ years in the blazar ON 246, based on Fermi-LAT ($\gamma$-rays) and ASAS-SN (optical) observations spanning 11.5 years (MJD 55932-60081). We applied various techniques to investigate periodic signatures in the light curves, including the Lomb-Scargle periodogram (LSP), Weighted Wavelet Z-transform (WWZ), and REDFIT. The significance of the signals detected in LSP and WWZ was assessed using two independent approaches: Monte Carlo simulations and red noise modeling. Our analysis revealed a dominant peak in the $\gamma$-ray and optical light curves, with a significance level exceeding 3$\sigma$ in both LSP and WWZ, consistently persisting throughout the observation period. Additionally, the REDFIT analysis confirmed the presence of a quasi-periodic signal at $\sim$0.00134 $day^{-1}$ with a 99% confidence threshold. To explain the observed quasi-periodic variations in $\gamma$-ray and optical emissions, we explored various potential physical mechanisms. Our analysis suggests that the detected periodicity could originate from a supermassive binary black hole (SMBBH) system or the jet-induced orbital motion within such a system. Based on variability characteristics, we estimated the black hole mass of ON 246. The study suggests that the mass lies within the range of approximately $(0.142 - 8.22) \times 10^9 \ M_{\odot}$.

 - **Abstract**
 2003fg-like Type Ia supernovae (03fg-like SNe Ia) are a rare subtype of SNe Ia, photometrically characterized by broader optical light curves and bluer ultraviolet (UV) colors compared to normal SNe Ia. In this work, we study four 03fg-like SNe Ia using Swift UltraViolet and Optical Telescope (UVOT) grism observations to understand their unique UV properties and progenitor scenario(s). We report 03fg-like SNe Ia to have similar UV features and elemental compositions as normal SNe Ia, but with higher UV flux relative to optical. Previous studies have suggested that the UV flux levels of normal SNe Ia could be influenced by their progenitor properties, such as metallicity, with metal-poor progenitors producing higher UV flux levels. While 03fg-like SNe were previously reported to occur in low-mass and metal-poor host environments, our analysis indicates that their UV excess cannot be explained by their host-galaxy parameters. Instead, we demonstrate that the addition of a hot blackbody component, likely arising from the interaction with the circumstellar material (CSM), to the normal SN Ia spectrum, can reproduce their distinctive UV excess. This supports the hypothesis that 03fg-like SNe Ia could explode in a CSM-rich environment.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we explore primordial black holes (PBH) formation scenario during the post-inflationary preheating stage dominated by the inflaton field. We consider, in particular, a model-independent parametrization of the Gaussian peak inflationary power spectrum that leads to amplified inflationary density fluctuations before the end of inflation. These modes can reenter the horizon during preheating and could experience instabilities that trigger the production of PBH. This is estimated with the Khlopov-Polnarev (KP) formalism that takes into account non-spherical effects. We derive an accurate analytical expression for the mass fraction under the KP formalism that fits well with the numerical evaluation. Particularly, we focus on ultra-light PBH of masses $M_{\text{PBH}}<10^9g$ and study their evolution and (possible) dominance after the decay of the inflation field into radiation and before the PBH evaporation via Hawking radiation. These considerations alter the previous estimates of induced gravitational waves (GWs) from PBH dominance and open new windows for detecting stochastic GW backgrounds with future detectors.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive analysis of Cyg X-1, utilizing archival high-resolution UV and optical spectra in conjunction with sophisticated atmospheric models. Notably, this is the first investigation to simultaneously analyze UV and optical spectra of Cyg X-1 along with incorporating X-rays to constrain the stellar and wind parameters. Our analysis yields notably lower masses for both the donor (29$\,M_\odot$) and the black hole (12.7 to 17.8$\,M_\odot$, depending on inclination), and confirms that the donor's radius is close to reaching the inner Lagrangian point. We find super-solar Fe, Si, and Mg abundances (1.3-1.8 times solar) at the surface of the donor star, while the total CNO abundance remains solar despite evidence of CNO processing (N enrichment, O depletion) and He enrichment. This abundance pattern is distinct from the surrounding Cyg OB3 association. We observe a clear difference in wind parameters between X-ray states: $v_\infty \approx 1200\,\mathrm{km\,s}^{-1}$ and $\dot{M} \approx 3\times 10^{-7}\,M_\odot\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ in the high/soft state, increasing to $v_\infty\lesssim 1800\,\mathrm{km\,s}^{-1}$ and $\dot{M}\lesssim 5\times 10^{-7}\,M_\odot\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ in the low/hard state. The observed X-ray luminosity is consistent with wind-fed accretion. Evolutionary models show that Cyg X-1 will undergo Roche lobe overflow in the near future. Under a fully conservative mass accretion scenario, our models predict a future binary black hole merger for Cyg X-1 within $\sim5$ Gyr. Our comprehensive analysis provides refined stellar and wind parameters of the donor star in Cyg X-1, highlighting the importance of using advanced atmospheric models and considering X-ray ionization and wind clumping. The observed abundances suggest a complex formation history involving a high initial metallicity.

 - **Abstract**
 The Hamilton-Jacobi approach is a powerful tool to describe super-Hubble dynamics during cosmological inflation in a non-linear way. A key assumption of this framework is to neglect anisotropic perturbations on large scales. We show that neglecting the anisotropic sector in the momentum constraint corresponds to discarding the non-adiabatic mode of scalar-field perturbations at large scales. Consequently, the Hamilton-Jacobi approach cannot be used to describe the evolution of large-scale perturbations during inflation beyond slow roll, when non-adiabatic fluctuations play an important role on super-Hubble scales due to the absence of an attractor trajectory. As an example, we analyse the case of cosmological perturbations during a phase of ultra-slow-roll inflation.

          Strong Evidence That Abiogenesis Is a Rapid Process on Earth Analogs

 - **Abstract**
 The early start to life naively suggests that abiogenesis is a rapid process on Earth-like planets. However, if evolution typically takes ~4Gyr to produce intelligent life-forms like us, then the limited lifespan of Earth's biosphere (~5-6Gyr) necessitates an early (and possibly highly atypical) start to our emergence - an example of the weak anthropic principle. Our previously proposed objective Bayesian analysis of Earth's chronology culminated in a formula for the minimum odds ratio between the fast and slow abiogenesis scenarios (relative to Earth's lifespan). Timing from microfossils (3.7Gya) yields 3:1 odds in favor of rapid abiogenesis, whereas evidence from carbon isotopes (4.1Gya) gives 9:1, both below the canonical threshold of "strong evidence" (10:1). However, the recent result of a 4.2Gya LUCA pushes the odds over the threshold for the first time (nominally 13:1). In fact, the odds ratio is >10:1 for all possible values of the biosphere's ultimate lifespan and speculative hypotheses of ancient civilizations. For the first time, we have formally strong evidence that favors the hypothesis that life rapidly emerges in Earth-like conditions (although such environments may themselves be rare).

          Fluorine abundances in CEMP stars at the lowest metallicity: Hints on the nature of the first stars

 - **Abstract**
 In the last decade, the available measurements of fluorine abundance have increased significantly, providing additional information on the chemical evolution of our Galaxy and details on complex stellar nucleosynthesis processes. However, the observational challenges to obtain stellar F abundances favor samples with higher metallicities, resulting in a scarcity of measurements at low-metallicity ([Fe/H] $<-2.0$). We present F abundances and upper limits in 7 carbon enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars observed with the Immersion Grating Infrared Spectrometer (IGRINS), at the Gemini-South telescope. These new observations delivered high-resolution, high signal-to-noise ratio, infrared spectra allowing us to probe significantly deeper into the metal-poor regime and the cosmic origin of F. This work presents the results of our observations, including two 2-sigma detections and five upper limits in a variety of CEMP stars. Arguably the most important result is for CS 29498-0043, a CEMP-no star at [Fe/H] = $-3.87$ with a F detection of [F/Fe] = $+2.0\pm 0.4$, the lowest metallicity star (more than a factor of 10 lower in metallicity than the next detection) with observed F abundance to date. This measurement allowed us to differentiate between two zero metallicity Population III (Pop III) progenitors: one involving He-burning with primary N in Wolf-Rayet stars, and the other suggesting H-burning during hypernova explosions. Our measured value is in better agreement with the latter scenario. This detection represents a pilot, and pioneering study demonstrating the power of F to explore the nature and properties of the first chemical enrichment from Pop III stars.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the results of a comprehensive analysis of the multiwavelength (in optical and X-rays) and multitimescale (from months to tenths of a second) variability of the 2018-2020 outburst of the black hole transient MAXI J1820+070. During the first outburst episode, a detailed analysis of the optical photometry shows a periodicity that evolves over time and stabilises at a frequency of $1.4517(1)$ $1/d$ ($\sim0.5\%$ longer than the orbital period). This super-orbital modulation is also seen in the X-rays for a few days soon after the transition to the high-soft state. We also observed optical Quasi-Periodic Oscillations (QPOs), which correspond to some of the QPOs observed in X-rays at three different epochs when the source was in the low-hard state. In two epochs, optical QPOs with a centroid consistent with half the frequency of the most prominent X-ray QPO can be seen. If the lowest modulation frequency is the one observed in the optical, the characteristic precession frequency of MAXI J1820+070 is lower than that inferred from the `fundamental' QPO in the X-rays. Assuming that QPOs can be generated by Lense-Thirring precession, we calculate the spin of the black hole in the case where the fundamental precession frequency is tracked by the optical emission. We find a relatively slowly spinning black hole with a spin parameter $\lesssim 0.15$. The super-orbital optical and X-ray modulations observed after the disappearance of the QPOs may be triggered by the self-irradiation of the outer disc by a standard inner disc truncated at a few gravitational radii.

 - **Abstract**
 de Grijs and Bono (ApJS 2020, 246, 3) compiled a list of distances to M87 from the literature published in the last 100 years. They reported the arithmetic mean of the three most stable tracers (Cepheids, tip of the red giant branch, and surface brightness fluctuations). The arithmetic mean is one of the measures of central tendency of a distribution; others are the median and mode. The three do not align for asymmetric distributions, which is the case for the distance moduli $\mu_0$ to M87. I construct a kernel density distribution of the set of $\mu_0$ and estimate the recommended distance to M87 as its mode, obtaining $\mu_0 = \left(31.06~\pm~0.001\,\textrm{(statistical)}\,^{+0.04}_{-0.06}\,\textrm{(systematic)}\right)$~mag, corresponding to \linebreak $D=16.29^{+0.30}_{-0.45}$~Mpc, which yields uncertainties smaller than those associated with the mean and median.

 - **Abstract**
 Changing-look quasars challenge many models of the quasar central engine. Their extreme variability in both the continuum and broad emission-line fluxes on timescales on the order of years is difficult to explain. To investigate the cause of the observed transitions, we present new contemporaneous optical and X-ray observations of three faded changing-look quasars as they return to the high state. Two of these three faded changing-look quasars remained in a quiescent state for more than ten years before returning to a new high state. We find that before, during, and after transition, the spectral energy distributions of all three follow predictions for quasars based on X-ray binary outbursts, suggesting that the mechanism for the change is likely a changing accretion rate causing changes in the accretion flow structure. We also find that, in two of the three cases, the transition between the initial high and low state and the transition between the low and new high state took nearly identical amounts of time, on the order of hundreds of days. This transition timescale is useful for testing theoretical models that attempt to explain the short time scale for the state transition.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate whether dark energy deviates from the cosmological constant ($\Lambda$CDM) by analyzing baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements from the Data Release 1 (DR1) and Data Release 2 (DR2) of DESI observations, in combination with Type Ia supernovae (SNe) and cosmic microwave background (CMB) distance information. We find that with the larger statistical power and wider redshift coverage of the DR2 dataset the preference for dynamical dark energy does not decrease and remains at approximately the same statistical significance as for DESI~DR1. Employing both a shape-function reconstruction and non-parametric methods with a correlation prior derived from Horndeski theory, we consistently find that the dark energy equation of state $w(z)$ evolves with redshift. While DESI DR1 and DR2 BAO data alone provide modest constraints, combining them with independent SNe samples (PantheonPlus, Union3, and the DES 5-year survey) and a CMB distance prior strengthens the evidence for dynamical dark energy. Bayesian model-selection tests show moderate support for dark energy dynamics when multiple degrees of freedom in $w(z)$ are allowed, pointing to increasing tension with $\Lambda$CDM at a level of roughly $3\sigma$ (or more in certain data combinations). Although the methodology adopted in this work is different from those used in companion DESI papers, we find consistent results, demonstrating the complementarity of dark energy studies performed by the DESI collaboration. Although possible systematic effects must be carefully considered, it currently seems implausible that $\Lambda$CDM will be rescued by future high-precision surveys, such as the complete DESI, Euclid, and next-generation CMB experiments. These results therefore highlight the possibility of new physics driving cosmic acceleration and motivate further investigation into dynamical dark energy models.

 - **Abstract**
 Properly estimating correlations between objects at different spatial scales necessitates $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ distance calculations. For this reason, most widely adopted packages for estimating correlations use clustering algorithms to approximate local trends. However, methods for quantifying the error introduced by this clustering have been understudied. In response, we present an algorithm for estimating correlations that is probabilistic in the way that it clusters objects, enabling us to quantify the uncertainty caused by clustering simply through model inference. These soft clustering assignments enable correlation estimators that are theoretically differentiable with respect to their input catalogs. Thus, we also build a theoretical framework for differentiable correlation functions and describe their utility in comparison to existing surrogate models. Notably, we find that repeated normalization and distance function calls slow gradient calculations and that sparse Jacobians destabilize precision, pointing towards either approximate or surrogate methods as a necessary solution to exact gradients from correlation functions. To that end, we close with a discussion of surrogate models as proxies for correlation functions. We provide an example that demonstrates the efficacy of surrogate models to enable gradient-based optimization of astrophysical model parameters, successfully minimizing a correlation function output. Our numerical experiments cover science cases across cosmology, from point spread function (PSF) modeling efforts to gravitational simulations to galaxy intrinsic alignment (IA).

 - **Abstract**
 While the simplest inflationary models predict a power-law form of the primordial power spectrum (PPS), various UV complete scenarios predict features on top of the standard power law that leave characteristic imprints in the late-time distribution of matter, encoded in the galaxy power spectrum. In this work, we assess the validity of the Effective Field Theory of Large Scale Structure (EFTofLSS) and the IR-resummation scheme of PyBird in the context of primordial (oscillatory) features. We find an excellent agreement at the level of the matter power spectrum between N-body simulations and the one-loop EFT predictions, for models commonly studied in the literature. We then apply the EFTofLSS to the galaxy power spectrum measurements from BOSS LRG and eBOSS QSO to constrain specific global and local features in the PPS. We demonstrate that while such features can improve the fit to cosmic microwave background (CMB) data, they may result in a poorer fit to clustering measurements at low redshift. The resulting constraints on the amplitude of the primordial oscillations are competitive with those obtained from CMB data, despite the well-known damping of oscillations due to non-linear structure formation processes. For the first time in this context, we jointly analyze the galaxy power spectrum (monopole and quadrupole) in combination with Planck CMB data to derive strong constraints on the amplitude of primordial features. This work highlights the EFTofLSS as a powerful tool for testing early universe scenarios on scales that complement CMB observations.

 We present SOFIA/upGREAT velocity-resolved spectral imaging and analysis of the 158 um [C II] spectral line toward the central 80 by 43\,pc region of the Central Molecular Zone of the Galaxy. The field we imaged with 14" (0.6 pc) spatial and 1 km/s spectral resolution contains the Circum-Nuclear Disk (CND) around the central black hole Sgr A*, the neighboring thermal Arched Filaments, the nonthermal filaments of the Radio Arc, and the three luminous central star clusters. [C II] traces emission from the CND's inner edge to material orbiting at a distance of approximately 6 pc. Its velocity field reveals no sign of inflowing material nor interaction with winds from the Sgr A East supernova remnant. Wide-field imaging of the Sgr A region shows multiple circular segments, including the thermal Arched Filaments, that are centered on a region that includes the Quintuplet cluster. We examine the possibility that the Arched Filaments and other large-scale arcs trace transient excitation events from supernova blast waves. Along the Arched Filaments, comparisons among far-IR fine structure lines show changes in ionization state over small scales and that high-excitation lines are systematically shifted in position from the other lines. These also point to transient fast winds that shocked on the surface of the Arches cloud to produce additional local UV radiation to excite the Arched Filaments on a cloud surface illuminated by UV from hot stars.

 - **Abstract**
 One hypothesis for runaway stars (RSs) is that they are ejected from star clusters with high velocities relative to the cluster center-of-mass motion. There are two competing mechanisms for their production: supernova-based ejections in binaries, where one companion explodes, leaves no remnant, and launches the other companion at the instantaneous orbital velocity, and the disintegration of triples (or higher-order multiples), which produces a recoiled runaway binary (RB) and an RS. We search for RS candidates using data from the Gaia DR3 survey with a focus on triple disintegration since in this case the product is always a binary and a single star that should be moving in opposite directions. We created a systematic methodology to look for candidate RS-RB runaway pairs produced from the disintegration of bound three-body systems formed from single-binary interactions based on momentum conservation and causality. The method we use is general and can be applied to any cluster with a 5D kinematic data set. We used our criteria to search for these pairs in a 150 pc circular field of view surrounding the open cluster M67, which we used as a benchmark cluster to test the robustness of our method. Our results reveal only one RS-RB pair that is consistent with all of our selection criteria out of an initial sample of $10^8$ pairs.

 - **Abstract**
 Forthcoming measurements of the line-intensity-mapping power spectrum (PS) are expected to set precious constraints on several quantities of astrophysical and cosmological interest. Our study targets the [CII] luminosity function (LF) at high redshift, which is still highly uncertain, in particular at the faint end. As an example of future opportunities, we present forecasts for the Deep Spectroscopic Survey (DSS) that will be conducted with the Fred Young Submillimeter Telescope at $z \simeq 3.6$ and also make predictions for eventual $10\times$ wider and/or $\sqrt{10}\times$ more sensitive surveys. The halo-occupation properties of [CII] emitters in the MARIGOLD simulations provide us with the motivation to abundance match two versions of the ALPINE LF against the halo mass function. We employ the resulting luminosity-mass relation within the halo model to predict the expected PS signal and its uncertainty. Finally, we use Bayesian inference to analyse mock PS data and forecast what constraints could be achieved on the first two moments of the LF and on Schechter fits. Depending on the actual LF, the DSS will measure the clustering and shot-noise amplitudes of the PS with a signal-to-noise ratio of $\sim 3$ or higher. However, degeneracies with the bias parameter and redshift-space distortions make it unfeasible to extract the first moment of the LF. Even the widest and most sensitive survey we consider can only constrain it with a $50\%$ uncertainty. By jointly fitting the PS and the LF, we directly constrain Schechter-function parameters. We find that the normalisation and the cutoff luminosity are precisely and accurately measured while the faint-end slope remains highly uncertain (unless the true value approaches $-2$). Overall, increasing the survey sensitivity at fixed sky coverage yields greater improvements than covering a larger area at fixed sensitivity.

          A critical analysis of the recent OGLE limits on stellar mass primordial black holes in the halo of the Milky Way

 - **Abstract**
 This paper is a response to recent claims that a population of primordial black holes in the Galactic halo has been ruled out by the OGLE collaboration. This claim was based on the latest results from the OGLE microlensing survey towards the Large Magellanic Cloud which failed to detect even the number of events expected from known stellar populations. In particular, their results are completely inconsistent with the results of the MACHO survey which detected a population of compact bodies in the Galactic halo which could not be accounted for by any known stellar population. The discrepancy between the results of these two groups has a long history, and includes problems such as different choice of photometric passbands, quality of light curves, microlensing event selection, detection efficiency, self lensing and halo models. In this paper it is demonstrated that these issues not only account for the discrepancy between the OGLE and MACHO results, but imply that the OGLE observations can put no meaningful constraints on a population of primordial black holes in the Galactic halo.

 - **Abstract**
 The TRAPPIST-1 system offers one of the best opportunities to characterize temperate terrestrial planets beyond our own solar system. Within the TRAPPIST-1 system, planet e stands out as highly likely to sustain surface liquid water if it possesses an atmosphere. Recently, we reported the first JWST/NIRSpec PRISM transmission spectra of TRAPPIST-1 e, revealing significant stellar contamination, which varied between the four visits. Here, we assess the range of planetary atmospheres consistent with our transmission spectrum. We explore a wide range of atmospheric scenarios via a hierarchy of forward modeling and retrievals. We do not obtain strong evidence for or against an atmosphere. Our results weakly disfavor CO$_2$-rich atmospheres for pressures corresponding to the surface of Venus and Mars and the cloud tops of Venus at 2$\sigma$. We exclude H$_2$-rich atmospheres containing CO$_2$ and CH$_4$ in agreement with past work, but find that higher mean molecular weight, N$_2$-rich atmospheres with trace CO$_2$ and CH$_4$ are permitted by the data. Both a bare rock and N$_2$-rich atmospheric scenario provide adequate fits to the data, but do not fully explain all features, which may be due to either uncorrected stellar contamination or atmospheric signals. Ongoing JWST observations of TRAPPIST-1 e, exploiting consecutive transits with TRAPPIST-1 b, will offer stronger constraints via a more effective stellar contamination correction. The present work is part of the JWST Telescope Scientist Team (JWST-TST) Guaranteed Time Observations, which is performing a Deep Reconnaissance of Exoplanet Atmospheres through Multi-instrument Spectroscopy (DREAMS).

 - **Abstract**
 TRAPPIST-1 e is one of the very few rocky exoplanets that is both amenable to atmospheric characterization and that resides in the habitable zone of its star -- located at a distance from its star such that it might, with the right atmosphere, sustain liquid water on its surface. Here, we present a set of 4 JWST/NIRSpec PRISM transmission spectra of TRAPPIST-1 e obtained from mid to late 2023. Our transmission spectra exhibit similar levels of stellar contamination as observed in prior works for other planets in the TRAPPIST-1 system (Lim et al, 2023; Radica et al., 2024), but over a wider wavelength range, showcasing the challenge of characterizing the TRAPPIST-1 planets even at relatively long wavelengths (3-5 um). While we show that current stellar modeling frameworks are unable to explain the stellar contamination features in our spectra, we demonstrate that we can marginalize over those features instead using Gaussian Processes, which enables us to perform novel exoplanet atmospheric inferences with our transmission spectra. In particular, we are able to rule out cloudy, primary H$_2$-dominated ($\gtrsim$ 80$\%$ by volume) atmospheres at better than a 3$\sigma$ level. Constraints on possible secondary atmospheres on TRAPPIST-1 e are presented in a companion paper (Glidden et al., 2025). Our work showcases how JWST is breaking ground into the precisions needed to constrain the atmospheric composition of habitable-zone rocky exoplanets.

          Beyond Hierarchical Mergers: Accretion-Driven Origins of Massive, Highly Spinning Black Holes in Dense Star Clusters

 - **Abstract**
 GW231123, the most massive binary black hole (BBH) merger detected by LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA, highlights the need to understand the origins of massive, high-spin stellar black holes (BHs). Dense star clusters provide natural environments for forming such systems, beyond the limits of standard massive star evolution to core collapse. While repeated BBH mergers can grow BHs through dynamical interactions (the so-called "hierarchical merger" channel), most star clusters with masses $\lesssim 10^6\,M_\odot$ have escape speeds too low to retain higher-generation BHs, limiting growth into or beyond the mass gap. In contrast, BH--star collisions with subsequent accretion of the collision debris can grow and retain BHs irrespective of the cluster escape speed. Using $N$-body (Cluster Monte Carlo) simulations, we study BH growth and spin evolution through this process and we find that accretion can drive BH masses up to at least $\sim200\,M_\odot$, with spins set by the details of the growth history. BHs up to about $150\,M_\odot$ can reach dimensionless spins $\chi \gtrsim 0.7$ via single coherent episodes, while more massive BHs form through multiple stochastic accretion events and eventually spin down to $\chi \lesssim 0.4$. These BHs later form binaries through dynamical encounters, producing BBH mergers that contribute up to $\sim10\%$ of all detectable events, comparable to predictions for the hierarchical channel. However, the two pathways predict distinct signatures: hierarchical mergers yield more unequal mass ratios, whereas accretion-grown BHs preferentially form near-equal-mass binaries. The accretion-driven channel allows dense clusters with low escape speeds, such as globular clusters, to produce highly spinning BBHs with both components in or above the mass gap, providing a natural formation pathway to GW231123-like systems.

          Macromodel-free flux-ratio prediction in quadruply imaged quasars with local constraints from lensed arcs

 - **Abstract**
 Strong gravitational lensing is a powerful cosmological probe, providing a direct tool to unveil the properties of dark matter (DM) on sub-galactic scales. In particular, flux-ratio anomalies in quadruply imaged quasars ("quads") can reveal the presence of dark substructure, such that population-level statistics can be used to constrain the particle nature of DM. Current methods, however, rely on globally parametrized models ("macromodels") of the lens mass distribution, which impose rigid physical assumptions on the deflection field. Given the high stakes, it is important to develop complementary methods that do not require the assumption of a macromodel. One promising avenue consists of modeling the resolved emission from the quasar host galaxy (lensed arcs) using a local lensing formalism like the Curved Arc Basis (CAB) description. In this paper, we test the ability of CAB models to predict flux ratios from mock imaging data. We find that CAB model-predicted flux ratios accurately reproduce the expected values, with a typical precision of $\sim 3-5\%$. While a macromodel-based approach yields smaller uncertainties, as expected, the CAB method permits a more flexible, local description of the deflection field, thus being more robust to angular structure in the main deflector mass profile, in particular avoiding false-positive detections of flux-ratio anomalies that can arise with overly simplistic parametrizations. On the other hand, by injecting individual DM halos near quasar images, we demonstrate that CAB models do not absorb the local lensing perturbations from DM substructure, and can therefore distinguish flux-ratio anomalies caused by DM substructure from other sources of small-scale perturbation. We conclude that CAB models can be used to infer DM properties from flux-ratio anomaly statistics with minimal assumptions, complementing the traditional macromodel based approach.

          Analytical Template for the 4-Point Correlation Function Covariance Beyond the Gaussian Random Field ${\rm I}$: 1-Loop Corrections involving Second-Order Densities

 - **Abstract**
 Analytical templates for the covariance matrix of the 4-Point Correlation Function (4PCF) have been developed in the past assuming a Gaussian Random Field (GRF). In this work, we present the first non-Gaussian calculation of the 4PCF covariance, incorporating 1-loop corrections using the second-order density contrast. Furthermore, we introduce a non-trivial galaxy bias scheme at second order. To simplify the calculation, we decompose the covariance into five distinct structures, and then exploit the isotropic basis functions of Cahn & Slepian (2023). This approach reduces the complexity of the high-dimensional integrals naively involved, enabling the angular parts to be performed and leaving us with low-dimensional radial integrals. This analytical template will provide a more accurate characterization of the statistical errors on the 4PCF, improving both the parity-odd and parity-even analyses. This is the first paper in a two-part series.

 Analytical templates for the 4-Point Correlation Function (4PCF) covariance matrix have been developed in the past assuming a Gaussian Random Field (GRF). In this work, we present the second part of the beyond GRF calculation of the 4PCF covariance, incorporating 1-loop corrections stemming from the third-order density contrast. Furthermore, we introduce a non-trivial galaxy biasing scheme at third order. To simplify the calculation, we decompose the covariance into three distinct structures and leverage the isotropic basis of Cahn & Slepian (2023).

This analytical template will provide a more accurate characterization of the statistical errors on the 4PCF, improving our ability to probe both its parity-even and parity-odd modes. This is the second and final paper in a two-part series.

          The possible accretion discs of GN-z11 at redshift z = 10.6, MoM-z14 at z = 14.44 and other high redshift objects

 - **Abstract**
 The JWST has enabled the discovery of Active Galactic Nuclei at high redshifts. The intrinsic UV spectrum of GN-z11 at redshift z = 10.6 has a spectral slope compatible with a standard accretion disc. By fitting a disc model to its spectrum, we find that the mass of the black hole must be above 1.6e7 Msun in order that it lies below the Eddington limit. We define this mass as the Eddington mass of the black hole. We note that the spectral shape is consistent with that of accreting stellar mass black holes sources in their soft state, for which no variability is expected. Mom-z14 is a more distant object at z = 14.44 and has a similar UV slope. Disc model-fitting gives a similar result but lower mass accretion rate. We also examine 3 further high redshift objects: GS z14-1, GHZ2 and GS-z11-1 at z = 13.86, 12.34 and 11.28, again obtaining similar results. If sub-Eddington accretion discs are indeed the origin of much of the UV emission from these objects, then the existence of massive black holes less than 440 and 290 Myr after the Big Bang point either to exceptional black hole seeds or to primordial black holes. The observed spread of UV spectral slopes in high redshift objects suggests that our approach may be relevant to about half of that population.

          Comprehensive Analyses of the Strongly Carbon-chain Depleted Comets in Lowell Observatory's Narrowband Photometry Database

 - **Abstract**
 We present measurements, analyses and results for the seventeen strongly carbon-chain depleted comets in Lowell Observatory's narrowband photometry database. The majority of comets exhibit a very similar, i.e. typical, composition in optical wavelengths, though the existence of anomalous comets with lower abundances of carbon-chain molecules relative to CN has long been known. M. F. A'Hearn et al. (1995) identified an entire class of these carbon-chain depleted comets, and the most recent full analysis of our database reveals there are varying degrees of carbon-chain depletion. Here we focus on the most depleted comets, the strongly carbon-chain depleted class, which is the largest non-typical compositional class to emerge from our taxonomic analyses. All comets in this class are strongly depleted in both C2 and C3 with respect to OH and CN, with depletions for these ratios being 3-27x below the mean abundance ratios for comets with typical composition. Several comets in this class additionally exhibit depletion in NH, with the largest depletions being 11x below mean typical values. A number of these comets exhibit asymmetry in production rates as a function of time and heliocentric distance, and one exhibits evidence of small secular changes. Almost all of the strongly depleted comets are Jupiter-family comets, indicating a Kuiper belt origin for this compositional class. Multiple lines of evidence from our full database indicate this composition is due to primordial conditions when and where these comets were formed and is not due to thermal heating after their arrival in the inner solar system.

 We present analyses of six microlensing events: KMT-2023-BLG-0548, KMT-2023-BLG-0830, KMT-2023-BLG-0949, KMT-2024-BLG-1281, KMT-2024-BLG-2059, and KMT-2024-BLG-2242. These were identified in KMTNet data from the 2023 -- 2024 seasons, selected for exhibiting anomalies shorter than one day -- potential signatures of low-mass planetary companions. Detailed modeling of the light curves reveals that the anomalies in all six events are caused by planetary companions to the lenses. The brief durations of the anomalies are attributed to various factors: a low planet-to-host mass ratio (KMT-2024-BLG-2059, KMT-2024-BLG-2242), a wide planet-host separation (KMT-2023-BLG-0548), small and elongated caustics restricting the source's interaction region (KMT-2023-BLG-0830, KMT-2024-BLG-1281), and a partial caustic crossing (KMT-2023-BLG-0949). { For KMT-2023-BLG-0548, the Bayesian posterior distribution of the lens mass shows two distinct peaks: a low-mass solution indicating a sub-Jovian planet orbiting an M dwarf in the Galactic disk, and a high-mass solution suggesting a super-Jovian planet around a K-type dwarf in the bulge. KMT-2023-BLG-0830 hosts a Neptune-mass planet orbiting an M dwarf in the Galactic bulge. KMT-2023-BLG-0949 involves a super-Jovian planet orbiting a $\sim 0.5~M_\odot$ host located at $\sim 6$ kpc. KMT-2024-BLG-2059Lb is a super-Earth with a mass about seven times that of Earth, orbiting an early M dwarf of $\sim 0.5~M_\odot$. KMT-2024-BLG-1281L hosts a planet slightly more massive than Neptune, orbiting an M dwarf of $\sim 0.3~M_\odot$. The short timescale and small angular Einstein radius of KMT-2024-BLG-2242 suggest a $\sim 0.07~M_\odot$ primary, likely a brown dwarf, with a Uranus/Neptune-mass planet.

 - **Abstract**
 The Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) will greatly improve upon sensitivities in the field of very-high-energy gamma-ray astrophysics. The CTAO northern site (CTAO-North, La Palma, Spain) currently hosts LST-1 with the remaining three large-sized telescopes (LSTs) expected in mid-2026 and one medium-sized telescope (MST) expected in mid-2027. The CTAO southern site (CTAO-South, Paranal, Chile) expects the delivery of five small-sized telescopes (SSTs) and two MSTs in early 2026 with on-site construction beginning in mid-2026. The dual-mirrored Schwarzschild-Couder Telescope (SCT) is a candidate MST for CTAO-South and is capable of observations in the energy range of 100 GeV to 10 TeV, the core of CTAO's 20 GeV to 300 TeV energy range. Inaugurated in January 2019, the prototype SCT (pSCT) located at the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory in southern Arizona observed gamma-ray emission from the Crab Nebula at a significance of 8.6 sigma in 2020. The pSCT utilizes a novel dual-mirror optics design and a densely packed focal plane of silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs). An upgrade of the pSCT camera is underway to fully instrument the camera with 11,328 pixels and an 8-degree diameter FoV. In addition, upgraded electronics will lower the front-end electronics noise, allowing for a lower trigger threshold and improved event reconstruction and background rejection. This work will present the status of the upgrade of the pSCT and discuss the future of the SCT.

 - **Abstract**
 The Pierre Auger and Telescope Array joint Working Group on the UHECR energy spectrum was established in 2012 to analyze energy scale uncertainties in both experiments and to in vestigate their systematic differences, particularly in the spectral shape of the flux measurements. Previous studies have indeed shown that, within systematic uncertainties, the energy s pectra measured by the two observatories are consistent below~$10\,\mathrm{EeV}$. However, at higher energies, a significant difference remains. In this work, we re-examine this discrepan cy in greater detail and explore its possible origins. We consider systematic and statistical uncertainties, including the conversion from directly measured observables to energy and the calculation of exposures. We present an updated energy scale comparison between the two experiments and updated flux measurements in the common declination band.

          Uncertainty-Aware Neural Networks for Fuzzy Dark Matter Model Selection from \texorpdfstring{$x_{\rm HI}$}{x_HI} Measurements

 - **Abstract**
 The nature of dark matter remains a central question in cosmology, with fuzzy dark matter (FDM) models offering a compelling alternative to the cold dark matter (CDM) paradigm. We explore FDM scenarios by performing 21-cm simulations across a parameter space with \texorpdfstring{$f_{\rm FDM} \in [0.02, 0.10]$}{f_FDM in [0.02, 0.10]} and \texorpdfstring{$m_{\rm FDM} \in [10^{-24}, 10^{-21}]\,\mathrm{eV}$}{m_FDM in [10^-24, 10^-21] eV}, obtaining global neutral hydrogen fractions (\texorpdfstring{$x_{\rm HI}$}{x_HI}) for each model. Observational \texorpdfstring{$x_{\rm HI}$}{x_HI} data and associated uncertainties from JWST are incorporated by estimating full probability density functions (PDFs) for both \texorpdfstring{$x_{\rm HI}$}{x_HI} and redshift \texorpdfstring{$z$}{z} using Bayesian inference with the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), yielding non-Gaussian multivariate uncertainty distributions. A hybrid machine learning framework is then trained on these observational PDFs to learn both central values and correlated uncertainties in \texorpdfstring{$x_{\rm HI}$}{x_HI} and \texorpdfstring{$z$}{z}, iteratively refining its parameters in each training epoch through direct incorporation of the multivariate PDFs derived from observational constraints. We then compare the simulation outputs to the machine-learned observational trends to identify the most consistent models. Our results indicate that FDM models with \texorpdfstring{$m_{\rm FDM} \simeq 10^{-22}\,\mathrm{eV}$}{m_FDM approx 10^-22 eV} and \texorpdfstring{$f_{\rm FDM} \simeq 0.04$}{f_FDM approx 0.04} best match current data, while lighter masses are strongly constrained. By integrating simulations and machine learning in an uncertainty-aware framework, this work explores the physics of the early Universe and guides future studies of 21-cm cosmology and reionization.

          On the origin of super-global spin-up trends of X-ray pulsars in HMXB systems

 - **Abstract**
 Most X-ray pulsars in high-mass X-ray binary (HMXB) systems exhibit both global and local trends of spin acceleration (spin-up) and deceleration (spin-down). Moreover, decades-long monitored objects display even more general spin-up trends in their spin evolution and simultaneously demonstrate a decrease in the orbital period, so-called orbital decay. Although obvious, this general behavior leaves the open question of the energy source and the mechanism of angular momentum transfer that ensures the neutron star's spin acceleration. We hypothesize that the observed spin acceleration of X-ray pulsars in HMXB (RLO and sgXRB) systems results from orbital angular momentum transfer via tidal interactions with their massive companions. To study these phenomena, we sample five well-studied objects with the longest observational history of their spin periods from the population of known Galactic persistent X-ray pulsars in HMXB systems. We obtain the spin frequency change from the observational data and estimate energy losses for orbital decay and pulsars' spin acceleration. We propose a new term of super-global spin-up trends, and show that their observable values do not exceed theoretical upper limits predicted within the scenario of orbital decay due to the tidal interaction between the neutron star and its massive companion.

 - **Abstract**
 Primordial black holes (PBHs) formed from the collapse of density fluctuations provide a unique window into the physics of the early Universe. Their evaporation through Hawking radiation around the epoch of Big Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) can leave measurable imprints on the primordial light-element abundances. In this work, we analyze in detail the effects of PBHs evaporating before BBN, with various intermediate steps understood analytically, and obtain the BBN constraint on PBHs within a transparent and reproducible framework. We find that, to produce observable effects on BBN, the PBH mass must exceed $10^{9}$ g, a threshold higher than that reported in some earlier studies. Slightly above $10^{9}$ g, the BBN sensitivity rapidly increases with the mass and then decreases, with the turning point occurring at $2\times10^{9}$ g. For PBHs in the mass range $[10^{9},\ 10^{10}]$ g, current measurements of BBN observables set an upper bound on the initial mass fraction parameter $\beta$ ranging from $10^{-17}$ to $10^{-19}$. To facilitate future improvements, we make our code publicly available, enabling straightforward incorporation of updated nuclear reaction rates, particle-physics inputs, and cosmological data.

 - **Abstract**
 Short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs), occasionally followed by a long and spectrally soft extended emission, are associated with compact object mergers (COMs). Yet, a few recent long GRBs (LGRBs) show compelling evidence for a COM origin, in contrast with the massive-star core-collapse origin of most LGRBs. While possible COM indicators were found, such as the minimum variability timescale (MVT), a detailed and unique characterisation of their gamma-ray prompt emission that may help identify and explain their deceptively long profile is yet to be found. Here we report the discovery of a set of distinctive properties that rule the temporal and spectral evolution of GRB 230307A, a LGRB with evidence for a COM origin. Specifically, the sequence of pulses that make up its profile is characterised by an exponential evolution of (i) flux intensities, (ii) waiting times between adjacent pulses, (iii) pulse durations, and (iv) spectral peak energy. Analogous patterns are observed in the prompt emission of other long COM candidates. The observed evolution of gamma-ray pulses would imply that a relativistic jet is colliding with more slowly expanding material. This contrasts with the standard internal shock model for typical LGRBs, in which dissipation occurs at random locations within the jet itself. We tentatively propose a few simple toy models that may explain these properties and are able to reproduce the overall time profile.

 - **Abstract**
 The correlation between solar Extreme Ultra-Violet (EUV) radiation above 8.8 eV and the release of sodium from the lunar surface via photon-stimulated desorption (PSD) is investigated. We use simultaneous measurements of EUV photon flux and Na optical spectral line flux ($F_{Na}$) from the lunar exosphere. Data were acquired with the high-resolution (R$\sim$72000) Echelle Spectrograph on the 2.34-m Vainu Bappu Telescope during the lunar first quarter (January-March 2024), observing $Na\,I$ D2 and D1 flux at altitudes below $\sim590\,km$ from the surface. Simultaneous EUV and FUV measurements were acquired from the GOES-R Series Extreme Ultraviolet Sensor (EUVS), while NUV data were obtained from the Total and Spectral Solar Irradiance Sensor-1 (TSIS-1) aboard the ISS. We correlated $F_{Na}$ with EUV photon flux from EUVS across six bands spanning $256-1405\,\text{Å}$ (48.5-8.8 eV) and NUV (2000-4000 $\text{Å}$) from TSIS-1. A non-linear rise in lunar exospheric sodium with increasing EUV and FUV fluxes was observed, contrasting with previous linear PSD models. The EUV radiation above 10 eV drives sodium release, with 256-304 $\text{Å}$ wavelengths as dominant contributors. Additionally, the NUV flux and $F_{Na}$ are positively correlated, indicating the role of sodium release. The zenith column density averages $3.3\times10^{9}$ atoms cm$^{-2}$, with Characteristic temperatures averaging at $\sim$6700K and scale heights of $\sim$1500 km. Elevated temperatures and sodium densities during solar activity suggest enhanced Na release during flares. These results emphasize the need for a revised PSD model above 8.8 eV and improved constraints on the PSD cross-section.

 - **Abstract**
 Mars exploration requires precise and reliable terrain models to ensure safe rover navigation across its unpredictable and often hazardous landscapes. Stereoscopic vision serves a critical role in the rover's perception, allowing scene reconstruction by generating precise depth maps through stereo matching. State-of-the-art Martian planetary exploration uses traditional local block-matching, aggregates cost over square windows, and refines disparities via smoothness constraints. However, this method often struggles with low-texture images, occlusion, and repetitive patterns because it considers only limited neighbouring pixels and lacks a wider understanding of scene context. This paper uses Semi-Global Matching (SGM) with superpixel-based refinement to mitigate the inherent block artefacts and recover lost details. The approach balances the efficiency and accuracy of SGM and adds context-aware segmentation to support more coherent depth inference. The proposed method has been evaluated in three datasets with successful results: In a Mars analogue, the terrain maps obtained show improved structural consistency, particularly in sloped or occlusion-prone regions. Large gaps behind rocks, which are common in raw disparity outputs, are reduced, and surface details like small rocks and edges are captured more accurately. Another two datasets, evaluated to test the method's general robustness and adaptability, show more precise disparity maps and more consistent terrain models, better suited for the demands of autonomous navigation on Mars, and competitive accuracy across both non-occluded and full-image error metrics. This paper outlines the entire terrain modelling process, from finding corresponding features to generating the final 2D navigation maps, offering a complete pipeline suitable for integration in future planetary exploration missions.

 - **Abstract**
 Aims. The aim of this work is to determine the maximum ages that can be unambiguously established for $\delta$ Sct stars using seismic observables, and, by extension, the oldest open clusters that can be dated using this type of star. Methods. I estimate the large frequency separation using various techniques applied to two samples of $\delta$ Sct located near the red edge of the instability strip. One sample consists of 18 targets observed by the Kepler mission, and the other comprises 17 targets observed by TESS. I employ a grid of stellar models representative of typical $\delta$ Sct parameters, incorporating mass, metallicity, and rotation as independent variables, and compute the first eight radial modes for each model. Using the observed spectroscopic temperature, and the estimated large separation, I estimate the age of each star by fitting a weighted probability density function to the age distribution of the models that best match the seismic constraints. Results. To evaluate the performance of the fitting method, it was applied to a synthetic population of 20 $\delta$ Sct stars with varying metallicities and ages, generated by randomly selecting models. The analysis indicates that $\delta$ Sct stars older than 1 Gyr, but still prior to reaching the terminal-age main sequence, can in principle be reliably age-dated. Nevertheless, when the method is applied to the observational sample, only three out of the 35 stars considered marginally exceed an estimated age of 1 Gyr. Conclusions. From these results, I can say that open clusters older than approximately 1 Gyr cannot be reliably dated using astero-seismology of $\delta$ Sct stars with 1D models, at least not without a more complete treatment of convection and a non-linear treatment of rotation.

          Asteroseismology of the young open cluster NGC 2516 II. Constraining cluster age using gravity-mode pulsators

 - **Abstract**
 Although asteroseismology is regarded as the most powerful tool for probing stellar interiors, seismic modelling remains dependent on global stellar parameters. Stellar clusters offer direct measurements of these parameters by fitting a CMD, making the application of asteroseismology in clusters a valuable approach to advancing stellar physics modelling. We aimed to develop seismic modelling for gravity-mode pulsators in the open cluster NGC 2516 to determine stellar ages. We computed 1D stellar models using MESA, incorporating rotation-induced transport processes. Exponential overshooting was included, as well as rotationally induced mixing in the radiative envelope. Grids of evolutionary models were computed covering isochrone-derived mass ranges. The models were evolved up to 300 Myr because of the cluster's young age (~100Myr). By fitting the frequencies of identified modes of four gravity-mode member pulsators simultaneously, we measure the seismic age of the cluster NGC 2516 as 132+-8Myr. This high-precision seismic age estimate deviates by 1sigma from the isochronal age derived from public MIST isochrones for rotating stars. Our findings show that seismic modelling strongly constrains core overshooting, but because the period spacing patterns are smooth, it provides weak constraints on mixing in the radiative envelopes. The two most massive gravity-mode pulsators have MIST masses ~2.0M_sun while their seismic masses are 1.75M_sun. We constructed new asteroseismology-calibrated isochrones using input physics identical to that of our seismic model grid. While this resolves the age discrepancy, the mass discrepancy is only partially addressed. The remaining small yet persisting mass discrepancy implies a mismatch between the physics in core to surface environments of 1D stellar models and the seismic observables probing those areas of fast-rotating stars.

 I present a preliminary orbit for the satellite of dwarf planet (136472) Makemake, based on archival Hubble Space Telescope images taken on 13 days between April 2015 and February 2019. The satellite was detected on twelve of them. A best-fit circular orbit has a period of $18.023 \pm 0.017$ d, a semi-major axis of $22250 \pm 780$ km, and an inclination of $83.7^{\circ} \pm 1.0^{\circ}$ relative to the line of sight. That orbit is nearly edge-on, raising the possibility of ongoing or imminent mutual events between Makemake and its satellite.

 - **Abstract**
 In the presence of significant measurement uncertainties, the events which appear to be the most extreme are very likely to be those exhibiting the greatest statistical fluctuations. It is therefore particularly important to exercise care when interpreting such events and to use the entire observed population for context. Here, I attempt to pedagogically illustrate this using the example of the most massive binary black hole so far detected in gravitational-wave data, GW231123. I argue that its total mass may be significantly lower than $238^{+28}_{-49}$ solar masses as reported by Abac et al. (2025a). The maximum total binary black hole mass from an analysis of the entire detected population may well be less than 140 solar masses, but the value is very sensitive to assumptions about the population distribution.

 - **Abstract**
 Comet C/2020 V2 (ZTF) is categorized as a dynamically new long-period comet, making its first approach to the inner Solar system. We have observed this comet for around 32 months (from January 2022 to July 2024) at heliocentric distances from 5.41 au (pre-perihelion) to 5.26 au (post-perihelion) through various telescopes, employing photometric (60 epochs) and spectroscopic techniques (5 epochs). Using these observations, we derived the production rates of different molecules such as CN$(0-0)$, C$_2(\Delta \nu=0)$, and C$_3$ and calculated the production rate ratios. The values of the ratios closest to the perihelion are found to be $\log$ (C$_2/$CN) $ = -0.04 \pm 0.03$ and $\log$ (C$_3/$CN) $ = -0.70 \pm 0.04$, which implies a typical carbon composition. The mean photometric broadband colours are found to be $B-V = 0.77\pm0.04$, $V-R = 0.43\pm0.04$, $R-I = 0.42\pm0.06$, and $B-R = 1.19\pm0.04$. The stability of the molecular production rate ratios and mean photometric broadband colours, pre- and post-perihelion, implies a homogeneous composition. The mean reflectivity gradient for $B-V$ colour is $10.90 \pm 3.62$ $\%/1000$ Å; $V-R$ colour is $6.15 \pm 3.51$ $\%/1000$ Å; and for $R-I$ colour is $4.94 \pm 3.56$ $\%/1000$ Å which is similar to the mean value of the dynamically new comets. Additionally, using an asymmetric non-gravitational force model, we report the comet's nuclear radius to be $1.1 \pm 0.1$ km. Our results are expected to provide inputs to the selection of a potential dynamically new comet as a target for the Comet Interceptor mission.

 - **Abstract**
 Interstellar objects (ISOs) can become gravitationally bound to the solar system, enabling multiple observations. If these bound ISOs exist, they provide valuable opportunities to generalize models of planetesimal formation, composition, and ejection beyond our solar system. We explore two mechanisms for ISO capture: gravitational braking (primarily with Jupiter) and the Hills mechanism with the Sun. Using N-body simulations, we investigate ISO capture rates, ejection probabilities, and the resulting orbital elements. Our simulations suggest that approximately 10 ISOs may currently be bound to the solar system, with the vast majority captured through gravitational braking by Jupiter. These objects are bound by a Tisserand parameter with respect to Jupiter less than three, tend to have high eccentricities, semi-major axes larger than Jupiter's, and inclinations modestly biased toward the prograde direction. This region is sparsely populated by observed solar system objects. By comparing known solar system objects to the most probable orbital elements of our simulated ISOs, we identify 18 candidate objects in the current solar system population that may be bound ISOs captured by Jupiter. For the Hills mechanism, we find it to be a viable but less common capture pathway, typically producing isotropic inclinations and perihelia less than one au. Based on these characteristics, we identify seven additional candidate objects for ISOs captured through the Hills mechanism.

 - **Abstract**
 We reassess the realistic discovery reach of Solar--System experiments for dark energy (DE) and dark matter (DM) and quantify their complementarity to dedicated cosmological probes, such as the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and Euclid mission. In scalar-tensor frameworks with universal conformal coupling $A(\phi)$, screening (chameleon/symmetron, Vainshtein) suppresses fifth forces in deep Solar potentials, consistent with the gravitational-wave speed bound $|c_{\tt T}/c-1|\lesssim 10^{-15}$. We treat Solar--System tests as hypothesis-driven probes: we assemble quantitative guardrails (MICROSCOPE $\eta$, Cassini $\gamma$, LLR $\dot G/G$ and SEP, ephemeris limits on $\rho_{\rm DM}$ and Yukawa $\alpha(\lambda)$, and clock-network searches for ultralight DM), place them alongside current cosmology posteriors, and provide an explicit map from cosmology-level linear response (e.g., $\mu_{\rm lin,0}$) to local residuals using the screening relations (thin--shell and Vainshtein). Guided by systematics-gated criteria, we outline a near-term program -- solar-conjunction Shapiro-delay and Doppler/range tests, sustained millimeter-class LLR, global optical-clock links, refined ephemerides, and spaceborne atom interferometry (AIS) -- with realistic sensitivities $|\gamma-1|\in (2$--$5)\times 10^{-6}$, $\eta_{\rm EEP}\sim10^{-16}$--$10^{-17}$ (AIS/LLR), $|\dot{G}/G|\lesssim (2$--$5)\times 10^{-14}\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$, a uniform $\simeq 2\times$ tightening of AU-scale Yukawa/DM-density bounds, and $3$--$10\times$ gains in ultralight-DM couplings from clock networks. Primary discovery potential for late-time dark energy lies with multi-probe cosmology (geometry and growth), while a hypothesis-driven Solar--System program supplies high-leverage falsification and selective discovery windows for dark matter with ultralight mediators or long-range forces.

 In this study, we investigate the microstructure properties of four pulsars (PSRs J0953+0755 (B0950+08), J0627+0706, J0826+2637 (B0823+26) and J1946+1805 (B1944+17)) using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST), with particular emphasis on identifying microstructure within interpulse (IP). Through the application of autocorrelation function (ACF) analysis and fast Fourier transform (FFT) techniques, we have systematically examined the periodicity of microstructure in these pulsars. Our findings represent the first successful detection of microstructure within IP. Furthermore, we conducted a comprehensive statistical analysis comparing the characteristic timescales ($\tau_{\mu}$) and the characteristic periods $P_{\mu}$ of quasi-periodic microstructure between the main pulse (MP) and IP, and our results indicate that the $\tau_{\mu}$ and $P_{\mu}$ of microstructure across components appear consistent within measurement errors for PSR J0627+0706, but microstructure in IP are relatively smaller than those in MP for PSR J0953+0755. Furthermore, the relationship between $P_{\mu}$ of microstructure and the rotation period in neutron star populations was reconfirmed: $P_{\mu}(\text{ms})=(1.337\pm0.114)\times P(\text{s})^{(1.063\pm0.038)}$.

 - **Abstract**
 We perform long-term general-relativistic neutrino-radiation hydrodynamic simulations for core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) which include the cooling effect induced by the coupling between axion-like particles (ALPs) and photons. We take into account the \kanji{photon} coalescence and the Primakoff effect, and investigate ALPs with the mass of 10\,MeV and the coupling constant $g_{a\gamma}$ of $1.0\times10^{-9}{\rm \,GeV^{-1}}$ to $7.0\times10^{-9}{\rm \,GeV^{-1}}$. It is found that the effects of the ALP cooling emerge in the late phase rather than the early phase and the ALP luminosities are always lower than the neutrino luminosity in our simulations. We estimate the number of neutrino events for Super-Kamiokande assuming a 10\,kpc CCSN. We conclude that signatures of ALPs could be found in the long-term neutrino signals from a nearby CCSN event in the future, even if $g_{a\gamma}$ is below an upper limit based on the conventional energy-loss argument.

 Context. Owing to its sensitivity to wide-orbit giant exoplanets, direct imaging is uniquely positioned to shed light on the interplay between proto-planetary disks and stellar hosts. Besides constraining formation models, new detections are natural benchmarks for atmospheric characterization. Aims. The COBREX project performed an extensive reanalysis of archival observations from SPHERE and GPI using advanced post-processing techniques, enhancing detection sensitivity at close separation. Newly found companion candidates are being followed up to confirm new planets. Methods. Following the detection of a companion candidate around the young ($\sim 15$ Myr) binary star HD 143811, we collected a new observation with SPHERE@VLT ($0.95-1.67 {\mu}$m) to confirm the presence of the source and to assess its physical bond to the target. Results. We report the discovery of a new exoplanet orbiting HD 143811 at a projected separation of $0.43" \sim 60$ au. Thanks to a 9-yr-long baseline, we derive a mostly face-on and low eccentricity orbit with a period of $320^{+250}_{-90}$ years. The luminosity of the planet, constrained through H-band spectrum from GPI, H-band photometry from SPHERE/IRDIS and YJ upper limits from SPHERE/IFS, allows us to place strong constraints on the planet's intrinsic temperature ($T_{int} = 1000 \pm 30$K), corresponding to a mass of $6.1^{+0.7}_{-0.9}$ MJup. Conclusions. HD 143811(AB)b is the second planet ever discovered by GPI; it joins the small cohort of circumbinary planets discovered through imaging, becoming a prime target for follow-up formation, dynamical, and characterization studies.

 - **Abstract**
 The first HIRES/Keck precision radial velocity (RV) catalog was released in 2017; it was followed by a second release in 2019, which incorporated corrections for small but significant systematic errors. The manifestation of stellar activity accompanied by systematic errors could affect the detection of exoplanets via the RV method. We expanded the HIRES catalog to March 2023 using publicly available spectra. Furthermore, we included the chromospheric emission line Ca II H&K indicator ($R_{\mathrm{HK}}^\prime$), which is among the most prominent tracers of stellar activity. The precision RVs were obtained using an iodine gas absorption cell and corrected for minor systematic errors. $R_{\mathrm{HK}}^\prime$ measurements were derived by rectifying the observed spectra with PHOENIX synthetic spectra models in six narrow bands surrounding the H and K lines, then subtracting the photospheric contribution. We present an updated HIRES/Keck precision RV catalog featuring 78,920 RV measurements for 1,702 stars. High-quality $R_{\mathrm{HK}}^\prime$ measurements are provided for ~ 40% of the HIRES catalog. The updated catalog can help distinguish stellar activity effects from planetary signals in RV time series, thereby corroborating previously detected planetary candidates and aiding in the detection of new ones.

 - **Abstract**
 This study proposes a schematic plan for in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) in Martian volcanic terrains. The work investigated the complexity of volcanic terrains and Martian environmental hazards and suggested comprehensive engineering strategies to overcome the odds and establish a successful mining program in Martian volcanic regions. Slope stabilization methods - such as terracing and anchored drilling rigs - with terrain-adaptive rovers capable of autonomous operations on steep unstable slopes has been suggested as feasible solutions to navigate the complex geological terrains of Martian volcanoes. The mid range rover design with a mass of approximately 2.1 t, proposed here for mining operations, incorporates a six-wheel rocker-bogie suspension, anchoring-enabled drilling arm, dust-mitigation solar arrays, and advanced sensing systems for hazard detection and navigation. A comparative analysis regarding choice of roads and rails for building transport infrastructure has also been performed. We have also looked into the energy requirement of the rover to work under extreme environmental conditions of Mars and suggested a combination of solar and nuclear power to account for the huge energy requirements of sustained operations on Mars. The results demonstrate that mission success in these environments depends on integrating mechanical resilience, environmental adaptability, and operational autonomy, enabling sustainable access to resources in one of Mars' most geologically challenging settings.

 - **Abstract**
 The equation of state (EOS) of cold dense matter is a central open problem in nuclear astrophysics. Its inference is hindered by the lack of \textit{ab initio} control above about twice nuclear saturation density, requiring extrapolation. Parametric schemes such as piecewise polytropes (PP) are efficient but restrictive, while nonparametric approaches like Gaussian processes (GP) allow more flexibility at the cost of larger prior volumes. We extend our hybrid EOS framework by replacing the high-density polytropic extension with a GP representation of the squared sound speed, anchored at low densities by the SLy crust EOS and a nuclear meta-model constrained by $\chi$EFT and laboratory data. Using hierarchical Bayesian analysis, we jointly constrain the EOS and neutron star mass distribution with multi-messenger observations, including NICER radii, GW170817 and GW190425 tidal deformabilities, pulsar masses, and neutron skin experiments. We examine four scenarios defined by high-density extrapolation (PP vs.\ GP) and hotspot geometry in the NICER modeling of PSR~J0030$+$0451 (ST+PDT vs.\ PDT-U). GP extrapolations generally yield softer EOS posteriors with broader uncertainties. Hotspot assumptions also play an important role, shifting inferred mass--radius relations. Bayesian evidence strongly favors the ST+PDT geometry over PDT-U under both extrapolations, while GP is mildly preferred over PP. These results underscore the impact of observational modeling and EOS extrapolation on neutron star inferences, and show that a GP-based extension offers a robust way to quantify systematic uncertainties in high-density matter.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a deep learning approach to classify fast radio bursts (FRBs) based purely on morphology as encoded on recorded dynamic spectrum from CHIME/FRB Catalog 2. We implemented transfer learning with a pretrained ConvNext architecture, exploiting its powerful feature extraction ability. ConvNext was adapted to classify dedispersed dynamic spectra (which we treat as images) of the FRBs into one of the two sub-classes, i.e., repeater and non-repeater, based on their various temporal and spectral properties and relation between the sub-pulse structures. Additionally, we also used mathematical model representation of the total intensity data to interpret the deep learning model. Upon fine-tuning the pretrained ConvNext on the FRB spectrograms, we were able to achieve high classification metrics while substantially reducing training time and computing power as compared to training a deep learning model from scratch with random weights and biases without any feature extraction ability. Importantly, our results suggest that the morphological differences between CHIME repeating and non-repeating events persist in Catalog 2 and the deep learning model leveraged these differences for classification. The fine-tuned deep learning model can be used for inference, which enables us to predict whether an FRB's morphology resembles that of repeaters or non-repeaters. Such inferences may become increasingly significant when trained on larger data sets that will exist in the near future.

 - **Abstract**
 We conduct an indirect dark matter (DM) search in the Galactic Center, focusing on a square region within $\pm 9^{\circ}$ in Galactic longitude and latutide, using 2,865 days of data ($\sim$8 years) from the High-Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) Observatory. We explore DM particles within the Weakly Interacting Massive Particles framework with masses from 1 TeV to 10 PeV. Analyzing three annihilation channels ($b\bar{b}$, $\tau^{+}\tau^{-}$, $W^{+}W^{-}$) and three density profiles (Navarro-Frenk-White, Einasto, Burkert), we find no significant excess and set 95\% confidence-level upper limits on the velocity-weighted annihilation cross section. Our results provide the first constraints on DM particles well above 100 TeV using gamma-ray data from the Galactic Center, with the strongest limits $\mathcal{O}(10^{-24})$~cm$^{3}$/s, from the $\tau^{+}\tau^{-}$ channel and the Einasto profile.

 - **Abstract**
 Determining the physical properties of ices across the solar system is essential for understanding the surface dynamics, volatile transport, and climate evolution on ice-covered planetary bodies. Here, we use well-constrained measurements of snow that has metamorphosed into coarse-grained firn and bubbly glacier ice in East Antarctica to test three commonly-used radiative transfer models: delta-Eddington, Hapke, and Shkuratov. Using the measured optical properties, we find that the delta-Eddington model generally shows the least deviation from the measured albedo, followed by the Shkuratov and Hapke models, respectively. But when the models are used to infer the grain radius using the measured albedo, the Shkuratov model provides closer best-fit grain radii (off by average factor 0.9) than delta-Eddington (0.6), and Hapke (1.8). Despite this, the spectral albedos estimated by the Shkuratov and Hapke models using their respective best-fit grain radii deviate more from the measurements than delta-Eddington. This result is caused by the Hapke and Shkuratov models not accounting for: (1) the increased absorption within dense ice, and (2) specular reflection at the surface of firn and ice. Additionally, all three models do not account for the nonsphericity of bubbles within ice. The combination of these factors leads to model errors generally increasing with increasing grain radius. Based on our quantitative comparison, we recommend using the delta-Eddington model for predicting the albedo and inferring the grain radius of ices across the solar system because it generally produces the least error while using realistic physical parameters.

 The recent discovery of a third interstellar object (ISO) 3I/ATLAS, following 1I/`Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, has raised questions about the nature and origin of these enigmatic objects. With the Vera C. Rubin Observatory expected to discover dozens of new ISOs over the next decade, it is timely to use a classification scheme for their nature in the context of the recently proposed Loeb scale. Here, we provide a formalism for ranking ISOs quantitatively on the Loeb Scale in analogy to Sagan's formalism for mapping the Kardashev scale based on the energy output of technological civilizations.

 - **Abstract**
 Spectral line surveys of the Taurus Molecular Cloud-1 (TMC-1) have led to the detection of more than 100 new molecular species, making it the most prolific source of interstellar molecular discoveries. These wide-band, high-sensitivity line surveys have been enabled by advances in telescope and receiver technology, particularly at centimeter and millimeter wavelengths. In this work, we present a statistical analysis of the molecular inventory of TMC-1 as probed by the GOTHAM large program survey from 3.9 to 36.4 GHz. To fully unlock the potential of the $\sim$29 GHz spectral bandwidth, we developed an automated pipeline for data reduction and calibration. We applied a Bayesian approach with Markov-Chain Monte Carlo fitting to the calibrated spectra and constrained column densities for 102 molecular species detected in TMC-1, including 75 main isotopic species, 20 carbon-13 substituted species, and seven deuterium-substituted species. This list of the detected gas-phase molecules is populated by unsaturated hydrocarbons, in stark contrast to the oxygen-rich organics found in sublimated ices around protostars. Of note, ten individual aromatic molecules were identified in the GOTHAM observations, contributing 0.011% of the gas-phase carbon budget probed by detected molecules when including CO and 6% when excluding CO. This work provides a reference set of observed gas-phase molecular abundances for interstellar clouds, offering a new benchmark for astrochemical theoretical models.

 This paper presents the first structured evaluation of Solar System bodies hypothetically relocated to Earth orbit (1 AU) to assess their potential as alternative habitats. Using comparative criteria, planetary size and gravity, atmospheric retention, volatile accessibility, weather system potential, soil development feasibility, and orbital transfer cost. We find that most bodies are unsuitable. Mercury and the Moon lack volatiles and atmospheres, while gas and ice giants offer no solid surfaces. Venus, despite strong atmospheric retention, remains constrained by extreme greenhouse forcing. Mars emerges as the most viable candidate, balancing accessibility and volatile resources. Titan provides a conditional long-term promise, with a dense atmosphere and rich organics that could transition to a water-based cycle at 1 AU. These findings highlight new pathways for planetary engineering and long-term human survival.

 - **Abstract**
 The Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST) is the world's largest single-dish radio telescope, and the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) is one of its five key science objectives. We conducted a targeted narrowband search toward the TRAPPIST-1 system using FAST. The observations consisted of five independent L-band pointings, each with a 20-minute integration, for a total on-source time of 1.67h. The frequency coverage spanned 1.05--1.45GHz with a spectral resolution of ~7.5Hz. We searched for narrowband drifting signals with Doppler drift rates within +_4Hz/s and a signal-to-noise ratio threshold of S/N>10 in two orthogonal linear polarizations this http URL on the system parameters adopted in this work, we estimate a minimum detectable equivalent isotropic radiated power of 2.04x10^10W, placing one of the most stringent constraints to date on persistent or high-duty-cycle narrowband transmitters in this system. No credible technosignature candidates were identified within the searched parameter space. Nevertheless,TRAPPIST-1 remains a compelling target for future SETI efforts. We plan to extend our search to other signal types, such as periodic or transient transmitters, and to carry out broader surveys of nearby exoplanetary systems with FAST.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an automated search method for radio transients on the minute timescale focused on the emerging long period transients (LPTs) in image-plane radio data. The method is tuned for use with the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) and tested on archival observations from the GaLactic and Extragalactic All-Sky MWA Extended Survey (GLEAM-X) in the 70--300 MHz range. The images are formed from model-subtracted visibilities, before applying three filters to the time series of each pixel in an image, with each filter designed to be sensitive to a different transient behaviour. Due to the nature of radio interferometry and the refraction of the fluctuating ionosphere, the vast majority of candidates at this stage are artefacts which we identify and remove using a set of flagging measures. Of the 336 final candidates, 7 were genuine transients; 1 new LPT, 1 new pulsar, and 5 known pulsars. The performance of the method is analysed by injecting modelled transient pulses into a subset of the observations and applying the method to the result.

 - **Abstract**
 Rejection of cloud-contaminated data is a complex and important process at the Pierre Auger Observatory, one which combines information from several sources, including IR cameras, lidars, and satellite imaging. With the deteriorating quality of the IR cameras and challenges in using other sources, we propose a new method. We use continuous detector monitoring measurements to build a large database of night sky background fluxes for each pixel across 27 telescopes. Using this database, we generate the expected background flux and define cloud rejection thresholds. Through a straightforward analysis we construct boolean cloud-contamination masks. We demonstrate some results of the analysis, including comparisons with cloud detected using infra-red observations.

 As we enter the final year of the second extended mission of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), it is time to reflect on what the TESS mission has contributed to the advancement of astronomy. Thousands of papers based on TESS data have already been published, making it a challenge to select the ones we mention or summarise in this review. As the title suggests, this paper focuses on variable stars, that is, phenomena that causes a star's brightness to change. We discuss all the major classes of extrinsic and intrinsic variables, from planetary transits to pulsating stars, excluding only the longest-period ones, which are not well suited for the typical time spans of TESS time-series observations. TESS has provided significant and interesting data and results for all these variable types. We hope that this selection successfully demonstrates the diverse applicability of TESS in variable star research.

 - **Abstract**
 Black hole X-ray binaries (BH XRBs) launch powerful relativistic jets during bright outburst phases. The properties of these outflows change dramatically between different spectral/accretion states. Collimated, compact jets are observed during the hard state and are quenched during the soft state, while discrete ejecta are mainly launched during the hard-to-soft state transition. Currently, we still do not understand what triggers the formation and destruction of compact jets or the launch of discrete ejecta. In this context, finding a unique link between the jet evolution and the properties of the X-ray emission, such as its fast variability, would imply a major progress in our understanding of the fundamental mechanisms that drive relativistic outflows in BH XRBs. Here we show that a brief but strong radio re-brightening during a predominantly soft state of the BH XRB MAXI J1348$-$630 was contemporaneous with a significant increase in the X-ray rms variability observed with NICER in 2019. During this phase, the variability displayed significant changes and, at the same time, MAXI J1348$-$630 launched two pairs of relativistic discrete ejecta that we detected with the MeerKAT and ATCA radio-interferometers. We propose that short-lived compact jets were reactivated during this excursion to the hard-intermediate state and were switched off before the ejecta launch, a phenomenology that has been very rarely observed in these systems. Interestingly, with the caveat of gaps in our radio and X-ray coverage, we suggest a tentative correspondence between the launch of ejecta and the drop in X-ray rms variability in this source, while other typical X-ray signatures associated with discrete ejections are not detected. We discuss how these results provide us with insights into the complex and dynamic coupling between the jets and hot corona in BH XRBs.

 - **Abstract**
 Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) seek to detect a nano-Hz stochastic gravitational-wave background (GWB) by searching for the characteristic Hellings and Downs angular pattern of timing residual correlations. So far, the evidence remains below the conventional $5$-$\sigma$ threshold, as assessed using the literature-standard ``optimal cross-correlation detection statistic''. While this quadratic combination of cross-correlated data maximizes the {\em deflection} (signal-to-noise ratio), it does not maximize the detection probability at fixed false-alarm probability (FAP), and therefore is not Neyman-Pearson (NP) optimal for the assumed noise and signal models. The NP-optimal detection statistic is a different quadratic form, but is not used because it also incorporates autocorrelations, making it more susceptible to uncertainties in the modeling of pulsar timing noise. Here, we derive the best compromise: a quadratic detection statistic which is as close as possible to the NP-optimal detection statistic (minimizing the variance of its difference with the NP statistic) subject to the constraint that it only uses cross-correlations, so that it is less affected by pulsar noise modeling errors. We study the performance of this new $\NPMV$ statistic for a simulated PTA whose noise and (putative) signal match those of the NANOGrav 15-year data release: GWB amplitude $A_{\rm gw}=2.1\times 10^{-15}$ and spectral index $\gamma=13/3$. Compared to the literature-standard ``optimal" cross-correlation detection statistic, the $\NPMV$ statistic increases the detection probability by $47\%$ when operating at a $5$-$\sigma$ FAP of $\alpha = 2.9 \times 10^{-7}$.

          Understanding JWST water spectra: what can thermochemical models tell us about the (cold) water in protoplanetary disks?

 - **Abstract**
 (Abridged) Rotational H$_2$O spectra as observed with JWST/MIRI provide a good probe of the temperature and column density structure of the inner disk. H$_2$O emission can also be influenced by dynamical processes, such as dust grains drifting inwards and their icy mantles sublimating once they cross the snowlines, thus enriching the inner regions in H$_2$O vapor. Recent work has found that this process may leave an imprint in the H$_2$O spectrum in the form of excess flux in the cold H$_2$O lines. In this work, we aim to test the accuracy of several common retrieval techniques on full 2D thermochemical disk models. Moreover, we investigate the cold H$_2$O emission that has been proposed as a signature of drift, to gain further insights into the underlying radial and vertical distribution of H$_2$O. We present two sets of Dust And LInes (DALI) thermochemical models and run several retrieval techniques to investigate how the retrieved temperature and column density compare to our models. Single-temperature slab retrievals mainly trace the warm ($\sim$500 K) H$_2$O reservoir, whereas a three-component fit is able to better trace the full temperature gradient in the IR emitting region. Retrieved temperatures tend to underestimate the true temperature of the emitting layer due to non-LTE effects. The retrieved column density traces close to the mid-IR dust $\tau=1$ surface. We find that the strength of the cold H$_2$O emission is directly linked to the H$_2$O abundance above the snow surface at large radii (>1 au). This implies that sources with excess cold H$_2$O flux likely have a high H$_2$O abundance in this region ($\gtrsim10^{-5}$), higher than predicted by the chemical network. This discrepancy is most likely caused by the absence of dust transport processes in our models, further strengthening the theory that this emission may be a signature of radial drift and vertical mixing.

 - **Abstract**
 The optical spectra of Titan reveal a rich set of absorption features, most of which are likely associated with methane (CH$_4$). Methane is a key molecule in planetary and exoplanetary atmospheres, yet a comprehensive high-resolution linelist at optical wavelengths remains incomplete. This study identified and characterized potential CH$_4$ absorption features in high-resolution optical spectra of Titan, providing essential data for linelist development and improving CH$_4$ detection and characterization. We analyzed Titan spectra from the ESPRESSO spectrograph (R $\approx$ 190,000), identifying intrinsic features and measuring their relative strengths. A conservative detection approach was employed, slightly overestimating solar and telluric contributions to distinguish them from Titan's intrinsic features. To assess the impact of spectral resolution, we compared the ESPRESSO data with Titan UVES data (R $\approx$ 110,000). We identified 6,195 absorption features in the ESPRESSO spectra potentially associated with CH$_4$, of which 5,436 are newly reported. ESPRESSO detected twice as many features as UVES in overlapping regions, highlighting the advantage of higher-resolution data. Most detected lines remained unresolved, so our reported features are primarily blended absorption structures. We estimated the detection limit for feature identification to correspond to a CH$_4$ absorption coefficient of approximately 0.02 km-am$^{-1}$. Comparison of our results with a previous analysis of Titan UVES spectra and with experimental CH$_4$ data at a similar temperature showed good agreement, while some discrepancies were observed when compared with data acquired at a different temperature. We provide a comprehensive list of Titan absorption features with key reliability metrics, along with Titan's intrinsic spectra, to support future studies.

          Origin of the lunar isotopic crisis from solidification of a stratified lunar magma ocean

 - **Abstract**
 According to the giant impact theory, the Moon formed through accreting the debris disk produced by a collision between Theia and the proto-Earth. The giant impact theory can explain most of the properties of the Earth-Moon system, however, simulations with respect to giant impact between a planetary embryo and the growing proto-Earth show that more than 40 percent of the materials in the circum-terrestrial debris disk produced by the giant impact originates from the impactor. Thus, the giant impact theory has difficulty explaining the Moon's Earth-like isotopic compositions, which is referred to as the lunar isotopic crisis. With the assumption that Theia may have possessed an iron-rich mantle compared with proto-Earth's mantle, here we show that, after the formation of the stratified lunar magma ocean, solidification of the stratified lunar magma ocean would result that the upper solid layer is composed of proto-Earth's mantle and the lower solid layer is made of Theia's mantle, meaning that the Moon's Earth-like isotopic composition is a natural result of the giant impact. The theory proposed here may provide a way of explaining the lunar isotopic crisis.

 This work presents measurements of local HII environment metallicities of core-collapse supernovae (SNe) in hosts with redshifts up to z$\sim$0.025. 139 SNe environments were observed at the Isaac Newton Telescope and data of an additional 268 SNe environments were found in archival data of MUSE, MaNGA and PISCO. The project focuses on SNe with clean Type IIP, Type Ib and Type Ic classifications. We present the largest spectroscopic sample to date, evaluating environment metallicities of 79 Type Ib, 66 Type Ic and 93 Type IIP by N2 and O3N2 strong emission line methods. The cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) of the SN environment metallicities show Type Ib and Type Ic SNe tending towards higher metallicity than Type IIP. We test the null hypothesis that Type Ib/Ic/IIP progenitors are drawn from the same parent population. There is no statistically significant difference between progenitors of Type Ib and Type Ic SNe. However, when comparing Ib/Ic with IIP SNe, the tests indicate strong statistical significance (significance level better than 1\%) to reject our null hypothesis suggesting that the samples are not drawn from the same parent population. The significance is even higher (level better 0.1\%) when testing Type IIP vs. the combined Type Ib+Ic sample. These results support a different physical nature of Type IIP and Types Ib/Ic progenitors. It challenges stellar evolution and SNe explosion models to reproduce the distinct CDFs found.

 - **Abstract**
 Super-fast rotators (SFRs; P < 2.2 hr) are of great importance in asteroid studies; yet, many reported detections suffer from aliasing caused by an insufficient observation cadence. We present dense CCD photometry for 15 SFRs candidates (14 after excluding 11219 Benbohn, whose published period already exceeds the spin barrier) observed from 2023 Aug 11 to 2024 Aug 11 with the 1.5 m Sierra Nevada and 1.4 m AS Vidojevica telescopes. Our dataset comprises approximately 2,400 calibrated data points, with per-measurement formal errors of 0.02-0.04 mag and total on-target coverage of 2-13 hr per object. We have reliably determined periods for 9 targets. In terms of spin rate, we have confirmed four SFRs with periods of 1.06-1.84 hr and peak-to-peak amplitudes of 0.054-0.685 mag. Three candidates remain ambiguous, while the rest are reclassified, showing the best solutions with periods greater than 2.5 hr. By extrapolating from our confirmation rate (4/14) to the 3.9 percent occurrence rate found in the Light Curve Database (LCDB) yields a central SFR fraction of 1.1 percent, with a one-sigma lower bound of 0.6 percent among kilometre-scale asteroids.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a 3D hydrodynamical simulation of the accretion of a gas cloudlet onto the IRAS 04125+2902 binary system, where the 3-Myr primary hosts a transiting planet. We demonstrate that such an accretion event can naturally produce a circumstellar disk that is misaligned with respect to the rest of the system, consistent with the observed misaligned transition disk. In the model, the prescribed orbital plane of the cloudlet is largely retained by the resulting circumstellar disk after undergoing gravitational interactions with the secondary during the initial accretion. After ~4.4 binary orbits, a disk with $R_d=300~\mathrm{AU}$ has formed around the stellar primary made of ~13% of the cloudlet mass, $M_\mathrm{d,p}=2.1\times 10^{-3}~\mathrm{M}_\odot$. The companion also retains some of the cloudlet's mass and forms a disk with $M_\mathrm{d,c}=9.3\times 10^{-5}~\mathrm{M}_\odot$, though only the transition disk around the primary has been observed. Our findings highlight the importance of considering mass inflow onto protoplanetary disk for their evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Transport and mixing of gas species are of particular interest in planetary environments, where interactions among multiple species can occur within confined or porous media. In this work, we present a novel Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) approach for modeling the mixing of binary gas species. The model treats each gas as a separate fluid governed by its own set of Euler equations, coupled through collisional momentum and energy exchange terms derived from a kinetic relaxation model based on the Boltzmann equation. The numerical scheme employs a first-order operator splitting approach combined with a two-step Euler integrator. In this setup, the hydrodynamic evolution is first computed using standard SPH techniques to handle pressure forces. This is followed by a separate correction step that accounts for interspecies collisional exchanges. Such a decoupled treatment enables the use of a larger timestep dictated by hydrodynamics rather than the typically much smaller collisional timescale, enhancing computational efficiency. The model achieves good accuracy in reproducing the equilibration of density and temperature in a range of molecular mass ratios. Its modular structure supports natural extensions to polyatomic mixtures and enables the inclusion of additional physics, such as gas-solid interactions with dust and ice. These features make the method particularly well-suited for applications involving confined, multi-component gas systems, such as those expected during the ESA ExoMars mission.

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-Ray Bursts are among the most powerful and violent events in the Universe. Despite over half a century of observations of these transient sources, many open questions remain about their nature and the physical emission mechanisms at play. Polarization measurements of the GRB prompt gamma-ray emission have long been theorized to be able to answer most of these questions. Early polarization measurements did not allow to draw clear conclusions because of limited significance. With the aim of better characterizing the polarization of these prompt emissions, a compact Gamma-Ray polarimeter called POLAR has been sent to space as part of the Tiangong-2 Chinese space lab for 6 months of operations starting September 2016. The instrument detected 55 GRBs as well as several pulsars. Time-integrated polarization analysis of the 14 brightest detected GRBs has shown that the prompt emission is lowly polarized or fully unpolarized. However, time-resolved analysis depicted strong hints of an evolving polarization angle within single pulses, washing out the polarization degree in time-integrated analyses. Energy-resolved polarization analysis has shown no constraining results due to limited statistics. Hence, a more sensitive $\gamma$-ray polarimeter is required to perform detailed energy and time-resolved polarization analysis of the prompt gamma-ray emission of GRBs. Based on the success of the POLAR mission, a larger-scale instrument, approved for launch to the China Space Station (CSS) in 2027, is currently being developed by a Swiss, Chinese, Polish, and German collaboration. Thanks to its large sensitivity in the 20-800~keV range, POLAR-2 will produce polarization measurements of at least 50 GRBs per year with a precision equal to or higher than the best results published by POLAR, allowing for good quality time and energy resolved analysis.

 - **Abstract**
 The recent detections of the afterglow phase of long gamma-ray bursts (lGRBs) at very high energies (VHE, >100 GeV) mark a significant advance in astrophysics of transient phenomena, offering deeper insights into the acceleration mechanisms, jet structure, and physical processes driving GRB emission. In the multi-messenger landscape, both high-energy neutrino and gravitational wave detections are providing new insights into the physics of extreme cosmic accelerators and highlighting the need for rapid and broadband follow-up observations. The Large-Sized Telescope (LST-1), the first telescope of the LST array, part of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) North site, is particularly well-suited for real-time, rapid follow-up of transients. In this contribution, we present the latest achievements of the transient observational program with LST-1, which is now in advanced commissioning on La Palma, Canary Islands. We outline the observational strategies in place and describe the dynamic handling of events by the transient handler of LST-1 (e.g., its ability to handle poorly localised events, including gravitational waves, GRBs and neutrinos). We present the key results from transient observation campaigns conducted so far, discuss the lessons learned, and outline the promising prospects for the future LST-1+MAGIC combined transient program with fast response, via a Transient Handler.

 - **Abstract**
 For the first time, we explore dark matter (DM) admixed quarkyonic stars (DAQSs) within a two-fluid formalism, where the normal/visible sector is modeled by a quarkyonic equation of state (EOS) in the Effective Relativistic Mean Field (E-RMF) framework and the DM component is treated as a degenerate fermionic gas with scalar and vector self-interactions. Our analysis begins with the mass-radius (M-R) relation, showing that the inclusion of DM enables stellar configurations to reach the mass range compatible with the GW190814 event. We identify both DM core and DM halo morphologies among the viable EOSs, with core dominated and halo dominated cases exhibiting distinct signatures. By fixing the stellar mass within the GW190814 range, we constrain the possible dark matter fractions and explore the role of different interaction channels. Using the EOSs consistent with these constraints, we further investigate the tidal deformability ($\Lambda$), moment of inertia (MOI), and stellar radius, finding broad agreement with constraints from GW170817, GW190814, and NICER. Finally, we compile the characteristic properties of DAQSs, including EOS type, DM fractions, morphology (core vs halo), and macroscopic observables in a comparative summary. This study provides a unified two-fluid framework to explore dense QCD matter and dark matter in the multi-messenger era, suggesting that the GW190814 secondary object could plausibly be interpreted as either a DM core or a DM halo quarkyonic star.

 - **Abstract**
 This study investigates the orbital migration of a planet located near the truncated edge of protoplanetary disks, induced by X-ray photo-evaporation originating from the central star. The combined effects of turbulent viscous accretion and stellar X-ray photo-evaporation give rise to the formation of a cavity in the central few astronomical units in disks. Once the cavity is formed, the outer disk experiences rapid mass loss and the cavity expands inside out. We have conducted 2D hydrodynamical simulations of planet-disk interaction for various planet masses and disk properties. Our simulations demonstrate that planets up to about Neptune masses experience a strong positive corotation torque along the cavity edge that leads to sustained outward migration -- a phenomenon previously termed {\it rebound} migration. Rebound migration is more favorable in disks with moderate stellar photo-evaporation rates of ${\sim}10^{-8} ~ \rm M_{\odot}\,yr^{-1}$. Saturn-mass planets only experience inward migration due to significant gas depletion in their co-orbital regions. In contrast, Jupiter-mass planets are found to undergo modest outward migration as they cause the residual disk to become eccentric. This work presents the first 2D hydrodynamical simulations that confirm the existence and viability of rebound outward migration during the inside-out clearing in protoplanetary disks.

          Fractal Aggregate Aerosols in the Virga Cloud Code I: Model Description and Application to a Benchmark Cloudy Exoplanet

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce new functionality to treat fractal aggregate aerosol particles within the Virga cloud modeling framework. Previously, the open source cloud modeling code Virga (Batalha et al. 2025), the Python version of EddySed (Ackerman & Marley, 2001), assumed spherical particles to compute particle mass and size distributions throughout the atmosphere. The initial release of Virga also assumed spherical particles to compute Mie scattering properties, which include the single scattering albedo, asymmetry parameter, and optical depth as a function of particle radius and composition. However, extensive evidence from Solar system aerosols, astrophysical disks and dust, and Earth climate studies suggests that non-spherical aggregate particles are common compared to idealized compact spherical particles. Following recent advances in microphysical and opacity modeling, we implement a simple parametrization for dynamical and optical (modified mean field theory) effects of fractal aggregate particles into Virga. We then use this new functionality to perform a case study using basic planetary parameters similar to the well-characterized, aerosol-laden mini-Neptune GJ 1214 b, using KCl clouds made of aggregate particles. We choose KCl to most directly explore comparisons to previous studies. We demonstrate 1) how our method compares to previous fractal aggregate particle treatments and 2) how our new fractal treatment affects theoretical spectra of cloudy atmospheres. Overall, our model is faster and more flexible for a wider range of parameter space than previous studies. We explore the limitations of our modeling set-up and offer guidance for future investigations using our framework.

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze the positional and morphological properties of about 3600 unique fast radio burst (FRB) sources reported in the second FRB catalog generated by the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) telescope. We find a two-dimensional dependence of FRB detections on sky position, and identify a significant absence of detections in a roughly circular region centered at Galactic coordinates (77.7$^\circ$, 0.9$^\circ$), spanning an area of 216.2 deg$^2$. This detection gap spatially coincides with the Cygnus X region $--$ a plasma-rich star-forming region in the Milky Way. This lack of FRB detections is most likely the result of increased sky temperature and strong multi-path scattering by turbulent ionized plasma, which broadens the FRB signals beyond detectability in the CHIME band. Our simulations yield a mean of 6 expected FRB detections within the gap when accounting for the elevated sky temperature in the direction of the detection gap. We infer that a lower limit of the maximum scattering timescale $\tau_{\rm sc,\, 1\,GHz} \geq 4.13$ ms is sufficient to suppress the observed signal-to-noise ratio of all FRBs. In addition to Cygnus X, a similar suppression is seen in Catalog 2 along other high-emission measure (EM) sightlines ( i.e., EM$\geq$2900 pc cm$^{-6}$), further supporting a broader trend of suppression due to Galactic scattering. Future very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) measurements of scattering disks with CHIME Outriggers could help confirm our interpretation. Our work highlights the substantial impact of the ionized and turbulent Galactic interstellar medium on the detectability of FRBs.

 - **Abstract**
 HD~143811~AB is the host star to the directly imaged planet HD~143811~AB~b, which was recently discovered using data from the Gemini Planet Imager and Keck NIRC2. A member of the Sco-Cen star-forming region with an age of $13 \pm 4$ Myr, HD~143811~AB is somewhat rare among hosts of directly imaged planets as it is a close stellar binary, with an $\sim$18 day period. Accurate values for the orbital and stellar parameters of this binary are needed to understand the formation and evolutionary history of the planet in orbit. We utilize archival high-resolution spectroscopy from FEROS on the MPG/ESO 2.2-meter telescope to fit the orbit of the binary, and combine with unresolved photometry to derive the basic stellar properties of the system. From the orbit, we derive precise values of orbital period of $18.59098 \pm 0.00007$ days, and mass ratio of $0.885 \pm 0.003$. When combined with stellar evolutionary models, we find masses of both components of $M_A = 1.30^{+0.03}_{-0.05}$ M$_\odot$ and $M_B = 1.15^{+0.03}_{-0.04}$ M$_\odot$. While the current data are consistent with the planet and stellar orbits being coplanar, the 3D orientations of both systems are currently poorly constrained, with additional observations required to more rigorously test for coplanarity.

 We present confirmation of HD 143811 AB b, a substellar companion to spectroscopic binary HD 143811 AB through direct imaging with the Gemini Planet Imager (GPI) and Keck NIRC2. HD 143811 AB was observed as a part of the Gemini Planet Imager Exoplanet Survey (GPIES) in 2016 and 2019 and is a member of the Sco-Cen star formation region. The companion object is detected $\sim 430$ mas from the host star by GPI. With two GPI epochs and one from Keck/NIRC2 in 2022, we confirm through common proper motion analysis that the object is bound to its host star. We derive an orbit with a semi-major axis of $64 ^{+32}_{-14}$ au and eccentricity $\sim 0.23$. Spectral analysis of the GPI $H$-band spectrum and NIRC2 \textit{L'} photometry provides additional proof that this object is a substellar companion. We compare the spectrum of HD 143811 AB b to PHOENIX stellar models and Exo-REM exoplanet atmosphere models and find that Exo-REM models provide the best fits to the data. From the Exo-REM models, we derive an effective temperature of $1042^{+178}_{-132}$ K for the planet and translate the derived luminosity of the planet to a mass of $5.6 \pm 1.1~M_\textrm{Jup}$ assuming hot-start evolutionary models. HD 143811 AB b is one of only a few planets to be directly imaged around a binary, and future characterization of this object will shed light on the formation of planets around binary star systems.

 - **Abstract**
 In the standard formation models of terrestrial planets in the solar system and close-in super-Earths in non-resonant orbits recently discovered by exoplanet observations, planets are formed by giant impacts of protoplanets or planetary embryos after the dispersal of protoplanetary disk gas in the final stage. This study aims to theoretically clarify a fundamental scaling law for the orbital architecture of planetary systems formed by giant impacts. In the giant impact stage, protoplanets gravitationally scatter and collide with one another to form planets. Using {\em N}-body simulations, we investigate the orbital architecture of planetary systems formed from protoplanet systems by giant impacts. As the orbital architecture parameters, we focus on the mean orbital separation between two adjacent planets and the mean orbital eccentricity of planets in a planetary system. We find that the orbital architecture is determined by the ratio of the two-body surface escape velocity of planets $v_\mathrm{esc}$ to the Keplerian circular velocity $v_\mathrm{K}$, $k$ = The mean orbital separation and eccentricity are about $2 ka$  and $0.3 k$, respectively, where $a$ is the system semimajor axis. With this scaling, the orbital architecture parameters of planetary systems are nearly independent of their total mass and semimajor axis.

 - **Abstract**
 The next generation of ground- and space-based observatories will enable direct imaging and characterization of cold, mature planets through thermal emission and, for the first time, reflected light detection. Known RV and astrometrically detected planets provide a known population for detection and characterization observations. However, many of the most promising targets lack orbital parameters of sufficient precision to confidently predict their location on relative to the star for a direct imaging campaign. We have developed \texttt{projecc}, an open source Python package designed to generate sky-plane planet location posteriors from literature orbit solutions. This tool aims to facilitate community preparation for direct imaging observations of known planets. In this work we describe \texttt{projecc} and use it to examine two case study systems relevant to reflected light imaging with ELTs: GJ~876~b, which we find has a well-constrained prediction, and Proxima Centauri b, whose location remains highly uncertain.%, as well as one potential target for \textsl{Roman} CGI, HD~219134~h, which we estimate has a 40\% probability of being in a detectable sky location at any given time. We provide a web app for exploring reflected light planet targets and their orbit solutions, including predictions from literature for 17 additional planets, located at this https URL. We also discuss future upgrades to \texttt{projecc}.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a study of core fragmentation in the W51-E and W51-IRS2 protoclusters in the W51 high-mass star-forming region. The identification of core fragmentation is achieved by the spatial correspondence of cores and compact sources which are detected in the short (low resolution) and the long baseline (high resolution) continuum images with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in Bands 3 (3 mm) and 6 (1.3 mm), respectively. We characterize the compact sources found in the long baseline image, and conclude that the compact sources are pre/protostellar objects (PPOs) that are either prestellar dust cores or dust disks or envelopes around protostars. The observed trend of core fragmentation in W51 is that (i) massive cores host more PPOs, (ii) bright PPOs are preferentially formed in massive cores, (iii) equipartition of flux between PPOs is uncommon. Thermal Jeans masses of parent cores are insufficient to explain the masses of their fragments, and this trend is more prominent at high-mass cores. We also find that unfragmented cores are large, less massive, and less dense than fragmented cores.

 - **Abstract**
 JWST/NIRSpec observations of Makemake reveal a chemically complex surface and evidence of gaseous CH$_4$. Our spectral modeling indicates a surface composition consisting of CH$_4$, CH$_3$D, and possibly CH$_3$OH, combined with aggregates of C$_2$H$_2$ and C$_2$H$_6$. The presence of C$_2$H$_4$ is also considered given its expected photochemical origin. Both areal and layered configurations reproduce the observed spectrum, with the latter being preferred. This composition confirms earlier hydrocarbon detections and suggests that CH$_4$ photolysis is either ongoing or occurred recently. The detection of CH$_3$D yields a D/H ratio in CH$_4$ ice of $(3.98 \pm 0.34) \times 10^{-4}$, consistent within $2\sigma$ with previous estimates. We report the first detection of CH$_4$ fluorescence from Makemake, establishing it as only the second trans-Neptunian object$\unicode{x2014}$after Pluto$\unicode{x2014}$with confirmed volatile release. We explore two scenarios consistent with the observed CH$_4$ emission, though neither fully reproduces the data: an expanding coma, yielding production rates of $(0.2\unicode{x2013}1.6) \times 10^{28}$ molecules s$^{-1}$ and a rovibrational temperature of $\sim$35 K, possibly originating from a localized plume, and a gravitationally bound atmosphere, which, if adopted, implies gas kinetic temperatures near 40 K and surface pressures of $\sim$10 pbar$\unicode{x2014}$values consistent with stellar occultation constraints and an atmosphere in equilibrium with surface CH$_4$ ice. Discriminating between these scenarios will require higher spectral resolution and improved signal-to-noise observations. Together, the gas-phase CH$_4$, intermediate D/H ratio between that in water and CH$_4$ in comets, and complex surface composition challenge the traditional view of Makemake as a quiescent, frozen body.

 - **Abstract**
 Differentiating between in-situ and accreted populations in the Milky Way halo is a challenging task. Various kinematic spaces are often used to identify distinct accreted populations from the in-situ Milky Way halo. However, this approach has limitations, especially at low orbital energies. To overcome this ambiguity, elemental abundances are typically used to distinguish between the populations. Yet, for many elemental abundance ratios, it remains difficult to make this distinction at low metallicities. Aluminium abundances, on the other hand, have been empirically found to be an effective discriminator, allowing for the separation of accreted and in-situ populations in the Milky Way halo even at low metallicities and low orbital energies. We aim to test the discriminating power of [Al/Fe] using a well-studied sample of high-velocity stars in the solar vicinity with high-quality spectra. With these stars, we explore the [Al/Fe] ability to separate the in-situ from accreted stars and test its limitations. We derived aluminium abundances from the Al I 3944 and 3961 {\rm Å} lines for 45 stars observed in two ESO programmes, along with 11 stars with archival spectra. Aluminium abundances were determined using 1D LTE and 1D NLTE spectral synthesis and line profile fitting. We confirm that the low-$\alpha$ population systematically has lower [Al/Fe] compared to high-$\alpha$ stars. Aluminium abundances, when carefully measured and NLTE effects taken into account, are effective tracers of the chemical history of halo stars. They provide an independent constraint on origin, complementing $\alpha$-element abundances trends, and help us to disentangle subpopulations within the accreted halo, especially in the metal-poor regime.

 - **Abstract**
 By using the horizontal visibility algorithm, the TESS light curves of 69 delta Sct stars are mapped to undirected horizontal visibility graphs (HVGs), where the graph nodes represent the light curve points. Then, the morphological characteristics of HVGs, such as the distribution of links between nodes (degree distribution) or the average fraction of triangles around each node (average clustering coefficient) are measured. The average clustering coefficients for HADS and LADS show two different linear correlations with the peak to peak amplitude of the TESS light curves is naturally separating them into two groups, thys, avoiding ad-hoc criteria for the first time. Exponential fits on HVG degree distributions for both HADS and LADS stars give indices suggesting correlated stochastic generating processes for delta Sct light curves. By applying the theoretical expression for the HVGs degree distribution of random time series we can distinguish significant pulsations from the background noise which might become a practical tool in frequency analysis of stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar multiple systems play a pivotal role in cluster dynamics and stellar evolution, leading to intense astronomical phenomena like X-ray binaries, gamma-ray bursts, Type Ia supernova, and stellar mergers, which are prime sources of gravitational waves. However, their origin remains poorly understood. Here we report the discovery of a septuple protostellar system embedded in a Keplerian disk within the high-mass star-forming region NGC\,6334IN, with close separations of 181-461 AU. The stability analysis reveals that the disk surrounding the septuple system is dynamically unstable, indicating that the septuple system formed via disk fragmentation. Previous studies have typically found only 2--3 members forming via disk fragmentation in both low- and high-mass star-forming regions. Our findings provide compelling observational evidence that the fragmentation of a gravitationally unstable disk is a viable mechanism for the formation of extreme high-order multiplicity, confirming what was previously only a theoretical concept. The results shed new light on the formation of extreme high-order multiplicity in cluster environments.

 This paper reports a Galactic kinematical and dynamical analysis of 1003 main-sequence carbon stars. The sample is drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and cross-matched with Gaia DR3 to obtain 6-dimensional positions and velocities using a Bayesian framework. The study provides the first reliable distances for a large sample of dwarf carbon stars, which are then analyzed using both space motions and actions. The results are combined with dynamical equilibrium models for the three primary Galactic components to assign membership, finding that around 60 per cent belong to the halo, and over 30 per cent originate in the thick disc. Therefore, the results indicate dwarf carbon stars are dominated by a metal-poor halo population, and are thus an excellent resource for stellar archaeology. These stars remain on the main sequence and are relatively nearby, but atmospheric modelling is challenged by their cool effective temperatures and strong molecular features. In light of this, efforts should be made to improve C/O >1 atmospheric modelling, as the subset of low-mass dwarf carbon stars may numerically dominate the Galactic population of carbon-enriched, metal-poor stars.

 - **Abstract**
 A major barrier to improving the quantum-limited sensitivity of gravitational-wave observatories are the thermal distortions of the test masses which arise at megawatt laser power. Recent advances in a new form of higher-order wavefront correction, in which corrective heating profiles are applied to the test mass surfaces near their edges, have the potential to enable a tenfold reduction of the quantum noise floor of future detectors. However, realizing high levels of quantum noise reduction in practice hinges on identifying measurable error signals to finely control each wavefront actuator, in order to suppress wavefront errors to few-nanometer precision across the full mirror apertures. No direct source of such an error signal exists in LIGO today. We demonstrate that thermally imaging the surface of each test mass can provide these critical error signals. We show that the surface temperature profiles obtained from thermal imaging can be uniquely mapped to a finite element model of the mirror whose complete thermal state is identified, enabling full-aperture wavefront reconstruction and direct error signals for real-time precision wavefront control. This new sensing capability can enable up to a 34% strain sensitivity improvement in LIGO A+ at 95% confidence, increasing the sky-averaged detection range for binary neutron star mergers by 11 Mpc, and will be integral to a next-generation 40-km gravitational-wave observatory in the U.S., Cosmic Explorer.

 The kinematics of the Milky Way bulge is known to be complex, reflecting the presence of multiple stellar components with distinct chemical and spatial properties. In particular, the bulge hosts a bar structure exhibiting cylindrical rotation, and a central velocity dispersion peak extending vertically along the Galactic latitude. However, due to severe extinction and crowding, observational constraints near the Galactic plane are sparse, underscoring the need for additional data to improve the completeness and accuracy of existing kinematic maps, and enabling robust comparison with dynamical models. This work aimed to refine the existing analytical models of the Galactic bulge kinematics by improving constraints in the innermost regions. We present updated maps of the mean velocity and velocity dispersion by incorporating new data near the Galactic plane. We combined radial velocity measurements from the GIBS and APOGEE surveys with both previously published and newly acquired MUSE observations. A custom\ -- developed Python\ -- based tool, {\tt PHOTfun}, was used to extract spectra from MUSE datacubes using PSF photometry based on DAOPHOT-II, with an integrated GUI for usability. The method included a dedicated extension, {\tt PHOTcube}, optimized for IFU datacubes. We applied Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques to identify and correct for foreground contamination and to derive new analytical fits for the velocity and velocity dispersion distributions. Our analysis included nine new MUSE fields located close to the Galactic plane, bringing the total number of mapped fields to 57 including ~23000 individual RV measured. The updated kinematic maps confirm the cylindrical rotation of the bulge and reveal a more boxy morphology in the velocity dispersion distribution, while preserving a well\ -- defined central peak.

 - **Abstract**
 The near-infrared helium triplet line is a powerful tool for studying atmospheric escape processes of close-in exoplanets, especially irradiated gas giants. Line profile fitting provides direct insight into the mechanisms driving atmospheric mass loss of close-in, Jupiter-sized planets. We present high-resolution transmission spectroscopy results for the helium triplet line of sixteen gas giants ($R_{\rm p} > 0.5 R_{\rm Jup}$). These observations are part of an extensive helium survey conducted using the Habitable Zone Planet Finder spectrograph on the 10m Hobby-Eberly Telescope. For the first time, we provide constraints on the helium line for HAT-P-12b, HAT-P-17b, HD118203b, TrES-1b, and WASP-156b. Additionally, we are able to confirm previous robust or tentative detections for HD189733b, HD209458b, WASP-52b, WASP-69b, and WASP-76b, and non-detections for HAT-P-3b, WASP-11b, WASP-80b, WASP-127b, and WASP-177\,b. We do not confirm the previous helium narrow-band detection in HAT-P-26b using high-resolution observations. To identify trends within the population of warm, hot, and ultra-hot Jupiters, we combined our results with available helium studies from the literature. As predicted by theory, we find that warm Jupiters with helium detections orbit K-type stars. However, the helium detections in hot Jupiters are found in low-density planets orbiting F-type stars. There are no helium detections in ultra-hot Jupiters. We compiled a list of 46 irradiated gas giants, but more helium studies are needed to increase the sample and improve our understanding of atmospheric mass loss through helium observations.

          An Acoustic Model for Sunquakes Unifying the Solar Interior and Atmosphere

 - **Abstract**
 One of the leading hypotheses for sunquake generation suggests that flare-accelerated particles originating from the reconnection site in the corona travel down to the chromosphere and photosphere, where they deposit energy through collisions and subsequently drive acoustic oscillations. To properly encompass this top-down excitation mechanism, we extend the domain of a semi-spectral 3D acoustic model of the global Sun up to several 10's of Mm above the photosphere, where the transition region and lower corona are resolved. We then use the radially-dependent heating rates derived from the flare radiative hydrodynamic (RADYN) simulations -- extrapolated to a 3D profile -- to realistically excite sunquakes. In addition to the usual sunquake wavefronts, we also observe waves that propagate through the chromosphere and corona in a similar fashion to Moreton-Ramsey waves and large-scale coronal propagating fronts (LCPFs). We examine the dynamics of these waves and discuss how they may be used to constrain models of sunquake excitation.

 - **Abstract**
 Galactic diffuse emissions in gamma rays and neutrinos arise from interactions of cosmic rays with the interstellar medium and probe the cosmic-ray intensity away from the Solar system. Model predictions for those are influenced by the properties of cosmic-ray sources, and understanding the impact of cosmic-ray sources on Galactic diffuse emissions is key for interpreting measurements by LHAASO, Tibet AS-gamma, IceCube, and the upcoming SWGO. We consider supernova remnants as prototypical cosmic-ray sources and study the impact of their discreteness on the Galactic diffuse emissions in different source injection and near-source transport models in a stochastic Monte Carlo study. Three lessons exemplify the results of our simulations: First, the distributions of Galactic diffuse emission intensities can be described by a mixture model of stable laws and Gaussian distributions. Second, the maximal deviations caused by discrete sources across the sky depend on energy, reaching typically tens of percent in burst-like and energy-dependent escape scenarios but order unity or larger in a time-dependent diffusion scenario. Third, the additional model uncertainty from source stochasticity is subdominant in burst-like and energy-dependent escape scenarios, but becomes sizeable above some tens of TeV in the time-dependent diffusion scenario, where it can help reconcile model predictions with LHAASO measurements. With increased spatial resolution, especially at energies beyond tens of TeV, measurements of Galactic diffuse emissions can be expected to constrain source models and locate cosmic ray sources.

          Auriga Streams III: the mass-metallicity relation does not rule out tidal mass loss in Local Group satellites

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The mass-metallicity relation is a fundamental galaxy scaling law that has been extended to the faintest systems in the Local Group. The small scatter in this relation has been used to argue against severe tidal mass loss in Local Group satellites. Aims. We aim to show that the observed scatter is consistent with tidal mass loss seen in cosmological hydrodynamical zoom-in simulations, using simulated Milky Way-mass haloes from the Auriga project as an example. Methods. We analyze the stellar masses and mean metallicites for all accreted systems in Auriga. We compute these quantities two ways: considering the total system (bound + lost material) and only considering the bound progenitor. For both cases we fit the mass-metallicity relation and consider properties that drive scatter about these relations. Results. Accreted systems in Auriga have a tight relation between total stellar mass and metallicity, with scatter at a fixed stellar mass driven by age. When only considering the bound progenitor, the tidally evolved mass-metallicity relation has similar scatter ($\sim$0.27 dex) as observed for the Milky Way and M31 satellites ($\sim$0.23 dex). Satellites that lie above the relation have experienced substantial mass loss and typically have low metallicity for their total stellar mass. Even satellites that fall exactly on the evolved relation can lose over half of their stellar mass. Only satellites that are substantially below the evolved relation are reliably intact. Conclusions. The small scatter in the observed mass-metallicity relation is compatible with tidal mass loss. Based on their offset from the observed relation, we predict which Milky Way and M31 satellites have experienced substantial mass loss. These predictions will be tested with deep resolved-star observations from upcoming facilities including Rubin LSST, Euclid, and Roman.

          A Rotational Disruption Crisis for Zodiacal Dust

 - **Abstract**
 A systematic torque from anisotropic radiation can rapidly spin up irregular grains to the point of breakup. We apply the standard theory of rotational disruption from radiative torques to solar system grains, finding that grains with radii $\sim$0.03 --3 $\mu$m at 1 a.u. from the Sun are spun to the point of breakup on timescales $\lesssim1$ yr even when assuming them to have an unrealistically high tensile strength of pure meteoritic iron. Such a rapid disruption timescale is incompatible with both the abundance of micron-sized grains detected in the inner solar system and with the low production rate of $\beta$ meteoroids. We suggest the possibility that zodiacal grains have a strong propensity to attain rotational equilibrium at low angular velocity (a so-called low-$J$ attractor) and that the efficacy of rotational disruption in the Solar System -- and likely elsewhere -- has been greatly overestimated.

          JWST-TST High Contrast: Living on the Wedge, or, NIRCam Bar Coronagraphy Reveals CO$_2$ in the HR 8799 and 51 Eri Exoplanets' Atmospheres

 - **Abstract**
 High-contrast observations with JWST can reveal key composition and vertical mixing dependent absorption features in the spectra of directly imaged planets across the 3-5 $\mu$m wavelength range. We present novel coronagraphic images of the HR 8799 and 51 Eri planetary systems using the NIRCam Long Wavelength Bar in an offset "narrow" position. These observations have revealed the four known gas giant planets encircling HR 8799, even at spatial separations challenging for a 6.5 m telescope in the mid-infrared, including the first ever detection of HR 8799 e at 4.6 $\mu$m. The chosen filters constrain the strength of CO, CH4, and CO2 absorption in each planet's photosphere. The planets display a diversity of 3-5 $\mu$m colors that could be due to differences in composition and ultimately be used to trace their formation history. They also show stronger CO2 absorption than expected from solar metallicity models, indicating that they are metal enriched. We detected 51 Eri b at 4.1 $\mu$m and not at longer wavelengths, which, given the planet's temperature, is indicative of out-of-equilibrium carbon chemistry and an enhanced metallicity. Updated orbits fit to the new measurement of 51 Eri b validate previous studies that find a preference for high eccentricities ($e{=}0.57_{-0.09}^{+0.03}$), which likely indicates some dynamical processing in the system's past. These results present an exciting opportunity to model the atmospheres and formation histories of these planets in more detail in the near future, and are complementary to future higher-resolution, continuum-subtracted JWST spectroscopy.

          Comprehensive Analysis of Constructing Hybrid Stars with an RG-consistent NJL Model

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we investigate the properties of hadronic and quark matter that would allow for a first order phase transition between them within neutron stars. To this end, we use a parameterizable Relativistic Mean-Field (RMF) description for the hadronic phase and a Renormalization Group-consistent Nambu-Jona-Lasino (RG-NJL) model for the quark phase. This also enables us to consider sequential phase transitions involving a two-flavor color-superconducting (2SC) and a color-flavor-locked (CFL) phase. We find large ranges for all parameters that facilitate a phase transition, even when constrained by current astrophysical data. We further attempt to filter out stars with a high chance of detectability by mass-radius measurement, i.e., stars with identical mass but different radii, so-called twin stars. However, we find that such configurations are outside the constrained parameter spaces. Instead, most of the mass-radius relations that feature a phase transition appear to be indistinguishable from a purely hadronic description.

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce an updated To&Krause2021 model for joint analyses of cluster abundances and large-scale two-point correlations of weak lensing and galaxy and cluster clustering (termed CL+3x2pt analysis) and validate that this model meets the systematic accuracy requirements of analyses with the statistical precision of the final Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 6 (Y6) dataset. The validation program consists of two distinct approaches, (1) identification of modeling and parameterization choices and impact studies using simulated analyses with each possible model misspecification (2) end-to-end validation using mock catalogs from customized Cardinal simulations that incorporate realistic galaxy populations and DES-Y6-specific galaxy and cluster selection and photometric redshift modeling, which are the key observational systematics. In combination, these validation tests indicate that the model presented here meets the accuracy requirements of DES-Y6 for CL+3x2pt based on a large list of tests for known systematics. In addition, we also validate that the model is sufficient for several other data combinations: the CL+GC subset of this data vector (excluding galaxy--galaxy lensing and cosmic shear two-point statistics) and the CL+3x2pt+BAO+SN (combination of CL+3x2pt with the previously published Y6 DES baryonic acoustic oscillation and Y5 supernovae data).

          Atmospheric Circulation of Close-In Extrasolar Giant Planets: The Diabatic Equivalent-Barotropic Model

 - **Abstract**
 We extend the description of equivalent-barotropic equations for exoplanets to the diabatic case -- that is, with explicit heating and/or cooling representation, rather than with a stationary deflection of the bottom bounding surface. In the diabatic case, the equation for potential temperature (or entropy) is directly forced and cannot be decoupled from the equations for momentum and nonlinear pressure, the mass-like variable; and, the isentropic surfaces do not remain coincident with material surfaces. Here the formalism is presented for an atmosphere with the Lamb vertical structure, as the formalism is substantially simplified under the structure. The equations presented set the stage for accurate global simulations which permit small-scale vortices, gravity waves, and fronts observed in current three-dimensional global simulations to be studied in detail.

 - **Abstract**
 How many simulations do we need to train machine learning methods to extract information available from summary statistics of the cosmological density field? Neural methods have shown the potential to extract non-linear information available from cosmological data. Success depends critically on having sufficient simulations for training the networks and appropriate network architectures. In the first detailed convergence study of neural network training for cosmological inference, we show that currently available simulation suites, such as the Quijote Latin Hypercube(LH) with 2000 simulations, do not provide sufficient training data for a generic neural network to reach the optimal regime, even for the dark matter power spectrum, and in an idealized case. We discover an empirical neural scaling law that predicts how much information a neural network can extract from a highly informative summary statistic, the dark matter power spectrum, as a function of the number of simulations used to train the network, for a wide range of architectures and hyperparameters. We combine this result with the Cramer-Rao information bound to forecast the number of training simulations needed for near-optimal information extraction. To verify our method we created the largest publicly released simulation data set in cosmology, the Big Sobol Sequence(BSQ), consisting of 32,768 $\Lambda$CDM n-body simulations uniformly covering the $\Lambda$CDM parameter space. Our method enables efficient planning of simulation campaigns for machine learning applications in cosmology, while the BSQ dataset provides an unprecedented resource for studying the convergence behavior of neural networks in cosmological parameter inference. Our results suggest that new large simulation suites or new training approaches will be necessary to achieve information-optimal parameter inference from non-linear simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper describes the development, design, ground verification, and in-orbit verification, performance measurement, and calibration of the timing system for the X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM). The scientific goals of the mission require an absolute timing accuracy of 1.0~ms. All components of the timing system were designed and verified to be within the timing error budgets, which were assigned by component to meet the requirements. After the launch of XRISM, the timing capability of the ground-tuned timing system was verified using the millisecond pulsar PSR~B1937+21 during the commissioning period, and the timing jitter of the bus and the ground component were found to be below $15~\mu$s compared to the NICER (Neutron star Interior Composition ExploreR) profile. During the performance verification and calibration period, simultaneous observations of the Crab pulsar by XRISM, NuSTAR (Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array), and NICER were made to measure the absolute timing offset of the system, showing that the arrival time of the main pulse with XRISM was aligned with that of NICER and NuSTAR to within $200~\mu$s. In conclusion, the absolute timing accuracy of the bus and the ground component of the XRISM timing system meets the timing error budget of $500~\mu$s.

          Gravitational instability in protoplanetary disk with cooling: 2D global analysis

 - **Abstract**
 Self-gravity is important in protoplanetary disks for planet formation through gravitational instability (GI). We study the cooling effect on GI in a thin two-dimensional protoplanetary disk. By solving the linear perturbation equations in global geometry, we obtain all the normal modes. Faster cooling leads to faster growth rate of GI with lower azimuthal wavenumber $m$. According to the spatial structure of normal modes at different mass-averaged Toomre number $\overline{Q}$ and dimensionless cooling timescale $\beta$, we identify three modes: local, transitional and global. The transitional modes are located in the outer disk while the other two modes in the inner disk. At $\beta\approx 1$ (the resonance of dynamical timescale and thermal timescale) the growth rate changes sharply and the transitional modes dominate. The disk $\alpha$ due to GI is much higher in the transitional modes than in the other two. Our result implies that the transitional modes at $\overline{Q}\approx 1$ and $\beta\approx 1$ can plausibly interpret the substructures and planet/brown dwarf formation in the outer disk.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and the Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA) have revealed many dust rings in protoplanetary disks, often interpreted as dust traps at gas pressure bumps. Previous studies have typically modeled these rings by assuming a single dust species in drift-diffusion equilibrium, neglecting dust size evolution resulting from coagulation and fragmentation. In this work, we perform numerical simulations that incorporate both dust-gas dynamics (drift and diffusion) and dust size evolution. Our results show that the radial distributions of different dust species are nearly identical, as dust growth dominates over drift and diffusion. Building on this finding, we develop a comprehensive, self-consistent analytical theory that describes the dust ring structure while explicitly accounting for size evolution effects. Our model provides a unified framework for interpreting multi-wavelength observations by linking the physical dust distribution to the observed ring properties, thus laying the foundation for future observational modeling.

 - **Abstract**
 Solar flare above-the-loop-top (ALT) regions are vital for understanding solar eruptions and fundamental processes in plasma physics. Recent advances in 3D MHD simulations have revealed unprecedented details on turbulent flows and MHD instabilities in flare ALT regions. Here, for the first time, we examine the observable anisotropic properties of turbulent flows in ALT by applying a flow-tracking algorithm on narrow-band Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) images that are observed from the face-on viewing perspective. First, the results quantitatively confirm the previous observation that vertical motions dominate and that the anisotropic flows are widely distributed in the entire ALT region with the contribution from both upflows and downflows. Second, the anisotropy shows height-dependent features, with the most substantial anisotropy appearing at a certain middle height in ALT, which agrees well with the MHD modeling results where turbulent flows are caused by Rayleigh-Taylor-type instabilities in the ALT region. Finally, our finding suggests that supra-arcade downflows (SADs), the most prominently visible dynamical structures in ALT regions, are only one aspect of turbulent flows. Among these turbulent flows, we also report the anti-sunward-moving underdense flows that might develop due to MHD instabilities, as suggested by previous three-dimensional flare models. Our results indicate that the entire flare fan displays group behavior of turbulent flows where the observational bright spikes and relatively dark SADs exhibit similar anisotropic characteristics.

 - **Abstract**
 The formation mechanisms of open cluster (OCs) groups remain unclear due to limited sample sizes and data precision. Recent advancements in Gaia astrometric data provide an unprecedented opportunity to study OC groups in greater detail. This study aims to extend the sample of OC groups and investigate their formation and evolution mechanisms, with a focus on the role of stellar feedback in triggering star formation. We identify four new OC groups based on Gaia data, whose member OCs are spatially proximate and kinematically coherent. Their age spreads are consistent with the timescale of continuous star formation, suggesting that their member OCs formed sequentially from the same molecular cloud. N-body simulation results further reveal that these groups will gradually disperse, evolving into independent OCs. By analyzing the correlation between OC ages and their separation from potential SN explosion sites, we predict SN explosion regions around the birthplaces of OC groups. The strong correlation between OC ages and predicted SN explosion sites supports a supernova-triggered star formation scenario. Additionally, we trace pulsar (PSR) orbits to examine their association with these regions. We detected three PSRs near Group 1 and 26 PSRs near Group 2, whose birthplaces align with the predicted SN explosions regions. The presence of PSRs associated with OC groups provides additional observational evidence for SN explosions in this region, further supporting a supernova-triggered star formation scenario for G1 and G2. We propose that multiple SN explosions in a short period triggered the formation of Group 1 and Group 2, reinforcing the hierarchical star formation model. These results highlight the multi-scale interactions driving star and OC formation and provide new insights into the role of stellar feedback in shaping OC groups.

 - **Abstract**
 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) serve as crucial cosmological distance indicators due to their empirical consistency in peak luminosity and characteristic light-curve decline rates. These properties facilitate them to be standardized candles for the determination of the Hubble constant ($H_0$) within late-time universe cosmology. Nevertheless, a statistically significant difference persists between $H_0$ values derived from early and late-time measurements, a phenomenon known as the Hubble tension. Furthermore, recent observations have identified a subset of over-luminous SNe Ia, characterized by peak luminosities exceeding the nominal range and faster decline rates. These discoveries raise questions regarding the reliability of SNe Ia as standard candles in measuring cosmological distances. In this article, we present the Bayesian analysis of eight over-luminous SNe Ia and show that they yield a lower $H_0$ estimates, exhibiting closer concordance with $H_0$ estimates derived from early-universe data. This investigation potentially represent a step toward addressing the Hubble tension.

          Core-collapse supernova explosions hindered by eV-mass sterile neutrinos

 - **Abstract**
 Light sterile neutrinos, $\nu_s$, are often introduced to explain an anomalous deficit in the electron antineutrino flux from nuclear reactors. If they exist, sterile neutrinos would also be produced in collapsing massive stars through the active-sterile neutrino oscillation. In order to investigate the impacts of sterile neutrinos on supernova dynamics, we perform two-dimensional neutrino-radiation hydrodynamic simulations of stellar core-collapse coupled with the active-sterile oscillation. As the initial condition of our simulations, we adopt a blue supergiant model that is tuned to reproduce observational features of the SN 1987A progenitor to compare our models with observations of the event. It is found that the active-sterile oscillation reduces the $\nu_{e}$ and $\bar{\nu}_e$ fluxes and decreases the explosion energy. We also find that, if the mixing angle $\theta$ and the mass difference $\delta m_\mathrm{s}^2$ between $\nu_e$ and $\nu_s$ are large enough, the star fails to explode. This suggests that these mixing parameters relevant to sterile neutrinos could be constrained by supernova explodability, though other uncertainties in supernova theory need to be addressed to refine them. In addition, we predict neutrino signals from a nearby supernova event and find that the neutrino event number can significantly decrease because the $\nu_e$ and $\bar{\nu}_e$ fluxes are reduced. In particular, DUNE observations of $\nu_e$ will be useful to search for a signature of sterile neutrinos with a tiny mixing angle because a smaller mixing angle leads to a larger effect on the $\nu_e$ flux.

          Variations in the Radiation Intensity of Pulsar B0950+08: Nine Years of Monitoring at 110 MHz

 - **Abstract**
 The analysis of variations in the emission intensity of the pulsar B0950+08 from 2014 to 2022 with scales from minutes to years was carried out. The observations were obtained in a round-the-clock daily survey conducted on the Large Phased Array (LPA) radio telescope. The high variability of emission is shown not only from pulse to pulse, but also at scales greater than 3 min. The average value of the estimated amplitude of these variations in 3.2 minutes is 25~Jy, the modulation index is 1. The average relative amplitude of the interpulse (IP) is $2.00 \pm 0.28\%$ of the main pulse. In individual pulses, the amplitude of the interpulse may exceed the amplitude of the main pulse (MP), but this is a rare event. Emission is observed in almost the entire period of the pulsar. For the first time, the relative amplitude of emission between the main pulse and the interpulse (emission bridge) was measured. When averaging about 10 hours, it varies from $0.8\%$ to $1.31\%$ with an average value of $1.04 \pm 0.28\%$. A high correlation was found between MP and IP amplitude variations both when averaging profiles over 3.2 minutes and when averaging over years. This correlation is due to refractive interstellar scintillation. The frequency scale of IP diffraction interstellar scintillation was measured for the first time and it was shown that the spectral forms for IP and MP are well correlated and have the same frequency scale. There are strong variations in the frequency scale of scintillation $f_{dif}$ from session to session (time interval from one day) on scales of 200-800 kHz. The refractive scale of scintillation for 1-2 days has been determined. A modulation of emission with a characteristic scale of about 130 days was detected, which, apparently, is also associated with refractive scintillation.

 - **Abstract**
 We observed the new Long Period Comet C/2024 E1 (Wierzchos), inbound at 7 au from the Sun, using the NIRSpec integral field unit on JWST. The spectrum shows absorption features due to water ice in the coma and evidence for CO$_2$ driven activity, with a production rate of $Q(CO_2) = 2.546 \pm 0.019 \times 10^{25}$ molecules s$^{-1}$, and no emission features of water or CO. The latter is surprising, given that CO is more volatile than CO$_2$, and suggests that this comet may have lost its near-surface CO during its early evolution, before implantation in the Oort cloud.

 - **Abstract**
 The NASA Lucy mission is scheduled to fly-by the main belt asteroid (52246) Donaldjohanson on April 20, 2025. Donaldjohanson (DJ hereafter) is a member of the primitive (C-type class) Erigone collisional asteroid family located in the inner main belt in proximity of the source regions of asteroid (101955)~Bennu and (162173)~Ryugu, visited respectively by OSIRIS-REx and Hayabusa2 missions. In this paper we provide an updated model for the Erigone family age, and discuss DJ evolution resulting from non-gravitational forces (namely Yarkovsky and YORP), as well as its collisional evolution. We conclude the best-fit family age to be $\sim 155$~Myr, and that, on such timescales, both Yarkovsky and YORP effects may have affected the orbit and spin properties of DJ. Furthermore, we discuss how the NASA Lucy mission could provide independent insights on such processes, namely by constraining DJ shape, surface geology and cratering history.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the detection of a previously unknown giant molecular cloud (GMC) located at the midpoint of the Galactic Bar Dust Lanes (M4.7--0.8), using spectral line observations taken with the Green Bank Telescope (GBT). This $\sim$60 pc long GMC is associated with accreting material that is transitioning from the quieter Galactic disk environment to the more extreme central molecular zone (CMZ) environment. Our 24 GHz single-dish radio observations targeted the NH$_3$ (1,1)$-$(4,4) and HC$_5$N (9$-$8), known dense gas tracers. The observations reveal the main features of the GMC, which we have dubbed the `Nexus' and `Filament', covering a 0$.\!\!^\circ$5$\times$0$.\!\!^\circ$25 area at 31$''$ angular resolution. In this publication we investigate the gas kinematics within the observed region and compare the distribution of molecular emission to previous infrared surveys to better understand the dust component. The observed gas tracers show centrally condensed cores corresponding to the positions of high dust column densities and low dust temperatures. We report the detection of a previously unknown NH$_3$ (3,3) maser, along with a 70$\mu$m source association, which supports the identification of this region as being actively star-forming. Gas emission in this region shows broad linewidths, comparable to values seen in CMZ clouds. The overall description of this cloud that we present is that of a highly dynamic region comprising dense gas and dust. This encapsulates a wide range of features associated with star formation, in addition to material transport related to the CMZ.

 - **Abstract**
 Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming scientific research, with deep learning methods playing a central role in data analysis, simulations, and signal detection across particle, nuclear, and astroparticle physics. Within the JENA communities-ECFA, NuPECC, and APPEC-and as part of the EuCAIF initiative, AI integration is advancing steadily. However, broader adoption remains constrained by challenges such as limited computational resources, a lack of expertise, and difficulties in transitioning from research and development (R&D) to production. This white paper provides a strategic roadmap, informed by a community survey, to address these barriers. It outlines critical infrastructure requirements, prioritizes training initiatives, and proposes funding strategies to scale AI capabilities across fundamental physics over the next five years.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work we present results of the first in-depth analysis of extra-tidal mock stars of Milky Way globular clusters recently generated by Grondin et al. (2024). Particularly, we selected a sample of globular clusters with a general consensus of being formed in the bulge or in the disk of the Milky Way. From the catalog we estimated the width and the dispersion in the z-component of the angular momentum and in the line-of-sight and tangential velocities of their tidal tails, and compared the results with those predicted by cosmological simulations of Malhan et al. (2021) and observations. We found that the resulting values of these four quantities are not in agreement with an in-situ formation of the associated globular clusters. On average, the resulting widths agree with an in-situ origin, while the dispersion in the z-component of the angular momentum, and the dispersion in the line-of-sight and in the tangential velocities fail in matching this formation scenario. The four quantities derived for globular clusters formed in the bulge or in the disk show similar correlations with the stream length, namely: the width and the dispersion in the z-component of the angular momentum increase with the stream length, while the bulk of dispersion values in the line-of-sight and in the tangential velocities is around 12 km s$^{\rm -1}$ along the mock stream.

 - **Abstract**
 We combine parallax distances to nearby O stars with parsec-scale resolution three-dimensional dust maps of the local region of the Milky Way (within 1.25 kpc of the Sun) to simulate the transfer of Lyman continuum photons through the interstellar medium. Assuming a fixed gas-to-dust ratio, we determine the density of ionized gas, electron temperature, and H$\alpha$ emissivity throughout the local Milky Way. There is good morphological agreement between the predicted and observed H$\alpha$ all-sky map of the Wisconsin H$\alpha$ Mapper. We find that our simulation underproduces the observed H$\alpha$ emission while overestimating the sizes of HII regions, and we discuss ways in which agreement between simulations and observations may be improved. Of the total ionizing luminosity of $5.84 \times 10^{50}~{\rm photons~s^{-1}}$, 15% is absorbed by dust, 64% ionizes "classical'' HII regions, 11% ionizes the diffuse warm ionized medium, and 10% escapes the simulation volume. We find that 18% of the high altitude ($|b| > 30^{\circ}$) H$\alpha$ arises from dust-scattered rather than direct emission. These initial results provide an impressive validation of the three-dimensional dust maps and O-star parallaxes, opening a new frontier for studying the ionized ISM's structure and energetics in three dimensions.

 - **Abstract**
 The Magellanic Stream (MS) is a large tail of neutral and ionized gas originating from tidal and hydrodynamical interactions between the Magellanic Clouds as they orbit the Milky Way (MW). It carries a significant gas reservoir that could impact the future evolution of the MW. Despite its importance, no direct observational constraints on the Stream's distance have been previously published. In this study, we analyze Very Large Telescope/Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph (VLT/UVES) spectra of five blue horizontal branch (BHB) stars in the MW halo located at distances ranging from 13 to 56 kpc near two regions of the Stream, with the aim of detecting Ca II and Na I absorption. No Ca II or Na I absorption is detected at Stream velocities in any of the individual spectra, or in higher signal-to-noise stacks of the spectra. The resulting limits on the Ca II absorption are significantly lower than the Ca II columns measured in the Stream along extragalactic directions. These non-detections establish a firm lower distance limit of 20 kpc for the two regions of the Stream studied. Ca II non-detections in the most distant stars yield tentative lower distance limits of 42 kpc and 55 kpc for the two regions, but deeper spectra are needed to confirm this. Our results provide the first observational constraints on the gaseous Stream's distance.

 - **Abstract**
 With the state-of-the-art Gaia astrometry, the number of confirmed white dwarfs has reached a few hundred thousand. We have reached the era where small features in the white dwarf luminosity function (WDLF) of the solar neighbourhood can be resolved. We demonstrate how to apply Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling on a set of pre-computed partial-WDLFs to derive the star formation history of their progenitor stellar populations. We compare the results against many well-accepted and established works using various types of stars, including white dwarfs, main sequence stars, sub-giants and the entire stellar population. We find convincing agreements among most of the methods, particularly at the intermediate age of 0.1-9 Gyr.

          Forming a clumpy circumstellar material in energetic pre-supernova activity

 - **Abstract**
 We demonstrate by three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of energy deposition into the envelope of a red supergiant (RSG) model the inflation of a Rayleigh-Taylor unstable envelope that forms a compact clumpy circumstellar material (CSM). Our simulations mimic vigorous core activity years to months before a core-collapse supernova (CCSN) explosion that deposits energy to the outer envelope. The fierce core nuclear activity in the pre-CCSN explosion phase might excite waves that propagate to the envelope. The wave energy is dissipated where envelope convection cannot carry the energy. We deposit this energy into a shell in the outer envelope with a power of L(wave)=2.6e6Lo or L(wave)=5.2e5Lo for 0.32 year. The energy-deposition shell expands while its pressure is higher than its surroundings, but its density is lower. Therefore, this expansion is Rayleigh-Taylor unstable and develops instability fingers. Most of the inflated envelope does not reach the escape velocity in the year of simulation but forms a compact and clumpy CSM. The high density of the inflated envelope implies that if a companion is present in that zone, it will accrete mass at a very high rate and power a pre-explosion outburst.

 - **Abstract**
 We present power spectra of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy in temperature and polarization, measured from the Data Release 6 maps made from Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) data. These cover 19,000 deg$^2$ of sky in bands centered at 98, 150 and 220 GHz, with white noise levels three times lower than Planck in polarization. We find that the ACT angular power spectra estimated over 10,000 deg$^2$, and measured to arcminute scales in TT, TE and EE, are well fit by the sum of CMB and foregrounds, where the CMB spectra are described by the $\Lambda$CDM model. Combining ACT with larger-scale Planck data, the joint P-ACT dataset provides tight limits on the ingredients, expansion rate, and initial conditions of the universe. We find similar constraining power, and consistent results, from either the Planck power spectra or from ACT combined with WMAP data, as well as from either temperature or polarization in the joint P-ACT dataset. When combined with CMB lensing from ACT and Planck, and baryon acoustic oscillation data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI Y1), we measure a baryon density of $\Omega_b h^2=0.0226\pm0.0001$, a cold dark matter density of $\Omega_c h^2=0.118\pm0.001$, a Hubble constant of $H_0=68.22\pm0.36$ km/s/Mpc, a spectral index of $n_s=0.974\pm0.003$, and an amplitude of density fluctuations of $\sigma_8=0.813\pm0.005$. We find no evidence for excess lensing in the power spectrum, and no departure from spatial flatness. The contribution from Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) anisotropy is detected at high significance; we find evidence for a tilt with suppressed small-scale power compared to our baseline SZ template spectrum, consistent with hydrodynamical simulations with feedback.

 - **Abstract**
 Star formation is a fundamental, yet poorly understood, process of the Universe. It is important to study how star formation occurs in different galactic environments. Thus, here, in the first of a series of papers, we introduce the Low-Metallicity Star Formation (LZ-STAR) survey of the Sh2-284 (hereafter S284) region, which, at $Z\sim 0.3-0.5Z_\odot$, is one of the lowest-metallicity star-forming regions of our Galaxy. LZ-STAR is a multi-facility survey, including observations with {\it JWST}, {\it ALMA}, {\it HST}, {\it Chandra} and {\it Gemini}. As a starting point, we report {\it JWST} and {\it ALMA} observations of one of the most massive protostars in the region, S284p1. The observations of shock-excited molecular hydrogen reveal a symmetric, bipolar outflow originating from the protostar, spanning several parsecs, and fully covered by the {\it JWST} field of view and the {\it ALMA} observations of CO(2-1) emission. This allows us to infer that the protostar has maintained a relatively stable orientation of disk accretion over its formation history. The {\it JWST} near-IR continuum observations detect a centrally illuminated bipolar outflow cavity around the protostar, as well as a surrounding cluster of low-mass young stars. We develop new radiative transfer models of massive protostars designed for the low metallicity of S284. Fitting these models to the protostar's spectral energy distribution implies a current protostellar mass of $\sim11\:M_\odot$ has formed from an initially $\sim100\:M_\odot$ core over the last $\sim3\times10^5$ years. Overall, these results indicate that massive stars can form in an ordered manner in low-metallicity, protocluster environments.

 - **Abstract**
 Due to non-zero neutrino rest masses we expect the energy density today in non-relativistic matter, $\omega_{\rm m}$, to be greater than the sum of baryon and cold dark matter densities, $\omega_{\rm cb}$. We also expect the amplitude of deflections of CMB photons due to gravitational lensing to be suppressed relative to expectations assuming massless neutrinos. The combination of CMB and BAO data, however, appear to be defying both of these expectations. Here we review how the neutrino rest mass is determined from cosmological observations, and emphasize the complementary roles played by BAO and lensing data in this process. We explain why, for current constraints on the sum of neutrino masses, the addition of BAO data to primary CMB data is much more informative than the addition of CMB lensing reconstruction data. We then use a phenomenological model to find that the preference from CMB and BAO data for a matter density that is below expectations from the CMB alone is at the $3\, \sigma$ level. We also show that if a fraction of the dark matter decays to dark radiation, the preference for $\omega_{\rm m} > \omega_{\rm cb}$ can be restored, but with a small increase to the CMB lensing excess.

 - **Abstract**
 Recently, the KM3NeT Collaboration released the detection of a 220 PeV neutrino from the celestial coordinates RA=94.3\degree~ and Dec.=-7.8\degree~ on 13 February 2023 at 01:16:47 UTC \cite{KM3NeT:2025npi}. The source for this extra-ordinary cosmic neutrino, designated KM3-230213A, is not identified yet but there has been a speculation that it might be associated with a gamma-ray burst GRB~090401B \cite{Amelino-Camelia:2025lqn}. The purpose of this report is to search the association of this 220 PeV neutrino with potential GRB sources from a more general consideration of Lorentz invariance violation (LV) without fixed LV scale. We try to associate this extra-ordinary neutrino with potential GRBs within angular separation of 1\degree, 3\degree~ and 5\degree~ respectively and the results are listed in Table 1. We find the constraints $E_{\rm{LV}}\leq 5.3\times 10^{18}$~GeV for subluminal LV violation and $E_{\rm{LV}}\leq 5.6\times 10^{19}$~GeV for superluminal LV violation if KM3-230213A is a GRB neutrino.

 - **Abstract**
 We consider tidal masses and ages of Milky Way open clusters, as well as a simple model of their distribution. Our aim is to investigate the space of model parameters and the correspondence between modelled and observed two-dimensional cluster age-mass distributions. The model for cluster evolution is comprised of a two-section cluster initial mass function, constant cluster formation rate, and a mass loss function. This mass loss function represents a supervirial phase after gas expulsion, mass loss due to stellar evolution, and gradual dissolution driven by internal dynamics and the Galactic tidal field. We construct different estimators of model fitness based on $\chi^2$-statistics, the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) and a maximum-likelihood approach. Using these estimators and Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling, we obtain best-fit values and posterior distributions for a selection of model parameters. The KLD returns a superior model compared to the other statistics. The cluster initial mass function is well constrained and we find a clear signature of an enhanced cluster mass loss in the first 50 Myr. In the KLD best model, clusters lose 72% of their initial mass in the violent relaxation phase, after which cluster mass loss slows down, allowing for a relatively low rate of cluster formation of $0.088\mathrm{M_\odot kpc^{-2} Gyr^{-1}}$. The observed upper limit of cluster ages at approx. 5 Gyr is reflected in the model by a shallow lifetime-mass relation for clusters with initial masses above $1000\mathrm{M_\odot}$. The application of the model to an independent cluster sample based on Gaia DR3 data yields similar results except for a systematic shift in age. The observed cluster age-mass distribution is compatible with a constant cluster formation rate. The enhanced number of young massive clusters observed requires an early violent relaxation phase of strong mass loss.

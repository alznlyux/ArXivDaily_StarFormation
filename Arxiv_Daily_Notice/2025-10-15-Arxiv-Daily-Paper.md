 - **Abstract**
 Cometary activity from interstellar objects provides a unique window into the environs of other stellar systems. We report blue-sensitive integral field unit spectroscopy of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS from the Keck-II-mounted Keck Cosmic Web Imager on August 24, 2025 UT. We confirm previously reported CN and Ni outgassing, and present, for the first time, the radial profiles of Ni and CN emission in 3I/ATLAS. We find a characteristic $e$-folding radius of $593.7\pm14.8$ km for Ni and $841.0\pm15.4$ km for CN; this suggests that the Ni emission is more centrally concentrated in the nucleus of the comet and favors hypotheses involving easily dissociated species such as metal carbonyls or metal-polycyclic-aromatic-hydrocarbon molecules. Additional integral field spectroscopy after perihelion will offer a continued opportunity to determine the evolution of the radial distributions of species in interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS.

 - **Abstract**
 Binary systems of two carbon-oxygen white dwarfs are one of the most promising candidates for the progenitor systems of Type Ia supernovae. Violent mergers, where the primary white dwarf ignites when the secondary white dwarf smashes onto it while being disrupted on its last orbit, were the first proposed double degenerate merger scenario that ignites dynamically. However, violent mergers likely contribute only a few per cent to the total Type Ia supernova rate and do not yield normal Type Ia supernova light curves. Here we revisit the scenario, simulating a violent merger with better methods, and in particular a more accurate treatment of the detonation. We find good agreement with previous simulations, with one critical difference. The secondary white dwarf, being disrupted and accelerated towards the primary white dwarf, and impacted by its explosion, does not fully burn. Its core survives as a bound object. The explosion leaves behind a $0.16\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ carbon-oxygen white dwarf travelling $2800\,\mathrm{km/s}$, making it an excellent (and so far the only) candidate to explain the origin of the fastest observed hyper-velocity white dwarfs. We also show that before the explosion, $5\times10^{-3}\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ of material consisting predominantly of helium, carbon, and oxygen has already been ejected at velocities above $1000\,\mathrm{km/s}$. Finally, we argue that if a violent merger made D6-1 and D6-3, and violent mergers require the most massive primary white dwarfs in binaries of two carbon-oxygen white dwarfs, there has to be a much larger population of white dwarf mergers with slightly lower-mass primary white dwarfs. Because of its size, this population can essentially only give rise to normal Type Ia supernovae, likely exploding via the quadruple detonation channel and leaving no bound object behind.

          Searching for GEMS: TOI-5916 b & TOI-6158 b are two Saturn-density planets orbiting M2 dwarfs

 - **Abstract**
 We confirm the planetary nature of (1) TOI-5916 b and (2) TOI-6158 b, two Exoplanets Transiting M-dwarf Stars (GEMS), both discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). Both systems were confirmed with ground-based photometry (Red Buttes Observatory and Swope, respectively) and radial velocity data from the Habitable-zone Planet Finder. Their radii are $R_{1}=11.8^{+0.52}_{-0.51}\text{ }R_{\oplus}$ and $R_{2}=10.4^{+2.70}_{-1.11}\text{ }R_{\oplus}$ and masses are $M_{1}=219\pm28\text{ }M_{\oplus}$ and $M_{2}=135^{+19}_{-18}\text{ }M_{\oplus}$. Both planets have Saturn-like densities ($\rho_{1} = 0.73^{+0.14}_{-0.13}\,\text{g cm}^{-3}$, $\rho_{2} = 0.66^{+0.41}_{-0.23}\,\text{g cm}^{-3}$), which appears to be a growing trend among GEMS systems and, more generally, warm Jupiters. In confirming both of these exoplanets, we add to the growing evidence for a population of Saturn-density planets among the GEMS systems. We also find evidence for a preliminary trend in which GEMS exhibit systematically closer orbits compared to FGK giants.

 - **Abstract**
 We present X-shooter observations of a sample of 21 hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae (SLSNe-I), spanning a redshift range of z=0.13-0.95, aimed at searching for shells of circumstellar material (CSM). Specifically, we focus on identifying broad Mg II absorption features that are blueshifted by several thousand kilometers per second and have previously been interpreted as arising from resonance line scattering of the SLSN continuum by rapidly expanding CSM ejected shortly before explosion. Utilizing high-quality spectra, we model the region around 2800A to characterize the Mg II line profiles, enabling us to either confirm their presence or place constraints on undetected CSM shells. We identify five objects in our sample that show broad Mg II absorption features consistent with the presence of CSM. While SN2018ibb, SN2020xga and SN2022xgc have been previously reported, we identify previously undiscovered CSM shells in DES15S2nr and DES16C3ggu. These shells were likely expelled approximately two and three months, respectively, before the explosion of their associated SNe, timescales consistent with late-stage mass-loss episodes. We do not find any correlations between the shell properties and the SN properties, except for a marginal correlation between the light curve decline time scale and the shell velocities. We further demonstrate that CSM configurations similar to the majority of the detected shells would have been observable in spectra with signal-to-noise >8 per resolution element, and that the lines from a shell are in general detectable except in the cases where the shell is either very geometrically and/or optically thin. Therefore, we conclude that the detection of CSM shells is not a selection effect, but may instead point to the existence of a subclass of SLSNe-I undergoing late-stage shell ejections shortly before explosion.

          Delayed phase mixing in the self-gravitating Galactic disc

 - **Abstract**
 The Gaia phase spiral is considered to work as a dynamical clock for dating past perturbations, but most of the previous studies neglected the disc's self-gravity, potentially biasing estimates of the phase spiral's excitation time. We aim to evaluate the impact of self-gravitating effects on the evolution of vertical phase spirals and to quantify the bias introduced in estimating their excitation time when such effects are ignored. We analysed a high-resolution, self-consistent $N$-body simulation of the MW-Sagittarius dwarf galaxy (Sgr) system, alongside four test particle simulations in potentials contracted from the $N$-body snapshots. In each case, we estimated the winding time of phase spirals by measuring the slope of the density contrast in the vertical angle-frequency space. In test particle models, the phase spiral begins winding immediately after Sgr's pericentre passage, and the winding time closely tracks the true elapsed time since the Sgr's pericentre passage. Adding the DM wake yields only a modest (< 100 Myr) reduction of the winding time relative to Sgr alone. By contrast, the self-consistent $N$-body simulation exhibits an initial, coherent vertical oscillation lasting $\gtrsim$ 300 Myr before a clear spiral forms, leading to systematic underestimation of excitation times. An analytical shearing-box model with self-gravity, developed by Widrow (2023), qualitatively reproduces this delay, supporting its origin in the disc's self-gravitating response. Assuming that self-gravity affects phase mixing in the MW to the same degree as the $N$-body model, the lag induced by self-gravity is estimated to be $\sim$ 0.3 Gyr in the solar neighbourhood. Accounting for this delay revises the inferred age of the MW's observed phase spiral to $\sim$0.6-1.2 Gyr, in better agreement with the Sgr's pericentre passage. (shortened for arXiv)

          Wind and nearby stellar environment of the quiescent luminous blue variable Var 2 in the Galaxy M33

 - **Abstract**
 This paper is dedicated to the study of the luminous blue variable (LBV) Var 2 in the galaxy M33, which is currently in a "dormant" state and is observed as an Of/late-WN star. We had calculated self-consistent hydrodynamic non-LTE models of the extended atmosphere, taking into account the balance of radial forces in the wind of the star. This allowed us to obtain reliable estimates of the fundamental parameters of Var 2. The derived luminosity ($L=6.5\times10^{5}\,L_\odot$), current mass ($M_* \approx23\,M_\odot$) and hydrogen abundance on the surface (${\rm X}_{\rm H}\approx43\%$) correspond well to a star with the initial mass $M_{\rm init}\approx50\,M_\odot$ and age $t_{\rm age}\approx5.0\times10^6\,$years that is evolving from lower temperatures towards the Wolf-Rayet stars. A study of dynamic properties of the wind showed that the shape of the wind velocity profile of the Var 2 is close to the one of OB supergiants. In contrast, for the obtained mass loss rate $\dot{M}=2.1\times10^{-5}\,M_{\odot}\,\text{yr}^{-1}$, the ratio of the wind momentum to the luminosity of Var 2 is in good agreement with the values found for late-WN stars. At the same time, Var 2 has a lower terminal wind velocity $v_\infty\approx230\,$km$\,$s$^{-1}$ compared to typical early-type supergiants or late-WN stars. Given the obtained age estimates, Var 2 could potentially have been ejected from the cluster associated with the nearest large star-forming region located at a distance of $\sim100\,$pc. However, statistical analysis of the projected distribution of stars in the vicinity of Var 2 suggests that this LBV could have formed in a local low-populated group.

          Hubble reveals complex multi-scale structure in the edge-on protoplanetary disk IRAS 23077+6707

 - **Abstract**
 We present high-resolution (<0.1") Hubble Space Telescope (HST)/Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) imaging of the near edge-on (i~80 deg) protoplanetary disk IRAS 23077+6707 ("Dracula's Chivito") obtained across six broadband filters spanning 0.4-1.6 microns. These observations unveil the scattered light from this unusually large disk (~14", or ~4200 au at 300 pc) in remarkable detail, revealing a rich tapestry of substructure, including brightness asymmetries and signatures of dynamical activity. Extended filaments are detected extending ~10" from the northern edges of both nebulae, while no comparable southern features are observed. In addition to large-scale asymmetries, the disk exhibits prominent wispy features that extend well above the midplane and are visible in all filters, suggesting a complex, possibly turbulent outer disk atmosphere shaped by infall, dynamical stirring, or gravitational instability. The central dark lane narrows from optical to near-IR wavelengths, and high-resolution millimeter data reveal compact midplane emission. Although our radiative transfer simulations show that the current data cannot yet distinguish between dust-settling and no-settling scenarios, they underscore the need for deeper observations of this unique system. IRAS 23077+6707 thus represents a rare and valuable laboratory for studying the vertical structure, asymmetries, and evolutionary state of protoplanetary disks.

 - **Abstract**
 Binary systems host complex orbital dynamics where test particles can occupy stable regions despite strong gravitational perturbations. The sailboat region, discovered in the Pluto-Charon system, allows highly eccentric S-type orbits at intermediate distances between the two massive bodies. This region challenges traditional stability concepts by supporting eccentricities up to 0.9 in a zone typically dominated by chaotic motion. We investigate the sailboat region's existence and extent across different binary system configurations. We examine how variations in mass ratio, secondary body eccentricity, particle inclination, and argument of pericenter affect this stable region. We performed 1.2 million numerical simulations of the elliptic three-body problem to generate four datasets exploring different parameter spaces. We trained XGBoost machine learning models to classify stability across approximately $10^9$ initial conditions. We validated our results using Poincaré surface of section and Lyapunov exponent analysis to confirm the dynamical mechanisms underlying the stability. The sailboat region exists only for binary mass ratios $\mu = [0.05, 0.22]$. Secondary body eccentricity severely constrains the region, following an exponential decay: $e_{s,\mathrm{max}} \approx 0.016 + 0.614 \exp(-25.6\mu)$. The region tolerates particle inclinations up to $90^\circ$ and persists in retrograde configurations for $\mu \leq 0.16$. Stability requires specific argument of pericenter values within $\pm 10^\circ$ to $\pm 30^\circ$ of $\omega = 0^\circ$ and $180^\circ$. Our machine learning models achieved over 97\% accuracy in predicting stability. The sailboat region shows strong sensitivity to system parameters, particularly secondary body eccentricity. Among Solar System dwarf planet binaries, Pluto-Charon, Orcus-Vanth and Varda-Ilmarë systems could harbor such regions.

          A Systematic North-South asymmetry in the Steady-state Climate of rapidly-rotating Oblique Water Worlds

 - **Abstract**
 Planetary obliquity (axial tilt) plays an important role in regulating the climate evolution and habitability of water-covered planets. Despite the suspicion of large obliquities in several exoplanetary systems, this phenomenon remains hard to observe directly. We aimed to study the effect of mass, obliquity, and rotation on the steady state climate of water-covered planets. We simulated the climate evolution of such planets with varying obliquities, rotational speed, and mass using a general circulation model (GCM) of intermediate complexity, assuming aqua-planet configurations. High obliquity supports an asymmetry between the equilibrium climatological conditions in the northern and southern hemispheres. The polar temperature ratio deviates further from unity with increasing obliquity and rotation rate. Cloud coverage patterns also shift with obliquity, displaying distinct latitudinal bands and increased cloudiness in the warmer hemisphere. The climate of habitable-zone aqua-planets turns out to be sensitive to changes in obliquity and rotation rate, but are independent of planet mass. Our results highlight the importance of considering these factors when assessing the surface conditions of exoplanets. As a consequence, surface condition asymmetries in water-world exo-planets can be used to infer the planet's obliquity and rotation rate.

 - **Abstract**
 Massive stars (>8 $M_{\odot}$) often undergo intense mass loss through winds or eruptive events in the final stages of their evolution, leading to the formation of a dense circumstellar medium (CSM). This material, expelled months to years before core collapse, shapes the pre-explosion environment and influences the early supernova (SN) emission. In particular, the interaction of the SN ejecta with the dense CSM can power an extended emission into the UV/optical bands, as seen in a growing fraction of type II SN. Recent events such as SN 2023ixf and SN 2024ggi confirm the relevance of dense environments and highlight the value of UV observations. Moreover, Fast Blue Optical Transients (FBOTs) may represent extreme cases of this interaction, possibly linked to more compact/massive CSM. In this work, we model the SN-CSM shock interaction in order to (i) estimate the maximum detection horizons and expected rates for future UV missions like ULTRASAT, and (ii) to estimate the intensity and expected rate of potential neutrino signals detectable by IceCube and KM3NeT. We then discuss the prospects for multi-messenger observations of such events in the near future.

          Abundances of Rarely Detected s-process Elements Derived from the Ultraviolet Spectrum of the s-process-enhanced Metal-poor Star HD 196944

 - **Abstract**
 We present an analysis of the heavy-element abundances of HD 196944, a carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) star enriched with elements produced by the slow neutron-capture process (s-process). We obtained a new high-resolution ultraviolet (UV) spectrum of this star, the UV-brightest known CEMP-s star, with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph on board the Hubble Space Telescope. This spectrum extends deeper into the UV (2029 < lambda < 2303 Angstroms) than previous studies of any CEMP-s star. When combined with previous UV and optical analysis, a total of 35 elements heavier than zinc (Z = 30) can be detected in HD 196944, and upper limits are available for nine other heavy elements. The abundances can be well fit by models of s-process nucleosynthesis operating in a low-mass companion star that evolved through the asymptotic giant branch phase and transferred heavy elements to HD 196944. This s-process event did not contribute substantially to the Ga, Ge, or As abundances (31 <= Z <= 33). Our results demonstrate that UV spectroscopy can greatly expand the inventory of heavy elements detectable in CEMP-s stars.

          PLATOSpec: a precise spectrograph in support of space missions

 - **Abstract**
 The upcoming space missions that will characterize exoplanets, such as PLATO and Ariel, will collect huge amounts of data that will need to be complemented with ground-based observations. The aim of the PLATOSpec project is to perform science with an echelle spectrograph capable of measuring precise radial velocities. The main focus of the spectrograph will be to perform the initial screening and validation of exoplanetary candidates, in addition to study stellar variability. It will be possible to determine the physical properties of large exoplanets. The PLATOSpec blue-sensitive spectrograph, with a spectral range of 380 to 700\,nm and a resolving power of R=70,000, is installed on the 1.5-m telescope at the ESO La Silla Observatory in Chile. Initial results show that the radial-velocity limit given by the wavelength calibration is about 2-3 m/s. Tests on bright F-K main-sequence standard stars reveal a scatter of about 5 m/s over a few hours. The scatter over a few months is slightly higher. We demonstrate the capabilities of PLATOSpec on the mass determination of WASP-79 b and the spin-orbit alignment of WASP-62\,b via the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect. We show its possible usage on variable star research as demonstrated on the false-positive exoplanetary candidate TIC 238060327, which is proven a binary star. Investigation of line-profile variations of the roAp star alpha Cir shows that PLATOSpec can also be used for the surface mapping. Finally, we present new results on the active star UY Pic in the PLATO southern field. Our results show that PLATOSpec is a versatile spectrograph with great precision.

 - **Abstract**
 In order to understand the mineralogy and structure of protoplanetary disks, it is important to analyze them from both an empirical spectrum-based perspective and a radiative transfer image-based perspective. In a prior paper, we set forth an empirical mineralogy mid-IR spectral model that conveyed spatial information and worked in tandem with a radiative transfer model, which formed the EaRTH Disk Model. In this article, we take the empirical portion of that model, the TZTD model, and refine it with a newly derived protoplanetary disk thermal emission formulation which uses a temperature distribution without requiring discrete integration; this simplified model uses an empirical relation between spatial distribution variables, which permits radiative transfer models to directly fit these spatial distribution variables more freely within the provided empirical constraints. We test this model against several $Spitzer~Space~Telescope$ Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) spectra, primarily transition disks, and discuss the mineralogical and structural implications of the fits, including the implications for grain growth and processing within the atmospheric zones of the disks.

          Short-Lived Radioisotopic enrichment from AGB interlopers in low-mass star-forming regions

 - **Abstract**
 The decay of Short-Lived Radioisotopes (SLRs) can be a significant source of heating early in protoplanetary systems, though how a protoplanetary disk becomes enriched with these SLRs far above the galactic background level remains an open question. Observational evidence suggests that this enrichment occurs during the period from when the disk forms to when it progresses into a protoplanetary system, and is homogenous throughout the resultant planetary system. Whilst SLRs such as 26Al and 60Fe can be injected into disks through interaction with Wolf-Rayet winds and supernovae, these outflows can disrupt disks, and in the case of low-mass star-forming regions high-mass stars may not form at all. Recent research has determined the existence of AGB ``interlopers'', Asymptotic Giant Branch stars that pass close to or through star-forming regions that could be an alternative source of SLR enrichment to WR winds and supernovae. In this paper we study the effect of AGB interlopers on star-forming regions from a dynamical perspective, determining the enrichment amount of 26Al and 60Fe in disks within small clusters via numerous N-body simulations via a parameter space exploration. We find that enrichment is widespread from AGB stars, with efficient enrichment dependent on the time at which the interloper intersects the star-forming region. Velocity is a factor, though interlopers travelling at 30 km/s are capable of enriching many disks in a star-forming region assuming they encounter a disk when the interloper is more evolved.

          Very-Long Baseline Interferometry Imaging with Closure Invariants using Conditional Image Diffusion

 - **Abstract**
 Image reconstruction in very-long baseline interferometry operates under severely sparse aperture coverage with calibration challenges from both the participating instruments and propagation medium, which introduce the risk of biases and artefacts. Interferometric closure invariants offers calibration-independent information on the true source morphology, but the inverse transformation from closure invariants to the source intensity distribution is an ill-posed problem. In this work, we present a generative deep learning approach to tackle the inverse problem of directly reconstructing images from their observed closure invariants. Trained in a supervised manner with simple shapes and the CIFAR-10 dataset, the resulting trained model achieves reduced chi-square data adherence scores of $\chi^2_{\rm CI} \lesssim 1$ and maximum normalised cross-correlation image fidelity scores of $\rho_{\rm NX} > 0.9$ on tests of both trained and untrained morphologies, where $\rho_{\rm NX}=1$ denotes a perfect reconstruction. We also adapt our model for the Next Generation Event Horizon Telescope total intensity analysis challenge. Our results on quantitative metrics are competitive to other state-of-the-art image reconstruction algorithms. As an algorithm that does not require finely hand-tuned hyperparameters, this method offers a relatively simple and reproducible calibration-independent imaging solution for very-long baseline interferometry, which ultimately enhances the reliability of sparse VLBI imaging results.

 - **Abstract**
 The Prime-Cam instrument of the Fred Young Submillimeter Telescope (FYST) at the CCAT Observatory will conduct sensitive millimeter to submillimeter surveys for a range of astrophysical and cosmological sciences. Prime-Cam will use kinetic inductance detectors (KIDs) sensitive to multiple frequency bands spanning 280--850 GHz. With over 100,000 sensors under development, these KID arrays will soon form the largest submillimeter focal plane ever built. With fixed microwave tones probing amplitude and phase modulations in the KIDs due to incoming radiation, challenges arise in determining the optimal readout settings, especially under varying atmospheric loading. Realizing the science goals of FYST requires operating the detectors at optimal performance and determining accurate responsivities, which depend on readout tone placement and power. To address these challenges, we present laboratory measurements of sample pixels from the 280 GHz TiN and Al arrays using a blackbody cold load to simulate observing conditions. These measurements probe detector responsivity and noise across varying optical loading, tone power, and tone placement, providing the foundation to guide in situ calibration and operation of the $>$100,000 KIDs. We characterize detector sensitivity via the Noise Equivalent Power (NEP) as a function of readout tone power and placement, and measure the impact of detuning due to varying optical power on the NEP. Our test setup and methodology will inform the commissioning of Prime-Cam, in situ detector calibration procedures, the cadence of probe tone resetting, and potential design refinements for future arrays, supporting FYST's planned first light in 2026.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The Multi-Order Coverage map (MOC) is a widely adopted standard promoted by the International Virtual Observatory Alliance (IVOA) to support data sharing and interoperability within the Virtual Observatory (VO) ecosystem. This hierarchical data structure efficiently encodes and visualizes irregularly shaped regions of the sky, enabling applications such as cross-matching large astronomical catalogs. Aims. This study aims to explore potential enhancements to the MOC data structure by encapsulating textual descriptions and semantic embeddings into sky regions. Specifically, we introduce "Textual MOCs", in which textual content is encapsulated, and "Semantic MOCs" that transform textual content into semantic embeddings. These enhancements are designed to enable advanced operations such as similarity searches and complex queries and to integrate with generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools. Method. We experimented with Textual MOCs by annotating detailed descriptions directly into the MOC sky regions, enriching the maps with contextual information suitable for interactive learning tools. For Semantic MOCs, we converted the textual content into semantic embeddings, numerical representations capturing textual meanings in multidimensional spaces, and stored them in high-dimensional vector databases optimized for efficient retrieval. Results. The implementation of Textual MOCs enhances user engagement by providing meaningful descriptions within sky regions. Semantic MOCs enable sophisticated query capabilities, such as similarity-based searches and context-aware data retrieval. Integration with multimodal generative AI systems allows for more accurate and contextually relevant interactions supporting both spatial, semantic and visual operations for advancing astronomical data analysis capabilities.

 - **Abstract**
 Many different scientific applications require sub-micro arcsecond precision astrometry, including researching rocky exoplanets in the vicinity of the Sun and studying dark matter. The Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) is a promising candidate to carry an astrometric instrument because it provides a stable, space-based telescope with a large aperture, which allows faint sources and small displacements to be observed. This paper presents the characterization of an appropriate detector for an astrometric instrument: the 46Mpx Gigapyx from Pyxalis. Moreover it explains the implementation of a testbed enabling interferometric characterization of pixel positions. Finally, the paper introduces a method for calibrating the telescope's optical distortion. This method was implemented in simulation and tested thanks to an optical bench developed at IPAG in France.

 - **Abstract**
 Interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) cause Forbush Decreases (FDs) effects, which are local decreases in background galactic cosmic rays (GCR). Even though FDs can be observed with simple particle instruments, their amplitude and shape provide physical profiles of passing ICMEs. However, in some cases, previous statistical studies of the heliocentric distance dependence of FD changes associated with ICME propagation have found no strong correlation. We need the criteria for evaluating the relationship between ICMEs structure and FD, necessary for FDs statistical analysis. This study investigates the effect of evolutions and interactions of ICMEs on FDs profiles in the inner Solar System, using multipoint comparisons. We focus on multipoint ICME observations by Solar Orbiter, BepiColombo, and near-Earth spacecraft from March 10-16, 2022, when these spacecraft were ideally located for studying the radial and longitudinal evolutions of ICME and accompanying FDs. We compared GCR variations with the multiple in-situ data and ICME model, clarifying the correspondence between the evolution of each ICME structure in radial and azimuthal directions and the depth and gradients of the FD. The radial comparison revealed decreases in FD intensities and gradients associated with the expansion of the ICME. The longitudinal difference found in FD intensity indicates longitudinal variations of the ICMEs shielding effect. These results suggest that accurate multi-point FD comparisons require determining the relationship between the observers position and the inner structure of the passing ICMEs.

 - **Abstract**
 The advent of the X-ray microcalorimeter spectrometer Resolve onboard the XRISM space telescope opened a new era for high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy of astrophysical plasmas. Many spectral features were newly detected, including the K alpha and K beta inner-shell transition lines of mildly ionized (F- to Li-like) Fe at 6-8 keV in the spectra of X-ray binaries and active galactic nuclei. The widely used atomic databases contain information on the K alpha but not K beta lines of these ions. We conducted the atomic structure calculation using FAC to derive the Fe K alpha and K beta lines and verified the result against ground experiments and other calculations of the Fe K alpha lines. We then implemented the Fe K beta lines in a radiative transfer code (cloudy) and compared the synthesized and observed spectra with XRISM. A reasonably good agreement was obtained between the observation and the ab initio calculations. This exemplifies the need to expand the atomic databases to interpret astrophysical spectra.

 - **Abstract**
 The centaur (2060) Chiron has long been a candidate for hosting material in orbit, based on occultation and photometric and spectroscopic data. Here, we present a multichord stellar occultation observed on 2023 September 10 UT that reveals new and complex structures surrounding Chiron. High-cadence light curves show multiple secondary events that are best explained (when compared with a multishell interpretation) with a system of three confined rings located at average radii of 273, 325, and 438 km, the outermost of which lies beyond Chiron's Roche limit. The rings appear coplanar, with a mean pole orientation of {\lambda} = 151° +/- 4° and \b{eta} = 20° +/- 6°. A broader, disklike structure extends from about 200 to 800 km, and a newly detected faint feature is observed at ~1380 km. Chiron thus appears as the fourth small solar system body known for hosting a ring system. Comparisons with previous occultation events that have occurred since 1994 show that these features are not permanent. With these observations, we may witness for the first time the ongoing formation and evolution of a ring system.

          Lanthanide Impact on the Infra-Red Spectra of Nebular Phase Kilonovae

 - **Abstract**
 Nebular phase kilonovae (KNe) have significant infra-red (IR) emission thought to be mostly forbidden emission lines from rapid neutron capture (r-process) species in neutron star merger ejecta. Lanthanide elements in particular have complex atomic structures with many IR transitions. Using non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) radiative transfer simulations, we explore the impact of lanthanides on the IR spectra of KNe in the nebular phase, exploring a parameter space of ejecta mass and lanthanide fraction. We find that lanthanide impact is greater at higher densities, corresponding to earlier epochs and greater ejecta masses. The wavelengths most affected are found to be $\lambda \lesssim 4~\mu$m, with the species Ce\,\textsc{iii} and Nd \textsc{ii} being the most important contributors to spectral formation. We also find significant emission from species proposed in observations, notably Te\,\textsc{iii} at 2.1 $\mu$m, and Se\,\textsc{iii} at 4.5 and 5.7 $\mu$m, while W\,\textsc{iii} is subdominant at 4.5 $\mu$m. The Te\,\textsc{iii} feature at 2.1 $\mu$m is always blended, particularly with Zr\,\textsc{ii}, Ce\,\textsc{iii}, and Nd\,\textsc{ii}. We do not reproduce the smooth blackbody-like continua observed in AT2023vfi. Based on our results, we argue that line opacity alone is likely insufficient to produce optically thick continua in the nebular phase, even in the case of lanthanide/actinide-rich ejecta, as our models are optically thin in the IR at these epochs. Given that lanthanide contributions are dominant below 4 $\mu$m, we suggest that NIR observations best probe these elements, while MIR spectroscopy with \textit{JWST} can reliably probe non-lanthanide emission even in relatively lanthanide-rich cases.

 Saturn's moon Enceladus is an exciting destination for future exploration missions due to the scientifically interesting geyser region located on its South pole. In this work, we compile the different types of science orbit configurations that have been proposed in the literature and present numerical methods to compute each of them in the Saturn-Enceladus circular restricted three-body problem (CR3BP). In addition, we explore the utility of the higher period dynamical structures found in the CR3BP. Figures of merit such as the observational properties and geometries for each family of orbits are presented. By providing a consistent analysis of potential Enceladus science orbits, this work can serve as a baseline for future mission designs.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a catalog of 1.28 GHz radio filaments observed by MeerKAT over the innermost 200 pc of the Galaxy (roughly $\pm 1.5°$), which includes the central molecular zone (CMZ). The catalog is generated by repurposing software developed for the automated detection of filaments in solar coronal loops. There are two parts to the catalog. The first part, the main catalog, provides a point-by-point listing of locations and basic observational properties along each detected filament. The second part is a summary catalog which provides a listing of mean, median, or total values of various properties for each filament. Tabulated quantities include position, length, curvature, brightness, and spectral index. The catalogs contain a heterogeneous mix of filamentary structures, including nonthermal radio filaments (NRFs), and parts of supernova remnants (SNRs) and thermally emitting regions (e.g. H II regions). We discuss criteria for selecting useful subsamples of filaments from the catalogs, and some of the details encountered in examining filaments or selections of filaments from the catalogs.

          Limits of Standard Tidal Models at Quaoar: Matching Weywot's Orbit, Missing the Spin

 - **Abstract**
 Weywot, Quaoar's small satellite, follows a nearly circular orbit at a distance of 12.9 times Quaoar's diameter and coexists with a compact ring system. Nevertheless, Quaoar's flattening of 0.16, slow 17.7hr rotation and Weywot's low mass are difficult to reconcile with conventional tidal-evolution theory. We assess whether standard tides can reproduce the present-day architecture of the Quaoar-Weywot system and identify the initial conditions required. Orbit-averaged integrations spanning 4.5Gyr were carried out with two formalisms: (i) a constant phase-lag (CPL) and (ii) an Andrade creep-tide (ACT) framework. With the nominal Weywot mass, both tidal prescriptions converge on Weywot's observed orbital distance for a wide range of initial orbital distances and eccentricities; eccentricity is damped and present-day tidal torques are negligible, rendering the orbit quasi-stationary. Quaoar's spin, however, remains essentially unchanged from its inferred primordial period based on its present-day flattening, and does not reproduce the observed value. A match is possible only if Weywot is 5-10x more massive than current estimates and if its initial eccentricity is finely tuned; such scenarios are inconsistent with occultation-derived masses and imply an implausibly dense satellite. Based on the best fitting viscoelastic parameters, the most plausible composition for Quaoar is found to be a partially differentiated dwarf planet containing roughly equal masses of silicate rock and H2O-dominated warm (150-180K) ices. Standard tidal models reproduce Weywot's semimajor axis but cannot account for Quaoar's slow 17.7hr rotation without invoking an unrealistically massive satellite or external torques, suggesting that non-tidal processes - such as a largely primordial spin, early satellite loss, or a retrograde secondary giant impact - must have influenced Quaoar's rotational evolution.

 DIPLODOCUS (Distribution-In-PLateaux methODOlogy for the CompUtation of transport equationS) is a novel framework being developed for the general transport of particle distribution functions through the seven dimensions of phase space, including forcing terms and interactions between particles. Following Paper I, which details the background analytic framework, this second paper provides an overview of the numerical implementation in the form of the code package this http URL, written in Julia, including the description of a novel Monte-Carlo sampling technique for the pre-computation of anisotropic collision integrals. In addition to the discussion of numerical implementation, a selection of test cases are presented to examine the package's capabilities. These test cases focus on micro-scale physical effects: binary collisions, emissive interactions and external forces that are relevant to the modelling of jetted astrophysical sources, such as Active Galactic Nuclei and X-Ray Binaries.

 - **Abstract**
 We conducted high-precision timing of PSR J1946+2052 to determine the masses of the two neutron stars in the system, test general relativity (GR) and assessed the system's potential for future measurement of the moment of inertia of the pulsar. We analysed seven years of timing data from the Arecibo 305-m radio telescope, the Green Bank Telescope (GBT), and the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). The data processing accounted for dispersion measure variations and relativistic spin precession-induced profile evolution. We employed both DDFWHE and DDGR binary models to measure the spin parameters, kinematic parameters and orbital parameters. The timing campaign has resulted in the precise measurement of five post-Keplerian parameters, which yield very precise masses for the system and three tests of general relativity. One of these is the second most precise test of the radiative properties of gravity to date: the intrinsic orbital decay, $\dot{P}_{\rm b,int}=-1.8288(16)\times10^{-12}\rm\,s\,s^{-1}$, represents $1.00005(91)$ of the GR prediction, indicating that the theory has passed this stringent test. The other two tests, of the Shapiro delay parameters, have precisions of 6\% and 5\% respectively; this is caused by the moderate orbital inclination of the system, $\sim 74^{\circ}$; the measurements of the Shapiro delay parameters also agree with the GR predictions. Additionally, we analysed the higher-order contributions of $\dot{\omega}$, including the Lense-Thirring contribution. Both the second post-Newtonian and the Lense-Thirring contributions are larger than the current uncertainty of $\dot{\omega}$ ($\delta\dot{\omega}=4\times10^{-4}\,\rm deg\,yr^{-1}$), leading to the higher-order correction for the total mass.

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-ray observations of young star clusters have recently provided evidence for particle acceleration occurring at stellar wind termination shocks, fueled by the mechanical energy of stellar winds from massive stars. In this work, we explore the possibility that the wind from a single powerful star, whether isolated or part of a cluster, can alone provide sufficient energy to generate gamma-ray emission detectable by current instruments. This scenario is particularly relevant given that a significant fraction of Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars are not found within clusters. To investigate this, we compiled a large sample of WR stars and ranked them based on their wind luminosity divided by the square of their distance, a proxy for their potential gamma-ray flux. We then searched for spatial coincidences between the most promising candidates and cataloged gamma-ray sources. This analysis leads us to propose associations between the stars WR14, WR110, WR111, and WR114 and several unidentified gamma-ray sources. These results suggest that WR stellar winds could represent a distinct and previously unrecognized population of gamma-ray emitters.

 We observed NH3 metastable inversion lines from (3, 3) to (18, 18) toward G0.66-0.13 in the Galactic center with the Shanghai Tianma 65m radio telescope and Yebes 40 m telescope. Highly-excited lines of NH3 (17, 17), (18, 18) were detected in emission for the first time in the interstellar medium, with upper energy levels up to 3100 K. Mapping observations reveal widespread hot molecular gas traced by NH3 (13, 13) toward G0.66-0.13. The rotation temperatures of hot gas traced by NH3 exceed 400 K, which amounts to five percent of the total NH3 in the Galactic Center. Hot gas (>400 K) and warm gas (100-140 K) are found in distinct clumps, with the hot gas located at the interfacing regions between different warm clouds. The theory of intermittency in turbulence reproduces the complex temperature structure in the central molecular zone, especially the hot gas observed here. The results presented here demonstrate that turbulence heating dominates the heating of the molecular gas in the Central Molecular Zone, while the turbulence is induced by the shear-motion of molecular clouds under the gravitational potential of the nuclear star clusters and the supermassive black hole. Our results suggest that shear-induced turbulence heating could be a widespread factor influencing galactic evolution.

          Using simultaneous mass accretion and external photoevaporation rates for d203-504 to constrain disc evolution processes

 - **Abstract**
 We cannot understand planet formation without understanding disc evolutionary processes. However, there is currently ambiguity about how protoplanetary discs transport angular momentum (e.g. via viscosity or winds) and the relative contributions and interplay of different dispersal mechanisms. A key difficulty is that for any given system only a handful of disc parameters are usually available to constrain theoretical models. Recent observations of the d203-504 disc in Orion, have yielded values of the stellar accretion rate, external photoevaporative mass loss rate, stellar mass and the disc size and mass. In particular, having the combination of accretion rate and external photoevaporative rate is new. Using this unique combination of observables, we run a suite of disc evolution simulations to constrain which scenarios can match the observed values. We explore both viscous and MHD wind-driven discs, finding that they best match observations when the angular momentum transport $\alpha$ parameter is $3\times10^{-4}\leq\alpha_{\nu}\leq2\times10^{-3}$ for viscous discs, and $2\times10^{-3}\leq\alpha_{\rm DW}\leq10^{-2}$ for MHD wind-driven discs, consistent with other estimates in the literature. As well constraining the disc properties and evolution, the d203-504 disc allows us to define a new irradiation age, since in order to match observations, it was required that the disc had only just appeared in the extreme UV environment it is currently exposed to (a known issue for proplyds referred to as the proplyd lifetime problem). This indicates that it is either very young, i.e. <0.1 Myr, or it has been shielded until recently, which would have protected the planet forming reservoir and helped facilitate planet growth despite it now residing in a harsh UV environment.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmological models where dark matter interacts with dark energy via a pure momentum transfer and with no energy exchange (i.e. elastic) provide compelling scenarios for addressing the apparent lack of structures at low redshift. In particular, it has been shown that measurements of $S_8$ may show a statistically significant preference for the presence of elastic interactions. In this work we implement a specific realisation of these scenarios into an $N$-body code to explore the non-linear regime. We include two populations of particles to describe the interacting dark matter and the non-interacting baryons respectively. On linear scales we recover the suppression of structures obtained from Boltzmann codes, while non-linear scales exhibit an enhancement of the matter power. We find that fewer massive halos are formed at low redshift as a consequence of the elastic interaction and that dark matter halos are more compact than in the standard model. Furthermore, the ratio of dark matter and baryons density profiles is not constant. Finally, we corroborate that baryons efficiently cluster around dark matter halos so they provide good tracers of the dark matter velocity field despite the presence of the interaction. This shows that the interaction is not sufficiently strong as to disrupt virialised structures.

 - **Abstract**
 Young massive stellar clusters (YMSCs) have recently regained interest as PeVatron candidates, potentially accounting for the cosmic-ray (CR) knee as alternatives to isolated supernova remnants (SNRs). LHAASO's unique capability to detect photons above 0.1 PeV, hence tracing multi-PeV CRs, can provide critical constraints on galactic acceleration models when combined with H.E.S.S. and Fermi-LAT data. We investigate the transport of particles from YMSCs acceleration sites, namely wind termination shocks (WTS) or embedded SNRs, to nearby dense molecular clouds where proton-proton interactions produce high-energy gamma rays. We determine the necessary conditions, such as the distance between the acceleration site and the target, or the cluster's power and age, for detectable gamma-ray excesses and identify viable systems through parameter space exploration. By comparing with observations, we can constrain key physical parameters including WTS efficiency, diffusion coefficient and injection slope. Our analysis also examines whether some of LHAASO's unidentified sources might correspond to such cluster-cloud systems.

 - **Abstract**
 We present JWST/NIRSpec and NIRCam observations of the first optically selected off-nuclear tidal disruption event (TDE), AT 2024tvd, along with Keck/KCWI integral field unit spectroscopy. The spectra show broad H and He emission lines that are characteristic of a TDE. Stellar kinematics show smooth host-galaxy morphology and ordered bulge rotation, with no evidence of disturbances in velocity, dispersion, age or metallicity space. We construct the first quasi-simultaneous spectral-energy distribution (SED) from X-rays to infrared for a TDE and decompose it into three components: the TDE accretion flow, an unresolved nuclear star cluster (NSC), and heated dust emission. The accretion component implies a black hole mass of $\log(M_\bullet/M_\odot) = 5.50\pm 0.04$, an instantaneous super-Eddington accretion rate of $\log (\dot{M}/M_{\odot} yr^{-1}) = -1.22 \pm 0.04$, and an outer disk photosphere radius of $\log(r_{out}/r_{g}) = 3.8 \pm 0.1$. The dust emission is well described by a blackbody with $T_{dust} = 873\pm 15$ K and peak luminosity $\log (L_{dust}/erg$ $s^{-1}) = 40.80\pm 0.01$, consistent with a dust echo near the sublimation radius. The SED is best fit when including additional stellar emission above the galaxy background at the TDE location, corresponding to $\log(M_{\star}/M_\odot) = 7.97^{+0.16}_{-0.26}$, which we interpret as a massive NSC or an ultra-compact dwarf galaxy. These results support a minor-merger origin for the MBH responsible for the TDE over scenarios involving gravitational recoil or dynamical ejection from the nucleus.

The recent DESI DR2 data has shown a significant preference for dynamical dark energy, yet this has further exacerbated the $H_0$ tension. In this work, we explore the potential of new interacting dark energy models ($\widetilde{\Lambda}$CDM and $e\widetilde{\Lambda}$CDM) to alleviate the $H_0$ tension. We perform observational constraints using the latest baryon acoustic oscillation data from DESI DR2, cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from Planck and Atacama Cosmology Telescop, and type Ia supernova data from DESY5 and PantheonPlus, as well as the SH0ES data. From our analysis, we observe the dynamical scale parameter of the cosmological constant, $\delta_{\Lambda} = -0.410^{+0.140}_{-0.120}$, in the $e\widetilde{\Lambda}$CDM model using the CMB+DESI+SH0ES data, which deviates from $\Lambda$CDM at the $3.2\sigma$ level. Due to the anti-correlation between $\delta_{\Lambda}$ and $H_0$, a negative $\delta_{\Lambda}$ results in a higher inferred $H_0$. Consequently, we obtain $H_0 = 71.90 \pm 1.00~\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$, reducing the $H_0$ tension to $0.8\sigma$. Even without SH0ES, the CMB+DESI data alone still alleviate the $H_0$ tension to $1.7\sigma$. Overall, the $e\widetilde{\Lambda}$CDM model not only deviates from the $\Lambda$CDM model but also demonstrates a significant capability to alleviate the $H_0$ tension.

 - **Abstract**
 The GEFF - the Gradient Expansion Formalism Factory - is a new Python package designed to study gauge-field production during inflation. The package provides a framework to implement and use the gradient expansion formalism (GEF), a numerical technique devised to study the nonlinear dynamics associated with inflationary gauge-field generation. The GEF has already been applied in the context of axion inflation, and with the GEFF package, one can build on these results. The GEFF gives users access to ready-to-use model files for two scenarios of axion inflation: pure axion inflation, with the inflaton coupled to a pure Abelian gauge sector, and fermionic axion inflation, which assumes that the Standard Model (SM) hypercharge field is coupled to the inflaton, resulting in the production SM fermions via the Schwinger effect. The GEFF provides the user with methods to solve GEF equations, including an integrated error estimator and self-correction algorithm. Furthermore, users can implement their own GEF models, e.g., variations of axion inflation or related scenarios. The package also comes with tools to study the production of primordial gravitational waves induced by gauge fields. This is a starting guide for the GEFF, providing a high-level introduction to the GEF, installation instructions, and the basics for using this package.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a precise measurement of the westward, rigidity-dependent shift of the Moon's shadow using three and a half years of cosmic-ray data collected by the Kilometer Square Array (KM2A) of the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO). These measurements enable us to calibrate the detector energy response in the range 20-260 TeV, with results showing excellent agreement with the response derived from Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of the KM2A detector. We also measure a best-fit parameter $\epsilon = 0.015 \pm 0.08$, corresponding to a 95% confidence interval of [-14%, +17%] for the energy-scale estimation. This result establishes the exceptional accuracy of the KM2A-MC in simulating the detector's response within this energy range.

 - **Abstract**
 Symbiotic stars are binary systems where a white dwarf (WD) accretes material from the wind of an evolved, late-type companion. X-ray-emitting symbiotic systems are classified into $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\delta$, and $\beta/\delta$ types, attributed to distinct physical mechanisms such as thermonuclear burning, wind interactions, and accretion-driven boundary layers. We present synthetic X-ray spectra derived from hydrodynamics simulations using the PHANTOM code, coupled with radiative-transfer calculations from SKIRT. We reproduce all X-ray spectral types by exploring different density structure of the accretion disc, the viewing angle, the plasma temperature of the boundary layer, and/or the presence of extended emission. The synthetic X-ray spectra consist of both absorbed and reflected components. In systems with massive, high-column density discs and viewing angles close to edge-on, the reflected continuum can dominate the X-ray emission. This effect is less pronounced in systems with low-mass, lower-column density discs. We explore i) systems going from $\delta$ to $\beta$ states, ii) $\delta$-types that become $\beta/\delta$ sources, iii) the variability of the three Fe emission lines in the 6.0-7.0 energy range, and iv) the possible physical processes behind the $\alpha$ sources. The observations from iconic symbiotic systems are discussed in line of the present models. Our framework offers predictive power for future X-ray monitoring and provides a path toward connecting accretion disc physics with observed spectral states in symbiotic binaries with accreting WDs.

 - **Abstract**
 Decades of solar coronal observations have provided substantial evidence for accelerated particles in the corona. In most cases, the location of particle acceleration can be roughly identified by combining high spatial and temporal resolution data from multiple instruments across a broad frequency range. In almost all cases, these nonthermal particles are associated with quiescent active regions, flares, and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Only recently, some evidence of the existence of nonthermal electrons at locations outside these well-accepted regions has been found. Here, we report for the first time multiple cases of transient nonthermal emissions, in the heliocentric range of $\sim 3-7R_\odot$, which do not have any obvious counterparts in other wavebands, like white-light and extreme ultra-violet. These detections were made possible by the regular availability of high dynamic range low-frequency radio images from the Owens Valley Radio Observatory's Long Wavelength Array. While earlier detections of nonthermal emissions at these high heliocentric distances often had comparable extensions in the plane-of-sky, they were primarily been associated with radio CMEs, unlike the cases reported here. Thus, these results add on to the evidence that the middle corona is extremely dynamic and contains a population of nonthermal electrons, which is only becoming visible with high dynamic range low-frequency radio images.

          The diverse shapes of binary asteroid satellites born from sub-escape-velocity moonlet mergers

 - **Abstract**
 Recent direct observations of atypically shaped rubble-pile satellites of sub-km asteroids in form of the spherically oblate Dimorphos and bilobate Selam challenge classical binary asteroid formation theories, which only explain the predominantly elongated population. This study further explores a rubble-pile satellite formation scenario for binary asteroid systems involving debris disks by investigating how mergers between moonlets with impact velocities below the mutual escape speed (sub-escape-velocity mergers) and tidal disruptions can create atypically shaped moons. We simulated sub-escape-velocity mergers between moonlets and studied the resulting structural evolution of the formed moon in a tidal environment using the polyhedral discrete elements method N-body code GRAINS. Firstly, we find that the shapes of rubble-pile moons formed by mergers in this regime are highly dependent on the shape and initial orientation of the involved moonlets. This can be explained by the moonlets largely retaining their individual structures during the impact. Secondly, we observe that mass-loss via tidal disruption for a bilobate object occurs in discrete regimes of distance to the primary. Closer to the primary, the innermost lobe is completely stripped off, while only a small piece of it is lost further out. Due to moonlets largely retaining their shape after undergoing a sub-escape-velocity merger, it is necessary to account for their non-sphericity to accurately model satellite formation in circumasteroidal debris disks. Moreover, the reshaping of merged objects via tidal disruption and distortion can produce oblate spheroid moons such as Dimorphos and highly elongated bilobate satellites with distinct necks such as Selam.

 - **Abstract**
 The advent of Stage IV galaxy redshift surveys such as DESI and Euclid marks the beginning of an era of precision cosmology, with one key objective being the detection of primordial non-Gaussianities (PNG), potential signatures of inflationary physics. In particular, constraining the amplitude of local-type PNG, parameterised by $f_{\rm NL}$, with $\sigma_{f_{\rm NL}} \sim 1$, would provide a critical test of single versus multi-field inflation scenarios. While current large-scale structure and cosmic microwave background analyses have achieved $\sigma_{f_{\rm NL}} \sim 5$-$9$, further improvements demand novel data compression strategies. We propose a hybrid estimator that hierarchically combines standard $2$-point and $3$-point statistics with a field-level neural summary, motivated by recent theoretical work that shows that such a combination is nearly optimal, disentangling primordial from late-time non-Gaussianity. We employ PatchNet, a convolutional neural network that extracts small-scale information from sub-volumes (patches) of the halo number density field while large-scale information is retained via the power spectrum and bispectrum. Using Quijote-PNG simulations, we evaluate the Fisher information of this combined estimator across various redshifts, halo mass cuts, and scale cuts. Our results demonstrate that the inclusion of patch-based field-level compression always enhances constraints on $f_{\rm NL}$, reaching gains of $30$-$45\%$ at low $k_{\rm max}$ ($\sim 0.1 \, h \, \text{Mpc}^{-1}$), and capturing information beyond the bispectrum. This approach offers a computationally efficient and scalable pathway to tighten the PNG constraints from forthcoming survey data.

 - **Abstract**
 A crucial chemical link between stars and their orbiting exoplanets is thought to exist. If universal, this connection could affect the formation and evolution of all planets. Therefore, this potential vital link needs testing by characterising exoplanets around chemically-diverse stars. We present the discovery of two planets orbiting the metal-poor, kinematic thick-disk K-dwarf TOI-2345. TOI-2345 b is a super-Earth with a period of 1.05 days and TOI-2345 c is a sub-Neptune with a period of 21 days. In addition to the target being observed in 4 TESS sectors, we obtained 5 CHEOPS visits and 26 radial velocities from HARPS. By conducting a joint analysis of all the data, we find TOI-2345 b to have a radius of $1.504\substack{+0.047\\-0.044}$ R$_\oplus$ and a mass of $3.49\pm0.85$ M$_\oplus$; and TOI-2345 c to have a radius of $2.451\substack{+0.045\\-0.046}$ R$_\oplus$ and a mass of $7.27\substack{+2.27\\-2.45}$ M$_\oplus$. To explore chemical links between these planets and their host star, we model their interior structures newly accounting for devolatised stellar abundances. TOI-2345 adds to the limited sample of well characterised planetary systems around thick disk stars. This system challenges theories of formation and populations of planets around thick disk stars with its Ultra-Short Period super-Earth and the wide period distribution of these two planets spanning the radius valley.

          Born Dry or Born Wet? A Palette of Water Growth Histories in TRAPPIST-1 Analogs and Compact Planetary Systems

 - **Abstract**
 It is still unclear whether exoplanets in compact multiplanet systems such as TRAPPIST-1 are able to accrete large quantities of volatiles, grow to sufficient mass, and maintain robust atmospheres and hydrospheres. Previous estimates of water content in M-dwarf systems have largely relied on population synthesis or atmosphere-interior evolution models, often treating impacts and atmospheric loss in isolation. In this work, we couple impact delivery, impact erosion, and mantle-atmosphere exchange within a model that tracks volatile evolution through stochastic collision histories. By explicitly including both planetesimal accretion and the prolonged luminous pre-main-sequence phase of M dwarfs, we find lower water inventories for the inner TRAPPIST-1 analogs (b-e), spanning only $10^{-4}$-$10^{-2} M_{\oplus,\rm ocn}$ across a wide range of disk structures and impact scenarios. By contrast, the outer planets (f-h analogs) frequently retain water inventories exceeding an Earth ocean mass. This systematic volatile gradient provides a physically motivated explanation for JWST's nondetections of atmospheres on TRAPPIST-1 b and c, implying an origin rooted in formation conditions rather than in post-formation escape. Our results suggest that many rocky planets in compact M-dwarf systems may form already depleted in volatile compounds, fundamentally limiting their capacity to sustain atmospheres or surface oceans. More broadly, our multistage framework for volatile tracking can help interpret future observations of compact systems and set more realistic initial conditions for exoplanet interior compositions and atmospheric models.

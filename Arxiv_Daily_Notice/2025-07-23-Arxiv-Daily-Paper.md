          On the Image Profiles of Transients in the Palomar Sky Survey

 - **Abstract**
 The VASCO project has discovered groups of short-lived transients on historical photographic plates that lack conventional explanation. Hambly & Blair (2024) examined nine such transients reported by Villarroel (2021) and found that they exhibit narrower, rounder profiles, attributing this to emulsion flaws. However, well-established optical principles and atmospheric physics imply that unresolved flashes lasting less than a second naturally appear sharper and more circular than stellar images, particularly on long-exposure plates where stars are significantly blurred by seeing and tracking errors. Such profiles are an expected consequence of sub-second optical flashes, making their findings consistent with the transient interpretation.

 - **Abstract**
 Ongoing and future photometric surveys will produce unprecedented volumes of galaxy images, necessitating robust, efficient methods for deriving galaxy morphological parameters at scale. Traditional approaches, such as parametric light-profile fitting, offer valuable insights but become computationally prohibitive when applied to billions of sources. In this work, we propose a Conditional AutoEncoder (CAE) framework to simultaneously model and characterize galaxy morphology. Our CAE is trained on a suite of realistic mock galaxy images generated via GalSim, encompassing a broad range of galaxy types, photometric parameters (e.g., flux, half-light radius, Sersic index, ellipticity), and observational conditions. By encoding each galaxy image into a low-dimensional latent representation conditioned on key parameters, our model effectively recovers these morphological features in a disentangled manner, while also reconstructing the original image. The results demonstrate that the CAE approach can accurately and efficiently infer complex structural properties, offering a powerful alternative to existing methods.

 - **Abstract**
 High-precision regression of physical parameters from black hole images generated by General Relativistic Ray Tracing (GRRT) is essential for investigating spacetime curvature and advancing black hole astrophysics. However, due to limitations in observational resolution, high observational costs, and imbalanced distributions of positive and negative samples, black hole images often suffer from data scarcity, sparse parameter spaces, and complex structural characteristics. These factors pose significant challenges to conventional regression methods based on simplified physical models. To overcome these challenges, this study introduces Multiscale Adaptive Network (MANet) , a novel regression framework grounded in deep learning. MANet integrates an Adaptive Channel Attention (ACA) module to selectively enhance features in physically informative regions. Meanwhile, a Multiscale Enhancement Feature Pyramid (MEFP) is employed to capture fine-grained spatial structures such as photon rings and accretion disks, while alleviating information loss due to downsampling. Experimental evaluations on GRRT-simulated datasets demonstrate that MANet substantially improves parameter estimation accuracy and generalization capability in high-dimensional parameter spaces, outperforming existing baseline approaches. This framework presents a promising avenue for high-precision parameter regression in Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) data analysis and broader astrophysical imaging applications characterized by sparse and noisy data.

 - **Abstract**
 The extended main-sequence turn-off (eMSTO) is a well-known feature observed in young and intermediate-age star clusters, characterized by a significant broadening of the main-sequence turn-off region. Although prolonged star formation and stellar rotation have been proposed as possible explanations, no consensus has yet been reached. Most previous studies have focused on high-mass clusters. In this work, we extend the analysis to the less-explored low-mass regime by investigating star clusters in the Magellanic Clouds using data from the VISCACHA survey. We employed a widely used method to quantify the MSTO width in terms of age spread. Additionally, to validate our approach, we used a cluster also observed with HST. Our analysis confirms that the eMSTO phenomenon is also present in low-mass clusters, following the known age/mass-MSTO width relations. In particular, the less massive cluster in our sample does not show an eMSTO, supporting the proposed link between the eMSTO and the escape velocity of the cluster, providing a new lower limit to the age spread of $88\pm40$ Myr for the presence of the eMSTO. The consistent MSTO width measurements between the VISCACHA and HST photometries confirm the robustness of our method and demonstrate that the age spread determination is independent of the photometric system, showing also the power of ground-based observations to investigate the eMSTO phenomenon.

          oLIMpus: An Effective Model for Line Intensity Mapping Auto- and Cross- Power Spectra in Cosmic Dawn and Reionization

 - **Abstract**
 Line-intensity mapping (LIM) is emerging as a powerful probe of the high-redshift Universe, with a growing number of LIM experiments targeting various spectral lines deep into the epochs of reionization and cosmic dawn. A key remaining challenge is the consistent and efficient modeling of the diverse emission lines and of the observables of different surveys. Here, we present oLIMpus, a fully analytical effective model to study LIM auto- and cross- power spectra. Our work builds on the 21-cm effective model presented in Zeus21, applying it to star-forming lines and improving it in different aspects. Our code accounts for shot noise and linear redshift-space distortions and it includes by default prescriptions for OII, OIII, H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, CII, CO line luminosities, together with the 21-cm model inherited from Zeus21. Beyond auto- and cross-power spectra, oLIMpus can produce mock coeval boxes and lightcones, and with a computational time of $\sim s$ it is ideal for parameter-space exploration and inference. Its modular implementation makes it easy to customize and extend, enabling various applications, such as MCMC analyses and consistent multi-line cross-correlations.

          A Late-time Radio Search for Highly Off-axis Jets from PTF Broad-lined Ic Supernovae in GRB-like Host Galaxy Environments

 - **Abstract**
 Hydrogen/Helium-poor stripped-envelope core-collapse supernovae with broad lines (SNe Ic-bl) almost always accompany the nearby ($z < 0.3$) jetted relativistic explosions known as long duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). However, the majority of SNe Ic-bl have no detected GRB counterpart. At least some of these SNe should harbor off-axis jets, whose afterglow may become detectable at late times, particularly at radio wavelengths. Here, we present Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array radio observations (rest frame times of $\sim 3$-$4\times10^{3}$ days post SN discovery) of a sample of 14 SNe Ic-bl discovered by the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) that have been demonstrated to originate from the same host environments as the SNe Ic-bl associated with nearby GRBs. Of the 14 SNe, we identify three that are radio detected, one of which (PTF10tqv, $z = 0.0795$) is consistent with an off-axis jet with energy similar to classical GRBs ($\gtrsim 10^{50.5}~$erg). Using recently developed synchrotron radiation code, we find that for our 11 non-detections, which are among the deepest limits obtained for Ic-bl, we rule out an off-axis jet with an energy of $\gtrsim 10^{51}~{\rm erg}$ in circumburst densities of $\gtrsim 10^{-1}~{\rm cm}^{-3}$. We predict that well-spaced monitoring of newly discovered SNe Ic-bl from $\sim 10~$days to $\sim 10~$years (rest frame) to luminosities of $\sim 10^{27}~{\rm erg~s}^{-1}~{\rm Hz}^{-1}$ will constrain the existence of highly off-axis jets ($\gtrsim60^\circ$) with classical GRB energies. The VLA Sky Survey will probe jets that are $\lesssim 60^\circ$ off-axis, whereas the Deep Synpotic Array 2000 will probe jets out to $\sim 90^\circ$ off-axis, demonstrating the importance of utilizing radio surveys to supplement targeted observations.

          Orbital and Physical Properties of the Pleiades Binary 27 Tau (Atlas)

 - **Abstract**
 We report new spectroscopic and interferometric observations of the Pleiades binary star Atlas, which played an important role nearly three decades ago in settling the debate over the distance to the cluster from ground-based and space-based determinations. We use the new measurements, together with other published and archival astrometric observations, to improve the determination of the 291-day orbit and the distance to Atlas ($136.2 \pm 1.4$ pc). We also derive the main properties of the components, including their absolute masses ($5.04 \pm 0.17 M_{\odot}$ and $3.64 \pm 0.12 M_{\odot}$), sizes, effective temperatures, projected rotational velocities, and chemical composition. We find that the more evolved primary star is rotationally distorted, and are able to estimate its oblateness and the approximate orientation of its spin axis from the interferometric observations. The spin axis may well be aligned with the orbital axis. Models of stellar evolution from MESA that account for rotation provide a good match to all of the primary's global properties, and point to an initial angular rotation rate on the zero-age main sequence of about 55% of the breakup velocity. The current location of the star in the H-R diagram is near the very end of the hydrogen-burning main sequence, at an age of about 105 Myr, according to these models. Our spectroscopic analysis of the more slowly-rotating secondary indicates that it is a helium-weak star, with other chemical anomalies.

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) offer a powerful window to probe the progenitor systems responsible for the formation of heavy elements through the rapid neutron capture (r-) process, thanks to their exceptional luminosity, which allows them to be observed across vast cosmic distances. GRB 241105A, observed at a redshift of z = 2.681, features a short initial spike (1.5 s) and a prolonged weak emission lasting about 64 s, positioning it as a candidate for a compact binary merger and potentially marking it as the most distant merger-driven GRB observed to date. However, the emerging ambiguity in GRB classification necessitates further investigation into the burst's true nature. Prompt emission analyses, such as hardness ratio, spectral lag, and minimum variability timescales, yield mixed classifications, while machine learning-based clustering places GRB 241105A near both long-duration mergers and collapsar GRBs. We conducted observations using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to search for a potential supernova counterpart. Although no conclusive evidence was found for a supernova, the host galaxy's properties derived from the JWST observations suggest active star formation with low metallicity, and a sub-kpc offset of the afterglow from the host, which appears broadly consistent with a collapsar origin. Nevertheless, a compact binary merger origin cannot be ruled out, as the burst may plausibly arise from a fast progenitor channel. This would have important implications for heavy element enrichment in the early Universe.

          Stellar evolution through the Red Supergiant phase

 - **Abstract**
 Massive stars less massive than ~30 Msol evolve into a red supergiant after the main sequence. Given a standard IMF, this means about 80% of all single massive stars will experience this phase. RSGs are dominated by convection, with a radius that may extend up to thousands of solar radii. Their low temperature and gravity make them prone to lose large amounts of masses, either through a pulsationally-driven wind or through mass-loss outburst. RSGs are the progenitors of the most common core-collapse supernovae, the type II. In the present review, we give an overview of our theoretical understanding about this spectacular phase of massive stars evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 The red and yellow hypergiants are a rare and important phase in the evolution of the most massive stars that can reach the cool part of the HR Diagram. The hypergiant phase is commonly characterized by high, often episodic mass-loss rates and significant changes in spectral type, probably due to the formation of a pseudo photopsphere during a high mass-loss episode. Many of the yellow hypergiants are the immediate successors to the most luminous red supergiants, and often show evidence in their dusty, circumstellar envelopes from past red supergiant activity. In this paper we review the yellow and red hypergiants with an emphasis on how they differ from more normal red supergiants.

 - **Abstract**
 Red supergiants are the largest stars known with some of the highest mass loss rates observed. They are the final stage in the evolution of the majority of massive stars. The unexpected discovery of high mass loss episodes in many red supergiants have posed questions about the role of mass loss on their final stages. The papers in this volume are timely reviews of our current understanding of this often surprising population of massive stars. This introductory paper is a brief summary of their observed properties and a historical perspective on some of the current problems on mass loss, their circumstellar environments, and their evolutionary state.

          Betelgeuse, the Prototypical Red Supergiant

 - **Abstract**
 The behavior of the bright red supergiant, Betelgeuse, is described with results principally from the past 6 years. The review includes imaging, photometry, and spectroscopy to record the Great Dimming of 2019--2020. This event was followed by a slow ongoing recovery from the massive surface mass ejection after which the stellar characteristics changed. Theoretical simulations address the cause of this episodic mass ejection and the optical Dimming. Recent publications evaluating the perplexing 2100 day periodicity in the star's brightness and radial velocity provide evidence that Betelgeuse may harbor a companion object. Current attempts at direct detection of this companion are discussed. Betelgeuse provides a well-studied and meaningful example for supergiant stars in our Galaxy and others.

          Resolving Black Hole Family Issues Among the Massive Ancestors of Very High-Spin Gravitational-Wave Events Like GW231123

 - **Abstract**
 The latest detection of GW231123, a binary black hole (BH) merger with exceptionally large masses and high spins for the incoming components, has been suggested as a smoking gun for hierarchical formation. In this scenario, a first generation of BHs resulting from collapsing stars form in a dense environment. Here they can assemble dynamically and undergo subsequent mergers. We discuss three challenges for the formation of a GW231123-like event inside a star cluster: 1) The high masses of the incoming BHs appear to be in the predicted pair-instability mass gap and thus suggest that second-generation or higher-order generation BHs are involved. 2) Very high spins ($\chi_f \gtrsim 0.8$) are very unlikely for dynamically assembled BHs because of the isotropic distribution of spin vectors. 3) Hierarchically formed BHs are susceptible to receive large recoils, which could kick them out of their cluster. We simulate this scenario and show that only a few percent of mergers recover remnants within GW231123's primary spin estimate $\chi_1=0.9^{+0.10}_{-0.19}$ and are retained inside typical star clusters. A large fraction of very rapidly spinning second-generation BHs (including $\chi_f>0.9$) can only form if the first-generation BHs merges with aligned spins. This is a natural outcome of massive binary star evolution scenarios, such as a chemically homogeneous evolution. This scenario also predicts equal masses for the components, implying that the resulting BHs tend to receive very low recoil kicks and would therefore likely be retained inside a cluster. We conclude that GW231123-like events, if formed in a star cluster, could require first-generation BHs with large aligned spins that evolved through stellar binary interaction, followed by the dynamical assembly for a subsequent merger. We discuss the implications for the uncertain lower edge of the putative mass gap 60-130 $\rm M_\odot$.

 - **Abstract**
 The envelopes of Red Supergiants (RSGs) have a unique chemical environment not seen in other types of stars. They foster an oxygen-rich synthesis but are tempered by sporadic and chaotic mass loss, which distorts the envelope and creates complex outflow sub-structures consisting of knots, clumps, and arcs. Near the stellar photosphere, molecules and grains form under approximate LTE conditions, as predicted by chemical models. However, the complicated outflows appear to have distinct chemistries generated by shocks and dust destruction. Various RSG envelopes have been probed for their molecular content, mostly by radio and millimeter observations; however, VY Canis Majoris (VY CMa) and NML Cygni (NML Cyg) display the highest chemical complexity, and also the most complicated envelope structure. Thus far, over 29 different molecules have been identified in the envelopes of RSGs. Some molecules are common for circumstellar gas, including CO, SiO, HCN and H$_2$O, which have abundances of $\sim$$10^{-6}$--$10^{-4}$, relative to H$_2$. More exotic oxides have additionally been discovered, such as AlO, AlOH, PO, TiO$_2$, and VO, with abundances of $\sim$$10^{-9}$--$10^{-7}$. RSG shells support intricate maser emission in OH, H$_2$O and SiO, as well. Studies of isotope ratios in molecules suggest dredge-up at least into the H-burning shell, but further exploration is needed.

          Red Supergiant Mass Loss and Mass-Loss Rates

 - **Abstract**
 This review discusses the causes, nature, importance and observational evidence of mass loss by red supergiants. It arrives at the perception that mass loss finds its origin in the gravity which makes the star a star in the first place, and is a mechanism for the star to equilibrate. This is corroborated by a careful examination of various popular historical and recent empirical mass-loss rate prescriptions and theoretical works, and which provides no evidence for an explicit dependence of red supergiant mass loss on metallicity though dust-associated mass loss becomes less prevalent at lower metallicity. It also identifies a common problem in methods that use tracers of mass loss, which do not correct for varying scaling factors (often because there is no information available on which to base such correction) and as a result tend to underestimate mass-loss rates at the lower end. Conversely, dense, extended chromospheres in themselves do not translate into high mass-loss rates, and the significance of stochastic mass loss can be overstated. On a population scale, on the other hand, binary interaction acts as a stochastic agent of mass loss of great import. In all, evidence is overwhelming that points at red supergiants at the lower mass end losing mass at insufficient rates to shed their mantles before core collapse, but massive (at birth) red supergiants to be prone to intense, dusty mass loss which sees them become hotter stars before meeting their fate. This is consistent with the identified progenitors of hydrogen-rich supernovae. Supernova evolution holds great promise to probe the mass loss but we caution against confusing atmospheres with winds. Finally, promising avenues are looked into, which could forge step-change progress in what has been a long and arduous search for the holy grail of red supergiant mass loss. We may yet find it!

          Red Supergiants as Supernova Progenitors

 - **Abstract**
 The inevitable fate of massive stars in the initial mass range of ~8--30 M_{Sun} in the red supergiant (RSG) phase is a core-collapse supernova (SN) explosion, although some stars may collapse directly to a black hole. We know that this is the case, since RSGs have been directly identified and characterized for a number of supernovae (SNe) in pre-explosion archival optical and infrared images. RSGs likely all have some amount of circumstellar matter (CSM), through nominal mass loss, although evidence exists that some RSGs must experience enhanced mass loss during their lifetimes. The SNe from RSGs are hydrogen-rich Type II-Plateau (II-P), and SNe II-P at the low end of the luminosity range tend to arise from low-luminosity RSGs. The typical spectral energy distribution (SED) for such RSGs can generally be fit with a cool photospheric model, whereas the more luminous RSG progenitors of more luminous SNe II-P tend to require a greater quantity of dust in their CSM to account for their SEDs. The SN II-P progenitor luminosity range is log(L_{bol}/L_{Sun}) ~ 4.0--5.2. The fact RSGs are known up to log(L_{bol}/L_{Sun}) ~ 5.7 leads to the so-called ``RSG problem'', which may, in the end, be a result of small number of available statistics to date.

 - **Abstract**
 Our understanding of cosmology is shaped by Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), the runaway thermonuclear detonations of white dwarfs via accretion from a companion star. The nature of this companion star is highly debated, with disparate models explaining currently available SNe Ia data. Critical ultraviolet (UV) signatures of SNe Ia progenitors are only observable within the first few days post-detonation. We present the instrument design of UVIa, a proposed SmallSat to make early UV observations of SNe Ia. UVIa conducts simultaneous observations in three photometric channels: far-UV (1500 - 1800 Å), near-UV (1800 - 2400 Å), and Sloan $u$-band (3000 - 4200 Å). UVIa employs two 80 mm double-offset Cassegrain UV telescopes and a similar 50 mm $u$-band telescope, imaging onto three Teledyne e2v CIS120-10-LN CMOS detectors. The UV detectors are delta-doped for enhanced sensitivity, with custom metal-dielectric filters providing further in-band efficiency and red light rejection. The UV optics utilize multi-layer coatings, defining the UV bandpasses and providing additional red light rejection. The instrument design achieves high UV sensitivity (21.5 mag AB) and superior red light rejection ($<$ 10$^{-5}$ throughput), allowing UVIa to make early observations of SNe Ia while serving as a pathfinder for future UV transient telescopes.

          Prospects for GeV Neutrino Transient Searches with the IceCube Upgrade

 - **Abstract**
 The recent detection of TeV neutrino sources by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory demonstrates the detector's advanced capabilities in detecting high-energy astrophysical neutrinos. At lower energies, down to the GeV range, a variety of transient phenomena, such as novae, supernovae, and gamma-ray bursts, are expected to emit neutrinos. Observations of these neutrinos can provide unique insights into processes below the photosphere and offer clues to identifying their emission mechanisms. We have searched for these neutrinos intensively with IceCube's existing infill array, DeepCore. Although no significant detections have been made, strong constraints on astrophysical environments in these transients, such as the baryon loading factor in gamma-ray bursts, have been obtained. A denser infill array, called the IceCube Upgrade, will enhance sub-TeV neutrino searches with its unprecedented sensitivity to GeV neutrinos. The Upgrade, set to be deployed in the 2025-2026 South Pole season, will consist of seven new strings, adding approximately 700 novel optical modules with multiple photomultiplier tubes in the DeepCore volume. The denser arrangement of high-efficiency modules will significantly improve IceCube's sensitivity between 1 GeV and 1 TeV. We present an initial assessment of the astrophysical capabilities of the IceCube Upgrade, using preliminary simulated data and an event selection similar to that used for DeepCore. We explore the detectability of GeV neutrino transients compared to DeepCore and discuss potential sensitivity enhancements through advanced detector simulations and optimized analysis techniques, including refined triggering conditions and event selection criteria.

Here, we show that mixtures of chondritic components: metal grains, chondrules, calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions (CAIs), and amoeboid olivine aggregates (AOAs) match Earth's major element composition (Fe, Ni, Si, Mg, Ca, Al, O) within uncertainties, whereas no combination of chondrites and iron meteorites does. Our best fits also match the $\epsilon^{54}$Cr and $\epsilon^{50}$Ti values of Earth precisely, whereas the best fits for chondrites, or components with a high proportion of E chondrules, fail to match Earth. In contrast to some previous studies, our best-fitting component mixture is predominantly carbonaceous, rather than enstatite chondrules. It also includes 15 wt% of early-formed refractory inclusions (CAIs + AOAs), which is similar to that found in some C chondrites (CO, CV, CK), but notably higher than NC chondrites. High abundances of refractory materials are lacking in NC chondrites, because they formed after the majority of refractory grains were either drawn into the Sun or incorporated into terrestrial protoplanets via pebble accretion. We show that combinations of Stokes numbers of chondritic components build 0.35-0.7 Earth masses in 2 My in the Hill regime accretion, for a typical pebble column density of 1.2 kg/m2 at 1 au. However, a larger or smaller column density leads to super-Earth or moon-mass bodies, respectively. Our calculations also demonstrate that a few My of pebble accretion with these components yields a total protoplanet mass inside 1 au exceeding the combined masses of Earth, Moon, Venus, and Mercury. Accordingly, we conclude that pebble accretion is a viable mechanism to build Earth and its major element composition from primitive chondritic components within the solar nebula lifetime.

 - **Abstract**
 Modern time-domain surveys like the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) generate hundreds of thousands to millions of alerts, demanding automatic, unified classification of transients and variable stars for efficient follow-up. We present AppleCiDEr (Applying Multimodal Learning to Classify Transient Detections Early), a novel framework that integrates four key data modalities (photometry, image cutouts, metadata, and spectra) to overcome limitations of single-modality classification approaches. Our architecture introduces (i) two transformer encoders for photometry, (ii) a multimodal convolutional neural network (CNN) with domain-specialized metadata towers and Mixture-of-Experts fusion for combining metadata and images, and (iii) a CNN for spectra classification. Training on ~ 30,000 real ZTF alerts, AppleCiDEr achieves high accuracy, allowing early identification and suggesting follow-up for rare transient spectra. The system provides the first unified framework for both transient and variable star classification using real observational data, with seamless integration into brokering pipelines, demonstrating readiness for the LSST era.

 This report presents a draft of a new detector designed to determine the chemical composition of primary cosmic rays based on the characteristics of the angular distribution of Cherenkov light from EAS. The installation, consisting of several such detectors, will be able to register individual EAS events in the energy range from 1 to 1000 PeV with high angular resolution of up to 0.2$^\circ$. The proposed detector's distinctive feature is its simple design and wide viewing angle of above $\pm30^\circ$.

 - **Abstract**
 The action of gravitational physics across space-time creates observable signatures in the behaviour of light and matter. We perform combined-probe studies using data from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) and Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument survey Data Release 1 (DESI-DR1), in combination with three existing weak lensing surveys, to test and constrain General Relativity (GR) in the context of the standard model of cosmology (LCDM). We focus on measuring the gravitational estimator statistic, E_G, which describes the relative amplitudes of weak gravitational lensing and galaxy velocities induced by a common set of overdensities. By comparing our amplitude measurements with their predicted scale- and redshift-dependence within the GR+LCDM model, we demonstrate that our results are consistent with the predictions of the Planck cosmology. The redshift span of the DESI dataset allows us to perform these E_G measurements at the highest redshifts achieved to date, z ~ 1.

 - **Abstract**
 The discrepancy between the early-time estimation and late-time observation on the cosmic baryon content - the 'missing baryon problem' - is a longstanding problem in cosmology. Although recent studies with fast radio bursts (FRBs) have largely addressed this discrepancy, the precise spatial distribution of these baryons remains uncertain due to the effect of galaxy feedback. Cosmological hydrodynamical simulations such as Simba have shown that the partitioning of baryons between the intergalactic medium (IGM) and haloes is sensitive to feedback models, motivating the connection of baryon distribution with feedback physics. With the Simba simulation suite, this study investigates how feedback affects the distribution of matter within large-scale cosmic structures, with implications for FRB foreground modeling. We apply the T-web method to classify the cosmic web into different structures: knots, filaments, sheets, and voids. We then analyze how the different feedback variants of Simba affect the distribution of matter within each structure. Our results show that in Simba, the fractions of IGM gas in different cosmic web structures vary only a few percent under different feedback models. However, jet feedback produces noticeable changes in the gas distribution within structures, enhancing the diffuse IGM on the outskirts of filaments and knots. This research provides a new perspective on the impact of feedback on the IGM and motivates a refined data model for the FRB foreground mapping.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an analysis of CO rovibrational emission lines in the 183 infrared spectra of nearby Class II objects obtained with the NIRSPEC instrument on the Keck II telescope over the past two decades. The sample includes a broad range of stellar mass (both T Tauri and Herbig Ae/Be) and disk evolutionary states (from full to debris disks). We find that 53% of the sample has CO rovibrational emission lines present in their spectrum with disk/stellar subtype detection rates of 82% for transition disks, 61% for Herbigs, and 77% for CTTSs. Although there is no discernible difference between T Tauri and Herbig Ae/Be star CO detection rates, the detection of accretion and of CO are statistically correlated in T Tauri stars but not in Herbig Ae/Be objects. Within the sample of T Tauri stars, we find that no weak-line T Tauri stars have CO rovibrational emission lines. We use slab modeling to analyze the density, temperature, and emitting area of the sample. The retrieval results imply that Herbig Ae/Be objects tend to have cooler and larger CO emitting regions than T Tauri stars. We find that the CO emitting area is not a thin ring as defined by temperature, but a ring of varying size likely dependent on the structure of the disk. We also present guidelines on how to approach CO rovibrational emission lines in JWST spectra and present methods for linking ground-based observations with JWST spectra. This includes line-to-continuum ratio estimates based on stellar mass and accretion rate.

 - **Abstract**
 The chemical evolution history of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) is complex and is best understood through a comprehensive analysis of star clusters across its various regions. The VISCACHA survey aims to fully explain the chemical evolution of SMC star clusters by analyzing different sub-regions adopted from an existing framework. The west halo (WH) region, which contains the oldest and most metal-poor stellar populations, exhibits a clear age-metallicity relation (AMR) with minimal dispersion. This region shows a significant dip of ~0.5 dex in metallicity approximately 6 Gyr ago. This was likely caused by a major merger event that subsequently accelerated the star formation rate. Clusters in the Southern Bridge (SB) and Northern Bridge regions of the SMC may have experienced distinct chemical enrichment histories, as suggested by our previous works but with limited data coverage. Furthermore, the AMR of wing/bridge (W/B) shows no sign of enrichment caused by the aforementioned merger event, but exhibits signatures of the recent collisions between the clouds contemporaneous with the epochs of the Magellanic Stream and Bridge formations. In this study, we present an updated AMR for the SB region based on a sample that includes approximately 67% of its known clusters. Contrary to the expectation of a very unique chemical evolution history, these SB clusters show a trend similar to the one of the WH clusters. The chemical evolution models that best fit the AMR trend of the SB clusters show excellent agreement with the major merger model proposed for the WH clusters. Building on this, we suggest a new unified chemical evolution model for both the WH and SB clusters, which can be explained by a major merger at ~6 Gyr followed by episodic chemical enrichment over time.

 - **Abstract**
 While cold dark matter is widely supported by a range of cosmological observations, it encounters several difficulties at smaller scales. These issues have prompted the investigation of various alternative dark matter candidates, leaving the question "What is dark matter?" still open. In this work, we propose a new cosmological model that considers dark matter as a barotropic fluid with a constant equation of state parameter and interprets dark energy as the phenomenological emergent dark energy rather than a cosmological constant. We then place constraints on our new model using the Planck 2018 Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropy measurements, Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), the Pantheon Plus (PP) compilation of Type Ia supernovae (Ia SNe), and the Redshift Space Distortions (RSD) data from Gold2018. The results show statistically significant signal for positive dark matter equation of state and square of sound speed $w_{\rm dm}=c_{\rm s,dm}^2$ ($10^{7}w_{\rm dm}$ = $4.0^{+2.5}_{-2.3}$ at the 95\% confidence level) for the data combination CMB+DESI+PP+RSD. However, Bayesian evidence indicates that this data combination favors the $\Lambda$CDM model with very strong evidence.

 - **Abstract**
 We extend our super-resolution and emulation framework for cosmological dark matter simulations to include hydrodynamics. We present a two-stage deep learning model to emulate high-resolution (HR-HydroSim) baryonic fields from low-resolution (LR-HydroSim) simulations at redshift $z = 3$. The method takes as inputs an LR-HydroSim and the high-resolution initial conditions (HR-HydroICs). First, the model stochastically generates high-resolution baryonic fields from the LR-HydroSim. Second, a deterministic emulator refines these fields using HR-HydroICs to reconstruct small-scale structures including displacement, velocity, internal energy, and gas/star classification. Trained on paired low- and high-resolution simulations produced with \texttt{MP-Gadget}, the model captures small-scale structures of the intergalactic medium and %Lyman-$\alpha$ forest observables down to the 100 kpc pressure smoothing scale relevant to the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest. The model achieves subpercent error for overdensity, temperature, velocity, and optical depth fields, a mean relative error of 1.07\% in the large-scale flux power spectrum (\(k < 3 \times 10^{-2}\ \mathrm{s/km}\)), and less than 10\% error in the flux probability distribution function. Notably, the two-stage model reduces the compute time by a factor of $\sim$450 compared to full smoothed particle hydrodynamics at the same resolution. This work demonstrates the potential of this framework as a powerful and efficient tool for generating high-resolution fields offering fast and accurate alternatives to traditional cosmological hydrodynamic simulations and enabling large-volume mock datasets for next-generation cosmological surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 Only a small fraction of Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have independent redshift measurements, which are essential for understanding their intrinsic properties. For this reason, empirical correlations of GRBs have often been touted as useful distance indicators, for both individual GRBs as well as population studies. Building upon our previous work, we test the ability of the Yonetoku, 3D Dainotti, and the L-T-E correlation to adequately constrain the GRB rate, $\Psi_{GRB}$. Our analysis demonstrates that, even under idealized conditions that neglect substantial uncertainties, the derived redshift solutions cannot accurately constrain $\Psi_{GRB}$, regardless of the intrinsic distribution's characteristic width. We thus demonstrate unequivocally that -- notwithstanding the questionable assumption of no selection biases -- empirical GRB correlations alone cannot serve as reliable distance indicators at either the individual or population level.

 - **Abstract**
 Although many cases of stellar spin-orbit misalignment are known, it is usually unclear whether a single planet's orbit was tilted or if the entire protoplanetary disk was misaligned. Measuring stellar obliquities in multi-transiting planetary systems helps to distinguish these possibilities. Here, we present a measurement of the sky-projected spin-orbit angle for TOI-880 c (TOI-880.01), a member of a system of three transiting planets, using the Keck Planet Finder (KPF). We found that the host star is a K-type star ($T_{\rm eff}=5050 \pm 100$ K). Planet b (TOI-880.02) has a radius of $2.19\pm0.11\mathrm{R_{\oplus}}$ and an orbital period of $2.6$ days; planet c (TOI-880.01) is a Neptune-sized planet with $4.95\pm0.20\mathrm{R_{\oplus}}$ on a $6.4$-day orbit; and planet d (TOI-880.03) has a radius of $3.40_{-0.21}^{+0.22}\mathrm{R_{\oplus}}$ and a period of $14.3$ days. By modeling the Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect, we found the sky-projected obliquity to be $|\lambda_c| = 7.4_{-7.2}^{+6.8}$$^{\circ}$, consistent with a prograde, well-aligned orbit. The lack of detectable rotational modulation of the flux of the host star and a low $\rm v\sin{i_\star}$ (1.6~km/s) imply slow rotation and correspondingly slow nodal precession of the planetary orbits and the expectation that the system will remain in this coplanar configuration. TOI-880 joins a growing sample of well-aligned, coplanar, multi-transiting systems. Additionally, TOI-880 c is a promising target for JWST follow-up, with a transmission spectroscopy metric (TSM) of $\sim 170$. We could not detect clear signs of atmospheric erosion in the H$\alpha$ line from TOI-880 c, as photoevaporation might have diminished for this mature planet.

 - **Abstract**
 Sub-Neptunes are small planets between the size of the Earth and Neptune. The orbital and bulk properties of transiting sub-Neptunes can provide clues for their formation and evolution of small planets. In this paper, we report on follow-up observations of a planetary system around the mid-M dwarf TOI-654, whose transiting sub-Neptune TOI-654 b ($P=1.53$ day) is validated as a suitable target for the atmospheric observation. We measure the planetary mass and stellar properties with the InfraRed Doppler instrument (IRD) mounted on the Subaru telescope and obtain the stellar and planetary properties from additional transit observations by the Transit Exoplanetary Survey Satellite (TESS) and a series of the Multicolor Simultaneous Camera for studying Atmospheres of Transiting exoplanets (MuSCAT). As a result, the planetary mass of TOI-654 b is determined to be $M_{\rm p} = 8.71 \pm 1.25 M_{\oplus}$, and the radius is updated to be $R_{\rm p} = 2.378 \pm 0.089 R_{\oplus}$. The bulk density suggests that the planet is composed of a rocky and volatile-rich core or a rocky core surrounded by a small amount of H/He this http URL-654 b is one of unique planets located around the radius valley and and also on the outer edge of the Neptune desert. The precise mass determination enables us to constrain the atmospheric properties with future spectroscopic observations especially for the emission by the James Webb Space Telescope and Ariel.

 - **Abstract**
 The timing of cosmic reionization across Local Group (LG) analogues provides insights into their early histories and surrounding large-scale structure. Using the radiation-hydrodynamic simulation THESAN-1 and its dark matter-only counterpart THESAN-DARK-1, we track the reionization histories of all haloes, including 224 LG analogues within the proximity of any of the 20 Virgo-like clusters with halo masses above 10^14 Msun at z=0 and their environments. The statistically controlled samples quantify how the reionization redshift (z_reion) correlates with halo mass, local overdensity, and present-day pair properties. Even at fixed mass, haloes in denser regions ionize earlier, and increasing the overdensity smoothing scale systematically suppresses small-scale structure, including local variations and environmental gradients in z_reion. Virgo-like clusters accelerate reionization in their surroundings out to ~5-10 cMpc, beyond which local overdensity again becomes the dominant factor. Within LG pairs, reionization timing offsets reach up to ~150 Myr and correlate with present-day halo separation, reflecting sensitivity to large-scale structure rather than mass ratio in driving asynchronous reionization. The results support an extreme inside-out picture where clustered sources rapidly ionize their immediate neighborhoods, while lower-density regions self-ionize later and voids wait for external homogenization. These links between environment and reionization timing explain the influence of protoclusters and help interpret fossil records in LG dwarfs around the Milky Way. For Milky Way analogues, we find a reionization redshift as early (late) as z_reion = 12.7^{+2.0}_{-1.7} (8.88^{+0.66}_{-0.70}) when considered on 125 ckpc (500 ckpc) scales, with LG analogues following an inside-out reionization picture.

 The Challan instrument is a solar full-disk imaging spectroscopic telescope planned to be installed at three sites with a 120-degree longitudinal difference, enabling continuous 24-hour observations of the Sun. It will take data every 2.5 min with a spatial resolution of $2-3^{\prime\prime}$ and a spectral resolving power (R) of >43,000 in H$\alpha$ and Ca II 854.2 nm bands simultaneously. Challan is composed of two modules, each dedicated to a specific waveband. This modular design is beneficial in minimizing the scattered light and simplifying the structure and engineering. The primary scientific goal of Challan is to investigate solar flares and filament eruptions. It is also expected to detect small-scale events in the solar chromosphere. In 2025, Challan will be installed at the Big Bear Solar Observatory for test observational runs, followed by scientific runs in 2026.

 - **Abstract**
 Star formation is a hierarchical process ranging from molecular clouds down to individual protostars. In particular how infalling asymmetric structures, called streamers, delivering new material onto protostellar systems, are connected to the surrounding envelope is not understood. We investigate the connection between the cloud material at 10000 au scales down to 300 au scales towards L1448N in the Perseus star-forming region hosting three young Class 0/I protostellar systems. Sensitive molecular line observations taken with the IRAM 30m telescope and NOEMA at 1.4 mm are used to study the kinematic properties in the region traced by the molecular lines. Several infalling streamers are associated with the protostellar systems, some of them traced by C18O and DCN, while one of them is bright in SO and SO2. The kinematic properties of the former streamers are consistent with the velocities observed at large envelope scales of 10000 au, while the latter case show different kinematics. The masses and infall rates of the streamers are 0.01 Msun and 0.01-0.1 Msun and 10^-6 Msun/yr and 5-18x10^-6 Msun/yr for IRS3A and IRS3C, respectively. The envelope mass in the L1448N region is ~16Msun, thus the mass of a single streamer is low compared to the envelope mass (<1%). However, compared to the estimated mass of the protostellar systems a single streamer could deliver up to 1% and 8-17% of mass towards IRS3A (M*~1.2 Msun) and IRS3C (M*~1 Msun), respectively. The rotational signatures of structures in L1448N are all connected - from the large-scale envelope, infalling streamers, down to the rotation of all three disks. Two of the three Class 0/I protostellar systems are still fed by this surrounding material, which can be associated to the remnant envelope. However, we also find a streamer that is bright in SO and SO2 towards IRS3C that could be connected to a nearby sulfur reservoir.

 The Lunar Orbital VLBI Experiment (LOVEX) is a scientific component of the Chinese Lunar Exploration Project (CLEP) Chang'E-7. The spaceborne component of LOVEX is implemented onboard the relay satellite QueQiao-2, which was launched on 2024 March 20, and later placed into an elliptical selenocentric orbit. The LOVEX-specific payload consists of an X-band cryogenic receiver, a hydrogen maser frequency standard, and VLBI data formatting and acquisition electronics. Several components of the QueQiao-2 nominal onboard instrumentation, such as the 4.2-meter antenna, the data storage device, and the downlink communication system, contribute to the overall spaceborne VLBI instrumentation. This allows us to form a space radio telescope capable of co-observing with Earth-based radio telescopes in VLBI mode. In this space VLBI system, the length of the baseline extends up to approximately 380,000 km. This paper presents the LOVEX scientific objectives, architecture, instrumentation, pre-launch tests, in-flight verification and calibration, and the first in-flight detections of interferometric response (''fringes'') achieved through observations of the quasar AO 0235+164 and the Chang'E-6 orbital module, positioned at the Sun-Earth Lagrange point L2. These initial results demonstrate the successful performance of LOVEX, verifying its capability for both astronomical and spacecraft tracking observations at ultra-long VLBI baselines.

 The Pierre Auger Observatory has published properties of the 100 highest-energy cosmic ray events (to energies above 100 EeV) which it recorded over a 17 year period. We have examined the directional properties of these events and have taken particular note of the most energetically extreme events. We find that the most energetic events have directions which are grouped in a non-random way at the 1\% level. There is an apparent clustering in a limited region of the sky. Close to that direction is found Centaurus A, which has long been considered as a source of such particles, but we also note that a close-by dwarf galaxy, the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is closer in angular terms. We examine the possibility that the LMC might be a source of observed cosmic rays at the highest energies.

 - **Abstract**
 The Single-Mirror Small Size Telescope (SST-1M) is a small Cherenkov telescope designed to detect gamma rays with energies more than about 1 TeV. The optical design of the SST-1M follows the Davies-Cotton concept to ensure good off-axis performance. In 2022, two SST-1M telescope prototypes were installed in Ondrejov, Czech Republic, and stereoscopic observations of astrophysical gamma-ray sources have been performed since then. VER J2019+368 is an unidentified very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray source, surrounded by several gamma-ray point-like and diffuse sources, together with their multi-wavelength counterparts. VHE emission was discovered by MILAGRO in 2012, followed by VERITAS observation, which revealed the complex morphology of the source. Recently, the LHAASO observatory detected photons with multi-TeV energies, opening up the possibility of particle acceleration up to PeV energies. In this contribution, we present preliminary results of the first observing campaign of the VER J2019+368 region, performed with SST-1M from April to November 2024. We present the data analysis, focusing on the morphological and spectroscopic study of the region. We also present the off-axis performance of SST-1M in the context of the prospects for detecting extended galactic gamma-ray sources. As one of the brightest and hardest sources in the LHAASO catalog, VER J2019+368 is an ideal candidate for testing the capabilities of the SST-1M, with its large field of view, to detect extended gamma-ray sources.

 - **Abstract**
 Using data from Swift-BAT and Fermi-GBM, we report the first detection of a high-confidence quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) in the thermal emission of gamma-ray burst GRB~240825A. The spectral analysis of the burst reveals two radiation components, including a thermal emission dominant in $100 \text{--} 300\,\mathrm{keV}$ and a non-thermal emission spanning a wide energy range. During the interval $2.07 \text{--} 3.25\,\mathrm{s}$ post-trigger, a strong QPO signal at $6.37\,\mathrm{Hz}$ ($\gtrsim 5\sigma$ confidence) is identified in the $100 \text{--} 300\,\mathrm{keV}$ thermal-dominated band. The variability analysis of the non-thermal component ($15 \text{--} 30\,\mathrm{keV}$) uncovered a $0.67\,\mathrm{Hz}$ QPO, consistent with light-curve modeling using periodic fast-rise exponential decay pulses. The strong QPO in the photospheric emission directly indicates a quasi-periodic oscillating jet. Together with the non-thermal emission variability, we show that this QPO can be explained in terms of a helical structure in the jet, where the viewing angle to the dominant emission region in the jet undergoes periodic changes.

 - **Abstract**
 Neutrinos and dark energy (DE) have entered a new era of investigation, as the latest DESI baryon acoustic oscillation measurements tighten the constraints on the neutrino mass and suggest that DE may be dynamical rather than a cosmological constant. In this work, we investigate the cosmological implications of simultaneously incorporating $\sum m_\nu$ and $N_{\rm eff}$ within the framework of dynamical DE. A joint analysis of DESI DR2, cosmic microwave background, DESY5 supernova, and DESY1 weak lensing data yields a total neutrino mass of $\sum m_\nu = 0.098^{+0.016}_{-0.037}\,\mathrm{eV}$, indicating a preference for a positive neutrino mass at the $2.7\sigma$ level within the $w_0w_a$CDM framework. This work highlights the important influence of the strength of evidence for dynamically evolving DE on the measurement of neutrino mass, with stronger evidence for DE dynamics leading to a larger neutrino mass. These results underscore the importance of measuring the neutrino mass within the framework of dynamical DE, particularly in light of the forthcoming, more complete DESI data releases.

          The Event Rate and Luminosity Function of Fermi/GBM Gamma-Ray Bursts

 - **Abstract**
 Luminosity function and event rate of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) are easily biased by the instrument and selection effects. We select 115 Fermi/GBM GRBs with good spectra fitted by a smoothly broken power-law function. The $\tau$-statistic method is used to describe how the luminosity evolves with redshift. The non-parametric Lynden-Bell's c$^{-}$ method has been applied to get the cumulative luminosity function and event rate which is compared with the star formation history. How the selection and instrument effects bias the deduced event rate has been carefully studied. We find that the event rate always exceeds the star formation rate (SFR) at lower redshift and matches with each other at higher redshift, which is independent of energy bands and consistent with previous findings of other satellites. Furthermore, it is found that sample completeness does not affect the deduced event rate too much as mentioned for the Swift lGRBs in Dong et al.. A triple power-law function has been used to fit the cumulative flux distribution and categorize the total sample into three subsamples of bright, medium and faint GRBs. We find that the event rates of bright GRBs, unlike medium and faint ones, comply with the SFR ideally, which indicates that these bright GRBs with higher luminosity are possibly produced from the core-collapse of massive stars.

          Forecast constraints on null tests of the $Λ$CDM model with SPHEREx

 - **Abstract**
 In this work we quantify the ability of the upcoming SPHEREx survey to constrain cosmological observables and test the internal consistency of the cosmological constant and cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model. Using Fisher matrix forecasting, we assess the expected precision on Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) observables, such as the angular diameter distance $D_\mathrm{A}(z)$ and the Hubble parameter $H(z)$. We further explore SPHEREx's potential to probe some of the fundamental assumptions of large-scale spatial homogeneity and isotropy, through model-independent reconstructions of several consistency tests of the $\Lambda$CDM model. In addition, we also examine the effect of the model dependence of the resulting Fisher and covariance matrices, using a neural network (NN) classification approach. We find that, while it is commonly assumed the covariance matrix depends weakly on the model, in fact the NN can very accurately ($\sim 98\%$) detect the underlying fiducial cosmological model based solely on the covariance matrix of the data, thus challenging this assumption.

          The gravitational potential of spiral perturbations. I the 2D (razor-thin) case

Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/
 - **Abstract**
 I develop an efficient numerical method to obtain the gravitational potential of razor-thin spiral perturbations and use it to assess the standard tight-winding (or WKB) approximation, which is found reasonably accurate for pitch angles $\alpha\lesssim 20°$. I extend Kalnajs' (1971)' potential-density pairs to logarithmic spirals with arbitrary power-law amplitude. Approximating a spiral locally by one of these models provides a second-order tight-winding approximation that predicts the phase offset between spiral potential and density, the resulting radially increasing pitch of the potential, and the non-local outward angular-momentum transport by gravitational torques. Beyond the inner and outer edge of a spiral with m arms, its potential is not winding ($\alpha=90°$), decays like $R^m$ and $R^{-1-m}$, respectively, and cannot be predicted by a local approximation.

 - **Abstract**
 The SST-1M telescopes are a pair of Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs) that have been operating at the Ondřejov Observatory (510 m a.s.l.) in the Czech Republic since 2022. Optimized for detecting gamma rays in the energy range 1-300 TeV, they are capable of performing both mono and stereo observations. Despite challenging atmospheric conditions, SST-1M has successfully detected several galactic and extragalactic gamma-ray sources with energies reaching up to 200 TeV during its ongoing commissioning. In this study, we analyze the performance of the SST-1M telescopes at different locations to assess the impact of altitude and relative telescope spacing on their physics performance. The low-altitude site at 510 m a.s.l. has already been investigated using both Monte Carlo simulations and real data. For comparison, we selected an intermediate-altitude site at 1420 m a.s.l. corresponding to Pampa Amarilla in Argentina and a high-altitude site at 4270 m a.s.l. corresponding to Hanle in India - both of which offer favorable astronomical conditions.

          Assessing robustness and bias in 1D retrievals of 3D Global Circulation Models at high spectral resolution: a WASP-76 b simulation case study in emission

 - **Abstract**
 High-resolution spectroscopy (HRS) of exoplanet atmospheres has successfully detected many chemical species and is quickly moving toward detailed characterization of the chemical abundances and dynamics. HRS is highly sensitive to the line shape and position, thus, it can detect three-dimensional (3D) effects such as winds, rotation, and spatial variation of atmospheric conditions. At the same time, retrieval frameworks are increasingly deployed to constrain chemical abundances, pressure-temperature (P-T) structures, orbital parameters, and rotational broadening. To explore the multidimensional parameter space, they need computationally fast models that are consequently mostly one-dimensional (1D). However, this approach risks introducing interpretation bias since the planet's true nature is 3D. We investigate the robustness of this methodology at high spectral resolution by running 1D retrievals on simulated observations in emission within an observational framework using 3D Global Circulation Models of the quintessential HJ WASP-76 b. We find that the retrieval broadly recovers conditions present in the atmosphere, but that the retrieved P-T and chemical profiles are not a homogeneous average of all spatial and phase-dependent information. Instead, they are most sensitive to spatial regions with large thermal gradients, which do not necessarily coincide with the strongest emitting regions. Our results further suggest that the choice of parameterization for the P-T and chemical profiles, as well as Doppler offsets among opacity sources, impact retrieval results. These factors should be carefully considered in future retrieval analyses.

 - **Abstract**
 The hybrid detection approach in astroparticle physics has been successfully employed in cosmic-ray experiments and is currently being explored by gamma-ray observatories like LHAASO. We present a study on the hybrid detection concept for the future Southern Wide-field Gamma-ray Observatory (SWGO), integrating multiple Cherenkov telescopes represented in the analysis by Single-Mirror Small-Size imaging atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (SST-1M) located next to the surface array of water Cherenkov detectors (WCDs). We discuss the mutual benefits of this hybrid approach and present simulation-based results on key performances. Our findings points to the fact that the combination of wide field-of-view and continuous operation of WCDs with the high angular and energy resolution of Cherenkov telescopes could significantly improve the overall detection capabilities of the SWGO experiment.

          Weinberg's theorem, phantom crossing and screening

 - **Abstract**
 We consider models where the dilaton, seen as the pseudo-Goldstone boson of broken scale invariance, plays the role of dark energy. We revisit Weinberg's theorem and show that quantum corrections induced by the graviton lead to the screening of the dilaton locally. We also discuss the time evolution of the equation of state and find that phantom crossing is a natural feature of these models. The time variation of the equation of state and its deviation from $-1$ is limited by screening locally and can only be relaxed when the dilaton is allowed to have a mass of the order of the Hubble rate cosmologically, thus going beyond single-field screened dark-energy models. This obstruction extends to all single-field screened models of the chameleon-type where the large mass of the scalar on cosmological scales leads to a negligible variation of the equation of state at low redshift.

          Considering contact forces during the formation of planetesimals by gravitational collapse: mutual orbits, spin states, and shapes

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we apply a soft-sphere discrete element method (SSDEM) within the PKDGRAV N-body integrator to investigate the formation of planetesimal systems through the gravitational collapse of clouds of super-particles. Previously published numerical models have demonstrated that the gravitational collapse of pebble clouds is an efficient pathway to produce binary planetesimal systems. However, such investigations were limited by their use of a perfect-merger and inflated-radii super-particle approach, which inhibits any analysis of planetesimal shapes and spin states, precludes the formation of the tightest binary orbits, and produces significantly under-dense planetesimals. The SSDEM enables super-particles to rest upon each other through mutual surface penetration and by simulating contact physics. Super-particles do not need to be inflated and collisions are not treated as perfect mergers; we can thus track the evolution of planetesimal shapes, spins, and tight binary orbits. We demonstrate that the SSDEM is an excellent method to model the collapse process, and is capable of producing many binary planetesimal systems from a single cloud. Our results confirm the findings of previously published perfect-merging models while also producing novel results about planetesimal spin and shape properties. Newly-formed planetesimals exhibit 10-hr rotation periods on average and can be characterized by a wide variety of shapes (spherical, oblate, top-shaped, flattened, egg-shaped, or prolate), with the most-massive planetesimals primarily forming as spheres and oblate-spheroids.

          Artifacts in Halo Shapes: Imprints of the Initial Condition

 - **Abstract**
 Grid type pre-initial conditions are commonly used to initialize particle positions in cosmological simulations. While these conditions are known to produce noticeable numerical artifacts in void regions, their impact on halo properties has generally been assumed to be negligible. In this work, we employ multiple simulations to demonstrate that grid initialization induces statistically significant artifacts in halo shapes, despite the modest absolute amplitude ($\sim 1\%$) making them unimportant for most cosmological studies. We identify a redshift-dependent artificial alignment pattern: at low redshifts ($z<2$), halo shapes preferentially orient away from the simulation box's Cartesian axes, whereas their constituent particles initially exhibit alignment with these axes. We propose a mathematical hypothesis to explain this flipping behavior.

          A double-degenerate scenario with a merger to explosion delay time to explain type Ia supernova SN 2020aeuh

 - **Abstract**
 I suggest the double-degenerate (DD) scenario with a merger-to-explosion delay (MED) time (the DD-MED scenario) of about 1-2 years to explain the rare properties of the recently analyzed type Ia supernova (SN Ia) SN 2020aeuh. The rare properties are the SN Ia ejecta interacting with a carbon-oxygen (CO)-rich circumstellar material (CSM) at approximately 50 days post-explosion. In this DD-MED scenario, two massive CO white dwarfs (WDs), masses of M1=1.1Mo and M2=1, merge to leave a rapidly rotating lonely WD of about the Chandrasekhar mass. The merger process ejects 0.7Mo to form a nonspherical CO-rich CSM. At the explosion, there is a lonely WD and a detached hydrogen- and helium-deficient CSM. Studies proposed the other lonely WD scenario, the core-degenerate (CD) scenario, to explain several specific SNe Ia and SN Ia remnants. SN 2020aeuh is the first particular SN Ia that is attributed to the DD-MED scenario. Besides being slightly brighter than typical SNe Ia and the CSM interaction, SN 2020aeuh is a normal SN Ia. Therefore, this study strengthens the claim that the lonely WD scenarios, i.e., the DD-MED and CD scenarios, account for most, if not all, normal SNe Ia; all SN Ia scenarios, whether lonely WD or not, might contribute to peculiar SNe Ia.

 - **Abstract**
 We present centimeter continuum observations of seven high luminosity massive protostars and their surroundings as part of the SOFIA Massive (SOMA) Star Formation Survey. With data from the Very Large Array and the Australia Telescope Compact Array, we analyze the spectral index, morphology and multiplicity of the detected radio sources. The high sensitivity and high resolution observations allow us to resolve many sources. We report thirteen new detections and two previously known detections that we observed for the first time in radio frequencies. We use the observations to build radio spectral energy distributions (SEDs) to calculate spectral indices. With radio morphologies and the spectral indices, we give assessments on the nature of the sources, highlighting five sources that display a radio jet-like morphology and a spectral index consistent with ionized jets. Combining with the SOMA Radio I sample, we present the radio - bolometric luminosity relation, especially probing the regime from $L_{\rm bol}\sim 10^4$ to $10^6\:L_\odot$. Here we find a steep rise in radio luminosity, which is expected by models that transition from shock ionization to photoionization.

 - **Abstract**
 White dwarf planetary systems uniquely link the bulk elemental composition of exoplanetary material to the mineralogy as photospheric abundances can be compared to circumstellar dust mineralogy. This study re-examines Spitzer/IRS spectra of eight white dwarfs with both circumstellar dust and photospheric metals. All systems show 10$\mu$m silicate emission features consistent with a mixture of olivine and pyroxene silicates, with varying dominance. New Hubble Space Telescope ultraviolet spectroscopic observations of two of these systems, GD56 and WD1150-153, reveal that both are accreting dry, rocky material. WD1150-153 is accreting material consistent with Bulk Earth, while GD56 is accreting core-rich material with an inferred core mass fraction of 0.59$^{+0.08}_{-0.09}$ (0.37$^{+0.08}_{-0.08}$ by mole). A comparison between the bulk elemental composition of the accreted planetary material and the dust mineralogy of the eight systems reveals a tentative correlation between the dominant silicate mineralogy and the Mg/Si ratio, indicating that the circumstellar and photospheric material are compositionally similar. This suggests that rapid and well-mixed accretion is occurring with minimal compositional alteration. Furthermore, new GGCHEM equilibrium chemistry models confirm that Mg-rich planetary material preferentially forms olivine-rich dust, highlighting the importance of equilibrium in planetary chemistry and that a host star or rock's Mg/Si can be used to predict whether its silicate mineralogy is olivine- or pyroxene-dominated, influencing its capacity to structurally store water, recycle key nutrients, and possibly habitability.

 A mechanism for generating anisotropic enhancements of the curvature perturbation through a vector field is proposed. We find that when the mixing between the inflaton perturbation and the vector-field perturbation is sufficiently strong in the anisotropic inflation, the power spectrum becomes dominated by anisotropic constant modes. This suggests that statistical anisotropy in primordial black hole (PBH) formation may be inevitable if inflation undergoes an anisotropic inflationary phase. Our findings offer a novel approach to probe vector fields during inflation and to test the cosmic no-hair conjecture.

 - **Abstract**
 Time-domain astrophysics relies on heterogeneous and multi-modal data. Specialized models are often constructed to extract information from a single modality, but this approach ignores the wealth of cross-modality information that may be relevant for the tasks to which the model is applied. In this work, we propose a multi-modal, mixture-of-expert variational autoencoder to learn a joint embedding for supernova light curves and spectra. Our method, which is inspired by the Perceiver architecture, natively accommodates variable-length inputs and the irregular temporal sampling inherent to supernova light curves. We train our model on radiative transfer simulations and validate its performance on cross-modality reconstruction of supernova spectra and physical parameters from the simulation. Our model achieves superior performance in cross-modality generation to nearest-neighbor searches in a contrastively-trained latent space, showing its promise for constructing informative latent representations of multi-modal astronomical datasets.

          An Explicit M1 Radiation-hydrodynamics Scheme for Three-dimensional Protostellar Evolution

 - **Abstract**
 We present a radiation-hydrodynamics (RHD) scheme that enables three-dimensional simulations resolving both protostellar interiors and their surrounding accretion flows within a single framework, to clarify how a protostar evolves while interacting with the accretion flow. The method builds on an explicit M1 closure scheme with a reduced speed of light approximation (RSLA) for massively parallel computation. Our scheme introduces a complementary non-RSLA radiation component that dominates in optically thick regions. This hybrid treatment restores physical energy conservation inside protostars, which would otherwise be violated under the RSLA, while retaining the advantage of large time steps. To overcome the limitation of the conventional M1 closure in solving radiative transfer in extremely optically thick regions inside protostars and across steep optical-depth gradients near their surfaces, we incorporate the optical-depth information of neighboring cells into the radiative transfer calculation. We further evolve photon number densities in addition to radiation energy densities to reconstruct an effective local spectrum on the fly without resorting to costly multi-frequency transport. We implement this scheme in the adaptive mesh refinement code SFUMATO and verify its validity through a series of test calculations. As an application, we follow the early evolution of a massive protostar formed at high redshift, within a full cosmological context. The results reveal a continuous structure connecting the swollen protostar and its surrounding disk, which cannot be captured in conventional one-dimensional models. This explicit RHD scheme opens a path to studies of protostellar evolution and its interaction with the accretion flow in realistic three-dimensional environments.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we forecast the number of, and requirements on, N-body simulations needed to train hybrid effective field theory (HEFT) emulators for a range of use cases, using a hybrid of HMcode and perturbation theory as a surrogate model. Our accuracy goals, determined with careful consideration of statistical and systematic uncertainties, are $1\%$ accurate in the high-likelihood range of cosmological parameters, and $2\%$ accurate over a broader parameter space volume for $k<1 h Mpc^{-1}$ and $z<3$. Focusing in part on the 8-parameter $w_0w_a$CDM+$m_\nu$ cosmological model, we find that $<225$ simulations are required to meet our error goals over our wide parameter space, including models with rapidly evolving dark energy, given our simulation and emulator recommendations. For a more restricted parameter space volume, as few as 80 simulations are sufficient. We additionally present simulation forecasts for example use cases, and make the code used in our analyses publicly available. These results offer practical guidance for efficient emulator design and simulation budgeting in future cosmological analyses.

          Constraining Power of Wavelet vs. Power Spectrum Statistics for CMB Lensing and Weak Lensing with Learned Binning

 - **Abstract**
 We present forecasts for constraints on the matter density ($\Omega_m$) and the amplitude of matter density fluctuations at 8h$^{-1}$Mpc ($\sigma_8$) from CMB lensing convergence maps and galaxy weak lensing convergence maps. For CMB lensing convergence auto statistics, we compare the angular power spectra ($C_\ell$'s) to the wavelet scattering transform (WST) coefficients. For CMB lensing convergence $\times$ galaxy weak lensing convergence statistics, we compare the cross angular power spectra to wavelet phase harmonics (WPH). This work also serves as the first application of WST and WPH to these probes. For CMB lensing convergence, we find that WST and $C_\ell$'s yield similar constraints in forecasts for the $\textit{Simons}$ Observatory and the South Pole Telescope. However, WST gives a tighter constraint on $\sigma_8$ by a factor of $1.7$ for $\textit{Planck}$ data. When CMB lensing convergence is crossed with galaxy weak lensing convergence projected from $\textit{Euclid}$ Data Release 2 (DR2), we find that WPH outperforms cross-$C_\ell$'s by factors between $2.4$ and $3.8$ for individual parameter constraints. To compare these different summary statistics we develop a novel learned binning approach. This method compresses summary statistics while maintaining interpretability. We find this leads to improved constraints compared to more naive binning schemes for $C_\ell$'s, WST, and most significantly WPH. By learning the binning and measuring constraints on distinct data sets, our method is robust to overfitting by construction.

 - **Abstract**
 As part of the Galactic Bulge Time Domain Survey (GBTDS), the Nancy Grace Roman Galactic Exoplanet Survey (RGES) will use microlensing to discover cold outer planets and free-floating planets unbound to stars. NASA has established several science requirements for the GBTDS to ensure RGES success. A key advantage of RGES is Roman's high angular resolution, which will allow detection of flux from many host stars. One requirement specifies that Roman must measure the masses and distances of 40% of detected planet hosts with 20% precision or better. To test this, we simulated microlensing events toward the GBTDS fields and used Fisher matrix analysis to estimate light curve parameter uncertainties. Combining these with Roman imaging observables (lens flux, relative lens-source proper motion), we estimated the achievable precision of lens mass and distance measurements. Using pyLIMASS, a publicly available code for estimating lens properties, we applied this analysis to 3,000 simulated events. Assuming the Cassan et al. (2012) exoplanet mass function, we find that >40% of host stars meet the required 20% precision threshold, confirming that the GBTDS can satisfy the mission requirement. We validated our approach by comparing our inferred lens masses and distances to empirical measurements from detailed image-constrained light curve modeling of historical microlensing events with Hubble and Keck follow-up imaging. Our results agree within roughly 1 sigma, demonstrating that both approaches yield consistent and reliable mass and distance estimates, and confirming the robustness of our simulations for Roman-era microlensing science.

 - **Abstract**
 Globular clusters (GCs) and their associated stellar streams are key tracers of the hierarchical assembly history of the Milky Way. $\omega$ Centauri, the most massive and chemically complex GC in the Galaxy, is widely believed to be the remnant nucleus of an accreted dwarf galaxy. Identifying its associated debris and that of chemically similar clusters can provide important constraints on the nature of this progenitor system. We aim to identify field stars that are chemically and kinematically linked to $\omega$ Cen and to a group of globular clusters associated with the Nephele accretion event. We analyse APOGEE DR17 data using a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) in a 8-dimensional chemical space to identify field stars whose abundances match those of $\omega$ Cen. We then compute the orbital energy and angular momentum of these stars and apply a second GMM, calibrated on simulations from the e-TidalGCs project, to determine kinematic compatibility with the predicted streams of $\omega$ Cen and the associated Nephele GCs. We identify 470 stars chemically compatible with $\omega$ Cen, of which 58 are also Al-rich, consistent with second-generation stars found in GCs. Of these, 6 stars show kinematics consistent with the predicted $\omega$ Cen stream, and additional stars are linked to the tidal streams of NGC 6205, NGC 6254, NGC 6273, NGC 6656, and NGC 6809. We also find overlap in chemical and kinematic properties between Nephele stars and the Gaia Sausage-Enceladus population. Our findings indicate stellar debris linked to $\omega$ Cen and its candidate globular cluster family, consistent with a shared, now-disrupted galactic progenitor. Despite residual uncertainties from disc contamination and limited sky coverage, the results demonstrate the effectiveness of combined chemical and dynamical analyses in uncovering relics of past accretion events in the inner Galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 Simulation-based inference (SBI) is emerging as a new statistical paradigm for addressing complex scientific inference problems. By leveraging the representational power of deep neural networks, SBI can extract the most informative simulation features for the parameters of interest. Sequential SBI methods extend this approach by iteratively steering the simulation process towards the most relevant regions of parameter space. This is typically implemented through an algorithmic structure, in which simulation and network training alternate over multiple rounds. This strategy is particularly well suited for high-precision inference in high-dimensional settings, which are commonplace in physics applications with growing data volumes and increasing model fidelity. Here, we introduce dynamic SBI, which implements the core ideas of sequential methods in a round-free, asynchronous, and highly parallelisable manner. At its core is an adaptive dataset that is iteratively transformed during inference to resemble the target observation. Simulation and training proceed in parallel: trained networks are used both to filter out simulations incompatible with the data and to propose new, more promising ones. Compared to round-based sequential methods, this asynchronous structure can significantly reduce simulation costs and training overhead. We demonstrate that dynamic SBI achieves significant improvements in simulation and training efficiency while maintaining inference performance. We further validate our framework on two challenging astrophysical inference tasks: characterising the stochastic gravitational wave background and analysing strong gravitational lensing systems. Overall, this work presents a flexible and efficient new paradigm for sequential SBI.

 - **Abstract**
 (abridged) Streamers are newly identified channels that transport mass from large, molecular-cloud scales down to small, protoplanetary-disk scales. To better understand their impact on planet formation, it is essential to study their physical and chemical properties. In this framework, we aim to characterize the longest streamer identified in carbon chain emission within the Class I system L1489 IRS, connecting the nearby prestellar core L1489 to the young stellar object (YSO). We observed multiple transitions of C$_2$H, ortho-c-C$_3$H$_2$, and HC$_3$N in L1489 IRS with NOEMA and IRAM-30m at 3mm and 2mm. Using a variety of radiative transfer methods, including a hyperfine structure (HFS) fitting, rotational diagrams, and proposing a new self-consistent Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach combined with the non-LTE RADEX code, we derived the column densities and abundances of those molecules, as well as the H$_2$ number density along the streamer. This enabled us to estimate its mass, infall rate, and its impact on the {star+disk} system's mass. We found lower limits on the streamer mass of $\geq(4.67-18.3)\times10^{-3}$ $M_\odot$ (i.e., $\geq0.65-2.57$ times the current disk mass) and an infall rate of $\geq(1.94-7.57)\times10^{-7}$ $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, where the ranges correspond to the different molecular tracers. These values are consistent with those derived in similar Class I objects. This suggests that the disk could be fully replenished by streamer material. Given its mass, the streamer is likely at the origin of the external warped disk seen in this system, as predicted by numerical simulations. Moreover, the first investigations based on the C$_2$H/c-C$_3$H$_2$ and HC$_3$N/c-C$_3$H$_2$ abundance ratios suggest that the streamer chemistry may be inherited from the core. These results suggest, for the first time, that the chemical composition of a Class I object is [...]

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of NGTS-11 c, a transiting warm Neptune ($P \approx 12.8$ d; $M_{p} = 1.2^{+0.3}_{-0.2} M_{\mathrm{Nep}}$; $R_{p} = 1.24 \pm 0.03 R_{\mathrm{Nep}}$), in an orbit interior to the previously reported transiting warm Saturn NGTS-11 b ($P \approx 35.5$ d). We also find evidence of a third outer companion orbiting the K-dwarf NGTS-11. We first detected transits of NGTS-11 c in TESS light curves and confirmed them with follow-up transits from NGTS and many other ground-based facilities. Radial-velocity monitoring with the HARPS and FEROS spectrographs revealed the mass of NGTS-11 c and provides evidence for a long-period companion ($P > 2300$ d; $M_{p} \sin i > 3.6 M_{\mathrm{Jup}}$). Taking into account the two additional bodies in our expanded datasets, we find that the mass of NGTS-11 b ($M_{p} = 0.63 \pm 0.09 M_{\mathrm{Sat}}$; $R_{p} = 0.97 \pm 0.02 R_{\mathrm{Sat}}$) is lower than previously reported ($M_{p} = 1.2 \pm 0.3 M_{\mathrm{Sat}}$). Given their near-circular and compact orbits, NGTS-11 c and b are unlikely to have reached their present locations via high-eccentricity migration. Instead, they probably either formed in situ or formed farther out and then underwent disk migration. A comparison of NGTS-11 with the eight other known systems hosting multiple well-characterized warm giants shows that it is most similar to Kepler-56. Finally, we find that the commonly used 10-day boundary between hot and warm Jupiters is empirically well supported.

          A formation mechanism for narrow rings around minor bodies

 - **Abstract**
 The recent discovery of narrow rings around minor bodies has raised many questions regarding their origin and current dynamics. Sharp ring boundaries seem indicative of shepherding moonlets, but none have been found. All rings lie close to spin-orbit resonances (SORs) with the central body, particularly the 1/3, even though it is not clear how these may be related. Furthermore, in at least one case the location of the ring is exterior to the Roche radius, adding to the striking differences with respect to giant planets. We study the dynamical evolution of a particle disk around a minor body, perturbed by the non-spherical component of the gravity field, particle collisions, and spin changes of the central mass linked to angular momentum conservation. By varying key parameters, we search for cases where the combined effects may lead to resonance capture and orbital configurations similar to those that have been observed. We performed N-body simulations of massless particles orbiting a central spherical body with a co-rotating mass anomaly. Collisions were modeled by adopting a simple radial damping force. Angular momentum conservation links the body spin to the disk orbital evolution. Since the gravitational effect of the test particles is neglected, this back-reaction is introduced externally assuming ad hoc spin-down rates and disk mass. Interaction between non-sphericity and collisions leads to the formation of a narrow ring that slowly recedes from the central mass. Spin-down of the minor planet shifts the SORs outward, enabling resonant capture. For suitable parameters, a portion -or all- of the initial disk can become trapped in the 1/3 SOR with the mass anomaly, in dynamically stable low-eccentricity orbits. Although the required disk mass is high ($\ge 1\%$ of the central body), long-term collisional erosion could reduce it to values that are consistent with observed ringlets.

 - **Abstract**
 IGR J17091-3624 is the only black hole X-ray binary candidate, aside from the well-studied black hole system GRS 1915+105, observed to exhibit a wide range of structured variability patterns in its light curves. In 2025, the source underwent a ``failed'' outburst: it brightened in the hard state but did not transition to the soft state before returning to quiescence within a few weeks. During this period, IGR J17091-3624 was observed by multiple ground- and space-based facilities. Here, we present results from six pointed NuSTAR observations obtained during the outburst. None of the NuSTAR light curves showed the exotic variability classes typical of the soft state in this source; however, we detected, for the first time, strong dips in the count rate during one epoch, with a total duration of $\sim4\,\mathrm{ks}$ as seen by NuSTAR. Through spectral and timing analysis of all six epochs, we investigate the hard-state spectral evolution and the nature of the dips. A clear evolution of the coronal properties with luminosity is observed over all six epochs, with clear signatures of relativistic disk reflection which remain largely unchanged across the first five epochs. The first five epochs also show a strong and stable quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) feature in the power spectra. The dips observed in Epoch 5 are consistent with partial obscuration by ionized material with a column density $N_{\mathrm{H}} \approx 2.0 \times 10^{23}\,\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$. We discuss possible origins for this material and place constraints on the orbital parameters and distance of the system.

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we investigate the physical and chemical properties of planetary nebulae (PNe) from the Milky Way Galaxy using the largest number of sources to date, with 1,449 True PNe from the HASH database. Among the Galactic components thin disk, thick disk, halo, and bulge-most PNe are concentrated in the Galactic disk, with a median angular size of 12 arcseconds (0.45 pc), while halo PNe tend to have larger sizes. Physical parameters of whole PNe, extinction coefficent c(Hbeta), electron temperature (Te), and density (Ne) show Gaussian-like distributions with medians of 1.5, 9,900 K, and 1,200 cm(-3), respectively. The abundances of He, N, O, Ne, S, Cl, and Ar in PNe show Gaussian distributions with slight variations across Galactic components. PNe located in thin disk exhibit higher abundances, except for O and Ne, while PNe in halo have the lowest values for all elements. Strong correlations between elements, particularly Sulphur vs. Nitrogen (r=0.87), were identified using statistical tests. Comparisons with previous studies reveal variations ( 2 dex.) in abundance ratios, particularly in halo PNe. We also present the first detailed database in the literature, providing 7,200 abundance values for these elements, derived from 16,500 emission line measurements, to support the testing and development of theoretical models.

 - **Abstract**
 Time domain surveys such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory are projected to annually discover millions of astronomical transients. This and complementary programs demand fast, automated methods to constrain the physical properties of the most interesting objects for spectroscopic follow up. Traditional approaches to likelihood-based inference are computationally expensive and ignore the multi-component energy sources powering astrophysical phenomena. In this work, we present a hierarchical simulation-based inference model for multi-band light curves that 1) identifies the energy sources powering an event of interest, 2) infers the physical properties of each subclass, and 3) separates physical anomalies in the learned embedding space. Our architecture consists of a transformer-based light curve summarizer coupled to a flow-matching regression module and a categorical classifier for the physical components. We train and test our model on $\sim$150k synthetic light curves generated with $\texttt{MOSFiT}$. Our network achieves a 90% classification accuracy at identifying energy sources, yields well-calibrated posteriors for all active components, and detects rare anomalies such as tidal disruption events (TDEs) through the learned latent space. This work demonstrates a scalable joint framework for population studies of known transients and the discovery of novel populations in the era of Rubin.

 We present the methodology and results of the on-sky responsivity calibration of the South Pole Telescope Shirokoff Line Intensity Mapper (SPT-SLIM). SPT-SLIM is a pathfinder line intensity mapping experiment utilizing the on-chip spectrometer technology, and was first deployed during the 2024-2025 Austral Summer season on the South Pole Telescope. During the two-week on-sky operation of SPT-SLIM, we performed periodic measurements of the detector response as a function of the telescope elevation angle. Combining these data with atmospheric opacity measurements from an on-site atmospheric tipping radiometer, simulated South Pole atmospheric spectra, and measured detector spectral responses, we construct estimates for the responsivity of SPT-SLIM detectors to sky loading. We then use this model to calibrate observations of the moon taken by SPT-SLIM, cross-checking the result against the known brightness temperature of the Moon as a function of its phase.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of exoplanet transits by small satellites have gained increasing attention for reducing detection biases. However, no unambiguous detection of an exoplanet has yet been demonstrated using optics with apertures smaller than 60 mm. Here, we investigated the detectability of exoplanet transits using the telescopic Optical Navigation Camera (ONC-T) onboard the Hayabusa2 spacecraft, which has an effective aperture of only 15 mm. We conducted transit observations of the hot Jupiters WASP-189 b and MASCARA-1 b, collecting data for ten and four events, respectively. The transit signal was detected with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 13 for WASP-189 b and 8 for MASCARA-1 b for each event. Stacking all events improved the SNR to 40 and 16, respectively. The transit mid-times of each event were measured with a precision of 6 minutes and were consistent with Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) data to within 2 minutes. The planet-to-star radius ratio was determined with an absolute precision of 0.004 (6% relative) and agreed with TESS results to within 0.002 (3% relative). The recent ONC-T and TESS data enabled an update to the planetary ephemerides. We report a 4 sigma discrepancy between the updated orbital period of MASCARA-1 b and previously reported values. ONC-T sets a new record for the smallest-aperture instrument to detect an exoplanet transit from space, advancing the frontier of exoplanet science with miniature instrumentation. Our results suggest that optics as small as ONC-T may be capable of detecting transiting long-period Jupiters: a population that remains underrepresented in current surveys.

          Water Snowline in Young Stellar Objects with Various Density Structures Using Radiative Transfer Models

 - **Abstract**
 Tracing the water snowline in low-mass young stellar objects (YSOs) is important because dust grain growth is promoted and the chemical composition varies at the water snowline, which influences planet formation and its properties. In protostellar envelopes, the water snowline can be estimated as a function of luminosity using a relation derived from radiative transfer models, and these predictions are consistent with observations. However, accurately estimating the water snowline in protoplanetary disks requires new relations that account for the disk structure. We present the relations between luminosity and water snowline using the dust continuum radiative transfer models with various density structures. We adopt two-dimensional density structures for an envelope-only model (Model E), an envelope+disk+cavity model (Model E+D), and a protoplanetary disk model (Model PPD). The relations between the water snowline, where T_dust = 100 K, and the total luminosity, ranging 0.1-1,000 solar luminosity, are well fitted by a power-law relation, R_snow=a * (L/L_solar)^p au. The factor a decreases with increasing disk density, while the power index p has values around 0.5 in all models. As the disk becomes denser, the water snowline forms at smaller radii even at the same luminosity, since dense dust hinders photon propagation. We also explore the effect of viscous heating on the water snowline. In Model PPD with viscous heating, the water snowline shifts outward by a few au up to 15 au, increasing the factor a and decreasing the power index p. In Model E+D with lower disk mass, the effect of viscous heating is negligible, indicating that the disk mass controls the effect. The discrepancy between our models and direct observations provides insights into the recent outburst event and the presence of a disk structure in low-mass YSOs.

          Combining spectral analysis and narrow band pass filtering to predict solar cycle parameters in the next solar grand minimum

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce a new method for predicting sunspot number (SSN) that, based on successful back projections, can predict features of the SSN several solar cycles in advance. The method applies Fourier analysis to the annual SILSO SSN record, from 1700.5 to 2023.5, to identify in the spectrum, four strong components in the decadal, 10 to 11 year period, range and four weaker components in the octal, 8 to 9 year period, range. The time variation of each component is isolated by a new method of narrow band pass filtering. The components are fitted with sinusoids at the beginning/end of the SSN record for back/forward projection. Back projection successfully replicated the long term features of the Maunder Minimum. Forward projection predicts a Maunder-like grand minimum from 2030 to 2110, encompassing solar cycles 26 to 35. Details of short term features of SSN within the grand minimum are less certain. The octal contribution to SSN is shown to occasionally exceed the decadal contribution both in the projection and also within the observational record. Predicted SSN amplitudes for cycles 26 and 28 are about 50, about half the amplitude of cycles 24 and 25. The amplitude of cycle 27 is difficult to forecast as it may emerge as a double peak of cycle 26 rather than as two separate cycles 26 and 27. Amplitudes forecast for cycles 29 to 33 are, on average, about half the amplitude of cycles 26 and 27 with the lowest cycle of the grand minimum, cycle 30, occurring around 2070. Macro changes in SSN such as the occurrence of grand solar minima and maxima and micro changes such as the Waldmeier Effect are explained in terms of interference between the octal and decadal components evident in the SSN spectrum. The explanation differs from current theories that suggest SSN variability is due to stochastic forcing of a single solar dynamo process.

 - **Abstract**
 The binary black hole merger GW231123 is both the most massive gravitational-wave event observed and has the highest component spins measured to date. The dimensionless spins of the more massive (primary) and less massive (secondary) black holes are measured to be $\chi_1 = 0.90^{+0.10}_{-0.19}$ and $\chi_2 = 0.80^{+0.20}_{-0.51}$ ($90\%$ credible intervals), respectively. Its large mass and extremal spins are challenging to explain through standard binary stellar physics, though a flurry of hypothetical scenarios have been proposed. Hierarchical assembly -- i.e., mergers of black holes that are themselves formed from previous generations of mergers -- is generally a promising way to explain massive and rapidly spinning black holes. Here, we investigate the possibility that both GW231123 was assembled hierarchically in a dense star cluster as the merger of two second-generation black holes. Taking the inferred spin values at face value, we find that it is possible, though unlikely ($p\lesssim 1\%$), that a compact binary with both component spins like GW231123 could form in a cluster from hierarchical assembly.

 - **Abstract**
 Dust plays a critical role in the study of the interstellar medium (ISM). Extinction maps derived from optical surveys often fail to capture regions with high column density due to the limited photometric depth in optical wavelengths. To address these limitations, we developed the XPNICER method based on near-infrared (NIR) photometric survey data. This method combines the previously established PNICER and Xpercentile techniques, enabling effective mitigation of foreground contamination and improved handling of complex dust structures in the Galactic plane, which thus can provide more accurate extinction estimates, particularly in highly obscured regions. By applying XPNICER to the Galactic Plane Survey from the UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey, we have generated a series of two-dimensional (2D) dust extinction maps that span roughly 1800 deg2 of the Galactic plane (0< l < 110deg and 140< l < 232deg, |b| < 5deg). These maps, with spatial resolutions between 30arcsec and 300arcsec, can trace extinction up to Av ~ 30-40 mag. This new approach offers higher spatial resolution and better detection of high-extinction regions compared to previous large-scale dust-based maps of the Galactic plane, providing an independent and complementary measure of dust column densities.

 - **Abstract**
 Hubble constant tension, together with the recent indications of dynamical dark energy proposed from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements, poses significant challenges to the standard cosmological model. In this work, we perform a model-independent reconstruction of the dark-energy equation of state $w(z)$, jointly with an evolving Hubble constant $H_0(z)$. Using the DESI DR2 data combined with multiple type Ia supernova samples, we find that $w(z)$ varies with redshift and exhibits two potential phantom crossings at $z\sim0.5$ and $z\sim1.5$. Meanwhile, $H_0$ decreases continually from local to high redshift, alleviating the Hubble constant tension effectively. The joint $w(z)$-$H_0(z)$ model is strongly favored over the $w$CDM ($\Lambda$CDM) framework, with a logarithmic Bayes factor $\ln \boldsymbol{\mathcal B}= 5.04~(8.53)$. Across various prior assumptions and dataset combinations, we obtain consistent, data-driven reconstructions of both $w(z)$ and $H_0(z)$. Future BAO measurements from Euclid and next-generation CMB experiments will provide critical tests of these results and bring deeper insights into the nature of dark energy and the evolution of cosmic expansion.

 - **Abstract**
 Scientific CMOS cameras are becoming increasingly prevalent in modern observational astronomy. We assess the ability of CMOS image sensors technology to perform high-precision photometry with a detailed laboratory characterization of the Marana 4.2BV-11 CMOS camera. We characterise the camera in the Fastest Frame Rate (FFR) and High Dynamic Range (HDR) modes. Our evaluation includes read noise, dark current, photo response and dark signal non-uniformities, quantum efficiency and window transmittance. The read noise is found to be 1.577\,e$^-$ for the FFR mode. For the HDR mode the read noise floor is measured to be 1.571\,e$^-$ for signal levels below approximately 1800\,e$^-$. The bias level shows dark signal non-uniformities with values of 0.318\,e$^-$ and 0.232\,e$^-$ for FFR and HDR mode, respectively. Pixel well capacity reached 2366 e$^-$pix$^{-1}$ for the FFR mode and 69026 e$^-$pix$^{-1}$ with a dynamic range of 93\,dB for the HDR mode. The camera demonstrates good linearity, yielding linearity errors of 0.099\,\% for FFR mode and 0.122\,\% for HDR mode. The uniformity across the image arrays show a photo response non-uniformity of 0.294\,\% for the FFR mode and 0.131\,\% for the HDR mode. The dark current displays a noticeable glow pattern, resulting in mean dark current levels of $1.674\pm0.011$\, \eps\, for the FFR mode and $1.617\pm0.008$\,\eps\, for the HDR mode at a constant temperature of -25\,$^\circ$C. We measured the quantum efficiency across the visible spectrum, with a peak of of >95\,\% at 560\,nm. Our tests indicate that the Marana CMOS camera is potentially capable of performing precise photometry.

 The International Academy of Astronautics (IAA) SETI Committee has long provided guiding principles for responding to a potential detection of a SETI signal. The foundational Declaration of Principles Concerning Activities Following the Detection of Extraterrestrial Intelligence, first formulated in 1989, has been widely recognised by the international scientific community. A supplemental set of draft protocols addressing the possibility of a reply to an extraterrestrial signal was prepared in 1995 by the IAA SETI Permanent Committee, with both documents presented in a position paper to the UN Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space in 2000. In keeping with the evolving landscape of SETI research, the IAA Declaration of Principles was streamlined and updated in 2010. Recognising the need for continued adaptation, the IAA SETI Committee established a Task Group in 2022 to re-examine the protocols in light of recent advances in search methodologies, the expansion of international participation in SETI, and the increasing complexity of the global information environment. The Group recognises the living document nature of the protocols, which will require ongoing refinement to remain relevant and effective in a rapidly changing world. A draft revised Declaration of Principles was presented at the IAC 2024 in Milan, and initial feedback was received from the community, particularly members of the IAA SETI Committee. Since then, we have continued to seek broader community input in a structured process, refining the proposed updates based on further discussions and consultations. A Revised Declaration of Principles, is presented here.

 - **Abstract**
 High abundances of various lead (Pb) species have been identified in the spectra of many Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars and O- and B-type subdwarfs (sdO/B). Additional atomic data relating to Pb, and in particular photoionization cross sections, are needed to allow a greater understanding of the origin of these observed Pb abundances, and hence discern the evolutionary pathway of these stars. We have calculated level-resolved photoionization cross sections for Pb III, IV, V and VI. Four new target structures have been developed with the General Relativistic Atomic Structure Package (GRASP0), whose corresponding energy levels, Einstein A-coefficients and oscillator strengths have been found to be in good agreement with previous experimental and theoretical sources. The photoionization cross sections calculated using the Dirac Atomic R-matrix Codes (DARC) are available in TOPBASE format, and follow the trends expected for an isonuclear series. These new Pb data sets will now allow for the modelling of Pb abundances and line opacities under Non-Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (non-LTE) conditions. Using the helium-rich hot subdwarf EC 22536-5304 as a test case, we show that there are noticeable differences in the Pb line profiles across the ultraviolet and optical wavelength regions under LTE and non-LTE conditions. There is both depletion and enrichment of individual Pb species. This highlights the importance of applying non-LTE conditions when modelling EC 22536-5304, as well as other O/B-type stars.

          The bimodal distribution of donor stars in X-ray binaries

 - **Abstract**
 The classification of X-ray binaries into high- and low-mass types has historically lacked a unified, data-driven quantitative criterion, and large-scale statistical studies of the donor star population have been limited. In this work, we address this gap by compiling data for 3,964 XRBs and deriving a plentiful set of physical parameters (mass, radius, age, and evolutionary stage) for a sub-sample of 288 donor stars using Gaia DR3 spectral data and stellar evolution models. We find a statistically bimodal distribution in the donor star parameters, which is characterized by a valley at approximately 3 $M_{\odot}$ or 11,000 K. We uncover the physical mechanism behind this bimodality: a previously unreported ``parallel tracks'' phenomenon observed in the relationship between the donor's evolutionary stage and its fundamental parameters, such as luminosity and radius. These two tracks represent distinct main-sequence populations, and the valley between them corresponds to the sparsely populated pre- and post-main-sequence evolutionary phases.

 - **Abstract**
 Electron-capture (EC) unstable species in Galactic cosmic rays constrain the time elapsed between nucleosynthesis and acceleration. They have also been advocated as tracers of reacceleration or gas inhomogeneities during their transport. The number of EC-unstable species grows with mass, with an expected EC-decay impact more important for larger atomic number and lower energy. We revisit the modelling of EC decay and its detectability in the context of recent unmodulated low-energy (Voyager) and high-precision data for heavy (AMS-02) and very-heavy nuclei (ACE-CRIS, CALET and Super-TIGER). We solve the transport equation for a multi-level configuration (up to any number of electrons attached) in the diffusion and leaky-box models. Their decayed fractions are found to be qualitatively similar but with very different absolute fluxes. We check that the standard two-level approximation, wherein the cosmic-ray nucleus is fully ionised or with one electron attached, is sufficient for most situations. We find that the impact of EC-decay is negligible in current data, except possibly for fluxes or ratios involving $^{51}$Cr, $^{55}$Fe, and Co. These conclusions are robust against significant uncertainties in the attachment and stripping cross-sections. This first analysis calls for further investigation, as several forthcoming projects (e.g., TIGERISS) are targeting $Z>30$ cosmic rays.

 - **Abstract**
 Algol is a well-known eclipsing binary hosting an active and variable star that exhibits frequent stellar flares. Here, we report our pre-planned and coordinated rapid X-ray follow-up observations of an eclipsing flare on Algol. The Monitor of All-sky X-ray Image (MAXI) detected a flare on Algol at 05:52 UT on 2018 July 4. Subsequently, we carried out a prompt X-ray monitoring with the Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) starting at 19:45 UT on the same day, and the observation ended at 06:02 UT on 2018 July 6. During the decaying phase of the flare, we successfully detected a 5.8-hour-long eclipse, corresponding to the secondary eclipse in which Algol A blocks the line of sight to Algol B. During the eclipse, the 2--10 keV X-ray flux is decreased to 20\% level from $1.9\times10^{-10}~ \mathrm{erg~cm^{-2}~s^{-1} }$ to $4.5\times10^{-11}~ \mathrm{erg~cm^{-2}~s^{-1} }$. We found a configuration of the flare size and location to explain the X-ray observations; e.g., the flare occurred at the latitude 45°S of the Algol B surface with a flare height of $1.9\times10^{11}~\mathrm{cm}$, corresponding to 0.8 times the stellar radius of Algol B, giving 80% obscuration of the flare loop by Algol A. The apparent absorption increase before the eclipse might originate from coronal mass ejection (CME) in the line of sight ejected during the flare.

 The prototype station of the Surface Array Enhancement at the IceCube Neutrino Observatory has been taking data in its final design since 2023. This station is part of the planned extension within the footprint of the existing surface array, IceTop. One station consists of 8 scintillator detectors, 3 radio antennas, and a central DAQ. The final upgrade of the scintillation detectors and their firmware at the prototype station has extended the dynamic range and increased the data-taking up-time, thereby expanding the observation window for air showers. This contribution will discuss the performance of the upgraded prototype station after commissioning and its angular resolution capabilities when observing air showers with the scintillation detectors and in coincidence with IceTop. Furthermore, the integration of additional stations during the most recent deployment will be discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 The bulk properties of convection in stellar and giant planet interiors are often assumed to be independent of the molecular diffusivities, which are very small. By contrast, simulations of this process in rotating, spherical shells, which are typically driven by conductive boundary heat fluxes, generally yield results that depend on the diffusivity. This makes it challenging to extrapolate these simulation results to real objects. However, laboratory models and Cartesian-box simulations suggest diffusion-free dynamics can be obtained if convection is driven using prescribed internal heating and cooling instead of boundary fluxes. Here, we apply this methodology to simulations of Boussinesq, hydrodynamic rotating spherical shell convection. We find that this set-up unambiguously yields diffusion-free behaviour for bulk 'thermal' properties of the convection, such as the radial temperature contrast and the convective heat transport. Moreover, the transition from prograde to retrograde equatorial zonal flow is diffusion-free and only depends on the convective Rossby number. The diffusivity dependence of other bulk 'kinematic' properties is regime-dependent. In simulations that are rotationally constrained, the convective velocities, and the strength and structure of the zonal flow, are diffusion-dependent, although the zonal flow appears to approach a diffusion-free state for sufficiently high supercriticality. In simulations that are uninfluenced by rotation, or are only influenced by rotation at large scales, diffusion-free convective velocities and zonal flow amplitudes are obtained. The result that many aspects of our idealised simulations are diffusion-free has promising implications for the development of realistic stellar and giant planet convection models that can access diffusion-free regimes.

 - **Abstract**
 The Kepler mission, despite its conclusion over a decade ago, continues to offer a rich dataset for uncovering new astrophysical objects and phenomena. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive search for exocometary transit signatures within the Kepler light curves, using a machine learning approach based on a neural network trained on a library of theoretical exocomet transit light curves. By analyzing the light curves of 201,820 stars, we identified candidate events through the neural network and subjected the output to filtering and visual inspection to mitigate false positives. Our results are presented into three catalogs of increasing ambiguity. The first-tier catalog includes 17 high-confidence exocometary transit events, comprising 7 previously reported events and 10 newly identified ones, each associated with a different host star. The second-tier catalog lists 30 lower-confidence events that remain consistent with possible exocometary transits. The third-tier catalog consists of 49 more symmetric photometric events that could be either exocometary transits, exoplanet mono-transits, or false positives due to eclipsing binaries mimicking transits. Contrary to previous studies, which suggested that the cometary activity was favored by stellar youth, we find a broad age distribution among candidate host stars, including several red giants. This challenges the general idea of a decline in cometary activity with stellar age and underlines the need for further investigation into the temporal evolution of exocometary activity in planetary systems.

 - **Abstract**
 Aims: Studying the dynamical evolution of young clusters is crucial for a more general understanding of the star formation process. Methods: We took spectra of >600 candidate pre-main sequence (PMS) stars in several nearby young clusters (NGC 2264 N & S, Collinder 95, and Collinder 359) using MMT/Hectospec. These spectra were analyzed for H{\alpha} emission and lithium absorption, features indicative of low-mass young stellar objects (YSOs) still in their PMS evolution. We complemented these samples with YSOs identified via Gaia DR3 variability. In conjunction with Gaia astrometry, these data enable an analysis of cluster structure, kinematics and ages. In particular, we searched for halos of YSOs around our targets to test models of young cluster dynamical evolution. Results: For the NGC 2264 N & S cluster pair we identified 354 YSOs, while for Collinder 95 and 359 we identified 130 and 7 YSOs, respectively. We calculate kinematic "traceback ages" for YSOs in these clusters, which we compare to isochronal ages estimated using several sets of stellar evolution models. We find for NGC 2264 N & S that kinematic ages are generally smaller than their isochronal ages, which may indicate these systems remained bound for a few Myr before their current state of expansion. On the other hand, kinematic ages for Collinder 95 are often significantly larger than isochronal ages, which implies many of these YSOs did not originate from a central, dense region, leading to overestimated kinematic ages. Conclusions: We conclude that NGC 2264 N & S clusters likely formed as initially bound and compact systems, but have been gradually evaporating as cluster members become unbound, forming halos of unbound YSOs surrounding the cluster cores. We conclude that Collinder 95 likely formed initially sparse and substructured and has been dispersing since gas expulsion.

          Evaluating Habitability and Biosignature Detection on TOI-700 d: The Role of UV Environment and Atmospheric Pressure

 - **Abstract**
 M dwarfs have long been prime targets in the search for habitable exoplanets, owing to their abundance in the galaxy and the relative ease of detecting Earth-sized worlds within their narrower habitable zones. Yet, these low-mass stars can emit high-energy radiation that may gradually erode planetary atmospheres, raising concerns about long-term habitability. TOI-700, a relatively quiescent M dwarf that hosts four known planets, stands out due to its Earth-sized TOI-700 d in the star's habitable zone. Here, we assess whether a habitable environment can be sustained on TOI-700 d by analyzing different UV flux levels and atmospheric pressures. We focus on two atmospheric scenarios - one analogous to the Archean Earth and another representing a modern Earth-like environment - using a 1D photochemistry-climate model. Our results indicate that all simulated cases can maintain temperatures compatible with liquid water on the surface. However, the dominant photochemical pathways differ substantially with UV levels: under low-UV conditions, haze formation in the Archean-like atmosphere provides the main UV shielding, whereas under intensified UV, ozone production in the modern-like atmospheres can protect the surface from harmful doses. Interestingly, although haze can impede the detection of certain biosignatures, such as CH4, CO2 and O2, it also enhances the overall atmospheric signal by increasing scattering and transit depth, potentially aiding in revealing the presence of an atmosphere. These findings underscore the dual role of hazes as both a challenge for biosignature detection and a potential protection of surface habitability.

 - **Abstract**
 We present phosphorus abundance measurements for a total of 102 giant stars, including 82 stars in 24 open clusters and 20 Cepheids, based on high-resolution near-infrared spectra obtained with GIANO-B. Evolution of phosphorus abundance, despite its astrophysical and biological significance, remains poorly understood due to a scarcity of observational data. By combining precise stellar parameters from the optical, a robust line selection and measurement method, we measure phosphorus abundances using available P I lines. Our analysis confirms a declining trend in [P/Fe] with increasing [Fe/H] around solar metallicity for clusters and Cepheids, consistent with previous studies. We also report a [P/Fe]-age relation among open clusters older than 1 Gyr, indicating a time-dependent enrichment pattern. Such pattern can be explained by the different stellar formation history of their parental gas, with more efficient stellar formation in the gas of older clusters (thus with higher phosphorus abundances). [P/Fe] shows a flat trend among cepheids and clusters younger than 1 Gyr (along with three Cepheids inside open clusters), possibly hinting at the phosphorus contribution from the previous-generation low-mass stars. Such trend suggests that the young clusters share a nearly common chemical history, with a mild increase in phosphorus production by low-mass stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Eclipsing brown dwarfs are important calibrators of sub-stellar evolution models used to infer the characteristics of directly imaged brown dwarfs and giant exoplanets. Only two double brown dwarf eclipsing binary systems are known, among them 2MASS J15104786-2818174 (2M1510 AB), published in 2020 with a poorly constrained orbital period. Here we analyse TESS full-frame image (FFI) photometry of this faint ($T=15.9$) binary and detect a significant (${>}10\sigma$) periodic signal spanning TESS Cycles 1-7, consistent with previous data. We refine the orbital period to $20.897782 \pm 0.000036$ d, reducing its present-day uncertainty from 18 h to 8 min. Our work is crucial for scheduling follow-up observations of this system for detailed study with other photometric facilities. We also find that a recent orbital solution from Doppler data is inconsistent with existing photometry. A timing offset in the Doppler data may have produced a spurious signal mimicking retrograde apsidal precession, from which the claimed circumbinary planet 2M1510 ABb was inferred. From our best attempt at correcting the data we were unable to reconcile the radial velocity data with the photometry, suggesting that the radial velocity uncertainties are underestimated, and that the circumbinary planet 2M1510 ABb may be a false positive.

 - **Abstract**
 Low- to intermediate-mass ($\sim$0.8$-$8 M$_\odot$) evolved stars contribute significantly to the chemical enrichment of the interstellar medium in the local Universe, making accurate mass-return estimates in their final stages crucial. The Nearby Evolved Stars Survey (NESS) is a large multi-telescope project targeting a volume-limited sample of $\sim$850 stars within 3 kpc in order to derive the dust and gas return rates in the Solar Neighbourhood, and to constrain the physics underlying these processes. We present an initial analysis of the CO-line observations, including detection statistics, carbon isotopic ratios, initial mass-loss rates, and gas-to-dust ratios. We describe a new data reduction pipeline to analyse the available NESS CO data from the JCMT, measuring line parameters and calculating empirical gas mass-loss rates. We present the first release of the available data on 485 sources, one of the largest homogeneous samples of CO data to date. Comparison with a large literature sample finds that high mass-loss rate and especially carbon-rich sources are over-represented in literature, while NESS is probing significantly more sources at low mass-loss rates, detecting 59 sources in CO for the first time and providing useful upper limits. CO line detection rates are 81% for the CO (2--1) line and 75% for CO (3--2). The majority (82%) of detected lines conform to the expected soft parabola shape, while eleven sources show a double wind. Calculated mass-loss rates show power-law relations with both the dust-production rates and expansion velocities up to $\sim 5 \times 10^{-6}$~\msunyr. Median gas-to-dust ratios of 250 and 680 are found for oxygen-rich and carbon-rich sources, respectively. Our analysis of CO observations in this first data release highlights the importance of our volume-limited approach in characterizing the local AGB population as a whole.

 - **Abstract**
 Galactic outflows are a key agent of galaxy evolution, yet their observed multiphase nature remains difficult to reconcile with theoretical models, which often fail to explain how cold gas survives interactions with hot, fast winds. We present high-resolution 3D hydrodynamic simulations of hot outflows interacting with a multiphase interstellar medium (ISM), parameterised by its cold-gas volume filling fraction $f_v$, depth $L_{\rm ISM}$, and clump size $r_{\rm cl}$. We identify a universal survival criterion $f_v L_{\rm ISM} \gtrsim r_{\rm crit}$ that generalises the classical single-cloud condition ($r_{\rm cl} > r_{\rm crit}$) and correctly predicts cold-gas survival across diverse ISM configurations - including scale-free - down to $r_{\rm cl}/r_{\rm crit} \sim 10^{-2}$. The surviving cold phase rapidly loses memory of the initial ISM structure and evolves toward a self-similar clump mass spectrum following Zipf's law ($\mathrm{d}N/\mathrm{d}m \propto m^{-2}$), implying that turbulent mixing and radiative condensation universally shape multiphase outflows. Cold gas assembles into plumes or confined shells of size $\sim \chi r_{\mathrm{cl,min}}$, growing as mass is accreted from the hot phase. The interaction of a laminar wind with a clumpy ISM drives turbulence in both phases, with first-order velocity structure functions following a Kolmogorov scaling and an injection scale set by $L_{\rm ISM}$, while velocity dispersions reach $\sigma \sim c_{\rm s,cold}$. The areal covering fraction of cold gas approaches unity even for $f_v \sim 10^{-3}$, though its volume filling fraction stays low, explaining the "misty" appearance of observed outflows. Together, these results link small-scale cloud-wind interactions to galaxy-scale feedback, and we discuss their implications for interpreting observations and for modelling multiphase galactic winds in larger-scale simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 The 21-cm signal is a powerful probe of the early Universe's thermal history and could provide a unique avenue for constraining exotic physics. Previous studies have forecasted stringent constraints on energy injections from exotic sources that heat, excite, and ionize the background gas and thereby modify the 21-cm signal. In this work, we quantify the substantial impact that astrophysical uncertainties have on the projected sensitivity to exotic energy injection. In particular, there are significant uncertainties in the minimum star-forming dark matter halo mass, the Lyman-$\alpha$ emission, and the X-ray emission, whose values characterize the fiducial astrophysical model when projecting bounds. As a case study, we investigate the energy injection of accreting primordial black holes of mass $\sim 1~M_\odot-10^3~M_\odot$, also taking into account uncertainties in the accretion model. We show that, depending on the chosen fiducial model and accretion uncertainties, the sensitivity of future 21-cm data could constrain the abundance of primordial black holes to be either slightly stronger, or significantly weaker, than current limits from the Cosmic Microwave Background.

 - **Abstract**
 Upcoming galaxy surveys will bring a wealth of information about the clustering of matter, but modeling small-scale structure beyond $\Lambda$CDM remains computationally challenging. While accurate $N$-body emulators exist to model the matter power spectrum for $\Lambda$CDM and some limited extensions, it's unfeasible to generate $N$-body simulation suites for all candidate models. Motivated by recent hints of an evolving dark energy equation of state, we assess the viability of employing the COmoving Lagrangian Acceleration (COLA) method to generate simulation suites for the $w_0w_a$ dark energy model. We combine COLA simulations with an existing high-precision $\Lambda$CDM emulator to extend its predictions into new regions of parameter space. We assess the precision of our emulator at the level of the matter power spectrum, finding that our emulator can reproduce the nonlinear boosts from EuclidEmulator2 at less than $2\%$ error. Moreover, we perform an analysis of a simulated cosmic shear survey akin to the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) first year of observations, assessing the differences in parameter constraints between our COLA-based emulator and the benchmark emulator. We find our emulator to be in excellent agreement with the benchmark, achieving less than $0.3\sigma$ shifts in cosmological parameters. We compare our emulator's performance to a commonly used approach: assuming the $\Lambda$CDM boost can be employed for extended parameter spaces without modification. We find that our emulator yields a significantly smaller $\Delta\chi^2$ distribution, parameter constraint biases, and a more accurate figure of merit compared to this second approach. Our results demonstrate that COLA emulators provide a computationally efficient path forward for modeling nonlinear structure in extended cosmologies, offering a practical alternative to full $N$-body suites.

          StarStream on Gaia: Stream discovery and mass loss rate of globular clusters

 - **Abstract**
 We apply the automatic stellar stream detection algorithm StarStream to Gaia Data Release 3 and identify 87 stellar streams associated with Galactic globular clusters (GCs), including 34 high-quality cases with median completeness and purity both exceeding 50%, as estimated from modeling mock streams. These detections double the number of known GC streams, and increase the fraction of GCs with tidal streams at high Galactic latitudes (|b| > 30 degree) to 75%. In contrast to visual expectations, many new streams are wide or short, or misaligned with their progenitors' orbits. Taking advantage of the unbiased density measurements enabled by our method, we also estimate the mass loss rate for the progenitor GCs. We find that several low-mass, large-size clusters have enhanced mass loss rates, indicating that they are approaching complete tidal disruption.

 - **Abstract**
 The Near InfraRed Planet Searcher (NIRPS) joined HARPS on the 3.6-m ESO telescope at La Silla Observatory in April 2023, dedicating part of its Guaranteed Time Observations (GTO) program to the radial velocity follow-up of TESS planet candidates to confirm and characterize transiting planets around M dwarfs. We report the first results of this program with the characterization of the TOI-756 system, which consists of TOI-756 b, a transiting sub-Neptune candidate detected by TESS, as well as TOI-756 c, an additional non-transiting planet discovered by NIRPS and HARPS. TOI-756 b is a 1.24-day period sub-Neptune with a radius of 2.81 $\pm$ 0.10 $R_\oplus$ and a mass of 9.8$^{+1.8}_{-1.6}$ $M_\oplus$. TOI-756 c is a cold eccentric (e$_c$ = 0.45 $\pm$ 0.01) giant planet orbiting with a period of 149.6 days around its star with a minimum mass of 4.05 $\pm$ 0.11 $M_\mathrm{jup}$. Additionally, a linear trend of 146$~\mathrm{m\,s}^{-1}\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ is visible in the radial velocities, hinting at a third component, possibly in the planetary or brown dwarf regime. This system is unique in the exoplanet landscape, standing as the first confirmed example of such a planetary architecture around an M dwarf. With a density of 2.42 $\pm$ 0.49 g cm$^{-3}$, the inner planet, TOI-756 b, is a volatile-rich sub-Neptune. Assuming a pure H/He envelope, we inferred an atmospheric mass fraction of 0.023 and a core mass fraction of 0.27, which is well constrained by stellar refractory abundances derived from NIRPS spectra. It falls within the still poorly explored radius cliff and at the lower boundary of the Neptune desert, making it a prime target for a future atmospheric characterization with JWST to improve our understanding of this population.

 - **Abstract**
 The Gaia mission has led to the discovery of over 100 stellar streams in the Milky Way, most of which likely originated from globular clusters (GCs). As the upcoming wide-field surveys can potentially continue to increase the number of known streams, there is a growing need to shift focus from manual detection of individual streams to automated detection methods that prioritize both quality and quantity. Traditional techniques rely heavily on the visual expectation that GC streams are dynamically cold and thin. This assumption does not hold for all streams, whose morphologies and kinematics can vary significantly with the progenitor's mass and orbit. As a result, these methods are biased toward a subset of the whole stream population, with often unquantified purity and completeness. In this work, we present StarStream, an automatic stream detection algorithm based on a physics-inspired model rather than visual expectation. Our method provides a more accurate prediction of stream stars in the multi-dimensional space of observables, while using fewer free parameters to account for the diversity of streams. Applied to a mock GC stream catalog tailored for the Gaia DR3 dataset, our algorithm achieves both purity and completeness of at least 65% at Galactic latitudes |b| > 30 degree.

 - **Abstract**
 Galactic microquasar SS433 and the radio nebula W50 surrounding it present a prototypical example of a hyper-Eddington binary system shaping its ambient interstellar medium via energetic outflows. In this paper, we present X-ray observations of the SS433/W50 complex by the eROSITA telescope onboard the SRG space observatory. These data provide images of the entire nebula characterized by a very large dynamic range and allow spectral analysis of the diffuse X-ray emission. In particular, these data illustrate a close connection between the thermal and non-thermal components of W50 on scales ranging from sub-parsecs, represented by narrow X-ray bright filaments, to the entire extent $\gtrsim 100\,{\rm pc}$ of the nebula. These data also allow us to fully characterize a pair of nearly symmetric, sharp-edged, elongated structures aligned with the orbital axis of the binary system, which lack radio counterparts, but are prominent in very high energy gamma-ray emission. The resulting multifaceted picture of the interaction between energetic outflows and the surrounding medium paves the way for future focused multiwavelength observations and dedicated numerical simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 Supernova (SN) and baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) distance measures have recently provided hints that the dark energy is not only dynamical but apparently evolves from normal to phantom dark energy between redshifts $0<z<1$. A normal axion dark energy component in the mass range just below the Hubble scale can mimic a phantom component by appearing as dark energy at $z=1$ and dark matter at $z=0$, raising the possibility of a phantom mirage. We show that there is a wide range of axion dark energy contributions that can resolve the SN-BAO tension as well as thawing quintessence does, leaving BAO tension with the cosmic microwave background (CMB) for the distance measures from $z\sim 1$ to recombination to be resolved at high redshifts. With axions, raising the optical depth to reionization to $\tau \approx 0.1$ works essentially as well as $w_0-w_a$ phantom dark energy for all but the lowE CMB data, with a remaining $\Delta\chi^2\sim -16$ compared with $\Lambda$CDM, whereas a small spatial curvature of $\Omega_K \sim 0.003$ can largely relax the full SN-BAO-CMB tension with a total $\Delta\chi^2 \sim -12$.

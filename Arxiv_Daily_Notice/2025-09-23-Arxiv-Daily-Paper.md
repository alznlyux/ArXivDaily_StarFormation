          Towards a Robust Machine-Learning Pipeline for 21-cm Cosmology Data Analysis I: A Roadmap for Development and Demonstration of Robustness Against PSF Modeling Errors

 - **Abstract**
 The 21-cm signal from the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) is a powerful probe of the evolution of the Universe. However, accurate measurements of the EoR signal from radio interferometric observations are sensitive to efficient foreground removal, mitigating radio-frequency interference and accounting for instrumental systematics. This work represents the first in a series of papers, where we will be introducing a novel ML based pipeline, step-by-step, to directly infer reionization parameters from 21-cm radio-interferometric images. In this paper, we investigate the impact of the variations in the point spread function (PSF) on parameter estimation by simulating visibilities corresponding to input 21-cm maps as observed by the 128-antenna configuration of the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) Phase II. These visibilities are imaged to obtain dirty images, which are then used to train a 2D convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict $\rm x_{HI}$. To systematically assess the effect of PSF mis-modelling, we generate multiple test sets by varying the MWA's antenna layout, thereby introducing controlled variations in the PSF; we then feed these alternative PSF dirty images to our CNN trained using only dirty images with the PSF of the true antenna layout. Our results demonstrate that PSF variations introduce biases in the CNN's predictions of $\rm x_{HI}$, with errors depending on the extent of PSF distortion. We quantify these biases and discuss their implications for the reliability of machine-learning-based parameter inference in 21-cm cosmology and how they can be utilized to improve the robustness of estimation against PSF-related systematics in future 21-cm surveys. In concluding, we also discuss how this approach to incorporating realistic instrument error into an ML analysis pipeline can be expanded to include multiple other effects.

          Recovering unbiased CMB polarization maps using modern ground-based experiments with minimal assumptions about atmospheric emission

 - **Abstract**
 We present a study of unbiased reconstruction of cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization maps from data collected by modern ground-based observatories. Atmospheric emission is a major source of correlated noise in such experiments, complicating the recovery of faint cosmological signals. We consider estimators that require minimal assumptions about unpolarized atmospheric emission properties, instead exploiting hardware solutions commonly implemented in modern instruments, such as pairs of orthogonal antennas in each focal plane pixel, and polarization signal modulation via a continuously rotating half-wave plate (HWP). We focus on two techniques: (i) statistical down-weighting of low-frequency atmospheric signals, and (ii) pair-differencing (PD), which involves differencing signals collected by two detectors in the same focal plane pixel. We compare their performance against the idealized case where the atmospheric signal is perfectly known and cleanly subtracted. We show that PD can be derived from maximum likelihood principles under general assumptions about the atmospheric signal, optimizing map sensitivity. In the absence of instrumental systematics but with reasonable detector noise variations, PD yields polarized sky maps with noise levels only slightly worse than the ideal case. While down-weighting could match this performance, it requires highly accurate atmospheric models that are not readily available. PD performance is affected by instrumental systematics, particularly those leaking atmospheric signal to the difference time stream. However, effects like gain mismatch are efficiently mitigated by a rotating HWP, making PD a competitive, robust, and efficient solution for CMB polarization mapmaking without atmospheric modeling.

          NICER observations reveal doubled timescales in Ansky's quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs)

 - **Abstract**
 Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are recurring X-ray bursts originating from the vicinity of supermassive black holes, but their driving mechanisms remain under debate. This study analyzes new NICER observations of QPEs in Ansky (a transient event in the nucleus of the galaxy SDSS J1335+0728), taken between January and June 2025. By examining flare durations, peak-to-peak recurrence times, and profiles, we compare the 2025 data with those from 2024 to investigate changes in energy, timescales, and flare shapes. The 2025 QPEs are found to be four times more energetic, with recurrence times of approximately 10 days and flare durations ranging from 2.5 to 4 days, making them both about twice as long as in 2024. Additionally, the flare profiles have become more asymmetric, showing longer decays. We explore different theoretical scenarios to explain the observed properties of the QPEs in Ansky, including evolving stream-disk interactions in an extreme mass-ratio inspiral (EMRI) system as a potential mechanism behind the observed changes in recurrence time and energetics, while also considering alternative models based on mass transfer and accretion disk instabilities. Continued observational efforts will be crucial for unveiling the nature of Ansky.

 - **Abstract**
 The core of a massive star (M > 8 Msun) eventually collapses. This implosion usually triggers a supernova (SN) explosion that ejects most of the stellar envelope and leaves behind a neutron star (NS) with a mass of up to about 2 Msun. Sometimes the explosion fails and a black hole forms instead. The NS radiates its immense binding energy (some 10% of its rest mass or $2-4\times10^{53}$ erg) almost entirely as neutrinos and antineutrinos of all flavors with typical energies of some 10 MeV. This makes core-collapse SNe the most powerful neutrino factories in the Universe. Such a signal was observed once - with limited statistics - from SN 1987A in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Today, however, many large neutrino detectors act as SN observatories and would register a high-statistics signal. A future Galactic SN, though rare (1-3 per century), would produce a wealth of astrophysical and particle-physics information, including possible signatures for new particles. Neutrinos are key to SN dynamics in the framework of the Bethe-Wilson delayed explosion paradigm. After collapse, they are trapped in the core for a few seconds, forming a dense neutrino plasma that can exhibit collective flavor evolution caused by the weak interaction, a subject of intense theoretical research.

 - **Abstract**
 A variety of physical processes leads to the low-energy ejection of material from the hydrogen-rich envelopes of red and yellow supergiants. These include common envelope events, stellar mergers, eruptive mass loss, and failed supernovae. These events may appear as luminous red novae, intermediate luminosity red transients, supernova imposters, or other transients with similar lightcurves and colors that are followed by the disappearance of the progenitor star (e.g. failed supernovae). The Vera C. Rubin Observatory will find these events in large numbers; detailed modeling of their lightcurves is essential for photometrically differentiating between these important physical processes in the lives of massive stars. We use one-dimensional, radiation hydrodynamic simulations to model the lightcurves of low-energy explosions of red and yellow supergiants. Red supergiant explosions have durations of 100-400 days, longer than Type IIp supernovae, while stripped, yellow supergiant explosions have durations of 10s of days. Our models probe the boundary between the radiation-pressure dominated and gas-pressure dominated regimes. We provide fitting formulae for the plateau luminosity and duration of the events. Finally, we show that the failed supernovae candidates in NGC 6946 and M31 are consistent with failed supernovae models for explosion energies of $\sim10^{47}-10^{49}$ erg.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first three-dimensional study of the asymptotic ejecta distributions for a suite of theoretical Type IIp supernovae originating from red supergiant progenitors. We simulate using the radiation-hydrodynamic code F{\sc{ornax}} from core bounce through the first seconds of the neutrino-driven explosion and then follow using a hydrodynamic variant of the code FLASH until shock breakout of the star and through to homologous expansion of the ejecta into the circumstellar environment. Our studied progenitor models range from 9 to 25 M$_{\odot}$, with explosion energies spanning $\sim$0.1$-$1 Bethe. The shock breakout times span the range $\sim$1$-$4 days, with a breakout time spread by direction ranging from hours to over a day. We find that the dipole orientation of the $^{56}$Ni ejecta is well-preserved from the first seconds out to shock breakout. The $^{56}$Ni ejecta penetrates through the initially outer oxygen shell, and its global structure is imprinted with small-scale clumping as the ejecta evolve through the stellar envelope. For the majority of our models, the neutron star kick is anti-aligned with the $^{56}$Ni ejecta. Models with strongly dipolar ejecta morphology and a massive hydrogen/helium envelope with an inner boundary located deep see as much as $\sim$70\% of the $^{56}$Ni ejecta mixed into that outer envelope, reaching asymptotic velocities ranging from $\sim$350 to 3200 km s$^{-1}$. Supernovae arising from red supergiant progenitors and exhibiting prominent nickel features generally display significant $^{56}$Ni mixing into the stellar envelope.

          Identifying close-in Jupiters that arrived via disk migration: Evidence of primordial alignment, preference of nearby companions and hint of runaway migration

 - **Abstract**
 Two leading hypotheses for hot Jupiter migration are disk migration and high-eccentricity migration (HEM). Stellar obliquity is commonly used to distinguish them, as high obliquity often accompanies HEM. However, low obliquity does not guarantee disk migration, due to possible spin-orbit realignment or coplanar HEM. Seeking a proxy for disk migration, we investigate the idea that when the circularization timescale of a planet on circular orbit is longer than its age ($\tau_\mathrm{cir} > \tau_\mathrm{age}$), HEM would not have had sufficient time to complete, favoring disk migration. We empirically calibrate the reduced planetary tidal quality factor to be $Q_\mathrm{p}=4.9^{+3.5}_{-2.5}\times10^5$ using the eccentricity distribution of 500+ Jovian mass ($0.2M_\mathrm{J}<M_\mathrm{p}<13M_\mathrm{J}$) planets with measured masses and radii, a value consistent with solar system Jupiter. We then calculate $\tau_\mathrm{cir}$ and identify dozens of disk migration candidates ($\tau_\mathrm{cir} > \tau_\mathrm{age}, \ e < 0.1$). These planets show three notable trends. We first find a clear cutoff of obliquity at $\tau_\mathrm{cir} \sim \tau_\mathrm{age}$, suggesting the primordial alignment of protoplanetary disks. Secondly, we find that among hot Jupiters ($a<0.1$ au), nearby companions are preferentially found around disk migration candidates, suggesting that either HEM dominates hot Jupiter formation, or disk migration also disrupts nearby companions at short separations. Finally, we find a possible dearth of disk migration candidates around mass ratio $\log q \sim -3.2$, consistent with a similar dip suggested at longer orbits from microlensing. The lack of planets across different orbital distance, if true, could be interpreted as a hint of runaway migration.

 - **Abstract**
 Determining the habitability of terrestrial exoplanets is a complex problem that represents the next major step for the astrophysical community. The majority of current models treat these planets as homogeneous or contain heterogeneity that is constant in time. In reality, habitable exoplanets are expected to contain atmospheric and surface heterogeneities similar to Earth, with diurnal rotation, seasonal changes, and weather patterns resulting in complex, time-dependent signatures. Due to its ability to measure light as a vector, polarimetry provides an important tool that will enhance the characterizations of heterogeneous worlds. Here we model the visible to near-infrared linear spectropolarimetric signatures, as functions of wavelength and planetary phase angle, of various heterogeneous Earth scenarios as well as the first signals of an early wet and potentially habitable Mars. The contributions from the different atmospheric and surface properties result in asymmetric phase curves and variable spectra, with the polarization appearing to be more sensitive than flux to heterogeneities such as patchy clouds and continents moving into and out-of-view. Our models provide important predictions of expected polarized and unpolarized signatures of heterogeneous exoplanets that will help guide the designs and observing plans of future polarimeters, including those proposed for the upcoming Habitable Worlds Observatory.

 - **Abstract**
 ServiMon is a scalable data collection and auditing pipeline designed for service-oriented, cost-efficient quality control in distributed environments, including the CTAO monitoring, logging, and alarm subsystems. Developed within a Docker-based architecture, it leverages cloud-native technologies and distributed computing principles to enhance system observability and reliability. At its core, ServiMon integrates key technologies such as Prometheus, Grafana, Kafka, and Cassandra. Prometheus serves as the primary engine for real-time performance metric collection, enabling efficient monitoring across multiple nodes. Grafana provides interactive, service-oriented data visualization, facilitating system performance analysis. Additionally, Kafka and Cassandra expose system metrics via the JMX Exporter, offering critical insights into infrastructure availability and performance. This contribution exposes how ServiMon could provide an enhancement on scalability, security, and efficiency in a distributed computing environment, such as the CTAO monitoring, logging, and alarm subsystems. This integrated approach not only ensures robust real-time monitoring, but also optimizes operational costs. Furthermore, ServiMon's ability to generate large volumes of diverse data over time provides a strong foundation for predictive maintenance. By incorporating stochastic and approximate computing techniques, it enables proactive failure detection and system optimization, minimizing downtime and maximizing telescope availability.

 - **Abstract**
 To study and monitor the Sun and its atmosphere, various space missions have been launched in the past decades. With the rapid improvement in technology and different mission requirements, the data products are subject to constant change. However, for long-term studies such as solar variability or multi-instrument investigations, uniform data series are required. In this study, we build on and expand the Instrument-to-Instrument translation (ITI) framework, which provides unpaired image translations. We apply the tool to data from the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI), specifically the Full Sun Imager (FSI) on Solar Orbiter (SolO) and the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). This approach allows us to create a homogeneous data set that combines the two extreme ultraviolet (EUV) imagers. We demonstrate that ITI is able to provide image calibration between SolO and SDO EUV imagers, independent of the varying orbital position of SolO. The comparison of the intercalibrated light curves derived from EUI and AIA shows that ITI can provide uniform data series that outperform a standard baseline calibration. We evaluate the perceptual similarity in terms of the Fréchet Inception Distance (FID), which demonstrates that ITI achieves a significant improvement of perceptual similarity between EUI and AIA. The study provides intercalibrated observations from SolO/EUI/FSI with SDO/AIA, enabling a homogeneous data set suitable for solar cycle studies and multi viewpoint investigations.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the evolution of primordial cosmological perturbations in a vacuum decay model where de Sitter space transitions to radiation domination through quantum-thermal decay processes. Unlike standard inflation, this framework generates curvature perturbations through stochastic noise from vacuum decay rather than quantum fluctuations of an inflaton field. We derive the stochastic differential equation governing the curvature perturbation $\mathcal{R}(t)$ and show that any horizon crossing is brief and does not constitute the primary mechanism for perturbation generation. Scale dependence emerges from spatial correlations in the noise rather than horizon crossing dynamics. The model naturally addresses the horizon and flatness problems through initial thermal equilibrium in de Sitter space and predicts zero tensor-to-scalar ratio. We demonstrate that spatially correlated noise can generate observationally viable spectral tilts while maintaining Gaussian statistics.

          First Array-Wide Search for Diffuse UHE Neutrinos with the Askaryan Radio Array

 - **Abstract**
 The Askaryan Radio Array (ARA) is an ultrahigh energy (UHE) neutrino detector at the South Pole, designed to search for radio pulses emitted by neutrino-initiated particle showers in ice. ARA consists of an array of five autonomous stations with 2 km spacing. Each station consists of 16 radio antennas embedded ${\sim}200$ m deep in the ice that are sensitive to either vertically- or horizontally-polarized signals. Radio arrays like ARA represent a cost-efficient means of achieving the enormous detection $O(10~\text{km}^3)$ volumes necessary for UHE neutrino detection. This contribution presents the current status of the first-ever array-wide search for UHE neutrinos, leveraging ARA's unprecedented ${\sim}28$ station-years of livetime. This search will have the best sensitivity of any neutrino detector above $3$ EeV, sufficient to probe the $220$ PeV flux inferred from KM3NeT's observation of KM3-230213A. Importantly, this study demonstrates the feasibility of array-wide neutrino searches, which are necessary for next-generation detectors, like RNO-G (35 stations planned) and IceCube-Gen2 Radio (361 stations proposed), to achieve their design sensitivity. We discuss the progress towards a fully analyzed sample and improvements to ARA's detector characterization and analysis sensitivity.

 - **Abstract**
 The Askaryan Radio Array (ARA) is a five-station, in-ice radio detector located at the South Pole searching for particle cascades from cosmogenic and astrophysical neutrinos with $\geq10^{17}$ eV of energy. Cascades in this energy regime emit radio-wavelength Askaryan radiation that can be observed by one or more ARA stations. With the recent KM3Net observation of an approximately $220$ PeV neutrino, there is renewed, urgent interest in further unlocking the ultra-high energy neutrino sky. We present updated calculations of ARA's array-wide effective volume, sensitivity, and expected event rates for ultra-high energy neutrino-induced cascades. Notably, results now account for the contributions of secondary particles from neutrino interactions (such as muon tracks) and multi-station detections within a detailed detector simulation framework. Previous work has shown these secondary interactions and multi-station coincidences compose 25\% and 8\% of the detector's effective area, respectively. We intend to extend these results towards a novel analysis that estimates the degree to which secondary cascades and multi-station observations are detectable in a real neutrino search. This will inform future UHE neutrino searches as it will characterize the feasibility of detecting such events.

          Constraining the Mass Loss and the Kinetic Energy of Solar Coronal Mass with Far-Ultraviolet Flares

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar eruptive events, such as flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs), can affect planetary habitability by disturbing the stability of their atmospheres. For instance, strong stellar flares and CMEs can trigger atmospheric escape and, in extreme cases, may strip away the atmosphere completely. While stellar flares have been observed and explored at a wide range of wavelengths, the physical properties of stellar CMEs remain unconstrained due to the difficulty in observing them. In this context, the Sun provides our only window on the potential characteristics of CMEs on Sun-like stars. A correlation between solar X-ray flare peak flux and the mass of flare-associated solar CMEs has been reported using solar data collected during Solar Cycle 23 (1996-2006) (Aarnio et al. 2011). Here, we build upon that work. We extend the correlation into the far-UV (FUV), where stellar flares are and will be routinely detected with existing and future FUV observatories by incorporating data spanning two entire Solar Cycles (23 and 24; 1996-2019). Using three different space missions (CMEs from LASCO/SOHO, X-ray flare events from XRS/GOES, and FUV flares from AIA/SDO), we report a correlation between FUV flare peak flux and energy centered at 1600Å and mass, kinetic energy, and linear speed of flare-associated CMEs. These empirical relations enable estimates of CME masses and kinetic energies from FUV flares on Sun-like stars. While direct stellar-CME detections remain elusive, the correlations derived here are likely applicable to Sun-like stars and provide a working framework for evaluating exoplanet atmospheric erosion.

          A New Subclass of Carbon-Enhanced Metal-Poor Stars at Extremely Low Metallicity

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of a new subclass of carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars, characterized by high absolute carbon abundances (A(C) > 7.39) and extremely low metallicity ([Fe/H] $<=$ -3.1) but notably lacking enhancements in neutron-capture elements, thus falling under the CEMP-no category. This population emerged from a detailed analysis of low-resolution spectroscopic data obtained from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST), where the observed frequency trends with the decreasing metallicity of CEMP-s (s-process-enhanced) and CEMP-no (no neutron-capture enhanced) stars deviated from established expectations. In contrast to earlier findings, we observe a rise in high-A(C) stars below [Fe/H] = -3.1, which we interpret as a distinct group not accounted for in traditional CEMP classifications. Following the Yoon-Beers group classification, we define these stars as Group IV. Statistical modeling confirms their presence as a separate peak in the A(C) distribution, and available radial velocity data suggest that about 30% of Group IV stars may be binaries, indicating possible binary-related formation mechanisms. This discovery challenges the current CEMP-no star formation pathways and implies the existence of alternative or hybrid enrichment scenarios in the early Universe. High-resolution spectroscopic follow-up of Group IV candidates will be crucial for identifying their progenitors and understanding their evolutionary implications.

          Light curves of time-dependent accretion disk in tidal disruption events

 - **Abstract**
 Tidal disruption events (TDEs) are believed to be an ideal laboratory for studying the evolution of accretion flow around a supermassive black hole (BH). In general, the mass feeding rate to the BH is suggested to be super-Eddington initially, and evolves to be sub-Eddington on timescale of years. In this paper, we carry out calculations of the time-dependent evolution of accretion disk in the standard environment of TDE, i.e., injecting matter at the circularization radius of the stellar debris in the form of $\dot M_{\rm inject} \propto t^{-5/3}$. One of the main findings is that when $\dot M_{\rm inject}$ evolves to a value around the Eddington accretion rate, the radiation pressure instability occurs. We test the influence of the model parameters on the light curves, such as the BH mass $M_{\rm BH}$, viscosity parameter $\alpha$, and mass-injecting radius $R_{\rm{out}}$, all of which are found to affect the light curves to some extent. In most cases, we find that the light curves oscillate significantly due to the radiation pressure instability. As an exception, when $\alpha$ is small or $R_{\rm{out}}$ is large, we find that the oscillations are completely suppressed. In this case, the light curve drops steeply and then becomes flat in the late-time evolution, which is applied to explaining the observed ultraviolet (UV) light curves of ASASSN-15oi and ASASSN-14ae together with the assumption of a photosphere. Finally, we discuss the potential applications of our time-dependent accretion disk model to explaining multi-band light curves of TDEs in the future.

 - **Abstract**
 We present GDCluster, a fully automated algorithm for decomposing spectral-line datacube of interstellar gas into coherent structures. Assuming a multi-Gaussian nature of observed spectra, GDCluster employs and augments the derivative spectroscopy technique for precise parameter estimation, incorporates spatial-continuity constraints during spectral fitting, and extends these constraints to spatial clustering. This approach effectively resolves velocity blending structures in PPV space-particularly critical for ubiquitous HI spectra where emissions from multiple phases are severely blended. Applied to the all-sky HI4PI data, a 10 degree times 10 degree CRAFTS survey region, and a 45 degree times 10 degree MWISP survey region, GDCluster extracts 45,299, 2247, and 47,119 structures in HI and CO (1-0), respectively. Comparative analyses demonstrate GDCluster's superiority over DBSCAN in separating overlapping spectra with complex velocity components.

 - **Abstract**
 \omega}Centauri ({\omega}Cen) is the most enigmatic Galactic globular cluster (GC), with unmatched chemical complexity. We combine photometric and spectroscopic catalogs to identify its distinct stellar populations and to investigate their spatial distribution and chemical properties, uncovering new insights into the cluster's formation history. We identify the iron-poor stars commonly found in GCs: the first population (1P), with halo-like chemical composition, and the second population (2P), enriched in elements produced by p-capture processes. Similarly, we divided the iron-rich stars (the anomalous stars) into two groups: the AI and the AII, exhibiting light-element abundance distributions similar to 1P and 2P stars, respectively. The wide extension of our dataset (five times the half-light radius) allowed us to directly and unambiguously compare the fraction of these populations at different radii. We find that 2P and AII stars are more centrally concentrated than the 1P and AI. The remarkable similarities between the 1P-2P and AI-AII radial distributions strongly suggest that these two groups of stars originated from similar mechanisms. Our chemical analysis indicates that the 1P and AI stars (the lower stream) developed their inhomogeneities through core-collapse supernova (and possibly other massive stars') self-enrichment, and that these populations contributed p-capture-processed material to the intracluster medium, from which the chemically extreme 2P and AII stars (the upper stream) formed. Additional polluters, such as intermediate-mass asymptotic giant branch stars and Type Ia supernovae, likely played a role in shaping the AII. Finally, we propose that 2P and AII stars with intermediate light-element abundances (the middle stream) formed via dilution between the pure ejecta that created the upper stream and lower-stream material.

 - **Abstract**
 The source count dipole from wide-area radio continuum surveys allows us to test the cosmological standard model. Many radio sources have multiple components, which can cause an overdispersion of the source counts distribution. We account for this effect via a new Bayesian estimator, based on the negative binomial distribution. Combining the two best understood wide-area surveys, NVSS and RACS-low, and the deepest wide-area survey, LoTSS-DR2, we find that the source count dipole exceeds its expected value as the kinematic dipole amplitude from standard cosmology by a factor of $3.67 \pm 0.49$ -- a $5.4\sigma$ discrepancy.

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze the inner debris disk around $\epsilon$ Eridani using simulated observations with the Cool-Planet Imaging Coronagraph (CPI-C). Using the radiative transfer code MCFOST, we generate synthetic scattered-light images and spectral energy distributions for three disk models that differ in inclination and radial extent, and compare these results with the anticipated performance of CPI-C. CPI-C can resolve disk structures down to $\sim$3 au, offering substantially finer spatial resolution than existing HST/STIS and Spitzer/IRS observations. Recovered inclinations and radial extents closely match the input models, constraining the disk geometry and informing potential planet-disk interactions in the $\epsilon$ Eri system. Although the cold Jupiter-like planet $\epsilon$ Eri b is not detected in our simulations, polarimetric methods may enable detection of its reflected light. These results highlight the capability of next-generation coronagraphs to probe cold dust in nearby planetary systems.

 - **Abstract**
 Astronomers are debating whether the plentiful "sub-Neptune" exoplanets -- worlds a bit larger than Earth but smaller than Neptune -- are predominantly rocky planets, water-rich "ocean worlds," or gas-enshrouded mini-Neptunes. This question is crucial because such sub-Neptune-sized planets are among the most common in our galaxy, yet we have no analog in our own solar system, making them a key to understanding planet formation and diversity. It also directly impacts the search for habitable worlds: larger-than-Earth planets with solid surfaces or oceans could support life, whereas gas-rich mini-Neptunes likely cannot. However, distinguishing these types using only a planet's mass and radius is very challenging, because different compositions can produce similar densities, leaving a world's nature ambiguous with current data. The proposed Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), a future NASA flagship telescope, offers a solution. HWO could directly image and spectroscopically analyze starlight reflected from 50~100 sub-Neptunes around nearby stars, aiming to reveal their atmospheric compositions and potential surfaces. Using visible and near-infrared spectroscopy along with sensitive polarimetry, HWO would detect atmospheric gases (such as water vapor, methane, and carbon dioxide) and search for telltale surface signatures, including rock absorption features and the characteristic reflectivity patterns of oceans. By analyzing these signals, we could determine whether sub-Neptunes are large rocky planets or water worlds rather than gas-dominated mini-Neptunes. Crucially, expanding the search beyond Earth-sized planets to include these abundant sub-Neptunes may uncover entirely new classes of potentially habitable worlds, directly advancing HWO's mission to identify and characterize planets that could support life.

 - **Abstract**
 Multiple populations, defined by correlations between light element abundances, are an almost ubiquitous property of globular clusters. On the other hand, dispersions among the heavy elements are limited to a few rare clusters. In this letter, we present Mg, Y, Ba, La, and Eu measurements for 89 stars in M15 with errors < 0.4 dex from Keck/DEIMOS medium-resolution spectra. We find higher Ba, La, and Eu dispersions in the first generation of stars than in the second generation at a significance of $\ge$2 $\sigma$. This is evidence for inhomogeneous mixing of gas during the formation of the first generation of stars, which subsequently became well-mixed prior to the formation of the second generation of stars. If the r-process event that caused the abundance dispersions was born with the first population of stars, it must be an r-process site with a short delay time.

 - **Abstract**
 This study refines the Greisen formalism by comparing the classical Greisen profile and a modified Greisen profile, which incorporates an empirical correction to the shower age parameter with zenith-angle dependence, aiming to better describe low-energy cascades against CORSIKA simulations of cosmic gamma-ray showers (20-800 GeV). Fittings across altitudes of 5000-5900 m and zenith angles from 0 to 40 degrees quantify deviations in particle numbers, showing that the modified profile yields deviations below 4.7%, compared to up to 12.5% for the classical profile. These improvements address low-energy ionization losses, atmospheric density variations, and zenith-angle effects, enhancing accuracy for high-altitude observatories like HAWC and the proposed CONDOR array. The modified profile offers a computationally efficient alternative, providing precise particle number predictions to advance gamma-ray astrophysics and cosmic-ray research.

 - **Abstract**
 We report deep long-slit spectroscopy of two Galactic compact planetary nebulae (PNe), PNG048.5+04.2 and PNG068.7+14.8, obtained using the 10.4m Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC). These spectra cover a broad wavelength range of ~3630-10370 A, enabling detection of numerous emission lines critical for nebular analysis, including [O II] 3727 and [O III] 4363 in the blue and [S III] 6312,9069 in the red. Also detected in the spectrum of PNG068.7+14.8 are broad C III and C IV lines probably due to stellar emission, indicating that the central star of this PN is [WC]-type. These GTC optical-IR spectra were analyzed in details in conjunction with the archival Spitzer/IRS mid-IR spectra, and elemental abundances of the two PNe determined. Photoionization models were established for the two PNe using CLOUDY, based on the ratios of line fluxes measured from the GTC optical-NIR spectra. Our best photoionization modeling, in combination with state-of-the-art post-AGB evolutionary model tracks, shows that both PNe evolved from low-mass progenitors (<2 M_sun) with relatively young ages (<3 Gyr), although their central cores are probably in different evolutionary stages - the central star of PNG068.7+14.8 is still in the process of heating up, while that of PNG048.5+04.2 has already entered the white dwarf cooling track. A comparison with AGB model predictions also constrains the progenitors of both PNe to be of low masses. Moreover, the two PNe are in line with the radial oxygen gradients exhibited by the Galactic PN populations, using the most up-to-date distances.

          The Impact of ${}^{12} \mathrm{C}(α, γ)^{16} \mathrm{O}$ Reaction on the Evolution of He Stars

 - **Abstract**
 The ${}^{12} \mathrm{C}(\alpha, \gamma)^{16} \mathrm{O}$ reaction is one of the most important reactions in the evolution of massive stars, yet its rate is still highly uncertain. In this work, we investigated how variations in the ${}^{12} \mathrm{C}(\alpha, \gamma)^{16} \mathrm{O}$ reaction rate affect the evolution of a 14 $\rm M_{\odot}$ He star using the MESA code. Our simulations indicate that the ${}^{12} \mathrm{C}(\alpha, \gamma)^{16} \mathrm{O}$ reaction rate determines the conditions for C burning, affecting its explodability. As the reaction rate increases, central C-burning becomes neutrino-dominated, transitioning from the convective to the radiative regime. This leads to higher compactness and a larger iron core, indicating a more compact pre-SN core structure that is difficult to explode. Conversely, lower reaction rates shorten the C-burning lifetime and trigger earlier central Ne ignition, which counteracts core contraction. This results in reduced compactness and iron core mass. We also found that variations in reaction rates shift the location of the last C-burning shell. When this shell exceeds the mass coordinate used for compactness evaluation, the overall compactness increases significantly. Although the Si- and O-burning convective shells decrease compactness, the overall increase remains unaffected. This work suggests that the ${}^{12} \mathrm{C}(\alpha, \gamma)^{16} \mathrm{O}$ reaction play an important role in the pre-SN core structure and potentially impact the explodability of massive He stars.

          Clues on the X-ray emission mechanism of blazars PKS 2155$-$304 and 3C 454.3 through polarization studies

 - **Abstract**
 X-ray polarization measurable with the imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (\textit{IXPE}) could constrain the long-debated leptonic versus hadronic origin of the high-energy component in the broadband spectral energy distribution (SED) of blazars. We report \textit{IXPE} results and SED modeling of PKS 2155$-$304 and 3C 454.3, a high- and low-synchrotron-peaked blazar. For PKS 2155$-$304, model-independent analysis gives polarization angle $\Psi_X$ = (130$\pm$2.5) deg and polarization degree $\Pi_X$ = (20.9$\pm$1.8)\% in the 2$-$8 keV band, in agreement with spectro-polarimetric analysis. We found $\Pi_X$ varies with time and shows indications of energy dependence, suggesting stratified emission regions. For 3C 454.3, no X-ray polarization is detected in the June 2023 observation, analyzed here for the first time. The detection in PKS 2155$-$304 and non-detection in 3C 454.3 are consistent with X-ray emission from synchrotron and inverse Compton processes, respectively. Dividing the dataset into finer time bins allows a more granular view of polarization variability. We modeled the broadband SEDs using quasi-simultaneous optical, UV, and X-ray data from {\it Swift}, {\it AstroSat}, and $\gamma$-rays from {\it Fermi}. In PKS 2155$-$304, X-rays lie in the high-energy tail of the synchrotron component, while in 3C 454.3 they lie in the rising part of the inverse Compton component. Our SED modeling with X-ray polarization favors a leptonic scenario for PKS 2155$-$304. These results support a structured jet model where X-ray emission originates from a compact acceleration zone near the shock front, while lower-energy optical emission comes from a broader turbulent region.

 - **Abstract**
 The interaction of carbon atoms with solid carbon monoxide (CO) is a fundamental process in astrochemistry, influencing the formation of complex organic molecules in interstellar environments. This study investigates the adsorption and reaction mechanisms of carbon atoms on solid CO under cryogenic conditions, employing a combination of experimental techniques, including photostimulated desorption and resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization (PSD-REMPI) and infrared spectroscopy, alongside quantum chemical calculations. The results reveal the formation of oxygenated carbon chains, such as CCO, C$_3$O$_2$, and C$_5$O$_2$, as well as CO$_2$. The findings highlight the role of chemisorption and subsequent reactions in driving molecular complexity on solid CO, with implications for the chemical evolution of interstellar ices and the potential formation of prebiotic molecules.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of a new short-period pre-main-sequence eclipsing binary, RX Gru, orbited by a distant circumbinary companion. We characterized the system by analysing the photometric observations from the Solaris network, the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, and the Super Wide Angle Search for Planets survey, combined with the radial velocities from four high-resolution spectrographs: HARPS, FEROS, CHIRON, and HRS. We derived the parameters of the eclipsing components, which are $M_{\rm Aa} = 1.004^{+0.027}_{-0.026}\,$M$_\odot$, $R_{\rm Aa} = 1.007\pm0.021\,$R$_\odot$, and $T_{\rm eff,Aa} = 5379\pm289\,$K for the primary, and $M_{\rm Ab} = 0.985^{+0.024}_{-0.025}\,$M$_\odot$, $R_{\rm Ab} = 1.024\pm0.023\,$R$_\odot$, and $T_{\rm eff,Ab} = 5322\pm278\,$K for the secondary. We determined the age of the system from the observed parameters using two evolution codes, MESA and Cesam2k20. We obtained an age of $\sim$28$\,$Myr, placing the two stars at the very end of the pre-main-sequence phase. We also derived the minimum mass and orbital period of the tertiary companion, which are found to be $M_{\rm B} = 89.0\pm3.5\,$M$_{\rm Jup}$ and $P_{\rm AB} = 23.79 ^{+0.10 }_{-0.25}\,$yr, respectively. We conclude that RX Gru consists of a tight inner binary composed of two twin components and an outer low-mass companion (a massive brown dwarf or a very low-mass star) in a relatively wide orbit, and we suggest that the system was formed via the dynamical unfolding mechanism coupled with the shared accretion of the circumbinary material by the binary components.

 - **Abstract**
 Hot subdwarfs with close low-mass M-type or brown dwarf companions usually show the reflection effect and often also eclipses. Through inspecting the light variations, we estimate the fractions of reflection effect systems detected in different subclasses of hot subdwarfs and constrain their possible formation channels. We noticed that none of the helium-rich hot subdwarfs were found with the reflection effect. Most of them might form through the merger channel. About 13\% of the He-poor hot subdwarfs on the extreme horizontal branch (EHB) with $T_{\rm eff}$ $\sim$ 25,000 -- 33,000 K are discovered with the reflection effect. Nevertheless, the cooler hot subdwarfs located on the top of the EHB, those grouped on the bottom of the EHB, and those located above the EHB with $T_{\rm eff}$ $\sim$ 45,000 -- 75,000 K exhibit lower fractions of reflection effect systems of about 2\%. These three subclasses of hot subdwarfs might contain higher fractions of single stars. Hot subdwarfs below the EHB also show a low fraction of reflection effect systems. They might have a higher fraction of stars with close WD companions. A similar fraction of reflection effect systems to those on the EHB with $T_{\rm eff}$ $\sim$ 25,000 -- 33,000 K is found in hot subdwarfs located above the EHB with $T_{\rm eff}$ $\sim$ 35,000 -- 45,000 K. We also discovered that hot subdwarfs close to the Galactic Plane might have a higher fraction of stars with the reflection effect than those at higher latitudes.

          Bayesian Framework for the E1 and E2 Astrophysical Factors at 300 keV from Subthreshold and Ground-State Asymptotic Normalization Coefficients

 - **Abstract**
 The $^{12}\mathrm{C}(\alpha,\gamma)^{16}\mathrm{O}$ reaction governs the carbon-to-oxygen ratio set during helium burning, shaping white-dwarf structure and Type~Ia supernova yields. At the astrophysical energy $E \approx 300~\mathrm{keV}$, the cross section is controlled by the subthreshold $1^{-}$ (7.12~MeV) and $2^{+}$ (6.92~MeV) states, whose contributions depend on their asymptotic normalization coefficients (ANCs) $C_{1}$ and $C_{2}$, respectively. We perform a Bayesian analysis of the $S_{E1}(300~\mathrm{keV})$ and $S_{E2}(300~\mathrm{keV})$ factors using calibrated $R$-matrix mappings and experimental ANC constraints for the $1^{-}$, $2^{+}$, and $0^{+}$ ground state. For $S_{E1}(300~\mathrm{keV})$, flat prior on the $1^{-}$ ANC lead to broad posterior with $68\%$ credible interval spanning $ [71.4,\,93.4]$~keV\,b, while Gaussian priors concentrate weight near the reported ANC values and yield narrower posteriors. For $S_{E2}(300~\mathrm{keV})$, the analysis includes the interference of the radiative transition through the subthreshold resonance with the direct capture to the ground-state, which depends on the ground-state ANC $C_{0}$, giving broad posterior with $68\%$ credible interval spanning $[30.7,\,50.5]$~keV\,b. The Gaussian priors centered near anchor values. The resulting posteriors quantify both correlations and uncertainties: despite incorporating the published ANC constraints, the $68\%$ intervals remain broad, showing that present ANC determinations do not yet reduce the astrophysical uncertainty. Overall, the Bayesian framework provides statistically robust posteriors for $S_{E1}(300~\mathrm{keV})$ and $S_{E2}(300~\mathrm{keV})$, improving the reliability of extrapolations for stellar modeling and nucleosynthesis.

 Transmission spectroscopy is an effective technique for probing exoplanetary atmospheres. While most observations have relied on space facilities such as HST and JWST, ground-based high-resolution transmission spectroscopy (HRTS) has also provided valuable insights by resolving individual atomic features. In this work, we present an initial performance assessment and feasibility test of the Hanle Echelle Spectrograph (HESP) on the 2 m Himalayan Chandra Telescope (HCT) for HRTS. As a benchmark, we observed the hot Jupiter HD 209458b during a single transit at a resolution of R = 30,000. We developed a Python-based, semi-automated data reduction and analysis pipeline that includes corrections for telluric contamination and stellar radial velocity shifts. The final achieved signal-to-noise ratio and spectral stability allow us to probe for features at the 0.1% level. This work establishes a methodology and demonstrates the operational capability of the HESP-HCT for obtaining high-resolution transmission spectra.

          Role of sunspot latitude versus tilt in determining the polar field and amplitude of the next cycle: Cause of the weak Solar Cycle 20

 - **Abstract**
 One prominent feature of solar cycle is its irregular variation in its cycle strength, making it challenging to predict the amplitude of the next cycle. Studies show that fluctuations and nonlinearity in generating poloidal field throughout the decay and dispersal of tilted sunspots produce variation in the solar cycle. The flux, latitudinal position, and tilt angle of sunspots are the primary parameters that determine the polar field and, thus, the next solar cycle strength. By analysing the observed sunspots and polar field proxy, we show that the nonlinearity in the poloidal field generation becomes important for strong cycles. Except for strong cycles, we can reasonably predict the polar field at the end of the cycle (and thus the next cycle strength) using the total sunspot area alone. Combining the mean tilt angle and latitude positions with the sunspot area, we can predict the polar field of Cycles 15 -- 24 (or the amplitude of sunspot Cycles 16-25) with reasonable accuracy except for Cycle 23 for which the average tilt angle cannot predict the polar field. For Cycles 15--22, we show that the average tilt angle variation dominates over the latitude variation in determining the polar field of a cycle. In particular, the reduction of tilt in Cycle 19 was the primary cause of the following weak cycle (Cycle 20). Thus, we conclude that tilt quenching is essential in regulating the solar cycle strength in the solar dynamo.

 - **Abstract**
 The geometry of a star's Alfvén surface determines stellar angular momentum loss, separates a causally distinct 'corona' and stellar wind, and potentially affects exoplanetary habitability. The solar Alfvén surface is the only such structure that is directly measurable and since 2021, has been routinely measured in situ by NASA's Parker Solar Probe (Parker). We use these unique measurements in concert with Solar Orbiter and L1 in situ data spanning the first half of the Solar Cycle 25 in time and from 0.045 - 1 au in heliocentric distance to develop a radial scaling technique to estimate the morphology of the Alfvén surface from measurements of the solar wind speed and local Alfvén speed. We show that accounting for solar wind acceleration and mass flux is necessary to achieve reasonable agreement between the scaled location of the Alfvén surface and the locations of direct crossings measured by Parker. We produce continuous 2D equatorial cuts of the Alfvén surface over half a Solar Cycle (ascending phase and maximum). Parker's earliest crossings clipped outward extrusions, many of which are likely transient related, while more recently Parker has unambiguously sampled deep sub-Alfvénic flows. We analyze the average altitude, departure from spherical symmetry, and surface roughness, finding that all are positively correlated to solar activity. For the current modest Solar Cycle, the height varies up to 30\% which corresponds to a near-doubling in angular momentum loss per unit mass loss.

 - **Abstract**
 High-energy cosmic rays are observed indirectly by detecting the extensive air showers initiated in Earth's atmosphere. The interpretation of experimental data relies on accurate modeling of the air shower development. Simulations based on current hadronic interaction models show significant discrepancies with measurements of the muon content in air showers, commonly referred to as the Muon Puzzle, indicating severe shortcomings in the understanding of particle physics. A hybrid detector design with a surface array and deep underground detector, such as the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, allows simultaneous measurements of muons at two vastly different energies: at GeV energies and above a few 100GeV. We present phenomenological studies of low-energy and high-energy muons in simulated air showers, and discuss how hybrid measurements can provide constraints on multi-particle production in hadronic interaction models.

 - **Abstract**
 Many potential direct imaging candidates suffer from large orbital period uncertainties, leading to challenges in accurate predictions of future orbital positions and imprecise direct imaging measurements of planetary parameters. To improve the precision in orbital properties, precursor radial velocity (RV) follow-up observations for selected candidates are essential. This study examines the impact of three variables on the orbital period uncertainties of long-period giant planets: the number of future observations, the temporal gap between past and future data, and the temporal coverage of upcoming observations. Our simulations indicate that the orbital phases at which future RV observations are acquired play a significant role in reducing period uncertainties. Additionally, observing too frequently within a given time frame adds limited value to the program once a certain number of observations has been achieved. The temporal gap proves to be the most important factor when there is no strict end time to the observing campaign. However, if a strict end time is set, starting observations earlier yields improved reductions in orbital period uncertainty. These insights offer practical guidance for planning efficient RV follow-up campaigns to maximize the science yield of future space-based direct imaging missions.

 - **Abstract**
 Between 40$\%$ and 80$\%$ of cataclysmic variables (CVs) are expected to have evolved past the period-minimum and contain a degenerate donor. However, observational surveys for CVs have only been able to detect a few of these highly evolved "period-bouncers", most likely due to the intrinsic faintness associated with their predicted low mass accretion rates. We have produced an initial selection of 137 high-likelihood period-bounce candidates from WD catalog based on our multiwavelength period-bouncer scorecard and selection cuts including X-ray data from the extended ROentgen Survey with an Imaging Telescope Array (eROSITA) on board the Spektrum-Roentgen-Gamma spacecraft (SRG). We have laid out three main requirements (classification as a CV, determination of an orbital period and detection of a very late-type donor) that should result in the confirmation of several of these candidates. Our path for confirming these candidates has already produced its first successful result with the confirmation of GALEX J125751.4-283015 as a new period-bouncer. Several other candidates have already fulfilled at least one of our three requirements making their future confirmation likely. Our search for period-bouncers using the X-ray eROSITA emission of objects in optical WD catalogs has led to the confirmation of six new period-bouncers identified from the Gaia DR3 WD catalog (five previously known CVs and one WD candidate), a 18$\%$ increase that brings the present population to 39 systems. Both the selection method for period-bounce candidates and the confirmation path that we outlined will aid in future searches for new period-bounce candidates, contributing to the goal of resolving the discrepancy between the predicted high number of period-bouncers and the low number of these systems successfully observed to date.

 - **Abstract**
 Ultra-short period (USP) exoplanets -- with $R_p \leq 2~$R$_{\oplus}$ and periods $\leq$1 day -- are expected to be stripped of volatile atmospheres by intense host star irradiation, which is corroborated by their nominal bulk densities and previous eclipse observations consistent with bare rock surfaces. However, a few USP planets appear anomalously under-dense relative to an Earth-like composition, suggesting an exotic interior structure (e.g., core-less) or a volatile-rich secondary atmosphere increasing their apparent radius. Here we present the first dayside emission spectrum of the low density (4.3$\pm$0.4 g~cm$^{-3}$) ultra-short period planet TOI-561 b, which orbits an iron-poor, alpha-rich, $\sim$10 Gyr old thick disk star. Our 3-5 $\mu$m JWST/NIRSpec observations demonstrate the dayside of TOI-561 b is inconsistent with a bare-rock surface at high statistical significance, suggesting instead a thick volatile envelope that is cooling the dayside to well below the $\sim$3000 K expected in the bare rock or thin atmosphere case. These results reject the popular hypothesis of complete atmospheric desiccation for highly irradiated exoplanets and support predictions that planetary-scale magma oceans can retain substantial reservoirs of volatiles, opening the geophysical study of ultra-hot super-Earths through the lens of their atmospheres.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents a low-noise amplifier (LNA) that was developed for a new radio telescope comprised of 512 parabolic dish antennas. The LNA closely interfaces to a custom-made antenna feed with an impedance co-designed to provide noise matching over a 5:1 bandwidth. Additionally, a method of broadband noise and power matching that allows the input impedance to be controlled independently from the optimum signal-source impedance to achieve minimum noise is also discussed. When measured in a 50-\Omega system, the LNA exhibits a return loss (RL) of > 8 dB between 0.32 to 1.5 GHz, S21 of 32 dB \pm 1.2 dB, IP1dB > -37 dBm, and IIP3 > -20 dBm. Noise parameter measurements show Tmin \approx 13 \pm 4K and noise temperatures T50{\Omega} \approx 18 \pm 6K between 0.5 to 1.4 GHz.

 In this contribution, we have investigated the energy spectra of the elemental mass groups of cosmic rays for the Light (H+He), medium (C+O) and heavy (Ne-Fe) components using the High Altitude Water Cherenkov Gamma-Ray observatory (HAWC). The study was carried out in the energy interval from $10$ TeV to $1$ PeV using almost $5$ years of data on hadronic air showers. The energy spectra were unfolded using the bidimensional distribution of the lateral shower age versus the reconstructed primary energy. We have employed the QGSJET-II-04 high-energy hadronic interaction model for the current analysis. The results show the presence of fine structure in the spectra of the light, medium and heavy mass groups of cosmic rays.

 - **Abstract**
 In the last two decades, different advances with extensive air shower (EAS) experiments have allowed to unveil several details about the composition and energy spectrum of galactic cosmic rays from some TeV up to several hundreds of PeV, which have led to improve our understanding of the physics of cosmic rays. EAS measurements above the knee, for instance, have helped to understand some aspects about the acceleration and propagation mechanisms of the PeV component of cosmic rays and have shown possible hints about the transition from the galactic to the extragalactic regime. Meanwhile, EAS data in the TeV energy range have revealed unexpected features in the all-particle and elemental spectra, which may indicate the presence of previously unknown cosmic-ray phenomena. In this contribution, I will present a brief account on these EAS results, with particular emphasis on the recent measurements of the all-particle energy spectrum and the elemental composition of cosmic rays from 10 TeV up to 1 EeV. In addition, I will compare the latest results of EAS experiments and direct detectors at energies just below the knee, where there exists an overlap between both detection techniques.

 - **Abstract**
 Atmospheric dispersion introduces wavelength-dependent effects that significantly impact ground-based observations, particularly in slit- and fibre-fed spectroscopic studies. These effects reduce the signal entering the spectrograph and introduce systematic errors in radial velocity measurements. To address this challenge, atmospheric dispersion correctors are utilised. However, many existing designs of these correctors, which are based on theoretical models, often lack practical validation and consistency. The forthcoming National Large Optical Telescope (NLOT) will be installed at Hanle, a site known for its favourable astronomical sky conditions. Thus, the design of an effective dispersion corrector for the instruments on the NLOT, specifically one that compensates for the measured dispersion, is crucial. For the first time, we have directly measured atmospheric dispersion at the Hanle site using the Himalayan Faint Object Spectrograph mounted on the Himalayan Chandra Telescope. In this study, we present our methodology, the dispersion measurements obtained within the 400 to 700 nm wavelength range, and a comparison with modelled dispersion values.

 - **Abstract**
 (Abridged) The present-day spatial and kinematic distribution of stars in the Milky Way provides key constraints on its internal dynamics and evolutionary history. We select stars that are more metal-rich than the interstellar medium (ISM) at their guiding radius (the so-called Local Metal-Rich stars, LMR) and investigate their chemo-kinematics. Until recently, existing catalogues did not contain such targets in large quantities, but one can now select many millions of them by using Gaia photometric metallicities. Once selected, we investigate their kinematics and age distributions across the disc, and compare them to the stellar populations having the metallicity of the ISM. Compared to locally born stars with [M/H]=[M/H]_ISM, we find that LMR stars, at a given location, are always older (mean age up to 2 Gyr older) and with velocity dispersions similar or slightly higher. Furthermore, at a given [M/H], LMR stars are older at larger galactocentric radiii, reflecting the fact that they need time to migrate. Finally, whereas we do not find any correlation between the location of the spiral arms and the spatial density of LMR stars, we find that the mean stellar eccentricity and mean ages show smaller values where the spiral arms are. Our results confirm a well established theoretical result that has not yet been formally confirmed via observations on large datasets without modelling: churning is not significantly heating the Galactic disc. Furthermore, the age distribution of these stars rule-out any significant contribution from Galactic fountains as their origin, and confirm the effect of the spiral arms on them.

          Probing dust and grain growth in the optically thick circumbinary ring of V892 Tau

 - **Abstract**
 A considerable proportion of young stars belong to multiple star systems. Constraining the planet formation processes in multiple stellar systems is then key to understand the global exoplanet population. This study focuses on investigating the dust reservoir within the triple system V892 Tau. Our objective is to establish constraints on the properties and characteristics of the dust present in the system's circumbinary ring. Based on archival ALMA and VLA data from 0.9 mm to 9.8 mm, we present a multi-wavelength analysis of the ring of V892 Tau. We first studied the spatial variation of the spectral index, before employing 3D full radiative transfer calculations to constrain the ring's geometry and the radial dependence of the dust grain properties. Spectral indices are consistent with non-dust emission in the vicinity of the central binary, and with dust emission in the ring likely remaining optically thick up to 3.0 mm. Our radiative transfer analysis supports these interpretations, yielding a model that reproduces the observed intensities within the 1-sigma uncertainties across all wavelengths. The resulting dust surface density and temperature profiles both decrease with increasing radius, and are in agreement with values reported in the literature. Maximum grain sizes are constrained to 0.2 cm, with a size distribution power-law index -3.5. These results imply that the dust grain fragmentation velocity does not exceed 8 m/s. Whilst our results suggest dust trapping at the cavity edge, they also suggest that tidal perturbations triggered by the central binary limit grain growth within the ring. This highlights the need to further constrain planet formation efficiency in multiple stellar systems, a goal that may be advanced by applying the methodology of this work to a wider sample of systems.

          Expect the unexpected: augmented mixture models for black hole population studies

 - **Abstract**
 Black hole population studies are currently performed either using astrophysically motivated models (informed but rigid in their functional forms) or via non-parametric methods (flexible but not directly interpretable). In this paper, we present a statistical framework to complement the predictive power of astrophysically motivated models with the flexibility of non-parametric methods. Our method makes use of the Dirichlet distribution to robustly infer the relative weights of different models as well as of the Gibbs sampling approach to efficiently explore the parameter space. After having validated our approach using simulated data, we apply this method to the BBH mergers observed during the first three Observing Runs of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration using both phenomenological and astrophysical models as parametric models, finding results in agreement with the currently available literature.

 - **Abstract**
 The $\Lambda$ cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) cosmological model provides a good description of a wide range of astrophysical and cosmological observations. However, severe challenges to the phenomenological $\Lambda$CDM model have emerged recently, including the Hubble constant tension and the significant deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM model reported by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration. Despite many explanations for the two challenges have been proposed, the origins of them are still intriguing mysteries. Here, we investigate the DESI Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAOs) measurements to interpret the Hubble constant tension. Employing a non-parametric method, we find that the dark energy equation of state $w(z)$ evolves with redshift from DESI BAO data and type Ia supernovae. From the Friedmann equations, the Hubble constant ($H_0$) is derived from $w(z)$ model-independently. We find that the values of $H_0$ show a descending trend as a function of redshift, and can effectively resolve the Hubble constant tension. Our study finds that the two unexpected challenges to the $\Lambda$CDM model can be understood in one physical framework, e.g., dynamical dark energy.

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) afterglows are rapidly decaying signals that pose significant detection challenges, requiring improved methods to track their temporal evolution. In this study, we systematically compare various techniques for detecting GRB-like transient emissions at very high energies (VHE, >100 GeV). Our analysis includes time-dependent extension of the standard method (i.e., Li & Ma 1983) and other previously developed methods in the literature, alongside a novel likelihood-based approach, which directly fits spectral and temporal decay features to IACT data. Through dedicated observation simulations, we evaluate the performance of these methods for the Large-Sized Telescope prototype (LST-1) of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO). We characterised the enhanced sensitivity found in some of these methods compared to the standard significance estimation. For GRBs simulated with very fast afterglow decay, an improvement of more than a factor of two is seen in detections for some of the methods presented here, compared to the standard Li&Ma approach.

 - **Abstract**
 Analysis of radio emission from tidal disruption events allows for detailed constraints on the properties of ejected outflows and the host environment surrounding the black hole. However, the late-time radio behaviour of tidal disruption events is not well-studied due to a lack of observations. In this work we present long-term radio monitoring observations of the tidal disruption event AT2019azh spanning 1167-2159 days post disruption. We fit a physically motivated synchrotron model to the radio spectra at each epoch, and model the decay of the light curve under the assumption that the outflow transitions into the non-relativistic Sedov-Taylor regime at late times. Through this modelling we obtain strong constraints on the density profile of the circumnuclear medium, finding an unusually flat density profile proportional to $r^{0.24^{+0.11}_{-0.15}}$. Overall we find that unlike some tidal disruption events, AT2019azh does not show late time re-brightening up to 6 years post-disruption. The Sedov-Taylor light curve decay model provides a good fit to the data, motivating the assumption that the outflow was produced by a single ejection of material close to the time of stellar disruption. From forward modelling the evolution of the radio light curve decay we predict that the radio afterglow from AT2019azh should be detectable for decades at its current rate of evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Kaniadakis Holographic Dark Energy is a one-parameter extension of the standard HDE framework, in which the horizon entropy is reformulated using Kaniadakis entropy. At the cosmological level, it has been shown to give rise to modified Friedmann equations, leading to a richer phenomenology compared to $\Lambda$CDM. In this work we test the Kanadiakis holography model against multiple late-time observational probes, including Type Ia supernovae from PantheonPlus and Union3, Cosmic Chronometer measurements of the Hubble parameter and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Data Release 2 (DESI DR2). Using a Bayesian inference approach with MCMC methods, we constrain the cosmological parameters of the model and evaluate its performance against $\Lambda$CDM through the Akaike Information Criterion. We find that Kaniadakis holography can provide a better fit for some data combinations, although $\Lambda$CDM remains slightly statistically favored overall. These results highlight Kaniadakis holography as a competitive alternative to the standard cosmological model, offering valuable insights into the role of generalized entropy in dark energy dynamics.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a multiphase, resolved study of the galactic wind extending from the nearby starburst galaxy NGC 4666. For this we use VLT/MUSE observations from the GECKOS program and HI data from the WALLABY survey. We identify both ionised and HI gas in a biconical structure extending to at least $z\sim$8 kpc from the galaxy disk, with increasing velocity offsets above the midplane in both phases, consistent with a multiphase wind. The measured electron density, using [SII], differs significantly from standard expectations of galactic winds. We find electron density declines from the galaxy centre to $\sim2$ kpc, then rises again, remaining high ($\sim100-300$ cm$^{-3}$) out to $\sim$5 kpc. We find that HI dominates the mass loading. The total HI mass outflow rate (above $z~>2$ kpc) is between $5-13~M_{\odot}~\rm yr^{-1}$, accounting for uncertainties from disk-blurring and group interactions. The total ionised mass outflow rate (traced by H$\alpha$) is between $0.5~M_{\odot}~\rm yr^{-1}$ and $5~M_{\odot}~\rm yr^{-1}$, depending on $n_e(z)$ assumptions. From ALMA/ACA observations, we place an upper-limit on CO flux in the outflow which correlates to $\lesssim2.9~M_{\odot}~\rm yr^{-1}$. We also show that the entire outflow is not limited to the bicone, but a secondary starburst at the edge generates a more widespread outflow, which should be included in simulations. The cool gas in NGC 4666 wind has insufficient velocity to escape the halo of a galaxy of its mass, especially because most of the mass is present in the slower atomic phase. This strong biconical wind contributes to gas cycling around the galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 Ultra-high-energy (UHE) neutrinos are unique cosmic messengers that can traverse cosmological distances unattenuated, offering direct insight into the most energetic processes in the universe. Radio detection promises significant advantages for detecting highly inclined air showers induced by UHE neutrinos, including a larger exposure range compared to particle detectors, which is due to minimal atmospheric attenuation of radio signals combined with good reconstruction precision. Furthermore, this technique improves the air shower longitudinal reconstruction, which can be used to identify neutrinos with their first interaction far below the top of the atmosphere. In this work, we present a method for identifying UHE neutrinos using radio antennas deployed in ground-based observatories. We introduce a reconstruction algorithm based on the radio emission maximum ($X^{\text{radio}}_{\text{max}}$) and demonstrate its power in distinguishing deeply developing neutrino-induced showers from background cosmic rays. Using the Pierre Auger Observatory as a case study, we use the simulations of $\nu_e$-CC-induced air showers and evaluate the trigger efficiency, reconstruction performance, and resulting effective area. Our results show that radio detection significantly enhances the sensitivity to very inclined showers above 1~EeV, complementing traditional surface detectors. This technique is highly scalable and applicable to future radio observatories such as GRAND. The proposed reconstruction and identification strategy provides a pathway toward achieving the sensitivity needed to detect UHE neutrinos.

 - **Abstract**
 Current cosmological data seem to show that dark energy is evolving in time and that it possibly crossed the phantom divide in the past. So far the only theories that lead to such a behavior involve a non-trivial coupling between dark energy, in the form of a scalar field, and the gravitational or matter sector. We show that there is another possibility involving both a non-trivial kinetic sector in a cubic Galileon theory and a scalar field potential that breaks the Galileon shift symmetry, which can lead to a similar phenomenology on large scales. We perform a full Bayesian analysis using the latest cosmological data, including DESI DR2 BAO measurements, type Ia SNe measurements from DESY5, Union3, and Pantheon+, and CMB data from Planck and ACT. We find that it is statistically strongly favored over a Universe dominated by a cosmological constant (with a Bayes factor of $\log B\simeq 6.5$). Yet, as with other non-minimally coupled theories, it has severe ancillary gravitational effects. These can be mitigated to some extent, but as with other viable theories, the penalty is ever more elaborate scalar field models of dark energy.

 - **Abstract**
 Hawking's groundbreaking prediction that black holes emit thermal radiation and ultimately evaporate remains unverified due to the extreme faintness of this radiation for stellar-mass or larger black holes. In this study, we explore a novel observational strategy to search for Hawking radiation from asteroid-mass black hole morsels -- hypothetical small black holes that may form and be ejected during catastrophic events such as binary black hole mergers. These black hole morsels are expected to emit gamma rays in the GeV-TeV range on observable timescales. We analyze data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope coinciding with the well-localized binary black hole merger GW170814, searching for delayed gamma-ray signatures associated with morsel evaporation. While we find no evidence for such emission, we place exclusion limits on morsel masses, ruling out the 4 x 10^8 kg scenario at the 95 percent confidence level for a total emitted mass of one solar mass. We also outline future directions, including the incorporation of late-time evaporation spikes, systematic application across the growing gravitational wave catalog, and the enhanced discovery potential of next-generation facilities such as the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory.

 In this paper, we develop a Neural Likelihood Estimator and apply it to analyse real gravitational-wave (GW) data for the first time. We assess the usability of neural likelihood for GW parameter estimation and report the parameter space where neural likelihood performs as a robust estimator to output posterior probability distributions using modest computational resources. In addition, we demonstrate that the trained Neural likelihood can also be used in further analysis, enabling us to obtain the evidence corresponding to a hypothesis, making our method a complete tool for parameter estimation. Particularly, our method requires around 100 times fewer likelihood evaluations than standard Bayesian algorithms to infer properties of a GW signal from a binary black hole system as observed by current generation ground-based detectors. The fairly simple neural network architecture chosen makes for cheap training, which allows our method to be used on-the-fly without the need for special hardware and ensures our method is flexible to use any waveform model, noise model, or prior. We show results from simulations as well as results from GW150914 as proof of the effectiveness of our algorithm.

 Silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) are increasingly favored for detecting near-UV, visible, and infrared light in space due to their high sensitivity to single photons and compact design. While SiPMs offer several advantages over traditional photomultiplier tubes, their susceptibility to radiation and noise remains an issue. Our study intended to determine the optimal SiPM design for the Terzina Cherenkov satellite in sun-synchronous low Earth orbit (LEO) at an altitude of 550 km. To this end, we characterised several NUV-HD-MT SiPM variants, developed by Fondazione Bruno Kessler, and studied their responses to irradiation by exposing them to a 50 MeV proton beam and to electrons from the $\beta$-emitting source strontium-90. Experimental results were cross-validated with SPENVIS and Geant4 simulations. Based on our findings, we also propose an annealing strategy to mitigate radiation damage and ensure reliable performance in space-based applications.

 - **Abstract**
 Asteroid families are typically identified using hierarchical clustering methods (HCM) in the proper element phase space. However, these methods struggle with overlapping families, interlopers, and the detection of older structures. Spectroscopic data can help overcome these limitations. The Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3) contains reflectance spectra at visible wavelengths for 60,518 asteroids over the range between 374-1034 nm, representing a large sample that is well suited to studies of asteroid families. Using Gaia spectroscopic data, we investigate a region in the central Main Belt centered around 2.72 AU, known for its connection to L- type asteroids. Conflicting family memberships reported by different HCM implementations underscore the need for an independent dynamical analysis of this region. We determine family memberships by applying a color taxonomy derived from Gaia data and by assessing the spectral similarity between candidate members and the template spectrum of each family. We identify an L- type asteroid family in the central Main Belt, with (460) Scania as its largest member. Analysis of the family's V-shape indicates that it is relatively old, with an estimated age of approximately 1 Gyr, which likely explains its non detection by the HCM. The family's existence is supported by statistical validation, and its distribution in proper element space is well reproduced by numerical simulations. Independent evidence from taxonomy, polarimetry, and spin-axis obliquities consistently supports the existence of this L- type family. This work highlights the value of combining dynamical and physical data to characterize asteroid families and raises questions about the origin of L- type families, potentially linked to primordial objects retaining early protoplanetary disk properties. Further spectroscopic data are needed to clarify these families.

 We present RAVEN, a newly developed vetting and validation pipeline for TESS exoplanet candidates. The pipeline employs a Bayesian framework to derive the posterior probability of a candidate being a planet against a set of False Positive (FP) scenarios, through the use of a Gradient Boosted Decision Tree and a Gaussian Process classifier, trained on comprehensive synthetic training sets of simulated planets and 8 astrophysical FP scenarios injected into TESS lightcurves. These training sets allow large scale candidate vetting and performance verification against individual FP scenarios. A Non-Simulated FP training set consisting of real TESS candidates caused primarily by stellar variability and systematic noise is also included. The machine learning derived probabilities are combined with scenario specific prior probabilities, including the candidates' positional probabilities, to compute the final posterior probabilities. Candidates with a planetary posterior probability greater than 99% against each FP scenario and whose implied planetary radius is less than 8$R_{\oplus}$ are considered to be statistically validated by the pipeline. In this first version, the pipeline has been developed for candidates with a lightcurve released from the TESS Science Processing Operations Centre, an orbital period between 0.5 and 16 days and a transit depth greater than 300ppm. The pipeline obtained area-under-curve (AUC) scores > 97% on all FP scenarios and > 99% on all but one. Testing on an independent external sample of 1361 pre-classified TOIs, the pipeline achieved an overall accuracy of 91%, demonstrating its effectiveness for automated ranking of TESS candidates. For a probability threshold of 0.9 the pipeline reached a precision of 97% with a recall score of 66% on these TOIs. The RAVEN pipeline is publicly released as a cloud-hosted app, making it easily accessible to the community.

 - **Abstract**
 The seasonal variation of single muons is a well-understood phenomenon, mainly driven by a positive correlation with temperature fluctuations in the atmospheric profiles. However, the rate of multi-muon events recorded by various experiments has shown an intriguing opposite seasonal modulation that remains unexplained by previous research. For the first time, we quantitatively describe the phase and amplitudes of the seasonal variation for cosmic multi-muon events detected by the NO$\nu$A Near Detector. We can further explain the amplitude dependence for multi-muon events across various multiplicities. For our analysis, we use the general-purpose Monte Carlo code FLUKA-CERN 4.4.1, which provides a more realistic description of the detector, atmospheric profiles, and muon propagation underground. Finally, we compare our results with those obtained from the latest CORSIKA version 7.8010, utilizing the most up-to-date high-energy hadronic interaction models EPOS LHC-R and QGSJETIII-01. Our findings provide a fresh perspective on seasonal muon flux modulation and offer key constraints for cosmic-ray interaction models and underground detector studies.

 - **Abstract**
 The ongoing exponential growth of computational power, and the growth of the commercial High Performance Computing (HPC) industry, has led to a point where ten commercial systems currently exceed the performance of the highest-used HPC system in radio astronomy in Australia, and one of these exceeds the expected requirements of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) Science Data Processors. In order to explore implications of this emerging change in the HPC landscape for radio astronomy, we report results from a survey conducted via semi-structured interviews with 14 Australian scientists and providers with experience of commercial HPC in astronomy and similar data intensive fields. We supplement these data with learnings from two earlier studies in which we investigated the application of commercial HPC to radio astronomy data processing, using cases with very different data and processing considerations. We use the established qualitative research approach of thematic analysis to extract key messages from our interviews. We find that commercial HPC can provide major advantages in accessibility and availability, and may contribute to increasing researchers' career productivity. Significant barriers exist, however, including the need for access to increased expertise in systems programming and parallelisation, and a need for recognition in research funding. We comment on potential solutions to these issues.

          Molecular clouds as a tool to constraint sub-GeV dark matter and primordial black holes

 - **Abstract**
 Despite decades of direct and indirect searches within the Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP) framework, no conclusive results have been found in the GeV--TeV range. This has motivated exploring alternatives, including new particles and macroscopic objects. Two well-motivated scenarios are sub-GeV DM and Primordial Black Holes (PBHs). Molecular clouds (MCs), typically studied as star-forming sites, can serve as astrophysical laboratories to probe these candidates via their ionization rates. Observations show ionization levels exceeding expectations from known CR fluxes, pointing to an additional ionizing component. Here, we consider electrons and positrons from annihilating and decaying MeV DM particles, as well as Hawking radiation from evaporating PBHs, as possible contributors. We model transport driven by energy losses within the clouds. By comparing predicted ionization rates with observations, conservative constraints are set on the thermally averaged cross section $\langle\sigma v\rangle$, decay lifetime $\tau$ and PBH abundances $f_{PBH}$. The analysis assumes all the observed ionization comes from DM and adopts a 95% confidence level. Results show that, even in the most conservative case of local MCs such as L1551, these constraints are very close to the most competitive bounds from X-ray observations, while inner-Galaxy clouds like DRAGON or G1.4--1.8+87 provide stronger limits, sometimes improving X-ray and cosmological constraints. For sub-GeV DM, MCs exclude parameter space competitive with the one tested by NuSTAR, INTEGRAL, or Voyager, especially below $\sim$30 MeV. In the PBH case, asteroid-mass black holes are restricted to a low fraction of DM, with optimistic scenarios getting close to the strongest limits. This demonstrates the potential of MCs as a novel probe in indirect DM searches.

          The young stellar clusters in M51 and the impact of GMC encounters

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the young stellar cluster population of M51 and how it is affected by encounters with giant molecular clouds (GMCs). We combine a galactic model with $N$-body simulations of 5000 unique clusters in the mass range [600 - 24000] $M_{\odot}$. We simulate each cluster twice: with ($C_R$) and without ($C_N$) tidal perturbations from the GMCs. We are able to reproduce the majority of the observed mass- and age functions. However, for the age function we see a large discrepancy for clusters with masses $\sim$ 5000 $M_{\odot}$, which is likely related to incompleteness in the observations. We find that old low-mass clusters, located close to the galactic centre, are most likely to be disrupted. The effect of GMC encounters causes a decrease in survivability by 8 per cent points for the oldest clusters with initial masses below 6000 $M_{\odot}$. For 15 clusters we find that the presence of GMCs can protect the $C_R$ clusters from the rest of the galactic tidal field and thereby cause them to retain a significantly higher fraction of stars compared to the $C N$ clusters. For clusters that are super-virialized we find that the $C_R$ clusters have a higher virial ratio compared to the $C_N$ clusters, which is a result of interactions with GMCs. We see no significant difference between the $C_R$ and $C_N$ populations, indicating that over a time period of 200 Myr the effect of the GMCs cannot be detected.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. In the search for exoplanets using radial velocities (RV), stellar activity has become one of the main limiting factors for detectability. Fortunately, activity-induced RV signals are wavelength-dependent or chromatic, unlike planetary signals. This study exploits the broad spectral coverage provided by the combined use of SOPHIE and SPIRou velocimeters to investigate the chromatic nature of the activity signal of the highly active M dwarf EV Lac. Aims. We aim to understand the origin of the strong wavelength dependence (chromaticity) observed in the RV signal of EV Lac by selecting spectral lines based on physical properties. In particular, we explore the impact of starspots by defining the contrast effect at the level of individual lines. The Zeeman effect is also considered in this study. Methods. SPIRou and SOPHIE spectra were reduced using the line-by-line (LBL) method. We performed custom RV calculations, using groups of spectral lines selected for their sensitivity to either the spot-to-photosphere contrast or the Zeeman effect. The sensi- tivity of each line to the spot is defined using a two-temperature model based on PHOENIX spectra, while Landé factors were used to quantify Zeeman sensitivity. Results. We find that the spectral lines are distributed in two distinct families of contrasts, producing anti-correlated RV signals. This leads to a partial cancellation of the total RV signal, especially at longer wavelengths and provides a natural explanation for the strong chromaticity observed in EV Lac. This sign-reversal effect is demonstrated here, for the first time, on empirical data. Building on this discovery, we propose a new approach to constraining spot temperatures and to mitigating stellar activity. This will open up promising avenues for improving activity corrections and enhancing the detection of exoplanets around active M dwarfs.

 - **Abstract**
 CARMENES is a dual-channel high-resolution spectrograph at the 3.5 m Calar Alto telescope designed to detect low-mass planets around late-type dwarfs by measuring their radial velocities (RVs). High thermal stability in both the visible (VIS) and near infrared channels is essential to achieve the precision required for these measurements. In particular, stabilising the NIR channel to the millikelvin level, which operates at cryogenic temperatures (140 K), poses significant engineering this http URL CARMENES-PLUS project was initiated to improve the instruments intrinsic RV precision. In this article, we focus on the thermal stability improvements made to the NIR channels cooling system. The NIR cooling system was originally conceived to operate with a discontinuous flow of cryogenic nitrogen gas. As part of CARMENES-PLUS, this was upgraded to a continuous flow configuration. Additional changes included the installation of an automatic vacuum system, a proportional control valve, and a pressure regulation system. These upgrades were designed to reduce thermal fluctuations and enhance long-term stability. The implemented upgrades significantly improved the intrinsic RV precision of the NIR channel. We quantified this improvement using Fabry Perot calibration spectra, obtaining an intrinsic RV precision of 0.67 ms after the interventions, an improvement of nearly 2 ms . We also assessed the stability of the nightly zero points, finding a reduced scatter of 3.9 ms post upgrade, compared to 6.1 ms before. For a sample of slowly rotating stars (vsin i below 2 kms), the median scatter decreased from 8.8 ms to 6.7 ms after the upgrades. These results demonstrate that the thermal control upgrades introduced in CARMENES PLUS have enhanced the NIR channels RV performance, bringing it closer to the VIS channels stability and reinforcing CARMENES capabilities for exoplanet detection around M dwarfs.

          A Decade of Transit-Timing Measurements Confirm Resonance in the K2-19 System

 - **Abstract**
 K2-19 is a star, slightly smaller than the Sun, that hosts three transiting planets. Two of these, K2-19 b and c, are between the size of Neptune and Saturn and have orbital periods near a 3:2 commensurability, and exhibit strong transit-timing variations (TTVs). A previous TTV analysis reported moderate eccentricities of $\approx0.20 \pm0.03$ for the two planets, but such high values would imply rapid orbital decay for the innermost planet d. Here, we present an updated analysis that includes eight new transit times from TESS, which extends the time baseline from three years to a decade, and employ a gradient-aware TTV modeling code. We confirm that the system resides in resonance with a small libration amplitude, but find a broader constraints on eccentricity that range from a few percent up to 0.2. These revised eccentricities alleviate previous concerns regarding rapid tidal circularization and support the long-term dynamical stability of the system.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. In a previous paper (Afify et al. 2024), we have investigated the stability threshold of the ion-ion acoustic instability (IIAI) in parameter regimes compatible with recent Parker Solar Probe (PSP, (Fox et al. 2016)) observations, in the presence of a Maxwellian electron distribution. We found that observed parameters are close to the instability threshold, but IIAI requires a higher electron temperature than observed. Aims. As electron distributions in the solar wind present clear non-Maxwellian features, we investigate here if deviations from the Maxwellian distribution could explain the observed IIAI. We address specifically the kappa ( $\kappa$ ) and core-strahl distributions for the electrons. Methods. We perform analytical studies and kinetic simulations using a Vlasov-Poisson code in a parameter regime relevant to PSP observations. The simulated growth rates are validated against kinetic theory. Results. We show that the IIAI threshold changes in the presence of $\kappa$ or core-strahl electron distributions, but not significantly. In the latter case, the expression of an effective temperature for an equivalent Maxwellian electron distribution given in Jones et al. (1975) is confirmed by simulations. Such an effective temperature could simplify stability assessment of future observations.

 - **Abstract**
 We present integral field spectroscopic observations of 75 strong gravitational lens candidates identified with a residual neural network in the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys, obtained with the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) on the ESO's Very Large Telescope. These observations are part of an ongoing effort to build a large, spectroscopically confirmed sample of strong lensing systems for studies on dark matter, galaxy structure, and cosmology. Our MUSE program targets both lens and source redshifts, with particular emphasis on southern hemisphere systems. MUSE's wide spectral coverage and integral field capability allow for efficient identification of multiple sources, lens environments, and weak spectral features. Redshifts for lenses and sources were obtained via manual identification of spectral features in extracted 1D spectra. Our dataset includes systems with complex configurations, such as multiple source planes and group or cluster-scale environments. We extracted and analyzed 185 spectra, successfully determining both the lens and the source redshifts for 48 gravitational lens systems. For an additional 21 targets, we measured the redshifts of the lenses but were unable to determine the redshifts of the background sources. Six targets were confirmed to not be gravitational lenses. The results presented here complement space-based imaging from our HST SNAPshot program and spectroscopic follow-up with DESI and Keck, and have lasting legacy value for identifying interesting high-redshift sources and complex lensing configurations.

 We present the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Strong Lensing Secondary Target Program. This is a spectroscopic follow-up program for strong gravitational lens candidates found in the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys footprint. Spectroscopic redshifts for the lenses and lensed source are crucial for lens modeling to obtain physical parameters. The spectroscopic catalog in this paper consists of 73 candidate systems from the DESI Early Data Release (EDR). We have confirmed 20 strong lensing systems and determined four to not be lenses. For the remaining systems, more spectroscopic data from ongoing and future observations will be presented in future publications. We discuss the implications of our results for lens searches with neural networks in existing and future imaging surveys as well as for lens modeling. This Strong Lensing Secondary Target Program is part of the DESI Strong Lens Foundry project, and this is Paper II of a series on this project.

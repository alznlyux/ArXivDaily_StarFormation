          Jitter Sensing and Control for Multi-Plane Phase Retrieval

 - **Abstract**
 The family of multi-plane phase retrieval sensors, such as the curvature and nonlinear curvature wavefront sensors (WFS), contain tip/tilt information embedded in their signals. We have built a nonlinear curvature WFS to study different wavefront reconstruction methods and test the ability to extract tip/tilt information. Using reliable and fast centroiding algorithms, combined with knowledge of the measured z-distance to each measurement plane, we demonstrate that image jitter may be sensed and compensated for using a fast steering mirror and the WFS alone, i.e. without the need for peripheral components such as quad-cells or access to a separate scientific imaging channel. This approach, which is both precise and accurate, corroborates previous numerical simulations and is expected to improve the overall reconstruction accuracy of multi-plane phase retrieval sensors including higher order spatial modes.

 - **Abstract**
 Luminous Red Novae (LRNe) are transients associated with mass ejection during stellar mergers and common envelope evolution (CEE). LRNe have the potential to illuminate the poorly understood phases of binary evolution leading up to the CEE, during the mass ejection phase, and in the immediate aftermath. However, the mechanism responsible for powering LRN light curves and the origin of their observed diversity remain open questions. Here, we perform two-dimensional moving-mesh radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of LRNe that take into account hydrogen recombination and relevant opacities. We study a typical high-mass stellar merger, which dynamically ejects 2 $M_\odot$ with a characteristic velocity of 410 km/s. This ejecta collides with 2.7 $M_\odot$ of equatorially concentrated circumbinary material (CBM) left behind from a prior phase of non-conservative runaway mass transfer. We find that the resulting light curve is composed of a short, blue peak followed by a redder, predominantly shock-powered plateau with luminosities reaching up to $10^{41}$ erg/s and durations up to 200 days. These luminosities are significantly higher, and the durations much longer, than those produced by a simple spherical ejection of the same mass. They also depend in a complex way on the radial distribution of the CBM. The shock is embedded in the ejecta and its observational signatures during the optically-thick phase are largely hidden. Our results are broadly compatible with observations of the brightest extragalactic LRNe and pave the way for the transformation of LRNe into powerful probes of binary evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Aims. We report the discovery of periodic maser variability of an unusual pattern in the high-mass young stellar object G26.598-0.024. Methods. A ten-year monitoring of the 6.7 GHz methanol maser was carried out with the Torun 32 m radio telescope. The archival data collected so far were also used to characterize the target with high angular resolution and examine its infrared variability. Results. We found anticorrelated flux variations of the opposite blueshifted and redshifted emission features with a period of 70.1 (2.2) d and the relative amplitude of 1.3 and 0.6, respectively. The light curves are best fit with a sinusoidal function modulated by mild changes in the average flux density on 3-5 yr timescales. The emission of the middle parts of the spectrum shows only long-term variability. High-angular-resolution data indicate that the maser is associated with one of the two 1.3 mm dust emission cores, while the periodic comes from two extended regions ~1500 au apart. We discuss several possible causes of the peculiar variability.

          Optical polarization properties of the closest tidal disruption event AT 2023clx indicate origin from tidal stream shocks

 - **Abstract**
 Polarization observations of tidal disruption events offer unique insights into the accretion processes around supermassive black holes. Here, we present optical polarization observations of the nearby event AT 2023clx, obtained using the Nordic Optical Telescope. Our observations reveal a rise and subsequent decay in the polarization degree, temporally offset from the peak of the optical light curve, reaching maximum intrinsic polarization degree of $\sim$5 per cent. In addition, the polarization angle shifts by $\sim60^\circ-100^\circ$ between 6 to 20 days after the optical peak, remaining stable thereafter. Remarkably, the observed polarization variability closely resembles that of AT 2020mot, strongly suggesting a common mechanism for accretion disk formation in these events. The variability in both polarization degree and angle supports models in which tidal stream shocks drive the optical outburst during the accretion disk formation.

          Impact of thermal effects on prompt-collapse binary neutron star mergers

 - **Abstract**
 The fate of the remnant following the merger of two neutron stars initially on quasicircular orbits depends primarily on the mass of the initial neutron stars, the mass ratio, and the still-uncertain dense-matter equation of state (EoS). Previous works studying the threshold mass for prompt collapse to a black hole have primarily focused on the uncertainties in the zero-temperature EoS, which are parametrized by a macroscopic quantity such as the characteristic neutron star radius. However, prompt collapse can take place either with or without a core bounce during the merger. In the bounce-collapse scenario, shocks can produce additional thermal support, potentially altering the threshold for collapse. In this work, we investigate the impact of the uncertainties in the finite-temperature part of the nuclear EoS on the threshold mass for prompt collapse in equal mass mergers. Using two cold EoSs, combined with four parametrizations of the finite-temperature part of the EoS, we find that the threshold mass is insensitive to realistic variations of the thermal prescription, at sub-percent accuracy. We report on the thermal properties and ejecta of mergers with masses just above the threshold mass, i.e., which experience a single core-bounce before collapsing. During the bounce, the thermal pressure can reach )(1-10)% of the cold pressure at supranuclear densities, depending on the thermal treatment, leading to modest differences in the dynamical ejecta that are launched and in the remnant disk mass as a result.

 - **Abstract**
 Over decades of solar wind observations, heavy ions have been observed to have a higher temperature and flow faster than protons in the solar corona and heliosphere. Remote observations have largely been limited to the low corona ($< 4R_{\odot}$), while in situ observations for heavy ions ($Z>2$) have only been sampled at 1 au and beyond. As a result, theories that address heavy ion heating and acceleration remain largely unconstrained. With the launch of Solar Orbiter, heavy ion kinetics can be probed closer to the Sun, as close as the orbit of Mercury ($65R_{\odot}$), to examine their radial behavior. Through a statistical analysis of O$^{6+}$, this work provides a comprehensive analysis of the velocity and temperature of O$^{6+}$ from 0.3 au to 1 au. The study finds that the O$^{6+}$ relative drift, normalized to the local Alfvén speed, and its temperature compared to protons, both decrease with distance from the Sun and show some speed dependence. The O$^{6+}$ temperature is well fit by a single temperature adiabatic profile across all wind speeds, suggesting there is no significant heating at these heliocentric distances. This is in contrast to what is observed for protons and He$^{2+}$. Alfvénic fluctuations, with full 180$^{\circ}$ field rotation, create momentary negative differential streaming where the speed of O$^{6+}$ trails the protons. The amount of negative differential streaming gradually increases at larger distances. These results provide critical constraints to the proposed mechanisms seeking to describe ion heating and acceleration in the solar wind.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first high-resolution XRISM spectrum of the neutron star low-mass X-ray binary GX 340+0, revealing unprecedented detail in its emission and absorption features. The spectrum reveals a rich and complex Fe XXV He$\alpha$ line profile and a P-Cygni profile from Ca XX. We use the state-of-the-art spectral synthesis code Cloudy to model the emission and absorption features in detail. Our analysis reveals multi-ionization and multi-velocity structures, where the combination of broad ($\sim$ 800 km/s) and narrow ($\sim$ 360 km/s) line components, along with rest-frame and blueshifted emission and absorption lines, accounts for the observed line profile complexity. We identify a modest $\sim$ 2735 km/s accretion disk wind exhibiting both absorption and emission features. We also detect a relativistic reflection feature in the spectrum, which we model using relxillNS - specifically designed to characterize X-ray reprocessing in accretion disks around neutron stars. Furthermore, we examine the detailed physics of the Fe XXV He$\alpha$ complex, focusing on the forbidden-to-resonance line ratio under the influence of continuum pumping and optical depth effects.

 - **Abstract**
 Low-mass stars and brown dwarfs -- spectral types (SpTs) M0 and later -- play a significant role in studying stellar and substellar processes and demographics, reaching down to planetary-mass objects. Currently, the classification of these sources remains heavily reliant on visual inspection of spectral features, equivalent width measurements, or narrow-/wide-band spectral indices. Recent advances in machine learning (ML) methods offer automated approaches for spectral typing, which are becoming increasingly important as large spectroscopic surveys such as Gaia, SDSS, and SPHEREx generate datasets containing millions of spectra. We investigate the application of ML in spectral type classification on low-resolution (R $\sim$ 120) near-infrared spectra of M0--T9 dwarfs obtained with the SpeX instrument on the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility. We specifically aim to classify the gravity- and metallicity-dependent subclasses for late-type dwarfs. We used binned fluxes as input features and compared the efficacy of spectral type estimators built using Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) models. We tested the influence of different normalizations and analyzed the relative importance of different spectral regions for surface gravity and metallicity subclass classification. Our best-performing model (using KNN) classifies 95.5 $\pm$ 0.6% of sources to within $\pm$1 SpT, and assigns surface gravity and metallicity subclasses with 89.5 $\pm$ 0.9% accuracy. We test the dependence of signal-to-noise ratio on classification accuracy and find sources with SNR $\gtrsim$ 60 have $\gtrsim$ 95% accuracy. We also find that zy-band plays the most prominent role in the RF model, with FeH and TiO having the highest feature importance.

 - **Abstract**
 Within the molecular clouds of the Camelopardis OB1 association exists a region previously noted as one subgroup. However, bulk clustering from Gaia astrometry has recently shown three distinctive kinematically coherent groups, all found in a similar location in the sky ($137 \lessapprox l\lessapprox145$ and $-2\lessapprox b \lessapprox5$) and at a similar distance ($\sim$1kpc). In this work, we derive from first principles the three proposed clusters in this region, refine the membership list and cluster ages, and, for the first time, examine the 3D structure, motion, and origin of the clusters. Using clustering of Gaia data in 3D position + 2D velocity space, supplemented by available SDSS-V radial velocities, we find the clusters of ages 10, 15.8, and 20 Myr with members numbering 140, 469, and 184, respectively. All three clusters overlap currently in 3D space. Tracing their previous location, based on present-day motions, shows that each cluster originated in its own distinct region and exhibited no influence on each other's formation. Two of the clusters trace their origin to different areas within the Cam OB1 association, with the oldest cluster tracing its origins to the near edge of the Perseus arm, in the direction of the Per OB1 or Cas 0B6 associations. Overall, this work illustrates how different stellar groups, even those originating in a different spiral arm, can visit and pass through each other as they travel through the Galaxy.

          AT2022sxl: A Candidate Repeating Tidal Disruption Event in Possible Association with Two High-Energy Neutrino Events

 - **Abstract**
 We report a candidate repeating tidal disruption event (TDE), AT2022sxl, found from large-field optical survey data. Two flares with a separation time of $\sim$7.2\,yr between the two optical peaks are observed. Related mid-infrared (MIR) flares, with delay times of $\sim$200\,day are also seen. We analyze two optical spectra of the TDE source, onenear the optical peak of the second flare from the Transient Name Server and one at the quiescent flux level after the second flare. The latter was taken by us with the 10.4-m Gran Telescopio Canarias. Comparing the features of the two spectra, we identify that the host is likely a composite galaxy at redshift 0.23 and the TDE event, probably an H+He type, mainly powered broad components in the emission lines of H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, and He~I $\lambda$5876. More interestingly, we find that two Bronze-type neutrino events, detected by the IceCube neutrino observatory, match the TDE in position and the second flare, especially the delayed MIR flare, in time. We discuss the MIR luminosity properties of the currently reported (candidate) neutrino-emitting TDEs and suggest that luminous MIR emission is a prerequisite for neutrino production in TDEs.

 - **Abstract**
 A key science goal of large sky surveys such as those conducted by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory and precursors to the Square Kilometre Array is the identification of variable and transient objects. One approach is the statistical analysis of the time series of the changing brightness of sources, that is, their light curves. However, finding adequate statistical representations of light curves is challenging because of data quality issues such as sparsity of observations, irregular sampling, and other nuisance factors inherent in astronomical data collection. The wide diversity of objects that a large-scale survey will observe also means that making parametric assumptions about the shape of light curves is problematic. We present a Gaussian process (GP) regression approach for characterising light curve variability that addresses these challenges. Our approach makes no assumptions about the shape of a light curve and, therefore, is general enough to detect a range of variable source types. In particular, we propose using the joint distribution of GP amplitude hyperparameters to distinguish variable and transient candidates from nominally stable ones and apply this approach to 6394 radio light curves from the ThunderKAT survey. We compare our results with two variability metrics commonly used in radio astronomy, namely $\eta_\nu$ and $V_\nu$, and show that our approach has better discriminatory power and interpretability. Finally, we conduct a rudimentary search for transient sources in the ThunderKAT dataset to demonstrate how our approach might be used as an initial screening tool. Computational notebooks in Python and R are available to help facilitate the deployment of this framework to other surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a joint analysis of high-resolution $K$- and $L$-band observations of the benchmark hot Jupiter \hdb\ from the Keck Planet Imager and Characterizer (KPIC). One half night of observations were obtained in each bandpass covering similar pre-eclipse phases. The two epochs were then jointly analyzed using our atmospheric retrieval pipeline based on \petit\ to constrain the atmospheric pressure-temperature profile and chemical composition. Consistent with recent results from \textit{JWST} observations at lower spectral resolution, we obtain an oxygen-rich composition for \hdb\ ($\rm C/O < 10^{-3}$ at 95\% confidence) and a lower limit on the volatile metallicity similar to the solar value ($\rm [(C+O)/H] > -0.2$ at 95\% confidence). Leveraging the large spectral grasp of the multi-band observations, we constrain the H$_2$O mixing ratio to $\rm \log H_2O_{VMR} > -3.1$ at 95\% confidence, and obtain 95\% upper limits on the atmospheric mixing ratios of CO ($<10^{-4.8}$), CH$_4$ ($<10^{-4.5}$), NH$_3$ ($<10^{-5.8}$), H$_2$S ($<10^{-3.3}$), and HCN ($<10^{-5.6}$). The limits on CH$_4$, NH$_3$, and HCN are consistent with recent results from \textit{JWST} transmission spectroscopy, demonstrating the value of multi-band ground-based high resolution spectroscopy for precisely constraining trace species abundances in exoplanet atmospheres. The retrieved low-C/O, moderate-metallicity composition for \hdb\ is consistent with formation scenarios involving late accretion of substantial quantities of oxygen-rich refractory solids and/or ices.

          Constraining intrinsic S-type AGB masses and third dredge-up using pulsation

 - **Abstract**
 The lowest mass at which the third dredge-up (TDU) occurs for thermally-pulsing asymptotic giant branch (TP-AGB) stars remains a key uncertainty in detailed stellar models. S-type AGB stars are an important constraint on this uncertainty as they have C/O ratios between 0.5 and 1, meaning they have only experienced up to a few episodes of TDU. AGB stars are also long-period variable stars, pulsating in low order radial pulsation modes. In this paper we estimate the initial masses of a large literature sample of intrinsic S-type AGB stars, by analysing their visual light curves, estimating their luminosities with Gaia DR3 parallax distances and finally comparing to a grid of detailed stellar models combined with linear pulsation models. We find that the initial mass distribution of intrinsic S-type stars peaks at 1.3 to 1.4 \Msun, depending on model assumptions. There also appear to be stars with initial masses down to 1 solar mass, which is in conflict with current detailed stellar models. Additionally, we find that though the mass estimates for semiregular variable stars pulsating in higher order radial modes are precise, the Mira variables pulsating in the fundamental mode present challenges observationally from uncertain parallax distances, and theoretically from the onset of increased mass-loss and the necessity of non-linear pulsation models.

 - **Abstract**
 The discovery of exoplanets has expanded our understanding of planetary systems and opened new avenues for astronomical research. In this study, we present a machine learning (ML) framework for exoplanet identification using a time-series photometric dataset from the Kepler Space Telescope, comprising 3,198 flux measurements across 5,074 stars. We investigate the performance of four supervised classification algorithms, namely Random Forest, k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression, using a comprehensive set of evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC), confusion matrices, and learning curves. Among the models, Random Forest achieves the highest accuracy (99.8\%) and near-perfect F1-scores, demonstrating superior generalization and robustness. KNN also performs strongly, achieving 99.3\% accuracy, while Decision Tree demonstrates moderate performance with 97.1\% accuracy, and Logistic Regression trails behind with the lowest accuracy and generalization at 95.8\%. Notably, the application of the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) significantly improves performance across all models by addressing class imbalance. These findings underscore the effectiveness of ensemble-based machine learning techniques, particularly Random Forest, in handling large volumes of photometric data for automated exoplanet detection. This approach holds significant potential for implementation at ground-based facilities, such as the Iranian National Observatory (INO), where such extensive and precise datasets can further advance exoplanet discovery and characterization efforts.

          Linear Polarization in a Black Hole, 4U~1957+115 and its X-ray Spectral Analysis

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new spectro-polarimetric method for estimation of the inclination of X-ray binaries using the linear polarization (LP) value in black hole (BH) sources, based on the early paper by Sunyaev \& Titarchuk (1985, ST85). The X-ray LP arises from multiple scattering of initially soft photons in a hot, optically thick Compton cloud (CC) using a flat geometry. ST85 showed that the LP degree $P$ depends on the binary inclination $i$ and remains independent of the photon energy. Moreover, the $P$ follows a characteristic angular distribution based on the CC optical depth $\tau_0$, in particular for $\tau_0 >$ 10 the LP follows the Chandrasekhar (1950) distribution. In light of the vast number of recent IXPE spectro-polarimetric observations of BHs, testing this approach in combination with spectral analysis of these sources by other missions is desirable. In particular, the BH source, 4U 1957+115 was observed with IXPE in the high/soft state for which $P\sim 2\%$ was found (Marra et al. 2024). To apply the new method, in addition to knowing $P$ for a given source, it is necessary to estimate the CC optical depth $\tau_0$ and then to calculate of the best-fit photon index $\Gamma$ and the plasma temperature $kT_e$. We present the X-ray spectral analysis of 4U~1957+11 using data from IXPE, NuSTAR, NICER, RXTE}, Swift, Suzaku and ASCA. We show that the X-ray source spectra are well described by the Comptonization model with $\Gamma$ varying from 1.5 to 3. We find a monotonic increase in $\Gamma$ with the mass accretion rate, $\dot M$, and a final saturation of the index at $\Gamma\sim3$ for high $\dot M$. We determine a BH mass by the scaling method: $M_{1957}=4.8 \pm 1.8~M_{\odot}$, assuming a source distance of 22 kpc, using H 1743-322, 4U 1630-47, and GRS 1915+105 as reference sources.

          Inflationary Models with Gauss-Bonnet Coupling in Light of ACT Observations

 - **Abstract**
 Recent analyses combining Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) data with other cosmological datasets report a higher scalar spectral index $n_s$, creating tension with a wide range of inflationary models. Since a Gauss-Bonnet term with a coupling function $\xi(\phi) = 3\lambda/[4V(\phi)]$ leaves $n_s$ nearly unchanged (up to a field rescaling) while reducing the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ by a factor $(1-\lambda)$, so choosing $(1-\lambda)$ sufficiently small effectively removes $r$ as a limiting observable, making it easier for inflationary models to satisfy the latest observational constraints and alleviating this tension. Applying this mechanism to chaotic inflation, E-models, T-models, and hilltop inflation, we find that broad regions of parameter space become consistent with the latest ACT-based CMB constraints. These results demonstrate that Gauss-Bonnet couplings can help bring a broad class of inflationary models into agreement with current CMB measurements.

 - **Abstract**
 Ground-based Cherenkov telescopes, although typically inoperative during moonlit nights for gamma-ray observations, offer a valuable opportunity for secondary scientific applications through Intensity Interferometry (II). Recent developments and observations suggest that implementing II instrumentation on existing Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs) or the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) can significantly advance optical stellar measurements. Motivated by the resurgence of II efforts over the past two decades, this work presents simulations demonstrating the estimation of stellar parameters for a radially pulsating star, such as Polaris, using either a single telescope or multiple telescopes. For single-telescope simulations, we assume that the photon pixels in the camera are mapped onto four distinct regions of the aperture, generating multiple baselines and enabling enhanced observational plane coverage. These results highlight the potential of Cherenkov telescopes in India for high-resolution optical astronomy during otherwise inoperative periods and offer promising insights into the characterization of bright stellar objects with unprecedented precision.

 - **Abstract**
 The discrepancy between the predictions of primordial nucleosynthesis and the observed lithium abundance in Spite plateau stars has been attributed either to a challenge to the standard model of nucleosynthesis or to stellar processes occurring after the stars formed. To understand the origin of this discrepancy, it is crucial to link the cosmic star formation rate with a chemical enrichment model that incorporates the yields of both Population (Pop) III and II stars. It is within this framework that the evolution of lithium can be determined. The primary goal is to demonstrate that there is no discrepancy between the predictions of primordial nucleosynthesis and the observed lithium abundance. By combining a standard chemical evolution model with the hierarchical structure formation scenario, it is possible to determine the lithium abundance as a function of $[\mathrm{Fe/H}]$. The model's results are compared with observational data, including two extremely iron-poor stars: J0023+0307 and SMSS J0313-6708. The Spite plateau is naturally established in the range $-8.0 \lesssim [\mathrm{Fe/H}] \lesssim -2.0$ with $^{7}\mathrm{Li/H}$ $\sim 1.81 \times 10^{-10}$. We find that J0023+0307 could have formed $\sim 4.4 \times 10^{5} - 1.3 \times 10^{6}$ years after the explosion of the first Pop III star in the Universe, whereas for SMSS J0313-6708 this event would have occurred $\sim 2.2 \times 10^{5} - 4.4 \times 10^{5}$ years later. The Spite plateau serves as an observational signature of the formation of Pop III stars. The abundances observed in J0023+0307 and SMSS J0313-6708 are consistent with Pop III progenitor stars in the mass range $10-100 M_{\odot}$. However, if some high-redshift star formation occurs within subhalo-like structures, the contribution of stars in the mass range $140-260 M_{\odot}$ to the formation of the extended Spite plateau cannot be ruled out.

 Aims. OH 231.8+4.2 , also known as the Rotten Egg or Calabash nebula is a protoplanetary nebula which is seen in the direction of the open cluster M 46. While an association of the nebula with the cluster has been suggested in the past, this has been never confirmed. Here, we present accurate trigonometric parallax and proper motion measurements using VLBI observations of masers in the nebula and Gaia DR3 data for the cluster. Methods. We observed 22 GHz H2O and 43 GHz SiO masers around OH 231.8+4.2 using the Very Long Baseline Array at 4 epochs over 1 year. We also calculated the parallax and proper motion of the open star cluster M 46 using Gaia DR3 data. Results. Based on astrometric monitoring for 1 year, we measured an annual parallax of OH 231.8+4.2 to be 0.65 +\- 0.01 mas (stat.) +\- 0.02 mas (syst.), corresponding to a distance of 1.54 +\- 0.05 kpc. This agrees well with the parallax of M 46 from the Gaia DR3 data, which is 0.639 +\- 0.001 mas (stat.) +\- 0.010 mas (syst.). We re-estimated the luminosity of OH 231.8+4.2 to be 1.4 x 10^4 L_sol. However, there is a 15 km/s velocity difference between OH 231.8+4.2 and M 46 which could be caused by a past merger event.

 Multi-channel aperiodic fiber Bragg grating (FBG) based hydroxyl (OH) line filters have attracted significant interest in ground-based near-infrared (NIR) astronomical observations. In this paper, we present the performance of a new self-compensating enclosure for the filters, that can be used in non-temperature-controlled environments. Our prototype encloses a 110 mm long single-mode photosensitive optical fiber with three 10 mm filter gratings. A fourth grating was used as a reference outside the package to measure the uncompensated wavelength shift. The prototype was tested over three thermal cycles, and showed a maximum wavelength deviation of 12 pm, a wavelength drift of only 0.37 pm/$^{\circ}$C, over the temperature range of -17$^{\circ}$C to 15$^{\circ}$C. The athermalization factor, i.e., the ratio of the maximum wavelength shift of the compensated grating to the uncompensated reference filter grating was $\frac{1}{22}$. The results demonstrate the capability of the prototype for stabilizing multi-channel long-length FBGs or chirped FBGs, particularly for astronomical applications that require sub-picometer stability.

          Supermassive Neutron Stars in Starobinsky Gravity with Causal Hybrid Stellar Matter

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the stellar structure of neutron stars in the framework of Starobinsky gravity, characterized by a quadratic correction to the Einstein-Hilbert action, $f(R) = R + \alpha R^2$. In order to {\em preserve causality throughout\/} the star, we adopt a two-phase hybrid construction for the stellar matter, in which the core region consists of deconfined quark matter described by the MIT bag model, while the outer layers are composed of hadronic matter represented by unified equations of state such as SLy4, BSk20, and BSk21. Within this framework, we derive the modified field equations with static spherical symmetry, and numerically integrate the corresponding Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations with the chosen hybrid equations of state. Our analyses show that, unlike in general relativity, the Ricci scalar remains nonzero outside the stellar surface, and gradually falls to zero beyond 50 km, while the stellar surface remains within 10--12 km for the hybrid equations of state considered. This extended Ricci scalar profile arises from the extra degree of freedom (scalaron) inherent in Starobinsky gravity, which also contributes to the gravitational mass outside the star, causing the ADM mass measured at infinity to exceed the stellar mass at the surface. Nevertheless, the key physical relationships, such as the mass-central density and mass-radius curves, remain consistent with what is expected physically. Notably, we find that the maximum stable mass of neutron stars increases with the Starobinsky parameter $\alpha$, with the combined MIT-BSk21 model supporting an ADM mass of up to $2.07 \, M_\odot$ for $\alpha = 10\,r_g^2$. This theoreical limit for a nonrotating neutron star suggests that a rotating configuration could reach mass thresholds in the range of $2.48$ to $2.59 \, M_\odot$, considering that rapid rotation can enhance the maximum mass by approximately 20--25\%.

          Powerful Radio Sources as Probes of Black Hole Physics

 - **Abstract**
 Powerful jetted radio sources for which the luminosity in directed kinetic energy has been empirically determined, independent of assumptions, are considered. The total outflow lifetime of each source determined in the context of detailed cosmological studies was found to depend only upon the luminosity in directed kinetic energy ($L$). The distributions of $L$, total outflow lifetime, and total outflow energy each have a broad range of values, as do the supermassive black hole masses. The total outflow energy relative to the black hole mass is a small number with a small dispersion. Three explanations of these remarkable results are considered. This could indicate (1) the efficiencies with which black hole irreducible mass is increased and spin mass energy is extracted during the outflow event, (2) that the merger of two supermassive black holes occurs over a timescale commensurate with the independently determined outflow lifetime and that these mergers lead to the production of the low-frequency gravitational wave background, or (3) that feedback shuts off black hole accretion due to energy injected into the ambient medium.

 - **Abstract**
 Searching for radio pulsars orbiting around the Galactic centre black hole (BH), Sagittarius A$^\star$ (Sgr A$^\star$), represents a holy grail goal for large-area radio telescopes, in particular for the Square Kilometre Array. Follow-up timing observation of such a PSR-Sgr A$^\star$ binary system with an orbital period $\lesssim O(1\,{\rm year})$ will bring forward a handful of new tests on different aspects of fundamental physics that are barely accessible with other means. However, mass perturbation in the Galactic centre harms the gravitational cleanness of PSR-Sgr A$^\star$ systems. In order to flexibly account for perturbations, a numerical pulsar timing model is gradually being built, which can be used to probe the spacetime around Sgr A$^\star$ BH and study the nature of dark matter.

 - **Abstract**
 The V883 Ori system is a rapidly accreting young stellar object that has been used as a laboratory for studying the molecular inventory of young circumstellar disks with high luminosity. We simultaneously fit high resolution spectroscopy and medium resolution spectrophotometry of the system to constrain the physical conditions in the inner au. Using our thin viscous accretion disk model, we find $\dot{M} = 10^{-3.9 \pm 0.2} \ M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, $R_\mathrm{inner} = 5.86 \pm 1 \ R_\odot$, $i = 38.2 \pm 3$ degrees and $A_V = 20.8 \pm 0.7$ mag, resulting in an accretion luminosity of 458 $L_\odot$ and maximum disk temperature of 7045 K. The optical portion of the SED greatly exceeds the flux level expected for a highly extincted accretion disk. We propose that the excess emission arises from a contribution due to scattering of the accretion disk spectrum off nearby envelope material that is viewed along a less-extincted line of sight. Additionally, we use photometric observations spanning 137 years to demonstrate that the source has accreted at least 18 $M_\mathrm{Jup}$ of disk material to date. Finally, we discuss the importance of considering both the viscous heating from the midplane and the consequent irradiation effects on the outer disk when modeling the temperature structure to reproduce millimeter-wavelength observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Stochastic $\delta N$ formalism is a powerful tool to calculate the cosmological correlators non-perturbatively. However, it requires the initial data for the amplitude of the noise on the initial flat hypersurface which for a free theory during inflation is fixed to be $\frac{H}{2 \pi}$. In this work, we study the setups where the underlying theory involves interactions and the stochastic noises inherit these interactions. We extend the stochastic $\delta N$ formalism to these setups and rewrite the corresponding Langevin and Fokker-Planck equations in which the QFT corrections in the amplitude of the noises are taken into account. As an example, in the three-phase SR-USR-SR setup which is employed for PBHs formation, the modification in the amplitude of noise is calculated from the one-loop corrections in power spectrum via in-in formalism. We show that in these setups the amplitude of the stochastic noise is modified to $\frac{H}{2 \pi} \Big(1+ \frac{ \Delta {\cal P}_{\cal R} }{ {\cal P}^{(0)}_{ {\cal R} } }\Big)^{\frac{1}{2}}$ in which $ \frac{\Delta {\cal P}_{\cal R} }{ {\cal P}^{(0)}_{{\cal R} } }$ is the fractional one-loop correction in power spectrum.

          Multi-TeV Gamma Rays from GRB 221009A: Challenges for Emission Mechanisms, EBL Opacity, and Fundamental Physics

 - **Abstract**
 The detection of gamma-ray burst GRB~221009A has attracted significant attention due to its record brightness and the first-ever detection of multi-TeV $\gamma$-rays from a GRB. Located at redshift $z=0.151$, this event is relatively nearby by GRB standards yet remains cosmologically distant, making the survival of multi-TeV photons surprising. The Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory detected photons with energies up to $\sim 13$~TeV during the early afterglow phase, challenging standard EBL models. We investigate whether several theoretical frameworks can explain this anomalous emission: reduced EBL opacity due to cosmic voids along the line of sight, novel emission mechanisms within the GRB environment, secondary $\gamma$-ray production through cosmic-ray cascades, and new-physics scenarios involving Lorentz-invariance violation or axion-like particles. Our analysis highlights the exceptional nature of this event and ongoing theoretical tensions about the dominant physical processes. We discuss the limitations of current models and identify specific observational signatures that future multiwavelength and multi-messenger observations could provide to discriminate between competing explanations. Continued study of similar events with next-generation facilities will be crucial for resolving these challenges and advancing our understanding of extreme particle acceleration in astrophysical environments.

          GW231123: a Possible Primordial Black Hole Origin

 - **Abstract**
 GW231123, the heaviest binary black hole merger detected by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration to date, lies in the pair-instability mass gap and exhibits unusually high component spins. In this letter, we show that both merging black holes may have a primordial origin with smaller initial masses. The observed masses and, crucially, the spins of GW231123 are naturally accommodated within the most vanilla primordial black hole framework, once cosmological accretion is taken into account. Interestingly, the parameter space needed to explain the inferred GW231123 rate is at the edge of the exclusion region from Xray and CMB observations, suggesting that this interpretation can be either confirmed or ruled out. The upcoming O5 observing run by the collaboration should detect ${\cal O}(20)$ similar events, testing their mass-spin correlation, while next-generation detectors would be capable of observing high redshift events, as predicted in this scenario.

 - **Abstract**
 Bulge globular clusters(BGCs) are exceptional tracers of the formation and chemodynamical evolution of this oldest Galactic this http URL, until now, observational difficulties have prevented us from taking full advantage of these powerful Galactic archeological tools. CAPOS, the bulge Cluster APOgee Survey, addresses this key topic by observing a large number of BGCs, most of which have been poorly studied. We aim to obtain accurate mean values for metallicity,[alpha/Fe],and radial velocity, as well as abundances for 11 other elements. We present final parameters based on ASPCAP for all 18 CAPOS BGCs. We carry out a stringent membership selection, finding 303 with SNR>70 and 125 with lower SNR. We reinforced the finding that stars with high [N/Fe] abundances show higher [Fe/H] than their lower [N/Fe] counterparts. Mg,Ca and global alpha abundances show similar trends, while Si is well-behaved. The [Fe/H] value of these 2nd population stars is corrected to derive the mean metallicity. Mean metallicities are determined to a precision of 0.05 dex,[alpha/Fe] to 0.06 dex, and radial velocity to 3.4 km/s. No clusters show strong evidence for internal metallicity variation, including M22. Abundances for 11 other elements using only 1st population stars are calculated and are generally in good agreement with the literature. We develope a new chemodynamical GC classification scheme, synthesizing several recent studies. We also compile up-to-date metallicities. The BGC metallicity distribution is bimodal, with peaks at [Fe/H]=-0.45 and -1.1, with the metal-poor peak strongly dominant, while exsitu GCs are unimodal, with a peak at -1.6. Surprisingly, we find only a small, statistically insignificant difference in the mean [Si/Fe] of in and exsitu GCs. The 4 GCs with the lowest [Si/Fe] values are all exsitu, relatively young, and 3 belong to Sagittarius, but no other correlations are evident.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a study of neutron-capture element abundances (Sr, Y, Zr, Ba, La, Ce, Nd, Pr, and Eu) in a large and homogeneous sample of 160 F-, G-, and K-type planet-host stars located in the northern hemisphere, including 32 stars in multi-planetary systems. The sample hosts a total of 175 high-mass planets and 47 Neptunian and super-Earth planets. High-resolution spectra were obtained with the 1.65-metre telescope at the Molėtai Astronomical Observatory using a fibre-fed spectrograph covering 4000-8500 Å. Elemental abundances were determined by differential line-by-line spectrum synthesis with the TURBOSPECTRUM code and MARCS model atmospheres. The analysis of $[\mathrm{El}/\mathrm{Fe}]$ ratios shows that most elements in PHSs follow the Galactic chemical evolution, but $[\mathrm{Zr}/\mathrm{Fe}]$, $[\mathrm{La}/\mathrm{Fe}]$, and $[\mathrm{Ce}/\mathrm{Fe}]$ are overabundant in PHSs relative to reference stars at a given $[\mathrm{Fe}/\mathrm{H}]$. Correlations between $[\mathrm{El}/\mathrm{Fe}]$ and planet mass are generally positive, except for Sr, Y, and Ba, which show no significant trends. The distribution of $\Delta[\mathrm{El}/\mathrm{H}]$ versus condensation temperature ($T_{\mathrm{cond}}$) slopes is positively skewed for PHSs, indicating enrichment in refractory elements compared to analogues. While no strong correlations are found between $\Delta[\mathrm{El}/\mathrm{H}]$-$T_{\mathrm{cond}}$ slopes and stellar or planetary parameters, older dwarf stars with multiple planets tend to have smaller or negative slopes, whereas younger dwarf stars exhibit larger positive slopes. Our results also confirm that multi-planetary systems are more frequent around metal-rich stars.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the performance of a newly implemented fourth-order accurate finite-volume HLLC Riemann solver in the adaptive-mesh-refinement numerical relativity code {\tt SACRA-MPI}. First, we validate our implementation in one-dimensional special relativistic hydrodynamics tests, i.e., a simple wave and shock tube test, which have analytic solutions. We demonstrate that the fourth-order convergence is achieved for the smooth flow, which cannot be achieved in our original second-order accurate finite-volume Riemann solver. We also show that our new solver is robust for the strong shock wave emergence problem. Second, we validate the implementation in a dynamical spacetime by demonstrating that {\tt SACRA-MPI} perfectly preserves the $\pi$-symmetry without imposing the $\pi$-symmetry in a short-term ($\sim 20~{\rm ms}$ in the inspiral and subsequent post-merger phase) non-spinning equal-mass binary neutron star merger simulations. Finally, we quantify the accuracy of $\approx 28$ cycles inspiral gravitational waveforms from binary neutron star mergers by conducting a resolution study with $\approx 78, 94$, $118$, and $135$ m. We find that the fourth-order accurate Riemann solver achieves the convergence order $\approx 2.1\pm{0.05}$--$2.4\pm{0.27}$, i.e., slightly evolving with time, in the inspiral gravitational wave phase, while the second-order accurate Riemann solver achieves the convergence order $\approx 2.0\pm{0.5}$. The residual phase error towards the continuum limit at the merger is $0.27\pm 0.07$ rad and $0.58\pm 0.22$ rad out of a total phase of $\approx 176$ rad, respectively, for the fourth- and second-order accurate Riemann solver.

 - **Abstract**
 Using cosmological radiation-hydrodynamical simulations, we study the effect of accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs) on nearby dark-matter (DM) haloes in the very early universe. We find that an SMBH with a spectral energy distribution (SED) extending from the near-ultraviolet to hard X-rays, can produce a radiation background sufficient to delay gravitational collapse in surrounding DM haloes until up to $10^7$ M$_\odot$ of zero-metallicity gas is available for the formation of Population III (Pop III) stars or direct-collapse black holes (DCBHs). We model three scenarios, corresponding to an SMBH located at physical distances of 10, 100, and 1000 kpc from the Pop III host DM halo. Using these three scenarios, we use the SED to compute self-consistent photoionization, photoheating, and photodissociation rates. We include the effects of Compton scattering and gas self-shielding. The X-ray portion of the spectrum maintains an elevated free-electron fraction as the gas collapses to high density. This stimulates H2 formation, allowing the gas to cool further while counteracting the dissociation of H2 by Lyman-Werner radiation. As a result, a large cluster of Pop III stars is expected to form, except in the case with the most intense radiation in which a DCBH may instead form. Our simulated Pop III clusters have comparable HeII 1640 luminosities to the recently discovered Pop III host candidate near GN-z11, observed by the James Webb Space Telescope. In two of the scenarios we consider, the resulting clusters could be detectable using the telescope's NIRSpec instrument out to z ~ 15.

          The Type II SN 2025pht in NGC 1637: A Red Supergiant with Carbon-rich Circumstellar Dust as the First JWST Detection of a Supernova Progenitor Star

 - **Abstract**
 We present follow-up imaging and spectroscopy and pre-explosion imaging of supernova (SN) 2025pht located in NGC 1637 at 12 Mpc. Our spectroscopy shows that SN 2025pht is a Type II SN with broad lines of hydrogen and with minimal line-of-sight extinction inferred from Na I D absorption. NGC 1637 was the target of several epochs of Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) imaging covering the site of SN 2025pht from 31 to 0.7 yr prior to discovery. Using a follow-up HST image of SN 2025pht aligned to these data, we demonstrate that there is a credible progenitor candidate detected in multiple epochs of HST imaging and in JWST imaging from 1.3-8.7 microns, the first JWST counterpart to a SN and the longest wavelength detection of a SN progenitor star. Fitting this source to red supergiant (RSG) spectral-energy distributions (SEDs), we show that it is consistent with a log(L/Lsun) = 5.0 RSG heavily reddened by circumstellar dust. The JWST photometry enable strong constraints on the nature of the circumstellar medium, and we find that the SED favors graphite-rich dust and an optical circumstellar extinction of Av = 5.3 mag as opposed to silicate-rich dust. We discuss the implications of a pre-SN RSG enshrouded in carbon-rich dust and this finding for the overall population of progenitor stars to Type II SN as well as the future of SN progenitor star discovery with JWST.

          An Ultraviolet Study of CO Chemistry in the Magellanic Clouds

 - **Abstract**
 How does molecular cloud chemistry change with metallicity? In this work, we study the relation between molecular hydrogen ($H_2$) and carbon monoxide (CO) at $1/2$ and $1/5$ solar metallicity using ultraviolet absorption spectroscopy obtained as part of the UV Legacy Library of Young Stars as Essential Standards (ULLYSES) Hubble Space Telescope (HST) program. We determine CO column densities or upper limits for a sample of 50 lines of sight through the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC and SMC). $^{12}$CO is detected along eight lines of sight and $^{13}$CO is detected along two. Combining our new CO column densities with $N_{H_2}$ measurements from the literature, we find that the evolution of $N_{CO}(N_{H_2})$ from the Milky Way to the LMC and SMC is a relatively shallow function of metallicity. Taking $N_{CO}>3\times10^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$ as a threshold value above which CO emission is likely to be detectable at the distance of the Magellanic Clouds, the $\log_{10} N_{H_2}$ at which a sightline has a 50% probability of having $N_{CO}$ above this threshold is 20.8 in the Milky Way, 20.9 in the LMC, and 21.1 in the SMC. This is an 0.3 dex change in threshold $\log_{10} N_{H_2}$ over an 0.7 dex change in metallicity. We compare our measurements with $N_{CO}(N_{H_2})$ relations from literature chemical models and find that the measured relations agree best with models in which the dynamical timescale is longer than the chemical timescale for $H_2$ but shorter than the chemical timescale for CO.

          $r$-process Abundance Dispersion in the Globular Cluster M5 using Keck Archival Data

 - **Abstract**
 We studied $28$ RGB stars in the mildly metal-rich globular cluster M5 ([Fe/H] $= -1.29$) using archival high-resolution spectra from the Keck Observatory archive (KOA) to better understand the $r$-process in globular clusters. Previous studies (M15, M92, and NGC 2298) have shown $r$-process dispersion in varying amounts, hinting at the source of the $r$-process in those clusters. We extend these dispersion studies to the more metal-rich cluster M5 by studying the rare-earth peak, specifically the elements Ba, Nd, and Eu. We separately analyze the different stellar generations, as traced by the abundance of Na and O. Based on the Nd and Eu abundances, we report a tenuous detection of $r$-process dispersion that is dependent on the generation and element. Based on a log-likelihood dispersion study accounting for measurement errors, Nd has an intrinsic first generation abundance spread of $\sigma_{1G}(\text{Nd}) = 0.15_{-0.07}^{+0.10}$ and an $2\sigma$ upper limit on the second generation spread of $\sigma_{2G}(\text{Nd}) < 0.28$. The upper limits on the Eu intrinsic spread are $\sigma_{1G}(\text{Eu}) < 0.34$ and $\sigma_{2G}(\text{Eu}) < 0.16$. A potential dispersion implies the cluster gas was inhomogeneously polluted, either due to an event concurrent with the formation of the cluster or due to clouds of disparate composition that coalesced to form the cluster.

          Explosions of pulsating red supergiants: a natural pathway for the diversity of Type II-P/L supernovae

 - **Abstract**
 Red supergiants (RSGs), which are progenitors of hydrogen-rich Type II supernovae (SNe), have been known to pulsate from both observations and theory. The pulsations can be present at core collapse and affect the resulting SN. However, SN light curve models of such RSGs commonly use hydrostatic progenitor models and ignore pulsations. Here, we model the final stages of a 15 solar-mass RSG and self-consistently follow the hydrodynamical evolution. We find the growth of large amplitude radial pulsations in the envelope. After a transient phase where the envelope restructures, the pulsations settle to a steady and periodic oscillation with a period of 817 days. We show that they are driven by the $\kappa\gamma$-mechanism, which is an interplay between changing opacities and the release of recombination energy of hydrogen and helium. This leads to complex and non-coherent expansion and contraction in different parts of the envelope, which greatly affect the SN progenitor properties, including its location in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. We simulate SN explosions of this model at different pulsations phases. Explosions in the compressed state result in a flat light curve (Type II-P). In contrast, the SN light curve in the expanded state declines rapidly, reminiscent of a Type II-L SN. For cases in between, we find light curves with various decline rates. Features in the SN light curves are directly connected to features in the density profiles. These are in turn linked to the envelope ionization structure, which is the driving mechanism of the pulsations. We predict that some of the observed diversity in Type II SN light curves can be explained by RSG pulsations. For more massive RSGs, we expect stronger pulsations that might even lead to dynamical mass ejections of the envelope and to an increased diversity in SN light curves.

 - **Abstract**
 LLNL has recently setup a High Contrast Testbed (HCT) for AO and exoplanet imaging technology development. We present the various HCT technologies currently under development, including (1) a Wynne corrector, (2) multi-wavefront sensor (WFS) single conjugate AO (SCAO) control. We present HCT testing results of a first Wynne corrector prototype with a self-coherent camera. We present updates on development efforts to design and apply multi-WFS SCAO control to our HCT setup. We also present ongoing HCT deformable mirror and WFS upgrades. Lastly, we present developments for REDWOODS, a project to deploy many of these technologies on-sky on a sub-bench of the Shane AO system at Lick Observatory.

          SQ-A: A Collision Triggered Starburst in Intra-Group Medium of Stephan's Quintet

 - **Abstract**
 We present new observational evidence supporting the hypothesis that SQ-A, a starburst in the intra-group medium (IGrM) of Stephan's Quintet (SQ), is triggered by a high-speed collision between two gas systems, one associated with the IGrM (v~6900 km/s) and another with the intruder galaxy NGC7318b (v~6000 km/s). The new ALMA CO(2-1) dataset has angular resolutions between 0.2" and 7.0" and the new VLA HI datacube an angular resolution of 6.6" * 7.9". The CO maps show that the two gas systems are bridged by another system with an intermediate velocity of ~6600 km/s, whereas the HI data show that the component of v~6600 km/s fits well into a gap in the more extended v~6000 km/s component, albeit with a displacement of ~5 kpc. Both the bridge and the complementary distributions between different gas systems are common features of starbursts triggered by cloud-cloud collision. An analysis of clumps (sizes of 100--200 pc) reveals very diversified star formation (SF) activity in clumps belonging to different kinematic systems, with the molecular gas depletion time of the v~6900 km/s clumps more than 10 times longer than that of the v~6600 km/s clumps. The results are consistent with a scenario in which the enhanced SF activity (and the starburst) in the system of v~6600 km/s is due to gas compression generated in cloud-cloud collisions, whereas the suppression of SF in the v~6900 km/s system is due to vortices (i.e. gas rotation) generated in more complex collisions involving dense clouds and diffuse intercloud gas accompanied by blast-wave shocks.

          Discovery of H$α$ Emission from a Protoplanet Candidate Around the Young Star 2MASS J16120668-3010270 with MagAO-X

 - **Abstract**
 2MASS J16120668-3010270 (hereafter 2MJ1612) is a young M0 star that hosts a protoplanetary disk in the Upper Scorpious star-forming region. Recent ALMA observations of 2MJ1612 show a mildly inclined disk ($i$=37$^\circ$) with a large dust-depleted gap (R$_\text{cav}\approx$0.4" or 53 au). We present high-contrast H$\alpha$ observations from MagAO-X on the 6.5m Magellan Telescope and new high resolution sub-mm dust continuum observations with ALMA of 2MJ1612. On both 2025 April 13 and 16, we recovered a point source with H$\alpha$ excess with SNR $\gtrsim$5 within the disk gap in our MagAO-X Angular and Spectral Differential (ASDI) images at a separation of 141.96$\pm$2.10 mas (23.45$\pm$0.29 au deprojected) from the star and position angle (PA)= 159.00$\pm$0.55$^\circ$. Furthermore, this H$\alpha$ source is within close proximity to a K band point source in SPHERE/IRDIS observation taken on 2023 July 21 \citep{sphere2025sub}. The astrometric offset between the K band and H$\alpha$ source can be explained by orbital motion of a bound companion. Thus our observations can be best explained by the discovery of an accreting protoplanet, 2MJ1612 b, with an estimated mass of 4$M_\text{Jup}$ and H$\alpha$ line flux ranging from (29.7 $\pm$7.5)$\times$10$^{-16}$ ergs/s/cm$^2$ to (8.2$\pm$3.4)$\times$10$^{-16}$ ergs/s/cm$^2$. 2MJ1612 b is likely the third example of an accreting H$\alpha$ protoplanet responsible for carving the gap in its host disk, joining PDS 70b and c. Further study is necessary to confirm and characterize this protoplanet candidate and to identify any additional protoplanets that may also play a role in shaping the gap.

          Demonstrating the velocity response of a table-top EPR Speedmeter

 - **Abstract**
 The sensitivity of gravitational-wave interferometers is fundamentally limited by quantum noise, as dictated by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, due to their continuous position measurement of the end mirrors. Speedmeter configurations, which measure mirror velocity rather than position, have been proposed as a means to suppress quantum back-action noise, but practical implementations remain at an early stage. In this work, we present a table-top realisation of the Einstein- Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) Speedmeter concept, employing an optical readout scheme based on two orthogonal polarisation modes that probe the interferometer with different effective bandwidths. Using a triangular cavity, we demonstrate that the differential optical response between the linear p- and s-polarised modes exhibits a speed-like frequency dependence: vanishing at DC and increasing linearly with signal frequency, up to the bandwidth of the slower mode. With this we show that an optical system equivalent to the EPR Speedmeter indeed performs a velocity readout of the end mirror.

          High-Resolution Simulations of the Interaction Between the Nova/Supernova Ejecta and the Accretion Disk

 - **Abstract**
 Many nova and type Ia supernova explosion scenarios involve accretion disks. However, direct numerical simulations of these explosive phenomena have barely addressed the question of the impact of ejecta-disk collision on the midterm evolution of such explosions. This is particularly critical for a better understanding of classical and recurrent novae, where each nova cycle depends on the imprint left by the precedent explosion. In this work, we describe and analyze a set of high-resolution simulations of the ejecta-disk interaction. We show that, depending on the initial configuration of the binary system, the disk is partially or, more often, totally destroyed, which will impact the next nova-explosion cycle. In the case of type Ia supernovae, the much larger kinetic energy carried by the ejecta always provokes complete destruction of the accretion disk. We also discuss the alterations induced in the geometry of the ejecta by the shielding effect of the disk, which has shown to cause reduced contamination of the companion star up to a factor \sim 1.5 - 2 in key nuclei produced during the nova outburst. In the framework of recurrent nova simulations, we report for the first time on the formation of a cavity in the ejecta after its interaction with the disk. We also describe the onset and development of several hydrodynamic instabilities such as Kelvin-Helmholtz and Richtmyer-Meshkov.

 - **Abstract**
 A review of several analyses is presented that forces the conclusion that the mass composition of the highest-energy cosmic rays is not proton-dominated. This deduction, combined with the use of a modern hadronic interaction model, should lead to a re-evaluation of the energy spectrum reported by the Telescope Collaboration that may well bring that measurement, and the corresponding one from the Pierre Auger Observatory, into better agreement.

          Improving Air Shower Simulations by Tuning Pythia 8/Angantyr with Accelerator Data

 - **Abstract**
 We present a combined analysis of the Pythia 8 event generator using accelerator data and evaluate its impact on air shower observables. Reliable simulations with event generators are essential for particle physics analyses, achievable through advanced tuning to experimental data. Pythia 8 has emerged as a promising high-energy interaction model for cosmic ray air shower simulations, offering well-documented parameter settings and a user-friendly interface to enable automatic tuning efforts. Using data from collider and fixed-target experiments, we first derive tunes for each domain separately, before tuning both domains simultaneously. To achieve this, we define a core set of observables and quantify their dependence on selected parameters. The tuning efforts are based on gradient descent and Bayesian methods, the latter providing a full uncertainty propagation of the parameters to the observables. Results for the impact of a combined analysis for the Pythia 8/Angantyr event generator on air shower observables, such as particle densities at ground level and energy deposit profiles, are presented.

          Propagation of Precessing Jet in Envelope of Tidal Disruption Events

 - **Abstract**
 It is likely that the disk of a tidal disruption event (TDE) is misaligned with respect to the equatorial plane of the spinning supermassive black hole (SMBH), since the initial stellar orbit before disruption is most likely has an inclined orbital plane. Such misaligned disk undergoes Lense-Thirring precession around the SMBH spin axis, leading to a precessing jet if launched in the vicinity of the SMBH and aligned with the disk angular momentum. The bound debris can also build a thick envelope which powers optical emission. In this work, we study the propagation of the precessing jet in the TDE envelope. We adopt a ``zero-Bernoulli accretion'' (ZEBRA) envelope model. A episodic jet will be observed if the line of sight is just at the envelope pole direction and $\theta_{\rm LT}=\theta_{\rm env}$, since the jet can freely escape from this low density rotation funnel, where $\theta_{\rm LT}$ and $\theta_{\rm env}$ are the jet precessing angle and the angle between the envelope polar axis and the SMBH spin axis, respectively. The jet will be choked at other directions. For $\theta_{\rm LT} < \theta_{\rm env}$, the jets can also break out of the envelope for very small precession angle $\theta_{\rm LT}$ or if the jet is aligned with SMBH spin. If the jet is choked within the envelope, the radiation produced during cocoon shock breakout will imprint characteris

          Bulk viscous cosmological models with cosmological constant: Observational constraints

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate whether viscous cold dark matter (vCDM) in a $\Lambda$-dominated FLRW universe can alleviate the Hubble tension while satisfying thermodynamic constraints, examining both flat and curved geometries. We model vCDM with bulk viscosity $\zeta = \zeta_0\,(\Omega_{vc}/\Omega_{vc0})^m$, where $m$ determines the viscosity evolution and $\Omega_{vc}$ is the density parameter of vCDM. We explore two particular scenarios: constant viscosity ($m=0$), and variable viscosity ($m$ free). Using Bayesian inference, we constrain these models with the latest datasets: the Pantheon+ SN Ia sample (both with SH0ES calibration, PPS, and without it, PP), $H(z)$ measurements from CC and BAO as separate datasets, and a Gaussian prior on $H_0$ from 2022 SH0ES baseline, $H_0=73.04 \pm 1.04$ km/s/Mpc (R22 prior). We compare the models via information criteria such as AIC, BIC, DIC, and Bayesian evidence. Our results reveal that the Hubble tension persists, although it shows partial alleviation ($\sim 1\sigma$ tension) in all investigated scenarios when local measurements are included. For the flat $m=0$ case, the joint analysis yields $H_0 = 71.05^{+0.62}_{-0.60}$ km/s/Mpc. Curved model initially favors $\Omega_{K0} > 0$ (at more than $2\sigma$), but this preference shifts toward flatness once the PPS+R22 prior are included. Notably, the current viscosity is constrained to $\zeta_0 \sim 10^6$ Pa s in all scenarios, in agreement with the thermodynamic requirements. Although model selection via BIC and Bayesian evidence favors $\Lambda$CDM, AIC and DIC show mild support for viscous models in some datasets. Bulk viscous models moderately improve fits but neither resolve the Hubble tension nor outperform the $\Lambda$CDM model. To achieve more robust constraints, future analyses should incorporate CMB observations, which are expected to break parameter degeneracies involving $m$ and $\tilde{\zeta}_0$.

 - **Abstract**
 The formation of dark-matter halos from small cosmological perturbations generated in the early universe is a highly non-linear process typically modeled through N-body simulations. In this work, we explore the use of deep learning to segment and classify proto-halo regions in the initial density field according to their final halo mass at redshift $z=0$. We compare two architectures: a fully convolutional neural network (CNN) based on the V-Net design and a U-Net transformer. We find that the transformer-based network significantly outperforms the CNN across all metrics, achieving sub-percent error in the total segmented mass per halo class. Both networks deliver much higher accuracy than the perturbation-theory-based model \textsc{pinocchio}, especially at low halo masses and in the detailed reconstruction of proto-halo boundaries. We also investigate the impact of different input features by training models on the density field, the tidal shear, and their combination. Finally, we use Grad-CAM to generate class-activation heatmaps for the CNN, providing preliminary yet suggestive insights into how the network exploits the input fields.

 - **Abstract**
 JWST has revealed a new high-redshift population called little red dots (LRDs). Since LRDs may be in the early phase of black hole growth, identifying them in the early universe is crucial for understanding the formation of the first supermassive black holes. However, no robust LRD candidates have been identified at $z>10$, because commonly-used NIRCam photometry covers wavelengths up to $\sim5\,{\rm \mu m}$ and is insufficient to capture the characteristic V-shaped spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of LRDs. In this study, we present the first search for $z\gtrsim10$ LRD candidates using both NIRCam and MIRI imaging from COSMOS-Web, which provides the largest joint NIRCam-MIRI coverage to date ($0.20\,{\rm deg^2}$). Taking advantage of MIRI/F770W to remove contaminants, we identify one robust candidate, CW-LRD-z10 at $z_{\rm phot}=10.5^{+0.7}_{-0.6}$ with $M_{\rm UV}=-19.9^{+0.1}_{-0.2}\,{\rm mag}$. CW-LRD-z10 exhibits a compact morphology, a distinct V-shaped SED, and a non-detection in F115W, all consistent with being an LRD at $z\sim10$. Based on this discovery, we place the first constraint on the number density of LRDs at $z\sim10$ with $M_{\rm UV}\sim-20$ of $1.2^{+2.7}_{-1.0}\times10^{-6}\,{\rm Mpc^{-3}\,mag^{-1}}$, suggesting that the fraction of LRDs among the overall galaxy population increases with redshift, reaching $\sim3\%$ at $z\sim10$. Although deep spectroscopy is necessary to confirm the redshift and the nature of CW-LRD-z10, our results imply that LRDs may be a common population at $z>10$, playing a key role in the first supermassive black hole formation.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first astrophysical detection of methanol (CH3OH) in the torsional band near 25 um. Using high resolution mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopy, we identified over seventy gas-phase CH3OH absorption lines between 20 and 28 um towards the massive protostar NGC 7538 IRS 1 with SOFIA/EXES. We derive a temperature of 180 K and a total column density of 2 x 10^17 cm-2, comparable to sub-mm measurements. Complementary analysis of acetylene (C2H2) absorption lines is also included. Both CH3OH and C2H2 reveal an unresolved second velocity component. These MIR absorption lines likely probe the molecular material in two edge-on disks, supporting the scenario that NGC 7538 IRS 1 consists of multiple protostars. We provide an updated line list for the torsional band of CH3OH, which was generated from lab work and model calculations. This discovery and the updated line list will enable the search for CH3OH in JWST/MIRI spectra.

 - **Abstract**
 The Gaia mission is transforming our view of the Milky Way by providing distances towards a billion stars, and much more. The third data release includes nearly a million spectra from its Radial Velocity Spectrometer (RVS). Identifying unexpected features in such vast datasets presents a significant challenge. It is impossible to visually inspect all of the spectra and difficult to analyze them in a comprehensive way. In order to supplement traditional analysis approaches, and in order to facilitate deeper insights from these spectra, we present a new dataset together with an interactive portal that applies established self-supervised metric learning techniques, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection, to allow researchers to visualize, analyze, and interact with the Gaia RVS spectra in straightforward but under-utilized manner. We demonstrate a few example interactions with the dataset, examining groupings and the most unusual RVS spectra, according to our metric. This combination of methodology and public availability enables broader exploration, and may reveal yet-to-be-discovered stellar phenomena.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate how dust foreground complexity can affect measurements of the tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r$, in the context of the Simons Observatory, using a cross-spectrum component separation analysis. Employing a suite of simulations with realistic Galactic dust emission, we find that spatial variation in the dust frequency spectrum, parametrized by $\beta_d$, can bias the estimate for $r$ when modeled using a low-order moment expansion to capture this spatial variation. While this approach performs well across a broad range of dust complexity, the bias increases with more extreme spatial variation in dust frequency spectrum, reaching as high as $r\sim0.03$ for simulations with no primordial tensors and a spatial dispersion of $\sigma(\beta_d)\simeq0.3$ -- the most extreme case considered, yet still consistent with current observational constraints. This bias is driven by changes in the $\ell$-dependence of the dust power spectrum as a function of frequency that can mimic a primordial $B$-mode tensor signal. Although low-order moment expansions fail to capture the full effect when the spatial variations of $\beta_d$ become large and highly non-Gaussian, our results show that extended parametric methods can still recover unbiased estimates of $r$ under a wide range of dust complexities. We further find that the bias in $r$, at the highest degrees of dust complexity, is largely insensitive to the spatial structure of the dust amplitude and is instead dominated by spatial correlations between $\beta_d$ and dust amplitude, particularly at higher orders. If $\beta_d$ does spatially vary at the highest levels investigated here, we would expect to use more flexible foreground models to achieve an unbiased constraint on $r$ for the noise levels anticipated from the Simons Observatory.

          An investigation of a varying G through Strong Lensing and SNe Ia observations

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we analyze the potential variation of the gravitational constant $G$ using data from strong gravitational lensing systems and Type Ia supernovae. Testing $G(z)$ parameterizations where $G(z) = G_0(1 + G_1z)$ and $G(z) = G_0(1 + z)^{G_1}$, we also account for the influence of $G$ on the luminosity of SNe Ia through the Chandrasekhar mass-luminosity relation. Only the flat universe hypothesis is considered. Constraints from 158 lensing systems and the Pantheon+ sample show no significant evidence of $G$ variation. However, although the results are compatible with no variation, the errors are not yet sufficiently restrictive to rule out any variation of $G$ with high statistical confidence. This study highlights the viability of using combined astrophysical data to probe variations in fundamental constants, suggesting that future surveys could refine these constraints.

          Towards the Habitable Worlds Observatory: 1D CNN Retrieval of Reflection Spectra from Evolving Earth Analogs

 - **Abstract**
 Upcoming direct-imaging missions like the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) aim to characterize dozens of Earth-like exoplanets by capturing their reflected-light spectra. However, traditional atmospheric retrieval frameworks are too computationally intensive to explore the high-dimensional parameter spaces such missions will generate. Here, we present a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D CNN), trained on over one million synthetic, noise-injected spectra simulating Archean, Proterozoic, and Modern Earth analogs, as observed by LUVOIR-B (0.2-2.0 $\mu$m) and HabEx/SS (0.2-1.8 $\mu$m). Our model simultaneously infers six molecular abundances (including biosignatures O$_2$ and O$_3$) along with radius, gravity, surface pressure, and temperature. Inference on unseen test data is performed via Monte Carlo Dropout, enabling uncertainty estimation across thousands of realizations within seconds. The network performs best where spectral features are prominent, accurately recovering CH$_4$ and CO$_2$ in Archean atmospheres and O$_2$ and O$_3$ in Modern cases, while avoiding false positives and outputting near-zero abundances in scenarios of true absence such as Archean O$_2$ and O$_3$. Interpretation via Integrated Gradients confirms that the model bases its predictions on physically meaningful features, including the Fraunhofer A band for O$_2$, and the Hartley-Huggins band for O$_3$. Credibility curve analysis indicates that O$_3$ remains retrievable across a wide range of stellar types and distances, while O$_2$ is detectable out to 12 pc around FG stars. These results elevate the CNN from proof of concept to a mission-ready retrieval engine, capable of processing direct-imaging spectra with HWO on an operational cadence.

 - **Abstract**
 While much work has gone into associating neutrino emission with various sources, very few sources have emerged. With the recent publication of IceCube Event Catalog (IceCat-1), the IceCube neutrino observatory has released a list of the most promising astrophysical neutrino events since operations began in 2010. Using the archival data from the High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) gamma-ray observatory, we perform a coincidence search for gamma rays and neutrinos using a Bayesian Block algorithm with the public IceCube alerts from IceCat-1 and the Astrophysical Multi-messenger Observatory Network (AMON). Of the 350 alerts considered, 25 detections were found, with 1 coinciding with the flaring HAWC source Markarian 421, an active galactic nuclei. We present the performance of this method and a discussion of physics implications.

          HD 5501: A Rapidly Evolving Interacting Eclipsing Binary with a Variable Light Curve and H$α$ Emission

 - **Abstract**
 HD~5501, a hitherto little studied eclipsing binary with an early A-type primary, has been caught in a short-lived, astrophysically interesting phase of its binary evolution. Recent photometric and spectroscopic observations, including photometric data from {\it TESS}, show it has a highly variable light curve as well as complex spectral variability, particularly in both the absorption and emission components at H~$\alpha$. Our current campaign, including both professional and amateur observers, has determined that the primary is evolving rapidly across the Hertzsprung gap and that, unusually in the case of mass transfer, the orbital period is declining with a characteristic time-scale $P/\dot{P} \approx$ 170,000 years. Significantly, the orbit is eccentric and it appears that mass transfer from the primary to the secondary occurs only near periastron. Modeling indicates the presumed B7 V secondary to be surrounded by an accretion torus, which likely has dynamically chaotic variations in size and shape. Our analysis further implies the presence of a circumbinary disc or shell supplied by mass loss through the Lagrange $L_3$ point. That mass loss appears to account for most of the emission at H$\alpha$. We describe how this astrophysically interesting system may yield valuable information about binary star evolution at the onset of Roche-lobe overflow, as well as insights into eccentricity-modifying mechanisms such as the Soker mechanism.

          Reliability of 1D radiative-convective photochemical-equilibrium retrievals on transit spectra of WASP-107b

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of WASP-107b suggest a metal-rich and carbon-deprived atmosphere with an extremely hot interior based on detections of SO$_2$, H$_2$O, CO$_2$, CO, NH$_3$, and CH$_4$. In this paper, we aim to determine the reliability of a 1D radiative-convective photochemical-equilibrium (1D-RCPE) retrieval method in inferring atmospheric properties of WASP-107b. Our grid of radiative-convective balanced pressure-temperature profiles and 1D photochemical equilibrated models covers a range of metallicities (Z), carbon-to-oxygen ratios (C/O), intrinsic temperatures (T$_{int}$), and eddy diffusion coefficients (K$_{zz}$). We obtain good fits with our 1D-RCPE retrievals based on a few molecular features of H$_2$O, CO$_2$, SO$_2$, and CH$_4$, but find no substantial contribution of NH$_3$. We find that the degeneracy between metallicity, cloud pressure, and a model offset is broken by the presence of strong SO$_2$ features, confirming that SO$_2$ is a robust metallicity indicator. We systematically retrieve sub-solar C/O based on the relative amplitude of a strong CO$_2$ feature with respect to the broad band of H$_2$O, which is sensitive to a wavelength-dependent scattering slope. We find that high-altitude clouds obscure the CH$_4$-rich layers, preventing the retrievals from constraining T$_{int}$, but that higher values of K$_{zz}$ can transport material above the cloud deck, allowing a fit of the CH$_4$ feature. However, T$_{int}$ and K$_{zz}$ can vary substantially between retrievals depending on the adopted cloud parametrization. We conclude that the 1D-RCPE retrieval method can provide useful insights if the underlying grid of forward models is well understood. We find that WASP-107b's atmosphere is enriched in metals (3 to 5 times solar) and carbon-deprived (C/O <= 0.20). However, we lack robust constraints on the intrinsic temperature and vertical mixing strength.

 - **Abstract**
 With over two dozen detections in the Milky Way, double neutron stars (DNSs) provide a unique window into massive binary evolution. We use the POSYDON binary population synthesis code to model DNS populations and compare them to the observed Galactic sample. By tracing their origins to underlying single and binary star physics, we place constraints on the detailed evolutionary stages leading to DNS formation. Our study reveals a bifurcation within the well-known common envelope formation channel for DNSs, which naturally explains an observed split in the orbital periods of the Galactic systems. The two sub-channels are defined by whether the donor star has a helium core (Case B mass transfer) or a carbon-oxygen core (Case C) at the onset of the common envelope, with only the helium core systems eventually merging due to gravitational wave-modulated orbital decay. However, producing DNSs through both sub-channels requires either a generous core definition of $\simeq$ 30% H-fraction or a high common envelope ejection efficiency of $\alpha_{\rm CE}\gtrsim1.2$. By testing different supernova kick velocity models, we find that galactic DNSs are best reproduced using a prescription that favors low velocity kicks ($\lesssim 50 \, \rm km/s$), in agreement with previous studies. Furthermore, our models indicate that merging DNSs are born from a stripped progenitor with a median pre-supernova envelope mass $\sim$ 0.2$M_{\odot}$. Our results highlight the value of detailed evolutionary models for improving our understanding of exotic binary star formation.

          Accretion disc reverberation mapping in a high-redshift quasar

 - **Abstract**
 Powered by supermassive black holes at their centers, quasars are among the most luminous objects in the Universe, serving as important probes of cosmic history and galaxy evolution. The size of the accretion disc surrounding the black hole is a critical parameter for understanding quasar physics and their potential use as standard candles in cosmology. However, direct measurements of accretion disc sizes have so far been confined to the Local Universe ($z<0.2$), limiting our understanding of quasars during the peak of cosmic activity. Here, we report the first direct measurement of the accretion disc size in the quasar QSO J0455-4216 at $z=2.66$, when the Universe was only $\sim2$ Gyrs old. Medium-band filters mounted on the MPG/ESO 2.2-metre telescope at La Silla Observatory were used to isolate continuum emission regions during a six-month monitoring campaign. The light curves exhibit pronounced variability features and enabled the detection of inter-band time delays from different parts of the disc. We mapped the disc and located its ultraviolet-emitting outermost region at $3.02^{+0.33}_{-0.57}$ light-days from the black hole ($\sim 500$ AU). Given a supermassive black hole 900 million times the mass of the Sun, these measurements validate accretion disc theory at an unprecedented redshift and pave the way for efficient black hole mass estimates, reducing decades-long spectroscopic reverberation campaigns to just a few years or less.

          Instrumental Polarization in Stellar Coronagraphy: Coherent Behavior and its Implications for Dark Hole Optimization

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar coronagraphs designed for high-contrast imaging of exoplanets inevitably introduce a small amount of instrumental polarization, called \emph{secondary polarization}. At the contrast levels required to detect and characterize terrestrial planets, these effects may become significant. Instrumentally induced polarization is often referred to as ``incoherent," yet this use of the term lacks rigor. This work uses Jones calculus and vector field simulations, including interactions with dielectric surfaces to show that the secondary polarization is fully coherent with the input field, but it does not interfere with it due to orthogonality. A key consequence of the coherence secondary polarization is that the process of creating a dark hole in the primary polarization tends to also significantly mitigate the intensity corresponding to the secondary polarization, called the \emph{secondary intensity}, in the dark hole region. This reduction of the secondary intensity may lead to relaxed polarization design requirements in future coronagraphs. Additionally, if the contrast is sufficient to make the secondary intensity non-negligible, modulation schemes to separate the planet from the instrumental light need to account for the modulation of the secondary intensity.

          A 50 s quasi-periodic oscillation in the early X-ray afterglow of GRB 220711B

 - **Abstract**
 It is generally believed that long duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) originate from the core collapse of rapidly spinning massive stars and at least some of them are powered by hyper-accreting black holes. However, definite proofs about the progenitor and central engine of these GRBs have not been directly observed in the past. Here we report the existence of a Quasi-Periodic Oscillation (QPO) signature with periodic frequency $\sim$0.02 Hz in the early X-ray afterglow phase of GRB 220711B. Such a low-frequency QPO likely signals the precession of a relativistic jet launched from a GRB hyper-accreting black hole central engine. The energy injection signature from the \textbf{late} X-ray observations (from $5\times 10^2s\sim 1\times10^4s$) is consistent with the precession hypothesis. The prompt $\gamma$-ray light curve does not show any QPO signature, suggesting that the X-ray flaring emission in the early afterglow phase and prompt emission likely originate from different accretion processess, indicating that the progenitor stars of GRBs have a core-envelope structure with a stratified angular momentum distribution and the late-time accretion disk likely has a misalignment with respect to the rotation axis of the black hole. Such a misalignment is not expected in a canonical collapsar model. As a result, the QPO signature in GRB 220711B may reveal a new formation channel of long GRBs, possibly a stellar-merger-induced core collapse, with the orbital angular momentum of the binary misaligned with the spin axis of the collapsing star.

 - **Abstract**
 The Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), a flagship ultraviolet/optical/infrared space telescope recommended by the National Academies' Pathways to Discovery in Astronomy and Astrophysics, will require detector technologies capable of supporting significantly larger pixel-count arrays than previous missions. Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors (MKIDs), naturally suited to microwave multiplexing readout, are already in use across several balloon-borne missions with FPGA-based systems. To transition this capability to space, we are developing a radiation-hardened detector readout system that builds directly on the technical and environmental requirements defined by the PRIMA mission. PRIMA serves as a critical pathfinder, informing the radiation tolerance, resource constraints, and on-board processing capabilities needed for HWO. In this work, we present our current results on algorithm implementation, hardware architecture, and firmware development using the radiation-hardened AMD Kintex Ultrascale FPGA, aligning with PRIMA's stringent specifications to ensure compatibility with future space-based observatories like HWO.

 The Solar System hosts the most studied and best understood major and minor planetary bodies - and the only extraterrestrial bodies to have been visited by spacecraft. The Solar System therefore provides important constraints on both the initial stages of planetary growth, communicated to us by its surviving planetesimal populations, and for the final result of the planet formation process represented by the architecture of the system and properties of the individual planets. We review here models of planetesimal formation in the outer Solar System as well as the wealth of recent observational constraints that has been used to formulate and refine modern planetesimal formation theory.

 - **Abstract**
 Core-collapse supernovae drive nucleosynthesis under extreme thermodynamic conditions, and complex mechanisms are at work prompting the transport of heavy elements from deep stellar interiors into outer layers. We present spatially resolved X-ray spectroscopy of Cassiopeia A's (Cas A) northeastern (NE) jet using the archival 1 Ms Chandra/ACIS observations, and focusing on three fingers of the jet. We report the highest Cr/Fe mass ratio (Cr/Fe $\sim0.14$) ever observed in Cas A, localized in a compact region within the southernmost finger in the NE jet. Comparisons with nucleosynthesis models indicate that the NE jet originated approximately at the boundary separating the complete Si burning layer from the incomplete Si-burning layer. We also find that mixing from different layers is needed to explain the chemical composition of the three fingers in the NE jet. We also detect significant differences in the physical and chemical properties among the three fingers analyzed of the NE jet. In particular, we find that, unlike the other two, the southernmost finger originated from a slightly more peripheral region of the explosion. Moreover, while the northern and central fingers lie almost in the plane of the sky, the southernmost finger is moving in a different direction, showing a velocity along the line of sight of $\sim2100$ km s$^{-1}$ towards the observer, with a tilt angle of $\sim16$\textdegree. These findings highlight the NE jet's role in ejecting material from the deepest explosive burning layers, providing new insights into the asymmetries originating in the inner layers of core-collapse supernovae.

 - **Abstract**
 The 21 cm radiation of neutral hydrogen provides crucial information for studying the early universe and its evolution. To advance this research, countries have made significant investments in constructing large low-frequency radio telescope arrays, such as the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) and the Square Kilometre Array Phase 1 Low Frequency (SKA1-low). These instruments are pivotal for radio astronomy research. However, challenges such as ionospheric plasma interference, ambient radio noise, and instrument-related effects have become increasingly prominent, posing major obstacles in cosmology research. To address these issues, this paper proposes an efficient signal processing method that combines wavelet transform and mathematical morphology. The method involves the following steps: Background Subtraction: Background interference in radio observation signals is eliminated. Wavelet Transform: The signal, after removing background noise, undergoes a two-dimensional discrete wavelet transform. Threshold processing is then applied to the wavelet coefficients to effectively remove interference components. Wavelet Inversion: The processed signal is reconstructed using wavelet inversion. Mathematical Morphology: The reconstructed signal is further optimized using mathematical morphology to refine the results. Experimental verification was conducted using solar observation data from the Xinjiang Observatory and the Yunnan Observatory. The results demonstrate that this method successfully removes interference signals while preserving useful signals, thus improving the accuracy of radio astronomy observations and reducing the impact of radio frequency interference (RFI).

 - **Abstract**
 A gas giant forms a small gas disk called a "circumplanetary disk (CPD)" around the planet during its gas accretion process. The small gas disk contains dust particles like those in a protoplanetary disk, and these particles could be the building material of large moons. A young T Tauri star PDS 70 has two gas accreting planets, and continuum emission from one of the forming planets, PDS 70 c, has been detected by ALMA Bands 6 and 7, which is considered as the dust thermal emission from its CPD. We reproduce the emission with both bands and predict how the dust emission will be observed by ngVLA by expanding the range of the wavelength from submillimeter to centimeter. We find that the flux density of the dust thermal emission can be detected with ngVLA at Band 6 (3 mm) and probably with Band 5 (7 mm) as well. We also find that the size and shape of the CPD can be constrained by observations of ngVLA Band 6 with reasonable observation time.

 - **Abstract**
 A subset of low-mass giants ($<2.2\,M_{\odot}$) exhibit anomalous lithium enhancement behavior, which is still an open topic. Given that more massive giants retain more surface lithium, increasing mass by accreting circumstellar matter could be a channel to enrich lithium. We evaluate this process in the current work. Using MESA, we construct a model of matter accretion, including mass loss, that evolves a star from the main sequence turnoff to the red giant branch tip. The mean accretion rate is estimated from the upper limit of the accreted mass and the evolutionary time of the star during this period, and a grid of accretion rates is constructed. We separately consider their effects on the lithium enhancement of giants, both in terms of the mass and the composition of accretion. Accreting matter with higher lithium abundances has a promoting effect on the lithium enhancement of giants. The accreted matter with excess lithium alleviates the dilution of lithium in the convective envelope during the first dredge-up. The added mass results in lower temperatures at the bottom of the convective envelope, which likewise weakens the depletion of surface lithium. Weak accretion of circumstellar matter is a possible route to lithium enhancement for giants, and it predicts an upper limit on the lithium abundance of $\rm \sim 2.5\,dex$. However, the mass increment it requires poses a potential challenge to real astrophysical environments. Such accretion suppresses lithium dilution and depletion of the star during the first dredge-up, thus exhibiting lithium enhancement behavior.

 - **Abstract**
 The progenitors of Type II-P supernovae (SNe) are generally considered to be red supergiants; however, the so-called "red supergiant problem" indicates that a deeper investigation into the progenitors of this class of SNe is necessary. SN 2009ib and SN 2012ec are two Type II-P SNe for which progenitor candidates have been identified in pre-explosion images. In this work, we use new, late-time Hubble Space Telescope observations to search for the disappearance of these two candidates and confirm their nature. In the case of SN 2009ib, the late-time high-resolution imaging reveals that the progenitor candidate is in fact a blend of multiple unresolved stars. Subsequent difference imaging shows no significant change in brightness at the SN's position even years after the explosion. These findings indicate that the flux from the previously identified source is dominated by unresolved field stars, with little to no contribution from the genuine progenitor. In the case of SN 2012ec, a comparison of pre-explosion and late-time images reveals that the progenitor candidate faded by about 0.6 mag in the F814W band seven years after the explosion, confirming the disappearance of the progenitor.

 - **Abstract**
 We compute the two-loop effective field theory (EFT) power spectrum of dark matter density fluctuations in $\Lambda$CDM using the recently proposed COBRA method (Bakx. et al, 2025). With COBRA, we are able to evaluate the two-loop matter power spectrum in $\sim 1$ millisecond at $ \sim 0.1 \%$ precision on one CPU for arbitrary redshifts and on scales where perturbation theory applies. As an application, we use the nonlinear matter power spectrum from the Dark Sky simulation to assess the performance of the two-loop EFT power spectrum compared to the one-loop EFT power spectrum at $z=0$. We find that, for volumes typical for Stage IV galaxy surveys, $V = 25 \,(\text{Gpc}/h)^3$, the two-loop EFT can provide unbiased cosmological constraints on $\Omega_m,H_0$ and $A_s$ using scales up to $k_\text{max}=0.26\, h/\text{Mpc}$, thereby outperforming the constraints from the one-loop EFT ($k_\text{max}=0.11\, h/\text{Mpc}$). The Figure of Merit on these three parameters increases by a factor $\sim 1.9$ and the one-dimensional marginalized constraints improve by $\sim35\%$ for $\Omega_m$, $\sim20\%$ for $H_0$ and $\sim 15\%$ for $A_s$.

 - **Abstract**
 The substellar initial mass function (IMF) and the formation mechanisms of brown dwarfs (BDs) remain key open questions in star formation theory. IMF characterization in a large number of star-forming regions (SFRs) is essential for constraining these processes. We aim to identify and spectroscopically confirm very low-mass members of the Corona Australis (CrA) SFR to refine its substellar census, determine its low-mass IMF, and compare it to other clusters. Using deep I-band photometry from SuprimeCam/Subaru and data from the VISTA Hemisphere Survey, we identified low-mass BD candidates in CrA. We subsequently obtained NIR spectra of 173 of these candidates with KMOS/VLT, as well as optical spectra for 8 kinematic candidate members using FLOYDS/LCO. The kinematic candidates are confirmed as low-mass stellar members with spectral types M1 to M5. In contrast, all 173 BD candidates observed with KMOS are identified as contaminants. Although the follow-up yielded no new substellar members, it places strong constraints on the number of undetected substellar objects in the region. Combined with literature data, this enables us to derive the substellar IMF, which is consistent with a single power-law slope of alpha = 0.95+-0.06 in the range 0.01-1 MSun or alpha = 0.33+-0.19 in the range 0.01-0.1 MSun. The star-to-BD ratio in CrA is about 2. We also provide updated IMFs and star-to-BD ratios for Lupus3 and ChaI from the SONYC survey, reflecting revised distances from Gaia. Finally, we estimate surface densities and median FUV fluxes for 6 SFRs and clusters and compare their substellar populations as a function of environmental properties. The IMF and star-to-BD ratio show no clear dependence on stellar density or ionizing flux from the massive stars. A combined effect - where one factor enhances and the other suppresses BD formation - also appears unlikely. (Abridged)

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic microwave background data from the Planck satellite, combined with baryon acoustic oscillation measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument and Type Ia supernovae from various samples, provide hints of dynamical dark energy (DE). These results indicate a peak in the DE density around $z\sim 0.4-0.5$, with the highest significance observed when using the supernovae from the Dark Energy Survey. In this Letter, we show that this peak does not necessarily imply a true crossing of the phantom divide if the measured effective DE is not a single component, but a combination of standard and negative quintessence. The latter is characterized by negative energy density and positive pressure, both decreasing in absolute value and tending to 0 in the future. For appropriate values of the parameters, negative quintessence is relevant at intermediate redshifts and becomes subdominant in front of standard quintessence around $z\sim 0.4-0.5$, giving rise to the aforementioned peak in the DE density. We find that our model is preferred over $\Lambda$CDM at a $3.27\sigma$ CL, which is comparable to the level of exclusion found with the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder parametrization. Our analysis leaves open the possibility of negative quintessence and other exotic fields existing in the low-energy universe, potentially playing a significant role in cosmic dynamics.

          Chemical abundances of seven stars in the GD-1 stream

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first detailed chemical abundances for seven GD-1 stream stars from Subaru/HDS spectroscopy. Atmospheric parameters were derived via color calibrations ($T\rm_{eff}$) and iterative spectroscopic analysis. LTE abundances for 14 elements ($\alpha$, odd-Z, iron-peak, n-capture) were measured. Six stars trace the main orbit, one resides in a `blob'. All exhibit tightly clustered metallicities ([Fe/H] = -2.38, {\bf intrinsic dispersion smaller than 0.05 dex, average uncertainty is about 0.13 dex}). While one star shows binary mass transfer signatures, the other six display consistent abundance patterns (dispersions $<$ uncertainties). Their iron-peak elements (Sc, Cr, Mn, Ni) match Milky Way halo stars. In contrast, Y and Sr are systematically lower than halo stars of similar [Fe/H]. Significantly, six stars show consistently enhanced [Eu/Fe] $\sim$ 0.60 ($\sigma$ = 0.08). A tight Ba-Eu correlation (r = 0.83, p=0.04) exists, with [Ba/Fe] = -0.03 $\pm$ 0.05, indicating a common r-process origin. This extreme chemical homogeneity strongly supports an origin from a single disrupted globular cluster. The lack of light-element anti-correlations may stem from our sample size or the progenitor's low mass.

 - **Abstract**
 Deflection of light along the optical path is a major source of image degradation for ground-based telescopes. Methods have been developed to measure upper atmospheric seeing based on models of the turbulence in the atmosphere, but due to boundary conditions, transmission within telescope enclosures is more complex. The Multi-beam Optical Seeing Sensor (MOSS) directly measures the component of the image quality degradation from inhomogeneity of the index of refraction within the telescope dome. MOSS outputs four near-parallel beams of light that travel along the optical path and are imaged by the telescope's detector, landing like starlight on the telescope's focal plane. By using a strobed light source, we can 'freeze' the instantaneous index variations transverse to the optical path. This system captures both 'dome' and 'mirror' seeing. Through plotting the standard deviation of differential motion between pairs of beams, MOSS enables characterization of the length scale of turbulence within the dome. The temporal coherence of temperature gradients can be probed with different pulse lengths, and the spatial coherence by comparing pairs at different separations across the aperture of the telescope. Optical path turbulence measurements, alongside other telemetry metrics, will guide thermal and airflow management to optimize image quality. A MOSS prototype was installed in the 1.2 meter Auxiliary Telescope (AuxTel) at the Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile, and preliminary data constrain the optical path turbulence with a lower bound of 1.4 arcseconds. The optical path turbulence varied throughout the night of observing.

 - **Abstract**
 The non-linear relation between the UV and X-ray luminosity in quasars has been studied for decades. However, as we lack a comprehensive model able to explain it, its investigation still relies on observational efforts. This work focuses on optically selected quasars detected by eROSITA. We present the properties of the sources collected in the eROSITA early data release (eFEDS) and those resulting from the first six months of eROSITA all-sky survey (eRASS1). We focus on the subset of quasars bright enough in the optical/UV band to avoid an ''Eddington bias'' towards X-ray brighter-than-average spectral energy distributions. The final samples include 1,248 and 519 sources for eFEDS and eRASS1, up to redshift $z\approx3$ and $z\approx1.5$, respectively. We found that the X-ray$-$UV luminosity relation shows no significant evolution with redshift, and its slope is in perfect agreement with previous compilations of quasar samples. The intrinsic dispersion of the relation is about 0.2 dex, which is small enough for possible cosmological applications. However, the limited redshift range and statistics of the current samples do not allow us to obtain significant cosmological constraints yet. We show how this is going to change with the future releases of the eROSITA data.

          Discovery of 63 New Young Asteroid Families

 - **Abstract**
 We searched for young asteroid families -- those with ages t_age < 10 Myr and at least three members -- using the proper element catalog from Nesvorny et al. (2024). Our approach employed the Hierarchical Clustering Method (HCM) in a five-dimensional space of proper orbital elements: semimajor axis, eccentricity, inclination, proper nodal longitude, and proper perihelion longitude. The proper longitudes were calculated for various times in the past. Any convergence of these angles at times t < 10 Myr ago was automatically identified by our algorithm as a clustering event in 5D space at time t. Using this method, we successfully recovered all previously known young families (over 40) and discovered 63 additional ones. The formation ages of these families were determined through backward orbital integrations. To validate orbital convergence, we applied three different methods and obtained generally consistent results. Notably, the vast majority of identified young families have the formation ages t_age < 1 Myr. The number and properties of these families provide valuable constraints on the frequency of recent large cratering or catastrophic collisions, offering new insights into the ongoing collisional evolution of the main asteroid belt. Alternatively, at least some of the families identified here could have been produced by the spin-up and rotational fission of their parent bodies. Future studies should address the relative importance of collisions and rotational fission for young asteroid families identified here.

          Can cosmic rotation resolve the Hubble tension? Constraints from CMB and large-scale structure

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate a relativistic cosmological model with background rotation, sourced by a non-perfect fluid with anisotropic stress. A modified version of the CLASS Boltzmann code is employed to perform MCMC analyses against Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and late-time datasets. The results show that current CMB data constrain the present-day rotation parameter to be negligible. As a consequence, the derived cosmological parameters remain consistent with the standard $\Lambda$CDM values. In contrast, late-time probes such as Type Ia supernovae (SNe) and Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) allow for a higher level of rotation and yield an increased Hubble constant. However, this comes at the cost of a higher $\sigma_8$, which remains in tension with DES-Y3 measurement. Combining CMB, SNe and BAO data confirms the preference for non-rotation.

          A Novel Formation Channel for Supermassive Black Hole Binaries in the Early Universe via Primordial Black Holes

 - **Abstract**
 We present a novel formation channel for supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries in the early Universe, driven by primordial black holes (PBHs). Using high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations, we explore the role of massive PBHs ($m_{\rm BH} \sim 10^6 M_\odot$) in catalyzing the formation of direct-collapse black holes (DCBHs), providing a natural in situ pathway for binary SMBH formation. PBHs enhance local overdensities, accelerate structure formation, and exert thermal feedback on the surrounding medium via accretion. Lyman-Werner (LW) radiation from accreting PBHs suppresses H$2$ cooling, shifting the dominant gas coolant to atomic hydrogen. When combined with significant baryon--dark matter streaming velocities ($v_{\rm b\chi} \gtrsim 0.8 \sigma_{\rm b\chi}$, where $\sigma_{\rm b\chi}$ is the root-mean-square streaming velocity), these effects facilitate the formation of dense, gravitationally unstable, atomically cooling gas clouds in the PBH wake. These clouds exhibit sustained high inflow rates ($\dot{M}_{\rm infall} \gtrsim 10^{-2}-10^{-1} M_\odot \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$), providing ideal conditions for DCBH formation from rapidly growing supermassive stars of $\sim 10^5 M_\odot$ at redshift $z\sim 10-20$. The resulting systems form SMBH binaries with initial mass ratios $q\sim O(0.1)$ and separations of $\sim 10$ pc. Such PBH--DCBH binaries provide testable predictions for JWST and ALMA, potentially explaining high-$z$ sources such as Little Red Dots, and represent gravitational-wave sources for future missions like LISA and TianQin, bridging early-Universe black hole physics, multi-messenger astronomy, and dark matter theory.

 - **Abstract**
 Despite many attempts, the origin of UV emission line and continuum in contact binary stars remains unclear. We present a substantial UV spectroscopic analysis of VW Cephei, a late-type contact binary system, using 46 low-resolution spectra from the International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) in the wavelength range 1150-1978 Å. By modelling continuum and emissions lines in individual spectra, we report the significant detection of OIII] (1660 and 1666 Å) and SiIV (1393 and 1402 Å) line complexes. We observe that UV fluxes for both continuum and emission lines like CIV, OIII], CII and SiIV vary significantly (fractional rms variability up to 45%) from hours to years. In addition, line widths also change by hundreds of kilometres/sec. The UV flux variabilities observed in the continuum bands and line emissions are uncorrelated. However, most of the flux values follow the binary orbital period observed from optical data. Our analysis indicates that, while the variation in continuum flux may be attributed to a heated photosphere, the line width measurements indicate that the emission lines are likely formed in the dynamical clouds associated with Roche lobe overflow. We estimate the mass transfer rate of $ \dot{M} = (0.82 \pm 0.01) \times 10^{-7} \ M_{\odot} {yr^{-1}}$ from UV line fluxes, which is in good agreement with optical studies.

 - **Abstract**
 Axion inflation is a well-motivated model of cosmic inflation with a rich phenomenology. The abundant production of gauge fields during axion inflation notably sources a stochastic gravitational-wave (GW) background signal, which nourishes the hope that future GW searches might have a chance to probe the model. In this paper, we scrutinize GW production during axion inflation in the gradient expansion formalism (GEF), a powerful numerical technique that captures the nonlinear dynamics of the system in the limit of vanishing axion gradients. We focus on axion inflation coupled to a pure Abelian gauge sector, i.e., pure axion inflation (PAI), and perform the first-ever comprehensive parameter scan of GW production in the Abelian PAI model close to the onset of strong backreaction. Remarkably enough, we find that GW signals within the reach of future GW interferometers can only be realized in parameter regions that also lead to strong backreaction and that are in conflict with the upper limit on $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$, i.e., the allowed energy density of dark radiation. This observation defines a clear target for future lattice studies of axion inflation that may confirm or improve the predictions of our GEF benchmark.

 - **Abstract**
 We aim to characterize the physical and activity properties of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS through spectroscopic and photometric observations during the first month after its discovery. We performed time-series photometry and long-slit spectroscopy between 2 and 29 July 2025 using multiple ground-based telescopes. Photometric data were calibrated against field stars from the ATLAS and APASS catalogs, and Fourier analysis was applied to derive the comet's rotational period. Spectral data were obtained using the SALT telescope and Nordic Optical Telescope. We report a spin period of $16.16 \pm 0.01$ h with a lightcurve amplitude of approximately 0.3 mag. The comet exhibits increasing dust activity and reddening colors during the observation period, with no visible tail detected, likely due to viewing geometry and low dust production. Dust mass loss rates are estimated between 0.3 and 4.2 kg s^-1, consistent with weakly active distant comets. Spectral colors are similar to those of outer Solar System comets and differ from previously reported values for 3I/ATLAS. The morphological and photometric properties of 3I/ATLAS are consistent with a weakly active comet of outer Solar System origin, despite its interstellar provenance. Continued monitoring around perihelion is necessary to track changes in activity, color, which will provide insights into the evolution of interstellar materials under solar radiation.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a catalog of 8545 and 19,257 unique DA white dwarfs observed in SDSS Data Release 19 and previous SDSS data releases, respectively. This is the largest catalog of both spectroscopic and photometric measurements of DA white dwarfs available to date, and we make this catalog and all code used to create it publicly available. We measure the apparent radial velocity, spectroscopic effective temperature and surface gravity, and photometric effective temperature and radius for all objects in our catalog. We validate our measurements against other published white dwarf catalogs. For apparent radial velocities, surface gravities, and effective temperatures measured from spectra with signal-to-noise ratios $>50$, our measurements agree with published SDSS white dwarf catalogs to within 7.5 km/s, 0.060 dex, and $2.4\%$, respectively. For radii and effective temperatures measured with Gaia photometry, our measurements agree with other published Gaia datasets to within $0.0005$ $R_\odot$ and $3\%$, respectively. We use this catalog to investigate systematic discrepancies between white dwarfs observed in SDSS-V and previous generations of SDSS. For objects observed in both SDSS-V and previous generations, we uncover systematic differences between measured spectroscopic parameters depending on which set of survey data is used. On average, the measured apparent radial velocity of a DA white dwarf is $11.5$ km/s larger and the surface gravity is $0.015$ dex smaller when a white dwarf's spectroscopic parameters are measured using SDSS-V data compared to using data from previous generations of SDSS. These differences may be due to changes in the wavelength solution across survey generations.

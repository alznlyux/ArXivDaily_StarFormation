          Revising the Giant Planet Mass-Metallicity Relation: Deciphering the Formation Sequence of Giant Planets

 - **Abstract**
 The rate at which giant planets accumulate solids and gas is a critical component of planet formation models, yet it is extremely challenging to predict from first principles. Characterizing the heavy element (everything other than hydrogen and helium) content of giant planets provides important clues about their provenance. Using thermal evolution models with updated H-He EOS and atmospheric boundary condition that varies with envelope metallicity, we quantify the bulk heavy element content of 147 warm ($< 1000$ K) giant planets with well-measured masses and radii, more than tripling the sample size studied in Thorngren et al. 2016. These measurements reveal that the population's heavy element mass follows the relation $M_{\rm Z} = M_{\rm core} + f_Z (M_{\rm p} - M_{\rm core})$, with $M_{\rm core} = 14.7^{+1.8}_{-1.6}$ Earth masses (M$_\oplus$), $f_Z = 0.09 \pm 0.01$, and an astrophysical scatter of $0.66 \pm 0.08 \times M_Z$. The classical core-accretion scenario ($Z_{\rm p} = 1$ at 10 M$_\oplus$ and $Z_{\rm p} = 0.5$ at 20 M$_\oplus$) is inconsistent with the population. At low planet masses ($<< 150$ M$_\oplus$), $M_{\rm Z} \sim M_{\rm core}$ and as a result, $Z_{\rm p} = M_{\rm Z} / M_{\rm p}$ declines linearly with $M_{\rm p}$. However, bulk metallicity does not continue to decline with planet mass and instead flattens out at $f_Z \sim 0.09$ ($\sim 7 \times$ solar metallicity). When normalized by stellar metallicity, $Z_{\rm p} / Z_\star$ flattens out at $3.3 \pm 0.5$ at high planet masses. This explicitly shows that giant planets continue to accrete material enriched in heavy elements during the gas accretion phase.

          Not All Sub-Neptune Exoplanets Have Magma Oceans

 - **Abstract**
 The evolution and structure of sub-Neptunes may be strongly influenced by interactions between the outer gaseous envelope of the planet and a surface magma ocean. However, given the wide variety of permissible interior structures of these planets, it is unclear whether conditions at the envelope-mantle boundary will always permit a molten silicate layer, or whether some sub-Neptunes might instead host a solid silicate surface. In this work, we use internal structure modeling to perform an extensive exploration of surface conditions within the sub-Neptune population across a range of bulk and atmospheric parameters. We find that a significant portion of the population may lack present-day magma oceans. In particular, planets with a high atmospheric mean molecular weight and large envelope mass fraction are likely to instead have a solid silicate surface, since the pressure at the envelope-mantle boundary is high enough that the silicates will be in solid post-perovskite phase. This result is particularly relevant given recent inferences of high-mean molecular weight atmospheres from JWST observations of several sub-Neptunes. We apply this approach to a number of sub-Neptunes with existing or upcoming JWST observations, and find that in almost all cases, a range of solutions exist which do not possess a present-day magma ocean. Our analysis provides critical context for interpreting sub-Neptunes and their atmospheres.

 - **Abstract**
 Metals enhance the cooling efficiency of molecular clouds, promoting fragmentation. Consequently, increasing the metallicity may boost the formation of low-mass stars. Within the integrated galaxy initial mass function (IGIMF) theory, this effect is empirically captured by a linear relation between the slope of the low-mass stellar IMF, $\alpha_1$, and the metal mass fraction, $Z$. This linear $\alpha_1$-$Z$ relation has been calibrated up to $\approx 2 \, Z_{\odot}$, though higher metallicity environments are known to exist. We show that if the linear $\alpha_1$-$Z$ relation extends to higher metallicities ($[Z] \gtrsim 0.5$), massive star formation is suppressed entirely. Alternatively, fragmentation efficiency may saturate beyond some metallicity threshold if gravitational collapse cascades rapidly enough. To model this behavior, we propose a logistic function describing the transition from metallicity-sensitive to metallicity-insensitive fragmentation regimes. We provide a user-friendly public code, pyIGIMF, which enables the instantaneous computation of the IGIMF theory with the logistic $\alpha_1$-$Z$ relation.

          A roadmap to cosmological parameter analysis with third-order shear statistics IV. Analytic cross-covariance between second- and third-order aperture masses

 - **Abstract**
 Weak gravitational lensing is a powerful probe of cosmology, with second-order shear statistics commonly used to constrain parameters such as the matter density $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$ and the clustering amplitude $S_8$. However, parameter degeneracies remain and can be reduced by including higher-order statistics such as the third-order aperture mass. To jointly analyse second- and third-order statistics, an accurate model of their cross-covariance is essential. We derive and validate a non-tomographic analytical model for the cross-covariance between second- and third-order aperture mass statistics. Analytical models are computationally efficient and enable cosmological parameter inference across a range of models, in contrast to numerical covariances derived from simulations or resampling, which are costly or biased. Our derivation is based on real-space estimators of the aperture mass. Substituting the Halofit power spectrum, BiHalofit bispectrum, and a halo-model tetraspectrum, we validate the model against numerical covariances from the $N$-body Scinet LIghtCone Simulations (SLICS) using shear catalogues and convergence maps. We perform a Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis with both analytical and numerical covariances for several filter scale combinations. The cross-covariance separates into three terms governed by the power spectrum, bispectrum, and tetraspectrum, with the latter dominating. The analytical model qualitatively reproduces simulations, though differences arise from modelling approximations and numerical evaluation. Analytical contours are systematically tighter, with a combined figure of merit 72% of the numerical case, rising to 80% when small-scale information is excluded. This work completes the analytical covariance framework for second- and third-order aperture mass statistics, enabling joint parameter inference without large simulation suites.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the stability and possible fates of Little Red Dots, under the stellar-only interpretation of their observational features. This is performed by a combination of analyzing the relevant timescales in their stellar dynamics and also, the application of recent numerical results on the evolution of the densest stellar systems. We study different scenarios for the evolution of Little Red Dots and conclude that in a fair fraction of those systems, the formation of a massive black hole by runaway collisions seems unavoidable, in all the possibilities studied within the stellar-only interpretation. We conclude that Little Red Dots are the most favourable known places to find a recently formed massive black hole seed, or in the process of formation, most probably formed directly in the supermassive range

          How two-dimensional are planet-disc interactions? II. Radiation hydrodynamics and suitable cooling prescriptions

 - **Abstract**
 The ring and gap structures found in observed protoplanetary disks are often attributed to embedded gap-opening planets and typically modeled with simplified thermodynamics in the 2D, thin disk approximation. However, it has been shown that radiative cooling and meridional processes play key roles in planet-disk interaction, though their computational cost has limited their exploration. We investigate the differences between 2D and 3D models of gap-opening planets while also comparing thermodynamical frameworks ranging from locally isothermal to fully radiative. We also compare simplified cooling recipes to fully radiative models in an effort to motivate the inclusion of radiative effects in future modeling even in a parametrized manner. We perform hydrodynamical simulations in both 2D and 3D, and then compare the angular momentum deposition by planetary spirals to assess gap opening efficiency. We repeat comparisons with different thermodynamical treatments: locally isothermal, adiabatic, local $\beta$ cooling, and fully radiative including radiative diffusion. We find that 2D models are able to capture the essential physics of gap opening with remarkable accuracy, even when including full radiation transport in both cases. Simple cooling prescriptions can capture the trends found in fully radiative models, albeit slightly overestimating gap opening efficiency near the planet. Inherently 3D effects such as vertical flows that cannot be captured in 2D can explain the differences between the two approaches, but do not impact gap opening significantly. Our findings encourage the use of models that include radiative processes in the study of planet-disk interaction, even with simplified yet physically motivated cooling prescriptions in lieu of full radiation transport. This is particularly important in the context of substructure-inducing planets in the ALMA-sensitive disk regions (>10 au).

          The elusive chase for the first RR Lyr star in a binary system: the case of KIC 2831097

 - **Abstract**
 The lack of RR Lyr stars in binary systems is an atypical fact when we compared it to other classes of variables. Therefore, it has become a challenge for observers to detect an RR Lyr variable in a binary system. The RR Lyr variable KIC 2831097 was one of the most promising candidates. The phases of maximum brightness in the Kepler photometry showed a regular variation superimposed on a parabolic trend. These variations in the times of maximum brightness (Tmax ) were interpreted as a possible light-time travel effect (LTTE) in a wide binary and a fast evolutionary change in the period. We planned two spectroscopic runs with the FIES instrument mounted at the NOT to test the hypothesis of binarity. The observations were programmed at the predicted quadratures of the orbit. The GEOS collaboration complemented the spectroscopic survey by a photometric one. We also analysed Gaia time series and intensive TESS photometry. The RV curves obtained at the quadratures show the same mean RV (-203 km/s), which rules the possibility of an LTTE out. KIC 2831097 is a single high-velocity metal-poor RRc star belonging to the Galactic halo. We revisited Kepler photometry and detected a weak Blazhko effect consisting of an oscillation of only 1.1% of the period in about 50 d. We also analysed the TESS photometry of Kepler-1601, whose photometry is contaminated by KIC 2831097. In total, we collected 3624 times of maximum brightness. Linear ephemerides cannot fit the whole dataset, but only parts of them. The period shows a tendency to decrease in value, as if it were an evolutionary effect, but not at a constant rate.

 - **Abstract**
 Galactic PeVatrons are astrophysical sources accelerating particles up to a few PeV (~10$^{15}$ eV). The primary method to identify both electron and proton PeVatrons is the observation of $\gamma$-ray radiation at ultra-high energies (UHE; E$>$100 TeV). In 2021, LHAASO detected 14 steady $\gamma$-ray sources with photon energies above 100 TeV and up to 1.4 PeV. Most of these sources can be plausibly associated with objects such as supernova remnants, pulsar wind nebulae, and stellar clusters. However, LHAASO J0341$+$5258 is detected as an unidentified PeVatron, emitting $\gamma$ rays at energies above hundreds of TeV. It is extended in nature and notably bright, with a flux $>$ 20% of the Crab Nebula's flux above 25 TeV. Multiwavelength observations are required to identify the PeVatron responsible for the UHE $\gamma$ rays, understand the source morphology and association, and shed light on the emission processes. Here, we will present the results from the VERITAS and HAWC observations of this PeVatron, along with a discussion on potential emission scenarios through multiwavelength modeling.

          The interstellar heritage of comets

 - **Abstract**
 Comets have similar compositions to interstellar medium ices, suggesting at least some of their molecules maybe inherited from an earlier stage of evolution. To investigate the degree to which this might have occurred we compare the composition of individual comets to that of the well-studied protostellar region IRAS 16293-2422B. We show that the observed molecular abundance ratios in several comets correlate well with those observed in the protostellar source. However, this does not necessarily mean that the cometary abundances are identical to protostellar. We find the abundance ratios of many molecules present in comets are enhanced compared to their protostellar counterparts. For COH-molecules, the data suggest higher abundances relative to methanol of more complex species, e.g. HCOOH, CH3CHO, and HCOOCH3, are found in comets. For N-bearing molecules, the ratio of nitriles relative to CH3CN -- HC3N/CH3CN and HCN/CH3CN -- tend to be enhanced. The abundances of cometary SO and SO2 relative to H2S are enhanced, whereas OCS/H2S is reduced. Using a subset of comets with a common set of observed molecules we suggest a possible means of determining the relative degree to which they retain interstellar ices. This analysis suggests that over 84% of COH-bearing molecules can be explained by the protostellar composition. The possible fraction inherited from the protostellar region is lower for N-molecules at only 26--74%. While this is still speculative, especially since few comets have large numbers of observed molecules, it provides a possible route for determining the relative degree to which comets contain disk-processed material.

 - **Abstract**
 The scope of this literature review is observations of the products of first-stage evolution for binaries having components with M < 2 $M_\odot$. A taxonomy for these products comprises dwarfs ("blue stragglers"), giants ("yellow stragglers"), subdwarf B stars, and giant-like stars ("sub-subgiants" and "red stragglers"). This literature review is organized according to this taxonomy within three distinct environments: open star clusters, globular star clusters, and the Galactic field. This literature review is the Supplemental Material for Blue Stragglers and Friends: Initial Evolutionary Pathways in Close Low-Mass Binaries (Mathieu & Pols, 2025, ARAA, 63:467-512, doi: this http URL). It is intended to support and expand on Section 3 of the main text of this Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics, where an integrated perspective on the common and contrasting astrophysical properties of these binary evolution products is provided. Figures used in the main text to highlight key observational results are referenced in this literature review. The closing date of this review is January 17, 2025, with some citations subsequently updated.

 - **Abstract**
 Quantum Gravity models suggest that singularities in gravitational collapse can be replaced by bounces, leading to the formation of Planck star remnants (PSR) that survive as stable relics once the black holes evaporate to the Planck mass. Recently, we proposed that such relics can be a viable candidate for dark matter. Here we show that LIGO's upper limit on the gravitational wave background rules out a formation pathway of Planck mass relics as dark matter from Gaussian initial conditions. This leaves non-Gaussian primordial fluctuations as the only viable channel for making Planck mass relics as dark matter.

 - **Abstract**
 The HWO Target Stars and Systems 2025 (TSS25) list is a community-developed catalog of potential stellar targets for the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) in its survey to directly image Earth-sized planets in the habitable zone. The TSS25 list categorizes potential HWO targets into priority tiers based on their likelihood to be surveyed and the necessity of obtaining observations of their stellar properties prior to the launch of the mission. This target list builds upon previous efforts to identify direct imaging targets and incorporates the results of multiple yield calculations assessing the science return of current design concepts for HWO. The TSS25 list identifies a sample of target stars that have a high probability to be observed by HWO (Tiers 1 and 2), independent of assumptions about the mission's final architecture. These stars should be the focus of community precursor science efforts in order to mitigate risks and maximize the science output of HWO. This target list is publicly available and is a living catalog that will be continually updated leading up to the mission.

          The First 4 Years of SN 1993J Revisited: Geometric $m$-ring Modeling of the Radio Shell with Closure Quantities Only

 - **Abstract**
 SN 1993J is the best-studied radio supernova, with observations using very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) spanning from within weeks of explosion through nearly three decades of ejecta evolution. Imaging and modeling techniques have revealed an expanding shell-like ejecta structure, with a width well-constrained after ~1000 days. In this work, we present a re-analysis of the first ~1700 days of SN 1993J evolution, using a new VLBI analysis technique with somewhat intrinsically higher angular resolution and compare our results with those from previous conventional techniques. We adopt the m-ring model, with potentially somewhat higher angular resolution, but only as a phenomenological alternative to the physically-motivated spherical shell model used in past analyses and shape the profile to approximately match that of the shell. We use closure quantities only, providing calibration insensitive constraints on ejecta geometry and largely independent comparisons with previous results from the same data sets. Using this approach we find the ejecta expanding with a power-law exponent $\omega=0.80\pm0.01$ averaged for the time from 175 to 1693 days, consistent with shell-fitting analyses. For the first time, we report estimates of the ejecta width at t < 1000 days -- as early as 264 days post-explosion -- finding a mean fractional width with standard deviation of $0.24 \pm 0.04$ (of the radius) with no significant evolution. We present a fit of the azimuthal brightness modulation over time with the maximum of a horseshoe pattern rotating from east to south-southwest from 175 to 1000 d and then evolving to a more complex behavior, quantifying previous results from images only. The constraints on the angular brightness modulation and width over time and ~700 days earlier than existing analyses provide an avenue to test more advanced simulations of the explosion and interaction mechanisms.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery and timing of two pulsars from a sample of four circularly polarized sources identified in radio continuum images taken as part of the Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP) Variables and Slow Transients (VAST) survey. Observations with the Parkes (Murriyang) radio telescope confirmed both sources as normal pulsars with high dispersion measures. PSR J1646$-$4451 has a spin period of 217 ms and a dispersion measure (DM) of 928 $\rm cm^{-3} \, pc$, while PSR J1837$-$0616 exhibits a spin period of 118 ms and a DM of 793 $\rm cm^{-3} \, pc$. These pulsars show extreme pulse broadening due to scattering, with measured scattering timescales of 290 ms and 343 ms at observing frequencies of 1.8 GHz and 1.9 GHz, respectively. These measurements imply extrapolated scattering timescales at 1 GHz of 2479 ms and 2154 ms, placing them among the most heavily scattered pulsars known to date. Our findings underscore the potential of using circular polarization in radio continuum images as a tool for identifying highly scattered pulsars. Future wide-field radio continuum surveys are poised to uncover a broader population of extreme pulsars particularly those that are heavily scattered at 1.4 GHz, intrinsically faint, or residing in binaries$-$offering valuable insights into both pulsar demographics and the complex structure of the interstellar medium.

          The impact of the point spread function fitting radius on photometric uncertainty based on the Fisher information matrix

 - **Abstract**
 In point spread function (PSF) photometry, the selection of the fitting aperture radius plays a critical role in determining the precision of flux and background estimations. Traditional methods often rely on maximizing the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) as a criterion for aperture selection. However, S/N-based approaches do not necessarily provide the optimal precision for joint estimation problems as they do not account for the statistical limits imposed by the Fisher information in the context of the Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB). This study aims to establish an alternative criterion for selecting the optimal fitting radius based on Fisher information rather than S/N. Fisher information serves as a fundamental measure of estimation precision, providing theoretical guarantees on the achievable accuracy for parameter estimation. By leveraging Fisher information, we seek to define an aperture selection strategy that minimizes the loss of precision. We conducted a series of numerical experiments that analyze the behavior of Fisher information and estimator performance as a function of the PSF aperture radius. Specifically, we revisited fundamental photometric models and explored the relationship between aperture size and information content. We compared the empirical variance of classical estimators, such as maximum likelihood and stochastic weighted least squares, against the theoretical CRLB derived from the Fisher information matrix. Our results indicate that aperture selection based on the Fisher information provides a more robust framework for achieving optimal estimation precision.

 - **Abstract**
 We report on the follow-up observations of circularly polarized sources identified in the MeerKAT image-based survey of the Galactic bulge. Using the Parkes radio telescope, we observed sixteen circularly polarized sources with the UWL receiver and detected nine pulsars among which six of them are new discoveries. All pulsars are fast rotators with spin periods under 100\,ms. Among the new discoveries five are millisecond pulsars (MSPs) and one has a spin period of 55\,ms. At least four new MSPs exhibit clear signs of binary motion in their discovery observations. The dispersion measures (DMs) of these pulsars fall between 18 and 330\,pc\,cm$^{-3}$, which is lower than expected for Galactic bulge members and indicates that these pulsars lie in the foreground along the line of sight rather than within the bulge itself. This is the first time such a large number of pulsars have been confirmed via an image-based survey. These discoveries underscore the exceptional efficacy of circular polarization selection in image-based pulsar surveys, and demonstrate the powerful synergy between high-sensitivity imaging and targeted time-domain follow-up using wide-band receivers and strengthen prospects for future deep pulsation searches$-$e.g., with MeerKAT or the forthcoming SKA or DSA-2000$-$to uncover the true millisecond pulsar population in the Galactic bulge.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the orbits of giant planets is critical for testing planet formation models, particularly at wide separations greater than 10 au where traditional core accretion becomes inefficient. However, constraining orbits at these separations has been challenging because of sparse orbital coverage and degeneracies in the orbital parameters. We use existing high-resolution spectroscopic measurements from CRIRES+ (R ~ 100000), astrometric data from SPHERE, NACO, and ALMA, and new high-precision GRAVITY astrometry to refine the orbit of GQ Lup B, a ~30 M_J companion at ~100 au, in a system that also hosts a circumstellar disk and a wide companion, GQ Lup C. Including radial velocity data significantly improves orbital constraints by breaking the degeneracy between inclination and eccentricity that affects astrometry-only fits for long-period companions. This work is among the first to combine high-precision astrometry with the companion's relative radial velocity to achieve improved orbital constraints. The eccentricity is refined from e = 0.47 (+0.14, -0.16) with GRAVITY alone to e = 0.35 (+0.10, -0.09) when RVs and GRAVITY data are combined. The orbit is misaligned by 63 (+6, -14) deg relative to the circumstellar disk and 52 (+19, -24) deg relative to the host star spin axis, and is more consistent (34 (+6, -13) deg) with the inclination of the wide tertiary companion GQ Lup C disk. These results support a formation scenario for GQ Lup B consistent with cloud fragmentation and highlight the power of combining companion RV constraints with interferometric astrometry to probe the dynamics and formation of wide-orbit substellar companions.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comparative analysis of estimators and Bayesian methods for determining the number count dipole from cosmological surveys. The increase in discordance between the number count dipole and the CMB's kinematic dipole has presented a challenge to the assumption of an isotropic and homogeneous universe. The level of discordance has depended on the choice of method to determine the dipole; hence, there is a need to compare them to determine the better approach. We select the healpy fit_dipole algorithm as our estimator and show that it gives unbiased results regardless of the noise levels and sky coverage in the data. However, for low sky coverage, the estimator's results have a large variance, which indicates that the estimator is not reliable in that regime. We then compare the estimator's outputs with the Bayesian results. If the sky coverage is sufficient, the Bayesian posterior probabilities agree with both the estimator's outcomes and the true parameter values. But if the sky coverage is low, Bayesian analysis is often inconclusive, which safeguards against incorrect conclusions. Both methods provide the ability to analyse multiple samples: on one hand, we need to select a different estimator, while in Bayesian inference, we need to extend our likelihood function to incorporate additional parameters. Our study emphasises the need to perform a principled statistical analysis of sky surveys for dipole determination.

          Reconciling the Tension Between Light Curve Modeling of Type II Supernovae and Neutrino-Driven Core-Collapse Supernovae Models with Late-Phase Spectroscopy

 - **Abstract**
 Type II supernovae (SNe II) are the most frequently observed outcome of core-collapse explosions and provide a valuable window into the physical mechanisms governing the deaths of massive stars. However, estimates of explosion properties based on optical light curve modeling often show tension with the predictions of modern neutrino-driven explosion models. In particular, when based on light curves from the explosions of red supergiant (RSG) tied to specific stellar wind models, many SNe II are found to originate from low-mass progenitors yet exhibit unusually high explosion energies ($E_{\rm K}$), far exceeding theoretical predictions. In this study, we incorporate late-phase (nebular) spectroscopy to estimate the helium core mass of the progenitor ($M_{\rm He\,core}$), which serves as an additional constraint to break degeneracies in light curve modeling. This approach is applied to a sample of 32 well-observed SNe II, using a light curve model grid constructed from RSGs with arbitrarily stripped hydrogen-rich envelopes, rather than assuming a fixed wind model. Examining the resulting correlations among the physical parameters, we find that the tension between the observed $M_{\rm He\,core}$-$E_{\rm K}$ and $E_{\rm K}$-$M_{\rm Ni}$ relations and those predicted by neutrino-driven explosion models has significantly lessened by incorporating nebular spectroscopy in light curve modeling. This study highlights the crucial role of nebular spectroscopy in interpreting SNe II observations and provides support to the neutrino-driven explosion mechanism as the dominant engine powering these events.

 Large Array of imaging atmospheric Cherenkov Telescope (LACT) is an array of 32 Cherenkov telescopes with 6-meter diameter mirrors to be constructed at the LHAASO site, aiming to enhance our understanding of ultra-high energy gamma ray astronomy. This work presents a detailed performance assessment of the LACT array, focusing on the IRFs for both an 8-telescope subarray configuration optimized for large zenith angle observations (60°) and the full 32-telescope array, with a particular emphasis on a 20° zenith angle configuration for lower energy threshold observations. We have generated IRFs using extensive Monte Carlo simulations of gamma-ray showers and the detector response. The IRFs include the effective area, angular resolution, and energy resolution as a function of energy and offset angle. Crucially, these IRFs are produced in the standard Data format for Gamma ray astronomy (GADF), ensuring interoperability with existing analysis tools like Gammapy and ctools and enabling seamless integration into scientific workflows. In this work, we also have used these GADF-format IRFs to simulate observations towards the Galactic Center Region.

 - **Abstract**
 The Askaryan Radio Array (ARA), located near the South Pole, is among the first experiments there designed to detect ultra-high energy neutrinos through the Askaryan effect. When such neutrinos interact in dense media like ice, they initiate particle cascades that generate coherent radio pulses. Operating in the 150-850 MHz band, ARA is deployed 80-200 meters deep in Antarctic ice, where the radio background is exceptionally low. Despite this, experiments such as ARA must still account for continuous wave (CW) signals, which can originate from anthropogenic sources, instrumental noise, and other environmental factors. These CW signals can obscure faint neutrino-induced pulses, complicating data analysis and event identification. Over the years, ARA has developed and refined techniques for CW filtering and identification, including spectral analysis, notch filtering, and phase-variance methods. These approaches exploit CW characteristics such as their narrowband nature and persistence to separate contamination from genuine impulsive events. We review the main CW identification and filtering techniques developed within the ARA collaboration and present recent improvements in adaptive, multi-stage filtering pipelines. These advances have led to faster processing, simpler operation, and more accurate CW suppression, improving data analysis quality. Their efficacy is demonstrated across all ARA stations, underscoring their role in reducing event misclassification and enhancing performance. By refining these techniques, this work not only improves the sensitivity of ARA but also highlights the importance of robust CW filtering for current and future neutrino radio detection experiments.

 - **Abstract**
 The emissivity profile assumed in X-ray reflection spectroscopy significantly impacts black hole spin measurements. Using simulated NuSTAR spectra generated for lamppost and disk-like coronae with the relxill model suite, we evaluate systematic biases introduced when fitting with power-law or broken power-law emissivity profiles. We find that a simple power-law can accurately recover spins for low-height lamppost coronae with long exposures and low inclination angle, while broken power-laws introduce degeneracies when the simple power-law already performs adequately. However, for extended or high-height coronae, especially at high inclinations, both models produce large systematic biases unresolved by longer exposure times. Our results demonstrate that power-law approximations are reliable for compact coronae, highlighting the need for geometry-specific models in complex cases.

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we analyzed millimeter-wave data toward the quasar PKS1830-211 observed with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array to obtain absorption spectra of HCN $J$=2-1, $J$=3-2, $J$=4-3, and $J$=5-4 lines at the cosmological redshift of $z=0.89$. We confirmed multiple absorption components in each spectrum, and the two lower-$J$ lines are highly saturated at velocity centers of the two most prominent components. The effect of uncertainty in the continuum covering factor was carefully assessed using a Monte Carlo approach. We also accounted for systematic uncertainties in the HCN $J$=4-3 and $J$=5-4 absorption due to time variability during an intense flaring event of the quasar. Assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium and neglecting molecular collisions, we derived the excitation temperature profiles and their uncertainties in the optically thin regime. We determined the cosmic microwave background radiation temperature at $z = 0.89$ to be ${5.13\pm0.06\,\mathrm{K}}$ by taking a weighted average of calculated excitation temperatures; this is highly consistent with that expected from the standard model of the universe.

          Exciting Stellar Eccentricity in Gaia BH3 via a Hidden Black Hole Binary

 - **Abstract**
 We propose that the high eccentricity of the stellar orbit in Gaia BH3 system could be excited through a secular resonance effect if the inner dark object is, in effect, a tight and eccentric black hole binary (BHB). During the orbital decay of the inner BHB, the apsidal precession rate of the inner binary matches that of the outer stellar orbit, and this resonance advection can drive the outer eccentricity into some extreme values. For a Gaia BH3-like system, we show that a near equal-mass ($q=0.8$) BHB with an initial semi-major axis of 1--3 au and an initial eccentricity $\gtrsim 0.95$ is able to excite the outer orbit to the observed value, leaving a current BHB with semi-major axis 0.25--0.5 au and eccentricity $\sim 0.8$. The eccentric inner BHB imprints two observable signatures on the outer star: (1) short-term RV modulations with an amplitude $\lesssim 100$ m/s and (2) long-term apsidal precession with a rate $\lesssim 0.1^{\circ}$/yr. Although neither of these is detected in the currently available astrometry and RV data, we show that these signals are detectable with the full Gaia astrometry data and dedicated high-precision and/or long-term RV observations. Our work provides a new perspective on the dynamical formation of Gaia BH3, and the methodology is readily applicable to similar systems such as HD 130298, Gaia BH1, and Gaia BH2.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of a kpc scale molecular contrail in the spiral galaxy NGC 3627, a narrow structure spanning 8 kpc in length with a width of 200 pc and an extreme aspect ratio of 40, observed in both mid-infrared dust emission (PHANGS-JWST) and CO(2-1) gas (PHANGS-ALMA). This contrail size significantly exceeds the size of any known analogs in the Milky Way and exhibits supersonic turbulence (10 km/s). Its morphology and dynamics are consistent with gravitational focusing by a flyby compact object of mass 1e6 M_sun, likely a massive black hole or a dwarf galaxy nucleus, traversing the disk at >300 km/s. The crossing time of such a contrail, estimated from its width and velocity dispersion, is only $\sim 20$ Myr, implying a recent interaction. This contrail can be caused by a dwarf galaxy, or massive black hole nucleus. This discovery establishes galactic-scale contrails as probes of massive dark objects interacting with medium in and around galactic disks.

          Probing redshift-dependent systematics in the Hubble tension: Model-independent $H_0$ constraints from DESI R2

 - **Abstract**
 We present a model-independent determination of the Hubble constant ($H_0$) using the latest observational data from multiple cosmological probes. By combining baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements from the second data release of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI DR2), cosmic chronometer $H(z)$ data, and the Pantheon Plus Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) sample, we reconstruct the cosmic expansion history through Gaussian process regression without assuming a specific cosmological model or relying on sound horizon calibration. Our analysis incorporates the complete covariance structure of the measurements and yields $H_0$ constraints at five distinct redshifts: $65.72 \pm 1.99$ (z=0.51), $67.78 \pm 1.75$ (z=0.706), $70.74 \pm 1.39$ (z=0.934), $71.04 \pm 1.93$ (z=1.321), and $68.37 \pm 3.95~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$ (z=1.484). The optimal combination of these measurements gives $\hat{H}_0 = 69.0 \pm 1.0~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$ with 1.4\% precision, which occupies an intermediate position between the Planck CMB result and the SH0ES local measurement and is consistent with the TRGB result. Rather than providing a single integrated $H_0$ value, our approach delivers independent constraints at multiple redshifts, thereby enabling a detailed investigation of potential redshift-dependent systematic effects that could contribute to the Hubble tension. We identify significant correlations between adjacent redshift bins ($\rho = -0.033$ to $0.26$), primarily arising from the BAO covariance and reconstruction effects. These results demonstrate a clear redshift evolution in Hubble constant measurements and suggest that the Hubble tension may involve more complex redshift-dependent effects than a simple dichotomy between early and late universe probes.

 - **Abstract**
 Several short-lived radionuclides (SLRs) are know to have existed in the early Solar System (ESS). These species, which typically decay with half-lives of the order of a few million years, can be used to probe the timescale of events preceding the birth of the Sun. We investigate the ESS origin of $^{53}$Mn, produced by core-collapse (CCSNe) and Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), and $^{60}$Fe, produced exclusively by CCSNe. We model the evolution of the radioactive-to-stable abundance ratios of these SLRs with a galactic chemical evolution (GCE) framework accounting for different supernova yields, SN Ia delay times, and other galactic features $(K)$. A further set of models are calculated assuming that SN Ia did not contribute any $^{53}$Mn to the ESS. The predicted ratios are compared to meteoritic ratios to derive a distribution of solar isolation times that includes uncertainties due to stochastic chemical enrichment and precision of the ESS values. The isolation times are then compared to those of $^{107}$Pd and $^{182}$Hf calculated in previous work. A self-consistent solution can be found within the current uncertainties, especially when using the GCE setups with $K = 1.6$ and 2.3, although the maximum likelihood for the \iso{60}Fe distribution is typically $\sim 4-5$ Myr shorter than for \iso{53}Mn. The predicted \iso{60}Fe/\iso{53}Mn ratio, instead, is completely inconsistent with the ESS value; this could be resolved using a larger fraction of faint CCSNe than usually considered in GCE models.

 - **Abstract**
 Isoprene and its oligomers, terpenes, are expected to be present, along with other complex organic molecules, in the diverse environments of the ISM and in our solar system. Due to insufficient spectral information of these molecules at low temperature, the detection and understanding of the importance of these molecules has been rather incomplete. For this purpose, we have carried out the vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) photoabsorption measurements on pure molecular ices of isoprene and a few simple terpenes: limonene, $\alpha$-pinene and $\beta$-pinene by forming icy mantles on cold dust analogs. From these experiments, we report the first low-temperature (10 K) VUV spectra of isoprene and its oligomers, limonene, $\alpha$-pinene, and $\beta$-pinene. VUV photoabsorption spectra of all the molecules reported here reveal similarities in the ice and gas phase, as expected, except for isoprene, where a prominent red shift is observed in the ice phase absorption. This unique property of isoprene, along with distinctive absorption at longer wavelengths, supports its candidature for detection on icy bodies.

 Microquasars are increasingly recognized as efficient particle accelerators, potentially contributing to the cosmic-ray flux up to the "knee". Among them, SS 433 stands out as a unique system with precessing relativistic jets embedded within the W50 supernova remnant. Recent detections of very- and ultra-high-energy gamma rays from SS 433 have solidified its role as a key laboratory for studying particle acceleration in jet-powered astrophysical sources. We present results from over 100 hours of observations of SS 433 with VERITAS, spanning more than a decade. These high-resolution measurements allow for a detailed morphological study of the eastern and western jet lobes with an angular resolution of <0.1°. By analyzing the spatial and spectral characteristics of the gamma-ray emission, we investigate the particle acceleration mechanisms within the jets and at the jet-medium interaction in W50.

 - **Abstract**
 The accretion luminosity (Lacc) in young, low-mass stars is crucial for understanding stellar formation, but direct measurements are often hindered by limited spectral coverage and challenges in UV-excess modeling. Empirical relations linking Lacc to various accretion tracers are widely used to overcome these limitations. This work revisits these empirical relations using the PENELLOPE dataset, evaluating their applicability across different star-forming regions and to accreting young objects other than Classical T Tauri Stars (CTTSs). We analyzed the PENELLOPE VLT/X-Shooter dataset of 64 CTTSs, measuring fluxes of several accretion tracers and adopting the stellar and accretion parameters derived from PENELLOPE works. We supplemented our analysis with the ODYSSEUS HST data set, which covers a wider spectral range in NUV bands. We compared the Lacc values obtained in the PENELLOPE and ODYSSEUS surveys finding statistically consistent results. Our analysis confirms that existing empirical relations, previously derived for the Lupus sample, provide reliable Lacc estimates for CTTSs in several other star-forming regions. We revisit empirical relations for accretion tracers in our dataset, based on HST-fit, with coefficients which are consistent within 1sigma with XS-fit results for most lines. We also propose a method to estimate extinction using these relations and investigate the empirical relations for Brackett lines (Br8 to Br21). The Lacc vs Lline empirical relations can be successfully used for statistical studies of accretion on young forming objects in different star-forming regions. These relations also offer a promising approach to independently estimate extinction in CTTSs. We confirm that near-infrared lines (PaB and BrG) reliably trace Lacc in high accretors, making them valuable tools for probing accretion properties of high accreting young stars not accessible in the UVB.

 - **Abstract**
 Both the Rubin Observatory and the first telescopes of the CTAO will be collecting data by 2026, marking a new era in optical and gamma-ray astronomy. Compared to predecessors, their enhanced sensitivity will extend extragalactic observations to a redshift of at least 2.5. This advancement offers insights into non-thermal astrophysical sources, particularly blazars. The 3-night cadence monitoring with Rubin, in one of its six filters, will produce blazar light curves that, when combined with targeted in-depth observations from the CTAO, could help distinguish acceleration and radiative models. Existing data from the ZTF and Fermi-LAT, though less sensitive, offer insights into what Rubin and the CTAO may achieve. However, the real-time processing of the immense data stream coming from Rubin/LSST presents a major challenge. Addressing this challenge is the work of brokers such as Fink, which we develop for multi-messenger astrophysics. Fink processes data in real-time before sending relevant information to other observatories like the CTAO. In this contribution, we present how we characterize the optical variability of blazars that emit in the gamma-ray range using the ZTF, with timescales spanning from the intra-night to multi-years. We identify properties in the resulting parameter space that could not only enable the identification of blazar-like sources, but also the characterization of the continuum of states. We describe our fast identification of transitions from one state to another, enabling the trigger of observations in the gamma-ray band and follow-up spectroscopic observations. Finally, we review the communication channel we set from the ZTF to the CTAO via Fink for blazars and discuss its outlook in light of the Rubin Observatory. This method is also applicable to other astrophysical sources and helps lay the groundwork for a fruitful era for time-domain astronomy.

 - **Abstract**
 Prestellar cores represent the initial conditions of star formation, but heavy molecules such as CO are strongly depleted in their cold, dense interiors, limiting the ability to probe core centers. Deuterated molecular ions therefore emerge as key tracers because deuterium fractionation is enhanced at low temperatures. We present the first direct observation of ortho-H2D+ depletion in the prestellar core G205.46-14.56M3 using ALMA 820um continuum and ortho-H2D+(110-111) data at ~300-au resolution. We confirm the previously reported two substructures, B1 and B2, and identify a central ortho-H2D+ depletion zone toward B1 with ~6$\sigma$ contrast and an inferred diameter $\lesssim$600au, together with a peak $x$(N2D+)/$x$(N2H+)=$1.03^{+0.07}_{-0.56}$. The observationally inferred profiles of $x$(ortho-H2D+) and $x$(N2D+)/$x$(N2H+) are reproduced by a deuteration-focused chemo-dynamical model; however, the central ortho-H2D+ depletion is only marginally matched within the $2\sigma$ upper limit, likely suggesting additional deuteration in the depletion zone. From these models we infer a core age of ~0.42Ma, comparable to the free-fall time, suggesting that the substructures formed via rapid, turbulence-dominated fragmentation rather than slow, quasi-static contraction. Our observations also reveal that ortho-H2D+ velocity dispersions are largely subsonic in the core and nearly thermal between B1 and B2, consistent with turbulence dissipating within a few free-fall times. These results highlight the critical role of deuterated ions for both chemical evolution and dynamics in dense cores.

          The depletion of the asteroid belt and the impact history of the Earth

 - **Abstract**
 We have evaluated the rate at which the asteroid belt is losing material, and how it splits between macroscopic bodies and meteoritic dust. The mass loss process is due to the injection of asteroid fragments into unstable dynamical regions, associated to mean-motion resonances with Jupiter, Saturn and Mars or secular resonances, from where they are scattered either to the region of the terrestrial planets or to the vicinity of Jupiter's orbit. Asteroid fragments that do not escape from the belt are ground down by mutual collisions to meteoritic dust. Under the assumption that 25\% of the zodiacal dust mass is of asteroidal origin, we find that the asteroid belt is currently losing a fraction of about $\mu_o \simeq 8.8 \times 10^{-5}$ Ma$^{-1}$ of its collisionally-active mass (without the primordial objects Ceres, Vesta and Pallas), about 20\% as macroscopic bodies, and 80\% as dust particles that feed the zodiacal dust cloud. Extrapolation of the current mass loss rate to the past suggests only a moderate increase of the asteroid belt mass and the mass loss rate around 3.0 - 3.5 Ga ago (by about 50\% and a factor of two respectively). Yet, should the computed $\mu_o$ be somewhat underestimated owing to the different uncertainties associated to its computation, the extrapolation to the past would lead to quite different results. For instance, a moderate increase in the computed $\mu_o$, say by a factor of three, would lead to an exponential increase of the asteroid mass and mass loss rate about 3.5 Ga ago. A greater asteroid mass loss rate in the past should be correlated with a more intense impact rate of the Earth, Moon and the other terrestrial planets, which is indeed what suggests the geologic record (Hartmann 2007).

 - **Abstract**
 Accurate pulsar astrometric estimates play an essential role in almost all high-precision pulsar timing experiments. Traditional pulsar timing techniques refine these estimates by including them as free parameters when fitting a model to observed pulse time-of-arrival measurements. However, reliable sub-milliarcsecond astrometric estimations require years of observations and, even then, power from red noise can be inadvertently absorbed into astrometric parameter fits, biasing the resulting estimations and reducing our sensitivity to red noise processes, including gravitational waves (GWs). In this work, we seek to mitigate these shortcomings by using pulsar astrometric estimates derived from Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) as priors for the timing fit. First, we calibrated a frame tie to account for the offsets between the reference frames used in VLBI and timing. Then, we used the VLBI-informed priors and timing-based likelihoods of several astrometric solutions consistent with both techniques to obtain a maximum-posterior astrometric solution. We found offsets between our results and the timing-based astrometric solutions, which, if real, would lead to absorption of spectral power at frequencies of interest for single-source GW searches. However, we do not find significant power absorption due to astrometric fitting at the low-frequency domain of the GW background.

 - **Abstract**
 The T Tauri star T Cha is known to have a protoplanetary disk with a dust gap separating the inner and outer disk regions. The mid-IR JWST spectrum of T Cha show multiple prominent aromatic infrared bands (AIBs) around 6.2, 8.1, and 11.3 $\mu$m. AIBs are commonly accepted as the emission stemming from PAH molecules. We aim to characterize the PAHs giving rise to the AIBs observed in the JWST spectrum of T Cha. Our objective is to estimate the PAH abundances, in terms of their sizes, ionization fraction, and mass, in the disk of T Cha. We perform spectral fitting of the observed AIBs to identify the possible underlying PAH emission components. We transfer the stellar radiation through a parametric disk model of T Cha in order to reproduce the mid-IR spectrum, optical photometric fluxes, and mm continuum band fluxes of T Cha. We include stochastically heated PAH dust grains in our model to simulate the AIBs, and hence estimate the PAH abundances from the modelling. We use the results from previous observations and modelling efforts to reduce our model degeneracies. We estimate the PAH abundances in T Cha self-consistently, with other important disk parameters. The overall disk morphology - an inner and an outer disk separated by a dust gap - derived in this work is consistent with the previous results from Spitzer, VLT, and ALMA observations. PAHs are located only in the outer disk in our model. We estimate a population of small PAHs of <30 C atoms, with an ionized PAH fraction of ~0.15. We also obtain a PAH-to-dust mass ratio of ~6.5$\times$10$^{-3}$, which amounts to ~16% of the ISM value. We predict that the outer disk should have a frontal wall with smaller dust grains limited up to $\mu$m-order to fit the slope of the continuum within 14-15 $\mu$m. We propose a possibility of sub-micron dust grains within the gap to justify an observed plateau around ~10 $\mu$m in the JWST spectrum.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the white dwarf catalog derived from the third data release of the Javalambre Photometric Local Universe Survey (J-PLUS DR3), which covers 3284 deg2 using 12 optical filters. A particular focus is given to the classification of outlier sources. We applied a Bayesian fitting process to the 12-band J-PLUS photometry of white dwarf candidates from Gaia EDR3. The derived parameters were effective temperature, surface gravity, and parallax. We used theoretical models from H- and He-dominated atmospheres, with priors applied to parallax and spectral type. From the posteriors, we derived the probability of an H-dominated atmosphere and of calcium absorption for each source. Outliers were identified as sources with chi2 > 23.2, indicating significant deviations from the best-fitting model. We analyzed the residuals from the fits using the UMAP technique, which enables the classification of outliers into distinct categories. The catalog includes 14844 white dwarfs with r < 20 mag and 1 < parallax < 100 mas, with 72% of the sources lacking spectroscopic (R > 500) classification. The application of UMAP identified three main types of outliers: random measurement fluctuations (391 sources), metal-polluted white dwarfs (98 sources), and two-component systems (282 sources). The last category also includes white dwarfs with strong carbon absorption lines. We validated the J-PLUS classifications by comparison with spectroscopy from SDSS and DESI, and with Gaia BP/RP spectra, confirming a one-to-one correspondence between J-PLUS photometric and spectroscopic classifications. The J-PLUS DR3 white dwarf catalog provides a robust dataset for statistical studies. The use of dimensionality reduction techniques enhances the identification of peculiar objects, making this catalog a valuable resource for the selection of interesting targets such as metal-polluted white dwarfs or binary systems.

 - **Abstract**
 The Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND) is a proposed multi-messenger observatory of ultra-high-energy (UHE) particles of cosmic origin. Its main goal is to find the long-sought origin of UHE cosmic rays by detecting large numbers of them and the secondary particles created by their interaction -- gamma rays, and, especially, neutrinos. GRAND will do so using large arrays of radio antennas that look for the radio signals emitted by the air showers initiated by the interactions of the UHE particles in the atmosphere. Since 2023, three small-scale prototype GRAND arrays have been in operation: GRAND@Nançay in France, GRAND@Auger in Argentina, and GRANDProto300 in China. Together, their goal is to validate the detection principle of GRAND under prolonged field conditions, achieving efficient, autonomous radio-detection of air showers. We describe the hardware, software, layout, and operation of the GRAND prototypes and show the first radio spectra measured by them. Despite challenges, the successful operation of the prototypes confirms that the GRAND instrumentation is apt to address the goals of the experiment and lays the groundwork for its ensuing stages.

 - **Abstract**
 The Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) has revealed a mysterious extended excess of GeV gamma-ray emission around the Galactic Center, which can potentially be explained by unresolved emission from a population of pulsars, particularly millisecond pulsars (MSPs), in the Galactic bulge. We used the distributed volunteer computing system Einstein@Home to search the Fermi-LAT data for gamma-ray pulsations from sources in the inner Galaxy, to try to identify the brightest members of this putative population. We discovered four new pulsars, including one new MSP and one young pulsar whose angular separation to the Galactic Center of 0.93° is the smallest of any known gamma-ray pulsar. We demonstrate a phase-resolved difference imaging technique that allows the flux from this pulsar to be disentangled from the diffuse Galactic Center emission. No radio pulsations were detected from the four new pulsars in archival radio observations or during the MPIfR-MeerKAT Galactic Plane Survey. While the distances to these pulsars remain uncertain, we find that it is more likely that they are all foreground sources from the Galactic disk, rather than pulsars originating from the predicted bulge population. Nevertheless, our results are not incompatible with an MSP explanation for the GC excess, as only one or two members of this population would have been detectable in our searches.

          Explaining the Origin of TeV Gamma Rays from M87 During High and Low States

 - **Abstract**
 The detection of very high-energy gamma-rays from M87 can provide crucial insights into particle acceleration and radiation mechanisms in jets. The recent observations by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) detector extend the energy range of TeV gamma-ray astronomy, and also the variability study to the TeV energy domain. We have modelled the low state and flare state multi-wavelength spectral energy distributions of M87 within a time-dependent framework. In our model, the low state gamma-ray flux results from the emissions from the sub-parsec and the kilo-parsec scale jets of M87, whereas the flare state gamma-ray flux is mainly produced in the sub-parsec scale jet. We have shown that the spectral and temporal features of the TeV gamma-ray spectrum of M87 are consistent with this two-zone model, where the contribution from the sub-parsec scale jet significantly increases during the flare state.

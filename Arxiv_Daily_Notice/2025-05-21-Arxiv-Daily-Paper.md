#### Title:
          Distinguishing the origin of eccentric black-hole mergers with gravitational-wave spin measurements

 - **Abstract**
 It remains an open question whether the binary black hole mergers observed with gravitational-wave detectors originate from the evolution of isolated massive binary stars or were dynamically driven by perturbations from the environment. Recent evidence for non-zero orbital eccentricity in a handful of events is seen as support for a non-negligible fraction of the population experiencing external driving of the merger. However, it is unclear from which formation channel eccentric binary black-hole mergers would originate: dense star clusters, hierarchical field triples, active galactic nuclei, or wide binaries in the Galaxy could all be culprits. Here, we investigate whether the spin properties of eccentric mergers could be used to break this degeneracy. Using the fact that different formation channels are predicted to either produce eccentric mergers with mutually aligned or randomly oriented black-hole spins, we investigate how many confident detections would be needed in order for the two models to be statistically distinguishable. If a few percent of binary black hole mergers retain measurable eccentricity in the bandwidth of ground-based detectors, we report a $\sim40\,\%$ chance that we could confidently distinguish both models after the fifth observing run of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA detector network, $\sim80\,\%$ for LIGO A#, and $\sim98\,\%$ for the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer.

 - **Abstract**
 Planet formation around young stars requires the growth of interstellar dust grains from mm-sized particles to km-sized planetesimals. Numerical simulations have shown that large ($\sim$mm-sized) grains found in the inner envelope of young protostars could be lifted from the disc via winds. However we are still lacking unambiguous evidence for large grains in protostellar winds/outflows. We investigate dust continuum emission in the envelope of the Class I binary L1551 IRS5 in the Taurus molecular cloud, aiming to identify observational signatures of grain growth, such as variations in the dust emissivity index ($\beta_{\rm mm}$). In this context, we present new, high-angular resolution (50 au), observations of thermal dust continuum emission at 1.3 mm and 3 mm in the envelope ($\sim$3000 au) of L1551 IRS5 , obtained as part of the ALMA-FAUST Large Program. We analyse dust emission along the cavity walls of the CO outflow, extended up to $\sim$1800 au. We find an H$_2$ volume density $>2\times10^5$ cm$^{-3}$, a dust mass of $\sim$58 M$_\oplus$, and $\beta_{\rm mm}$<1, implying the presence of grains $\sim$10$^3$ times larger than the typical ISM sizes. We provide the first spatially resolved observational evidence of large grains within an outflow cavity wall. Our results suggest that these grains have been transported from the inner disc to the envelope by protostellar winds and may subsequently fall back into the outer disc by gravity and/or via accretion streamers. This cycle provides longer time for grains to grow, playing a crucial role in the formation of planetesimals.

 - **Abstract**
 Limb-resolved transmission spectroscopy has the potential to transform our understanding of exoplanetary atmospheres. By separately measuring the transmission spectra of the evening and morning limbs, these atmospheric regions can be individually characterized, shedding light into the global distribution and transport of key atmospheric properties from transit observations alone. In this work, we follow up the recent detection of limb asymmetry on the exoplanet WASP-107 b (Murphy et al. 2024) by reanalyzing literature observations of WASP-107 b using all of JWST's science intruments (NIRISS, NIRCam, NIRSpec, and MIRI) to measure its limb transmission spectra from $\sim$1-12 $\mu$m. We confirm the evening--morning temperature difference inferred previously and find that it is qualitatively consistent with predictions from global circulation models. We find evidence for evening--morning variation in SO$_2$ and CO$_2$ abundance, and significant cloud coverage only on WASP-107 b's morning limb. We find that the NIRISS and NIRSpec observations are potentially contaminated by occulted starspots, which we leverage to investigate stellar contamination's impact on limb asymmetry measurements. We find that starspot crossings can significantly bias the inferred evening and morning transmission spectra depending on when they occur during the transit, and develop a simple correction model which successfully brings these instruments' spectra into agreement with the uncontaminated observations.

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of the high-energy emission in astrophysical jets from black holes is a highly debated issue. This is particularly true for jets from supermassive black holes that are among the most powerful particle accelerators in the Universe. So far, the addition of new observations and new messengers have only managed to create more questions than answers. However, the newly available X-ray polarization observations promise to finally distinguish between emission models. We use extensive multiwavelength and polarization campaigns as well as state-of-the-art polarized spectral energy distribution models to attack this problem by focusing on two X-ray polarization observations of blazar BL Lacertae in flaring and quiescent $\gamma$-ray states. We find that regardless of the jet composition and underlying emission model, inverse-Compton scattering from relativistic electrons dominates at X-ray energies.

          Large databases of metal-poor stars corrected for three-dimensional and/or non-local thermodynamic equilibrium effects

 - **Abstract**
 Early chemical enrichment processes can be revealed by the careful study of metal-poor stars. In our Local Group, we can obtain spectra of individual stars to measure their precise, but not always accurate, chemical abundances. Unfortunately, stellar abundances are typically estimated under the simplistic assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). This can systematically alter both the abundance patterns of individual stars and global trends of chemical enrichment. The SAGA database compiles the largest catalogue of metal-poor stars in the Milky Way. For the first time, we provide the community with the SAGA catalogue fully corrected for non-LTE (NLTE) effects, using state-of-the-art publicly available grids. In addition, we present an easy-to-use online tool NLiTE that quickly provides NLTE corrections for large stellar samples. For further scientific exploration, NLiTE facilitates the comparison of different NLTE grids to investigate their intrinsic uncertainties. Finally, we compare the NLTE-SAGA catalogue with our cosmological galaxy formation and chemical evolution model, NEFERTITI. By accounting for NLTE effects, we can solve the long-standing discrepancy between models and observations in the abundance ratio of [C/Fe], the best tracer of the first stellar populations. At low [Fe/H]<-3.5, models are unable to reproduce the high measured [C/Fe] in LTE, which are lowered in NLTE, aligning with simulations. Other elements are a mixed bag: some show improved agreement with models (e.g. Na) and others worse (e.g. Co). Few elemental ratios do not change significantly (e.g. [Mg/Fe], [Ca/Fe]). Properly accounting for NLTE effects is fundamental for interpreting the chemical abundances of metal-poor stars. Our NLiTE tool thus enables a meaningful comparison of stellar samples with stellar and chemical evolution models and low-metallicity gaseous environments at higher redshift.

          Field-Level Comparison and Robustness Analysis of Cosmological N-Body Simulations

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first field-level comparison of cosmological N-body simulations, considering various widely used codes: Abacus, CUBEP$^3$M, Enzo, Gadget, Gizmo, PKDGrav, and Ramses. Unlike previous comparisons focused on summary statistics, we conduct a comprehensive field-level analysis: evaluating statistical similarity, quantifying implications for cosmological parameter inference, and identifying the regimes in which simulations are consistent. We begin with a traditional comparison using the power spectrum, cross-correlation coefficient, and visual inspection of the matter field. We follow this with a statistical out-of-distribution (OOD) analysis to quantify distributional differences between simulations, revealing insights not captured by the traditional metrics. We then perform field-level simulation-based inference (SBI) using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), training on one simulation and testing on others, including a full hydrodynamic simulation for comparison. We identify several causes of OOD behavior and biased inference, finding that resolution effects, such as those arising from adaptive mesh refinement (AMR), have a significant impact. Models trained on non-AMR simulations fail catastrophically when evaluated on AMR simulations, introducing larger biases than those from hydrodynamic effects. Differences in resolution, even when using the same N-body code, likewise lead to biased inference. We attribute these failures to a CNN's sensitivity to small-scale fluctuations, particularly in voids and filaments, and demonstrate that appropriate smoothing brings the simulations into statistical agreement. Our findings motivate the need for careful data filtering and the use of field-level OOD metrics, such as PQMass, to ensure robust inference.

 - **Abstract**
 The Sun was born in a clustered environment with 10,000 other stars. Being an isolated star today, the Sun must have left the nest. We do not directly know when that happened, how violent the ejection was, or how far the Solar siblings have drifted apart. The mass of the fragile outer Opic-Oort cloud, (between $r_{\rm inner} \sim 30,000$\,au and $200\,000$au from the Sun) and the orbital distribution of planetesimals in the inner Hills-Oort cloud (between $\sim 1000$\,au and $\sim 30\,000$ au) are sensitive to the dynamical processes involving the Sun in the parent cluster. We aim at understanding the extend to which observing the Oort cloud constrains the Sun's birth environment. This is achieved by a combination of theoretical arguments and N-body simulations. We show that the current mass of the Opic-Oort cloud (between 0.2 and $2.0$ Earth masses) is best explained if the Sun left the nest within $\sim 20$\,Myr after the giant planets formed and migrated. As a consequence, the possible dynamical encounter with another star carving the Kuiper belt, the Sun's abduction of Sedna, and other perturbations induced by nearby stars then must have happened shortly after the giant planets in the Solar system formed, but before the Sun left the parent cluster. Signatures of the time spend in the parent cluster must still be visible in the outer parts of the Solar system today. The strongest constraints will be the discovery of a population of relatively low-eccentricity ($e < 0.9$) inner Oort-cloud (but $500 < a < 10^4$\,au) objects.

 - **Abstract**
 We develop a multipole analysis method for images with a circular boundary, then apply it to supernova remnant (SNR) images. The morphology of SNR images is related to several factors, including the inhomogeneities of the supernova ejecta and of the circumstellar medium in which the ejecta and shock wave travel. The current multipole method corrects some errors in a previously presented method, and applies the new analysis to test for differences in X-ray image morphology between Type Ia and core-collapse type SNRs. We find there is no clear difference between the two SNR types in morphology as measured by multipole moments.

 - **Abstract**
 Temperate sub-Neptune exoplanets could contain large inventories of water in various phases, such as water-worlds with water-rich atmospheres or even oceans. Both space-based and ground-based observations have shown that many exoplanets likely also contain photochemically-generated hazes. Haze particles are a key source of organic matter and may impact the evolution or origin of life. In addition, haze layers could provide a mechanism for lower-atmospheric shielding and ultimately atmospheric retention. Often orbiting close to M-dwarf stars, these planets receive large amounts of radiation, especially during flaring events, which may strip away their atmospheres. M-dwarf stars are known to have higher stellar activity than other types of stars, and stellar flares have the potential to accelerate atmospheric escape. In this work, we present results on laboratory investigations of UV radiation effects simulating two different stellar flare energies on laboratory-produced exoplanet hazes made under conditions analogous to water-world atmospheres. We find that both simulated flares altered the overall transmittance and reflectance of the hazes, and higher energy "flares" make those alterations more pronounced. On a larger scale, these laboratory-made hazes show potential signs of degradation over the simulated flaring period. Our results provide insight into the effects that stellar flaring events have on potential exoplanet haze composition and the ability for water-world-like exoplanets to retain their atmospheres.

 - **Abstract**
 The Be star $\pi$ Aquarii shows peculiar $\gamma$ Cas-type X-ray emission, likely caused by its outer disk interacting with a low-mass companion, probably a white dwarf. We study the long-term variability of its optical spectra to derive stellar and disk parameters during major changes. We identify and analyze Balmer, helium, silicon, and iron emission lines at selected epochs. Stellar parameters were derived using atmosphere models, considering oblate geometry due to fast rotation. Disk properties were constrained through H$\alpha$ line modeling using a viscous decretion disk model. The H$\alpha$ line evolved from shell to double-, triple-peaked, and flat-topped profiles. On Dec 22, 2001, the disk showed a low-intensity shell profile and fast density decay, indicating a small disk. From 2011 to 2014, the disk decayed slowly, then grew significantly until Nov 2022, increasing its H$\alpha$ equivalent width 18-fold and reaching an emitting region of ~65 solar radii. The inclination changed by ~10 degrees over 20 years, suggesting a precessing disk. The FeII 5018 A line traces a larger region than H$\alpha$ and is the only FeII line with a distinct profile. We conclude $\pi$ Aquarii is part of a misaligned binary system, with the white dwarf crossing the disk twice per orbit, capturing material, and enhancing X-ray emission.

          Can thermodynamic equilibrium be established in planet-forming disks?

 - **Abstract**
 The inner regions of planet-forming disks are warm and dense. The chemical networks used for disk modelling so far were developed for a cold and dilute medium and do not include a complete set of pressure-dependent reactions. The chemical networks developed for planetary atmospheres include such reactions along with the inverse reactions related to the Gibb's free energies of the molecules. The chemical networks used for disk modelling are thus incomplete in this respect. We want to study whether thermodynamic equilibrium can be established in a planet-forming disk. We identify the regions in the disk most likely to reach thermodynamic equilibrium and determine the timescale over which this occurs. We employ the theoretical concepts used in exoplanet atmosphere chemistry for the disk modelling with PROtoplanetary DIsk MOdel ({\sc ProDiMo}). We develop a chemical network called CHemistry Assembled from exoplanets and dIsks for Thermodynamic EquilibriA ({\sc ChaiTea}) that is based on the UMIST 2022, STAND, and large DIscANAlysis (DIANA) chemical networks. It consists of 239 species. From the STAND network, we adopt the concept of reversing all gas-phase reactions based on thermodynamic data. We use single-point models for a range of gas densities and gas temperatures to verify that the implemented concepts work and thermodynamic equilibrium is achieved in the absence of cosmic rays and photoreactions including radiative associations and direct recombinations. We then study the impact of photoreactions and cosmic rays that lead to deviations from thermodynamic equilibrium. We explore the chemical relaxation timescales towards thermodynamic equilibrium. Lastly, we study the predicted 2D chemical structure of a typical T\,Tauri disk when using the new {\sc ChaiTea} network instead of the large DIANA standard network, including photorates, cosmic rays, X-rays, and ice....

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results of multi-wavelength observations of the High-Mass Gamma-Ray Binary 4FGL J1405.1-6119. A pair of joint XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observations taken in 2019 (sampling the gamma-ray maximum and X-ray maximum) characterize the emission of soft and hard X-rays. We find variability of the hydrogen column density along our line of sight, $N_{\rm H}$, and photon index, $\Gamma$, and find no evidence of pulsations in X-rays. We also refine a new best-fit orbital period to $P=13.7157\pm0.0014$ days, the first orbital phase-resolved analysis based on nearly 16 years of Fermi--LAT observations of 4FGL J1405.1-6119 and the evolution of the spectral shape as a function of orbital phase. Finally, the X-ray and $\gamma$-ray spectra for the phases sampled in the new X-ray observations can be interpreted in the framework of the intrabinary shock model, previously applied to High-Mass Gamma-Ray binaries such as LS 5039.

          Extensions of Brown Hamiltonian-I. A high-accuracy model for von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai oscillations

 - **Abstract**
 Triple systems with low hierarchical structure are common throughout the Universe, including examples such as high-altitude lunar satellites influenced by the Earth, planetary satellites perturbed by the Sun, and stellar binaries affected by a supermassive black hole. In these systems, nonlinear perturbations are significant, making classical double-averaged models (even those incorporating the Brown Hamiltonian correction) insufficient for accurately capturing long-term dynamics. To overcome this limitation, the current study develops a high-precision dynamical model that incorporates the nonlinear effects of the quadrupole-order potential arising from both the inner and outer bodies, referred to as the extended Brown Hamiltonian model. This framework specifically expresses the Hamiltonian function and the transformation between mean and osculating orbital elements in elegant, closed forms with respect to the eccentricities of the inner and outer orbits. Practical applications to Jupiter's irregular satellites show that the long-term evolutions predicted by the extended Brown Hamiltonian model align well with the results of direct N-body simulations. The developed Hamiltonian offers a fundamental dynamical model, which is particularly well suited for describing von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai oscillations in low-hierarchy three-body systems.

 With the planned launch of the PLAnetary Transit and Oscillation of stars (PLATO) satellite mission in 2026, an understanding of the stellar properties and spatial distribution of astrophysical false positives (FPs) is essential to ensure the limited ground-based spectroscopy resources are used efficiently to target the most likely genuine planetary transit (PT) candidates. In our previous paper, Bray et al. (2023), we presented the expected blended eclipsing binary false positive (BEB) percentage in the proposed Southern PLATO field, which we referred to as SPF0. This was obtained from a detailed statistical analysis of a complete synthetic rendering of SPF0. In this follow-up paper, we present a more detailed analysis of the synthetic binary population creating these BEBs including the apparent radii of the planets mimicked, distances from Earth, orbital periods and binary component masses and evolutionary this http URL examine the properties of the BEBs from 400 new independent simulations where random orbital inclinations were assigned to all synthetic binaries in the entire SPF0 region. We consider BEBs created by all eclipses of non-compact remnant binaries. Finally we examine the BEBs most likely to be mistaken for planets in the habitable zone which we define as fully or partially eclipsing binaries with periods between 180 and 1,000 days satisfying our critical inclination angle check.

 - **Abstract**
 Modeling the light curves (LCs) of luminous astronomical transients, such as supernovae, is crucial for understanding their progenitor physics, particularly with the exponential growth of survey data. However, existing methods face limitations: efficient semi-analytical models (e.g., Arnett-like) employ significant physical simplifications (like time-invariant temperature profiles and simplified heating distributions), often compromising accuracy, especially for early-time LCs. Conversely, detailed numerical radiative transfer simulations, while accurate, are computationally prohibitive for large datasets. This paper introduces TransFit, a novel framework that numerically solves a generalized energy conservation equation, explicitly incorporating time-dependent radiative diffusion, continuous radioactive or central engine heating, and ejecta expansion dynamics. The model accurately captures the influence of key ejecta properties and diverse heating source characteristics on light curve morphology, including peak luminosity, rise time, and overall shape. Furthermore, TransFit provides self-consistent modeling of the transition from shock-cooling to $^{56}$Ni}-powered light curves. By combining physical realism with computational speed, TransFit provides a powerful tool for efficiently inverting LCs and extracting detailed physical insights from the vast datasets of current and future transient surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 We explore possible advantages of cyclic spectroscopy for observations of pulsars in instances where full cyclic deconvolution is not feasible. We compute cyclic merits and full-deconvolution regime boundaries for pulsars observed by NANOGrav and discuss which sources stand to benefit the most from using cyclic spectroscopy when observed with the Green Bank Telescope and DSA-2000 in a given frequency range. We compare data products, namely the wavefield, in both full-deconvolution and partial-deconvolution regimes to demonstrate what can be accomplished with incomplete phase retrieval. Additionally, we show how some phase retrieval can still be achieved in the partial-deconvolution regime and how this allows for additional information in scintillation-based data products, like the dynamic wavefield power, compared to what can be found in traditional dynamic spectra. An examination of dynamic wavefield phase as a function of observing frequency reveals more complete phase retrieval is achieved the closer one gets to the full deconvolution regime, agreeing with the expectations of cyclic merit. While we demonstrate that fragmentary recovery of the secondary wavefield can be accomplished in the partial-deconvolution regime, we advocate for a synergistic approach with phase retrieval methods like the $\theta-\theta$ transform, although we also provide discussion about shortcomings of this strategy. Finally, we use the combination of modest cyclic merit and lack of discernible results for PSR J1903$+$0327 to motivate the creation of an updated "cyclic merit 2.0", which relies on scintillation bandwidth instead of observing bandwidth.

 - **Abstract**
 Research on the high-mass end of the initial mass function (IMF) has been limited due to a scarcity of samples. Recently, Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST), as the most efficient spectroscopic telescope, has provided new opportunities for related research. In this study, based on approximately 70,000 main-sequence early-type stars from the LAMOST survey, we investigated the IMF of Galactic field stars at the high-mass end (1.5 < M/Msun < 7.1). First, we derived the slope of the present-day mass function (PDMF), finding after correcting for selection effect in the observed sample. We then accounted for the effects of stellar evolution and unresolved binaries to correct the PDMF back to the IMF, resulting in {\alpha}ini = 2.70 - 2.82. Notably, we corrected both stellar evolution and unresolved binary effects simultaneously by using binary-Star evolution code, which enhances the robustness of our results. Additionally, we investigated how different mass-ratio (q) distributions of binaries and different star formation histories of the Milky Way impact the IMF. Finally, we tested samples across different spatial scales and found that {\alpha}ini may exhibit a decreasing trend as the spatial scale increases, which could be attributed to variations in metallicity.

 - **Abstract**
 Mean-motion resonances (MMRs) form through convergent disc migration of planet pairs, which may be disrupted by dynamical instabilities after protoplanetary disc (PPD) dispersal. This scenario is supported by recent analysis of TESS data showing that neighboring planet pairs in younger planetary systems are closer to resonance. To study stability of MMRs during migration, we perform hydrodynamical simulations of migrating planet pairs in PPDs, comparing the effect of laminar viscosity and realistic turbulence. We find stable 3:2 resonance capture for terrestrial planet pairs migrating in a moderately massive PPD, insensitive to a range of laminar viscosity (alpha = 0.001 to 0.1). However, realistic turbulence enhances overstability by sustaining higher equilibrium eccentricities and a positive growth rate in libration amplitude, ultimately leading to resonance escape. The equilibrium eccentricity growth rates decrease as planets migrate into tighter and more stable 4:3 and 5:4 MMRs. Our results suggest that active disc turbulence broadens the parameter space for overstability, causing planet pairs to end up in closer-in orbital separations. Libration within MMR typically lead to deviation from exact period ratio |Delta| \sim 0.5%, which alone is insufficient to produce the typical dispersion of |Delta| \sim 1 to 3% in TESS data, suggesting that post migration dynamical processes are needed to further amplify the offset.

 - **Abstract**
 Reliable stellar atmospheric parameters are essential for probing stellar structure and evolution, and for stellar population studies. However, various deviations appear in comparisons with different ground-based spectroscopic surveys. We aim to select high-quality open cluster members and employ the atmospheric parameters provided by the theoretical isochrones of open clusters as a benchmark to assess the quality of stellar atmospheric parameters from Gaia DR3 and other ground-based spectroscopic surveys, such as LAMOST DR11, APOGEE DR17, and GALAH DR4. We selected 130 open clusters with well-defined main sequences within 500 pc of the solar neighborhood as a benchmark sample to estimate the reference atmospheric parameters of the members from the best-fit isochrones of those clusters. By comparing the atmospheric parameters provided by different spectroscopic surveys to the theoretical parameters, we found that the atmospheric parameter deviation and the corresponding dispersions exhibit different variations. The atmospheric parameter deviations of F, G, and K-type stars are smaller than those of B, A, and M-type stars for most surveys. For most samples, the dispersion of Teff decreases as temperature decreases, whereas the dispersion of logg shows the opposite trend.

 - **Abstract**
 With around 200 detections of exoplanets around giant stars to date, our knowledge of the population of exoplanets orbiting evolved hosts more massive than the Sun remains limited. The CORALIE radial-velocity search for companions around evolved stars (CASCADES) was launched in 2006 with the aim of improving our understanding of the demographics of exoplanets around intermediate-mass stars, by studying them once they have evolved off the main sequence. We intend to refine the current sample of known exoplanets orbiting intermediate-mass (1.5 - 5 M$_\odot$) giant stars of spectral types G and early K. We searched for exoplanets orbiting the four stars HD 87816, HD 94890, HD 102888, and HD 121056. We used data obtained with the CORALIE spectrograph, mounted on the Leonhard Euler Swiss telescope located at La Silla Observatory in Chile. We gathered high-precision radial-velocity measurements over more than ten years for each of the aforementioned targets. We started by performing a search for periodic signals in the radial-velocity time series of the four targets by using periodograms. Following this, we fit for a Keplerian model using the significant peak with the highest power of the periodogram as the starting guess for the period. We then subtracted this model and repeated the procedure iteratively on the residuals until no significant peaks were found. Finally, to explore the posterior distribution of our models, the final solution was determined using a Markov chain Monte Carlo approach. We report the discovery of five new massive planets around HD 87816, HD 94890, and HD 102888 as well as the presence of a distant, potentially substellar, companion around HD 102888. We confirm the presence of a previously announced exoplanet orbiting the HD 121056 multi-object system with a period of 89 days and propose an update to the period of the outer companion.

 - **Abstract**
 Vortices have been observed at various heights within the solar atmosphere and are suggested to potentially play great roles in heating the solar upper atmosphere. Multiple automated vortex detection methods have been developed and applied to detect this http URL aim to improve the $\Gamma$-functions method for vortex identification by optimizing the value of $\Gamma_{1min}$ and the approach to calculate $\Gamma_1$ and $\Gamma_2$ used to determine vortex center and edge. In this way, we can detect vortices more accurately and enable more statistical studies that can improve our knowledge of the generation and evolution of vortices in the solar atmosphere. We apply the automated swirl detection algorithm (ASDA, one representative of $\Gamma$-functions method) with different parameters to various synthetic data, with each containing 1000 Lamb-Oseen vortices, and search for the optimal $\Gamma_{1min}$ and kernel size when calculating $\Gamma_1$ and $\Gamma_2$. We also compare another detection method using simulation and observational data to validate the results obtained from the synthetic data. The best performance is found with the Optimized ASDA, which combines different kernel sizes (5, 7, 9, and 11) to calculate $\Gamma_1$ and $\Gamma_2$ with a fixed $\Gamma_{1min}$ = 0.63 to detect vortex center. We find that more vortices can be detected by the Optimized ASDA with higher location, radius, and rotation speed accuracies. The above results are further confirmed by comparing vortices detected by the Optimized ASDA and the SWIRL method on CO5BOLD numerical simulation data and SST observational data.

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we propose a novel method based on the wavelet scattering transform (WST) to distinguish large-scale structures of the universe across different cosmological models while mitigating tracer bias. By introducing a tailored data preprocessing strategy--particularly a high-density apodization technique--and defining a new statistical measure, the WST $m$-mode ratios, we assess performance using \texttt{CosmicGrowth} N-body simulations across three datasets: WMAP, mWMAP, and Planck. We find that only the WST ratio $R^{\rm wst}$ within the scale range $j \in [3,7]$ achieves a reduced chi-square for cosmological parameters $\chi^2_{\nu, \rm cos} \gg 1$ while maintaining $\chi^2_{\nu, \rm bias} \sim 1$ for tracer bias--a regime unattained by any other statistic. These results highlight $R^{\rm wst}$ as a promising tool for future galaxy surveys, offering strong cosmological sensitivity with effective bias mitigation.

 - **Abstract**
 The observed millisecond-scale duration is an essential yet mysterious feature of fast radio bursts (FRBs). In this Letter, we link the observed soft gamma-ray counterpart of FRB 200428 to electron-positron pair cascades driven by Compton scattering and the Breit-Wheeler process. We demonstrate that such pair cascades can truncate FRBs to durations down to millisecond-scale, thereby establishing millisecond-scale upper bounds on their durations. The physical processes involved in the truncation mechanism occur during the propagation of FRBs after their production. Consequently, this mechanism is independent of the specific production mechanism or origin of the FRBs, suggesting that it could potentially operate in all FRBs. Our results lift the constraint on FRB production mechanisms that they must inherently generate bursts lasting only milliseconds.

 - **Abstract**
 Most known white dwarfs in multiple systems with main sequence stars have been discovered with M-type companions, because the white dwarf causes detectable UV excess and bluer colors than expected from a single M star. Surveys have shown that the number of white dwarfs in Sirius-like systems within 100 pc of the Sun is lower than expected, suggesting that white dwarfs are being missed in the glare of their main sequence companions. In this work we have leveraged the angular resolution and high-contrast capabilities, as well as optimization for visible wavelengths, of the extreme adaptive optics instrument MagAO-X to detect new white dwarf companions to AFGK stars. We present the first results of our survey with the extreme AO instrument MagAO-X, called the Pup Search, of 18 targets with seven new candidate companions, five of which are confirmed to be white dwarfs. We discuss the new detections in the context of previous surveys and other detection metric sensitivities and show that we are sensitive to a region not probed by other surveys. Finally we discuss the future of the Pup Search in light of developing technologies.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the first high-purity identification of cosmic-ray (CR) protons and a precise measurement of their energy spectrum from 0.15 to 12 PeV using the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO). Abundant event statistics, combined with the simultaneous detection of electrons/photons, muons, and Cherenkov light in air showers, enable spectroscopic measurements with statistical and systematic accuracy comparable to satellite data at lower energies. The proton spectrum shows significant hardening relative to low-energy extrapolations, culminating at 3 PeV, followed by sharp softening. This distinct spectral structure - closely aligned with the knee in the all-particle spectrum - points to the emergence of a new CR component at PeV energies, likely linked to the dozens of PeVatrons recently discovered by LHAASO, and offers crucial clues to the origin of Galactic cosmic rays.

 - **Abstract**
 OSIRIS-REx, NASA's first asteroid sample return mission, rendezvoused with the near-Earth asteroid Bennu in 2018 and delivered a 121.6-gram sample to Earth in 2023, the largest amount of material ever recovered from a planetary body beyond the Moon. The operations phase of OSIRIS-REx was considered the most challenging robotic mission that NASA had undertaken, owing to the tight constraints on spacecraft performance and the microgravity environment. In preparation for the sample collection and return campaign, the mission leadership defined four operational key decision points (OKDPs) at critical junctures: sample site selection, rehearsal and execution of the sample collection maneuver, sample stow, and Earth return. This publication examines these OKDPs in depth, inclusive of rationale, implementation, decision processes, and efficacy. We also review other decisions that enabled mission success despite the unexpectedly rugged nature of Bennu's surface. This information should be beneficial for future challenging operational concepts where science-in-the-loop, time-critical decision making is integral to success.

          The Great Comets of 1843 and 1882 at Their Previous Return to Perihelion in the Twelfth Century: One Spectacular, the Other Dull

 - **Abstract**
 New insights into the history of C/1843 D1 and C/1882 R1, the two celebrated Kreutz sungrazers, are provided by assessing evidence on their appearance at the previous perihelion return, known as X/1106 C1 and the Chinese comet of 1138 (Ho's No. 403), respectively. The conditions differed vastly because of disparities in geocentric distance, solar elongation, and phase correction (forward scattering), all linked to the arrival times (early February vs early August). The conclusions include: the daytime sighting of the 1106 comet by Sigebert de Gembloux is consistent with expectation and so are the accounts of an exceptionally long tail observed later in twilight; the comet reached perihelion only hours before its daytime detection; the 1138 comet could have never been sighted in daylight or discovered much earlier than it actually was, in early September, one month after perihelion; at discovery, the tail is predicted to have reached elevations of 15-30 deg, while the head was merely 10 deg above horizon, when observed from moderate northern latitudes; notion that Kreutz sungrazers at perihelion between mid-May and mid-August could not be seen from the ground except possibly in daylight is misleading; the appearance of the 1138 comet's nucleus after its tidal fragmentation at perihelion is modeled on the assumption that it consisted of five major fragments (including C/1882 R1 and C/1965 S1); and unpredictable morphological changes with time in the 1882 sungrazer's split nucleus are discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new stellar dynamical measurement of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) in the compact elliptical galaxy NGC 4486B, based on integral field spectroscopy with JWST/NIRSpec. The two-dimensional kinematic maps reveal a resolved double nucleus and a velocity dispersion peak offset from the photometric center. Utilizing two independent methods-Schwarzschild orbit-superposition and Jeans Anisotropic Modeling-we tightly constrain the black hole mass by fitting the full line-of-sight velocity distribution. Our axisymmetric Schwarzschild models yield a best-fit black hole mass of $M_{BH} = 3.6^{+0.6}_{-0.6} \times 10^8 \, M_{\odot}$, slightly lower but significantly more precise than previous estimates. However, since our models do not account for the non-equilibrium nature of the double nucleus, this value may represent a lower limit. The inferred black hole mass corresponds to approximately 4-13% of the total stellar mass, providing robust evidence for an overmassive SMBH in NGC 4486B. Combined with the galaxy's location deep within the Virgo Cluster, our results support the interpretation that NGC 4486B is the tidally stripped remnant core of a formerly massive galaxy. As the JWST/NIRSpec field of view is insufficient to constrain the dark matter halo, we incorporate archival ground-based long-slit kinematics extending to 5 arcsec. While this provides some leverage on the dark matter content, the constraints remain relatively weak. We place only an upper limit on the dark matter fraction, with $M_{DM}/M_{*} < 0.5$ within 1 kpc-well beyond the effective radius. The inferred black hole mass remains unchanged with or without a dark matter halo.

 - **Abstract**
 Water is detected in environments representing every stage of star and solar system formation, but its chemical evolution throughout these stages remains poorly constrained. Deuterium ratios offer a means of probing chemical links between water in different cosmic regions because of their sensitivity to physicochemical conditions. Here, we present the first detection of the 4.1 $\mu$m HDO ice feature with JWST toward L1527 IRS, an isolated low-mass protostar that may eventually grow to a sun-like mass. We measure an ice HDO/H$_{2}$O ratio of 4.4$^{+3.7}_{-1.7}$$\times$10$^{-3}$, where the reported error is dominated by uncertainties in continuum definition and ice band strengths. This fraction is similar to the gas HDO/H$_{2}$O ratios measured in the warm ($>$100 K) inner cores of other low-mass protostellar envelopes and protoplanetary disks found in comparably isolated star-forming regions. Such a similarity tentatively supports the assumption that water vapor detected in these regions is not significantly altered by gas-phase reactions following ice sublimation. It also supports the hypothesis that pre- and protostellar water ice is largely inherited in a chemically unaltered state by outer protoplanetary disks. However, the fraction is a factor of $\sim$4-10 times higher than the gas HDO/H$_{2}$O ratios measured toward comets and low-mass protostars in clustered star-forming regions. This difference may be due to either gas-phase water reprocessing in protostellar envelopes and protoplanetary disks, or differences between prestellar conditions of isolated dense cores and the clustered star-forming regions that are more analogous to the environment in which our Sun formed.

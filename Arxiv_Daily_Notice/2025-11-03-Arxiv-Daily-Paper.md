- **Abstract**
 In the Milky Way disk there is a strong trend linking stellar age to surface element abundances. Here we explore this relationship with a dataset of 8,803 red-giant and red-clump stars with both asteroseismic data from NASA Kepler Mission and surface abundances from the SDSS-V MWM. We find, with a k-nearest-neighbors approach, that the [Mg/H] and [Fe/Mg] abundance ratios predict asteroseismic ages to an accuracy of about 2 Gyr for the majority of stars. That said, there are substantial outlier stars whose surface abundances do not match their asteroseismic ages. Because asteroseismic ages for these stars are fundamentally based on density or mass, these outliers are mass-transfer candidates. Stars whose surface abundances predict a younger age (higher mass) than what's seen in the asteroseismology are mass accretor candidates (MAC); stars whose abundances predict an older age (lower mass) than the asteroseismology age are mass donor candidates (MDC). We create precise control samples, matched according to (1) surface abundances and (2) asteroseismic ages, for both the MAC and MDC stars; we use these to find slight differences in rotational velocity, [C/N], and [Na/Mg] between the mass-transfer candidates and their abundance neighbors. We find no drastic differences in kinematics, orbital invariants, UV excess, or other stellar abundances between outliers and their abundance neighbors. We deliver 377 mass-transfer candidates for follow-up observations. This project implicitly suggests a fundamental limit on the reliability of asteroseismic ages, and supports existing evidence that age-abundance outliers are products of binary mass transfer.

- **Abstract**
 The distribution and the abundance of metals in the intergalactic medium (IGM) have strong implications on galaxy formation and evolution models. The ionic transitions of heavy elements in quasar spectra can probe both the mechanisms and the sources of chemical pollution, but high resolution, high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) spectra are required, as the IGM absorbers can be too weak for direct detection. In this work, we investigate the IGM metallicity, focusing on the detection of the weak absorption lines. We exploited the cosmological tool of the two-point correlation function (TPCF) and applied it to the transmitted flux in the CIV forest of the ultra-high S/N UVES spectrum of the quasar HE0940-1050 (z~3). We also "deabsorbed" the strongest circum-galactic medium (CGM) systems to reveal the underlying IGM signal. For each test, we generated 1000 mock spectra with shuffled line positions to derive an estimate for the TPCF noise level. The TPCF shows a clear peak at the characteristic velocity separation of the CIV doublet, but when deabsorbing the CGM contribution (i.e. all metal lines and CIV lines associated with logN(HI)>14.0), the peak is no longer significant at 1$\sigma$, although 7 weak CIV systems remain visible. Even adding up to 135 additional weak mock CIV systems (logN(HI)<14.0) to the spectrum does not produce a significant CIV peak. Eventually, when we create a synthetic spectrum with gaussian distributed noise and same S/N as the complete spectrum, we remove the signal caused by the spectral intrinsic features and thus find a peak compatible with a metallicity of -3.80<[C/H]<-3.50. We conclude that the TPCF method is not sensitive to the presence of the weakest systems in the real spectrum, despite the extremely high S/N and high resolution of the data. However, the results of this statistical technique would possibly change when combining more than one line of sight.

          A Critical Examination of the PAH Hypothesis

- **Abstract**
 The polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) hypothesis proposes that the aromatic infrared bands (AIBs) observed at 3.3, 6.2, 7.7, 8.6, 11.3, and 12.7 mic originate from gas-phase PAH molecules. These bands exhibit consistent peak wavelengths and profiles in diverse sources, and ISO SWS and JWST spectra show a nearly identical red wing of the 3.3 mic AIB and blue wing of the 11.2 mic AIB in the dominant Class A sources. This spectral uniformity suggests that the AIBs arise from a small, well-defined set of gas phase PAH species, regardless of the excitation conditions or the nature of the source such as HII regions, reflection nebulae, planetary nebula, young stellar objects, or the diffuse interstellar medium. However, a small number of gas phase PAH species is inconsistent with current modeling of the AIBs that require a wide range of PAH types and sizes. It is also inconsistent with the lack of observed UV and optical absorption bands from gas phase PAH molecules. Furthermore, there is no plausible formation pathway to produce only a small number of specific PAH molecules in the interstellar medium. These issues require quantitative investigation in order to definitively establish gas-phase PAH molecules as the carrier of the AIBs.

- **Abstract**
 We investigate the evolution of red supergiant (RSG) progenitors of core-collapse (CC) supernovae (SNe) with initial masses between $12-20~M_\odot$ focusing on the effects of enhanced mass loss due to pulsation-driven instabilities in their envelopes and subsequent dynamical ejections during advanced stages of nuclear burning. Using time-dependent mass loss from detailed MESA stellar evolution models, including a parameterized prescription for pulsation-driven superwinds and time-averaged mass loss rates attributed to resulting shock-induced ejections, we construct the circumstellar medium (CSM) before the SN explosion. We calculate resulting CSM density profiles and column densities considering the acceleration of the stellar wind. Our models produce episodes of enhanced mass loss $10^{-4}-10^{-2}~M_\odot~\rm{yr}^{-1}$ in the last centuries-decades before explosion forming dense CSM ($>10^{-15}~\rm{gcm}^{-3}$ at distances $<10^{15}$ cm) -- consistent with those inferred from multi-wavelength observations of Type II SNe such as SN~2023ixf and SN~2020ywx.

- **Abstract**
 The chemical evolution of fluorine is still a matter of debate in Galactic archaeology, especially at low metallicities, where it is particularly challenging to obtain the corresponding chemical abundances from observations. We present here the first detailed theoretical study of the chemical evolution of fluorine at low metallicity by means of a stochastic chemical evolution model for the Galactic halo, in light of the most recent data for fluorine, which further pushed observations to lower metallicities down to [Fe/H]$\sim$-4 dex, more than a factor of 10 lower in metallicity than previous detections. We employ a state-of-the-art stochastic chemical evolution model to follow the evolution in the Galactic halo, which has been shown to reproduce well the main observables in this Galactic component and the abundance patterns of CNO and neutron-capture elements, and we implement nucleosynthesis prescriptions for fluorine, focusing on the chemical evolution of this element. By comparing recent observations with model predictions, we confirm the importance of rotating massive stars at low metallicities to explain both the [F/Fe] vs [Fe/H] and [F/O] vs [O/H] diagrams. In particular, we showed that we can reach high [F/Fe]$\sim$2 dex at [Fe/H]$\sim$-4 dex, in agreement with recent observations at the lowest metallicity. With a stochastic chemical evolution model for the Galactic halo, we confirm the importance of rotating massive stars as fluorine producers, as hinted by previous studies using chemical evolution models for the Galactic disc. We also expect an important production of F at high redshift, in agreement with recent detections of supersolar N by JWST. Further data for fluorine at low metallicities and also at high redshift would be needed to put further constraints on the chemical evolution of fluorine and be compared to our theoretical predictions.

- **Abstract**
 UZ Dra is a detached and totally-eclipsing binary containing two late-F stars in a circular orbit of period 3.261 d. It has been observed by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite in 41 sectors, yielding a total of 664,809 high-quality flux measurements. We model these data and published radial velocities to determine the physical properties of the system to high precision. The masses of the stars are 1.291 +/- 0.012 Msun and 1.193 +/- 0.009 Msun, and their radii are 1.278 +/- 0.004 Rsun and 1.122 +/- 0.003 Rsun. The high precision of the radius measurements is made possible by the (previously unrecorded) total eclipses and the extraordinary amount of data available. The light curves show spot modulation at the orbital period, and both stars rotate synchronously. Our determination of the distance to the system, 185.7 +/- 2.4 pc, agrees very well with the parallax distance of 185.39 +/- 0.39 pc from Gaia DR3. The properties of the system are consistent with theoretical predictions for an age of 600 +/- 200 Myr and a slightly super-solar metallicity.

- **Abstract**
 Ethanol (CH3CH2OH) has been detected in interstellar ices within regions associated with the early stages of star and planet formation. Its solid-phase pathways can lead to diverse conditions that can significantly influence its photostability and -chemistry. Laboratory studies have explored the effects of energetic processing on pure ethanol ices, there is a gap in understanding how ethanol behaves in astrophysically relevant mixed ices. This proof-of-principle study aims to quantify how the ice composition influences the photostability of ethanol mixed with CO, from both physical and chemical perspectives. It also seeks to highlight the importance of balancing constructive and destructive processes. Mixtures with ethanol to CO ratios ranging from 1:0 to 1:11 are exposed to UV irradiation from a microwave discharge H lamp under UHV conditions, at 16 K. The evolution of the solid phase is tracked using reflection-absorption infrared spectroscopy, and changes in the gas phase are monitored with a quadrupole mass spectrometer. Temperature-programmed desorption experiments aid in the identification of infrared spectral features. A radiative-transfer model has been developed to account for the influence of ice composition on the effective photon flux. The model reveals that, during later stages of irradiation, photoproducts play a significant role in the absorbing of incident photons, highlighting the complex cascade of processes initiated by single-photon absorption in ethanol-containing ices. By evaluating photodestruction cross sections as a function of the initial ice composition, we found that CO exerts a stabilizing effect on ethanol. For highly dilute ethanol:CO mixtures, representative of astronomical ices, the photodestruction cross section of ethanol is estimated to ~1.6E-17 cm2/photon after correcting for the effective absorbed UV fluence of the studied interstellar ice analogs.

- **Abstract**
 We present the discovery of 52 eclipsing quadruple star candidates detected in TESS Full Frame Image eleanor data by machine learning and citizen scientists. The uniformly-vetted and -validated targets exhibit two sets of eclipses following two distinct periods, representing quadruple systems with a 2+2 hierarchical configuration. Detailed photocenter measurements confirmed that both sets of eclipses originate within ~0.1-0.2 pixels (~2-4 arcsec) of the corresponding target, and ruled out resolved nearby field stars. The catalog includes a number of systems producing prominent eclipse timing variations and/or apsidal motion, a quadruple with an outer period of ~1,400 days, and even a 2+2 quadruple in a likely wide quintuple with a resolved co-moving star. Additionally, two systems have complete astrometric solutions for the outer orbits from Gaia. We provide the measured ephemerides, eclipse depths and durations, overall statistical properties, and highlight potentially interesting systems that merit further investigations.

- **Abstract**
 Cyclopentadiene (c-C5H6) is considered a key molecule in the formation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the interstellar medium (ISM). The synthesis of PAHs from simpler precursors is known as the "bottom-up" theory, which, so far, has been dominated by reactions between organic radicals. However, this mechanism struggles to account for the origin of the smallest cycles themselves. Ion-molecule reactions emerge as promising alternative pathways to explain the formation of these molecules. In the present work, we investigate the reaction network of the main ionic precursor of cyclopentadiene c-C5H7+ . To this end, we establish an integrated protocol that combines astrochemical modelling to identify viable formation routes under cold interstellar medium conditions, automated reaction path search and kinetic simulations to obtain accurate descriptions of the reaction pathways and reliable rate constants. In particular, we examine the reaction between ethylene (C2H4) and the linear propargyl cation (CH2CCH+). Our results reveal that the formation of c-C5H7+ by radiative association turns out to be inefficient, contrary to our initial expectations. Instead, the system predominantly evolves through bimolecular channels yielding c-C5H5+ and CH3CCH2+ with the formation of c-C5H5+ offering new insights into reactivity that supports molecular growth in the ISM.

- **Abstract**
 3 Puppis is the brightest known B[e] star. Recent work classifies this A-type object as a supergiant, yet the impact of its binarity on the circumstellar environment (CE) remains hard to characterize. To resolve its dusty region at 5-10 mas, we obtained mid-IR interferometric observations with VLTI/MATISSE over 3-12 {\mu}m. Because the (u,v) coverage supports imaging, we introduce a statistical interferometric-imaging workflow based on MiRA to generate averaged images: this systematic approach enables the selection of an optimal set of reconstructions, improving the robustness and fidelity of the recovered features. We also use SPARCO, an independent tool well suited to bright central objects embedded in fainter extended emission. Images from both tools in the L, M, and N bands agree and reveal an asymmetric, elongated feature ~17 mas (~10 au at 631 pc) southeast of the star with ~20% density contrast. A second northwest asymmetry and a skewed inner rim are detected. Simple geometric modelling, guided by the MATISSE images, constrains the morphology, location, and flux of the CE and its asymmetries. The images are consistent with earlier VLTI measurements but expose a more complex CE with large-scale clumps in the southeast and northwest parts of the disc. Hydrodynamic modelling indicates that tidal spiral-wake perturbations from the central binary, dynamically excited at Lindblad resonances in the circumbinary disc, best explain the radial extent and curvature of the elongated structures seen in all bands.

          X-ray and UV Observations of the Young Sun HIP~67522: Evidence of Lyman-alpha Absorption Within the Planetary System

- **Abstract**
 We present ultraviolet (UV) spectroscopy of the 17 Myr, G0V star, HIP 67522. The UV spectrum is characterized by strong chromospheric and transition region emission lines. There was moderate spectral variability during the observations consisting of 15% stochastic fluctuation and two small flares releasing $E_{UV} \simeq 2-4\times10^{32}$ ergs in each event. We compare the broadband spectral energy distribution (SED; 4.7 A - 13.0~$\mu$m) of the star first presented in Thao et al. (2024) to the solar SED and show that X-ray/UV (XUV) flux density at 1 AU is $10^{2}-10^{5}$ stronger (from 1000 A down to 5 A) in the young star compared to the present-day Sun. Attempts to reconstruct the intrinsic Ly-alpha emission of the star failed to return physically realistic results. The discrepancy appears to arise from a population of neutral hydrogen within the system itself, extending to $> \pm500$ km/s. The absorption could be due to outflow from exoplanet atmospheric loss or from a stellar component; such a picture would require high spectral resolution observations and/or UV transit spectroscopy to confirm. Finally, we examine the evolution of the XUV emission from solar-type stars from ages of 17 Myr to 9.4 Gyr and derive a scaling relation between FUV Ly-alpha and EUV emission as a function of stellar age. X-ray (1--100 A) and EUV (100--900 A) contributions to high energy emission are 329 and 672 ergs/cm^2/s at 1 AU, respectively, suggesting that both may contribute to exoplanet heating at this epoch. The XUV emission levels at 17 Myr combined with the low density of the planet HIP67522b are consistent with models that predict that solar type stars born with high rotation and activity levels will drive substantial heating and escape on close-in, gaseous planets.

          Accretion-Driven Turbulence in the Circumgalactic Medium

- **Abstract**
 Both observations and hydrodynamic simulations suggest that turbulence is ubiquitous in the circumgalactic medium (CGM). We study the development and properties of CGM turbulence driven by accretion in halo masses of $10^{10}-10^{13}\,{\rm M}_\odot$ at redshifts $0\leq z\lesssim 2$, thus providing a baseline for additional turbulence driving processes such as galaxy feedback. Using analytic considerations and idealized hydrodynamical simulations we demonstrate that in halos with mass up to $\sim10^{12}\,{\rm M}_\odot$, even mild turbulent velocities near the virial radius of $\sigma_{\rm t}(R_{\rm vir})\sim 10\,{\rm km \, s^{-1}}$ are enhanced by the accretion process so that turbulent velocities are comparable to the virial velocity at inner CGM radii, with $\sigma_{\rm t}(0.1\,R_{\rm vir})\approx v_{\rm vir}\sim 100\,{\rm km \, s^{-1}}$. Rapid cooling at these inner radii further implies that thermal pressure support is small, and the gas is dominated by the cool and warm ($\sim10^4-10^5\,{\rm K}$) phases. Inner CGM energetics are thus dominated by turbulence, with gas density distributions and velocity structure functions similar to those seen in simulations of isothermal supersonic ISM turbulence, rather than those seen in subsonically turbulent stratified media such as the ICM. The gas accretion rate in these systems is regulated by the turbulence dissipation rate rather than by the cooling rate as in more massive halos. We argue that galaxy feedback is unlikely to qualitatively change our conclusions unless it continuously injects high specific energy material ($\gg v^2_{\rm vir}$) into the CGM. Such `turbulence-dominated' CGM can be identified in observations via the predicted wide lognormal ionization distributions and large velocity dispersions in UV absorption spectra, particularly in the inner CGM of $\sim L^\star$ and lower-mass halos.

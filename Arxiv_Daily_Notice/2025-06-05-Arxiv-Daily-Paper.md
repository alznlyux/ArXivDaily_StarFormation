          Model-Independent Reconstruction of $f(T)$ Gravity Using Genetic Algorithms

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we use genetic algorithms, a specific machine learning technique, to achieve a model-independent reconstruction of $f(T)$ gravity. By using $H(z)$ data derived from cosmic chronometers and radial Baryon Acoustic Oscillation method, including the latest Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) data, we reconstruct the Hubble rate which is the basis parameter for reconstructing $f(T)$ gravity without any assumptions. In this reconstruction process, we use the current value of the Hubble rate, $H_0$, derived by genetic algorithms. The reconstructed $f(T)$ function is consistent with the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology within the 1$\sigma$ confidence level across a broad temporal range. The mean $f(T)$ curve, adopting a quadratic form, prompts us to parametrize it using a second degree polynomial. This quadratic deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM scenario is mildly favored by the data.

 - **Abstract**
 Every halo of collisionless dark matter contains a $\rho = A r^{-1.5}$ density cusp at its center. This prompt cusp is a relic of the halo's earliest moments and has a mass comparable to the cutoff scale in the spectrum of initial density perturbations. In this work, we provide a framework to predict for each halo the coefficient $A$ of its central cusp. We also present a "cusp-NFW" functional form that accurately describes the density profile of a halo with a prompt cusp at its center. Accurate characterization of each halo's central cusp is of particular importance in the study of warm dark matter models, for which the spectral cutoff is on an astrophysically relevant mass scale. To facilitate easy incorporation of prompt cusps into any halo modeling approach, we provide a code package that implements the cusp-halo relation and the cusp-NFW density profile.

 - **Abstract**
 The Kepler field hosts the best studied sample of field star rotation periods. However, due to Kepler's large 4" pixels, many of its light curves are at high risk of contamination from background sources. The new Kepler Bonus Background light curves are de-blended using a PSF algorithm, providing light curves of over 400,000 new background sources in addition to over 200,000 re-analyzed Kepler prime targets. These light curves provide the opportunity to search for new rotation periods. Here we apply a convolutional neural network trained on synthetic spot-modulated light curves to regress rotation periods from the Kepler Bonus light curves. We obtained periods for 32,159 total sources, 19,650 of which had previously been measured and 9,811 of which are new periods for both Kepler prime and background sources. Our method also detected 608 pulsation frequencies from asteroseismic oscillations in red giants. We validate our Kepler prime periods against literature values and present the full period sample. We find excellent agreement with previously-known literature periods, validating deep learning as a viable class of period determination methods. Comparing the periods and light curves of foreground-background pairs, we find that as many as 63% of periodic background light curves are still blended with the foreground, highlighting limitations of the de-blending technique.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the data reduction methodology used for the COSMOS-Web survey JWST NIRCam data. Covering 0.54 deg^2 with four broadband filters (F115W, F150W, F277W, F444W) and a total exposure time of approximately 270 hours, COSMOS-Web represents the largest contiguous field surveyed during JWST Cycle 1, posing unique data reduction challenges due to its extensive scale. By combining the official JWST Calibration Pipeline with custom improvements for noise removal, background subtraction, and astrometric alignment, we achieve high fidelity science-ready mosaics. We detail the systematic approach employed in the three stages of the JWST Calibration Pipeline. The data, collected in three epochs from January 2023 to January 2024, encompass 152 visits and have been processed into 20 mosaic tiles to optimize computational efficiency and data processing. The final data products achieve 5 sigma depths of 26.7-28.3 AB mag in 0.15" apertures. The processed and calibrated datasets are made available to the public.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we present an equation of state formalism for hot Neutron Stars (NSs) which consistently includes the effects of finite temperature, hyperons as well as neutrino trapping, relevant for the study of proto-neutron stars, binary neutron star mergers and supernova explosions. Within a non-linear relativistic mean field description, the framework allows for a systematic variation of nuclear parameters within the range allowed by uncertainties in nuclear experimental data, ensuring compatibility with nuclear theory, astrophysical and heavy-ion data. We then investigate the role of nuclear and hypernuclear parameters on NS macroscopic properties and $f$-mode oscillations in hot neutron stars within Cowling approximation. Our results reveal that in hyperonic neutron stars with trapped neutrinos, the saturation nuclear density shows moderate to strong correlation with NS astrophysical observables. We also investigate the $C-Love$ universal relations for this model and provide fit relations for hot NS configurations in the neutrino-trapped regime.

 - **Abstract**
 The NASA Exoplanet Archive and the Exoplanet Follow-up Observing Program service are two widely used resources for the exoplanet community. The NASA Exoplanet Archive provides a complete and accurate accounting of exoplanetary systems published by NASA missions and by the community in the refereed literature. In anticipation of continued exponential growth in the number of exoplanetary systems, and the increasing complexity in our characterization of these systems, the NASA Exoplanet Archive has restructured its primary tables and interfaces, as well as extending and standardizing their modes of access. The Exoplanet Follow-up Observing Program service provides the exoplanet community with a venue for coordinating and sharing follow-up and precursor data for exoplanets, their host stars, and stars that might eventually be targets for future planet searches, and recently reached one million files uploaded by the community. In this paper we describe the updates to our data holdings, functionality, accessibility, and tools, as well as future priorities for these two services.

 - **Abstract**
 We present dynamical mass measurements, obtained from multi-epoch Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observations, for the young multiple stellar system EC\,95, located in the core of the Serpens star-forming region. Our dataset includes both archival data and more recent observations obtained as part of the \textit{Dynamical Masses of Young Stellar Multiple Systems with the VLBA project} (DYNAMO--VLBA), totalling 32 epochs over 12 years of observation. The observations span more than half of the EC\,95AB orbit, which has an estimated period of $21.6\pm0.1$ years, and yield masses of $2.15\pm0.10$ M$_\odot$ for EC\,95A and $2.00\pm0.12$ M$_\odot$ for EC\,95B. Furthermore, for the first time, we have estimated the mass of the third component (EC\,95C) using four available radio detections as well as an infrared observation. We find it to be 0.26 $^{+0.53}_{-0.46}$ M$_\odot$, suggesting that E\,95C is a low-mass T Tauri star. We conclude that EC\,95 is a hierarchical triple system comprised of a tight central binary proto-Herbig\,AeBe system and a lower mass companion on a wider orbit. These results contribute to improve our understanding of the stellar dynamics in this system and provide valuable insights into its triple nature.

 - **Abstract**
 The Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) consists of empirical mode decomposition (EMD), which is a template-free method that represents the combination of different intrinsic modes on a time-frequency map (i.e., the Hilbert spectrum). The application of HHT involves introducing trials by imposing white noise on the signal and then calculating the ensemble mean process of the corresponding EMD to demonstrate its significance on the Hilbert spectrum. In this study, we develop a stacked Hilbert-Huang Transform (sHHT) method that generates the Hilbert spectrum for each trial and compiles all results to enhance the strength of the real instantaneous frequency of the main signal on the time-frequency map. This new approach is more sensitive to detecting/tracing the nonlinear and transient features of a signal embedded in astronomical databases than the conventional HHT, particularly when the signal experiences dramatic frequency changes in a short time. We analytically investigate the consistency of HHT and sHHT and perform numerical simulations to examine the dispersion of the instantaneous frequency obtained through sHHT and compare its advantages and effectiveness with those of conventional HHT. To confirm the feasibility of the sHHT, we demonstrate its application in verifying the signal of superorbital modulation in X-ray and binary black hole mergers in gravitational waves.

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxy-galaxy strong gravitational lenses can constrain dark matter models and the Lambda Cold Dark Matter cosmological paradigm at sub-galactic scales. Currently, there is a dearth of images of these rare systems with high signal-to-noise and angular resolution. The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (hereafter, Roman), scheduled for launch in late 2026, will play a transformative role in strong lensing science with its planned wide-field surveys. With its remarkable 0.281 square degree field of view and diffraction-limited angular resolution of ~0.1 arcsec, Roman is uniquely suited to characterizing dark matter substructure from a robust population of strong lenses. We present a yield simulation of detectable strong lenses in Roman's planned High Latitude Wide Area Survey (HLWAS). We simulate a population of galaxy-galaxy strong lenses across cosmic time with Cold Dark Matter subhalo populations, select those detectable in the HLWAS, and generate simulated images accounting for realistic Wide Field Instrument detector effects. For a fiducial case of single 146-second exposures, we predict around 160,000 detectable strong lenses in the HLWAS, of which about 500 will have sufficient signal-to-noise to be amenable to detailed substructure characterization. We investigate the effect of the variation of the point-spread function across Roman's field of view on detecting individual subhalos and the suppression of the subhalo mass function at low masses. Our simulation products are available to support strong lens science with Roman, such as training neural networks and validating dark matter substructure analysis pipelines.

          Late gas released in the young Kuiper belt could have significantly contributed to the carbon enrichment of the atmospheres of Neptune and Uranus

 - **Abstract**
 Exo-Kuiper belts have been observed for decades, but the recent detection of gas in some of them may change our view of the Solar System's youth. Late gas produced by the sublimation of CO (or CO$_2$) ices after the dissipation of the primordial gas could be the norm in young planetesimal belts. Hence, a gas-rich Kuiper belt could have been present in the Solar System. The high C/H ratios observed on Uranus and Neptune could be a clue to the existence of such late gas that could have been accreted onto young icy giants. The aim of this paper is to estimate the carbon enrichment of the atmospheres of Uranus and Neptune caused by the accretion of the gas released from a putative gas-rich Kuiper belt. We find that assuming a primordial Kuiper belt with a mass of tens of earth masses leads to significant CO gas accretion onto the giants, which can lead to high C/H ratios, especially for Uranus and Neptune. Our model shows that a relatively massive gas-rich Kuiper belt could have existed in the Solar System's youth, significantly enriching the atmospheres of Uranus and Neptune with carbon. Late gas accretion and its effect on outer giant planets metallicities could be a universal scenario, also occurring in extrasolar systems. Observations of sub-Jupiter exoplanets could provide very useful information to better constrain this scenario, with an enrichment in carbon and oxygen (for warm-enough planets) compared to other elements that should be inversely proportional to their envelope mass.

 - **Abstract**
 With over 1,000,000 images from more than 10,000 exposures using state-of-the-art high-contrast imagers (e.g., Gemini Planet Imager, VLT/SPHERE) in the search for exoplanets, can artificial intelligence (AI) serve as a transformative tool in imaging Earth-like exoplanets in the coming decade? In this paper, we introduce a benchmark and explore this question from a polarimetric image representation learning perspective. Despite extensive investments over the past decade, only a few new exoplanets have been directly imaged. Existing imaging approaches rely heavily on labor-intensive labeling of reference stars, which serve as background to extract circumstellar objects (disks or exoplanets) around target stars. With our POLARIS (POlarized Light dAta for total intensity Representation learning of direct Imaging of exoplanetary Systems) dataset, we classify reference star and circumstellar disk images using the full public SPHERE/IRDIS polarized-light archive since 2014, requiring less than 10 percent manual labeling. We evaluate a range of models including statistical, generative, and large vision-language models and provide baseline performance. We also propose an unsupervised generative representation learning framework that integrates these models, achieving superior performance and enhanced representational power. To our knowledge, this is the first uniformly reduced, high-quality exoplanet imaging dataset, rare in astrophysics and machine learning. By releasing this dataset and baselines, we aim to equip astrophysicists with new tools and engage data scientists in advancing direct exoplanet imaging, catalyzing major interdisciplinary breakthroughs.

 - **Abstract**
 Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are emerging as powerful cosmological probes for constraining the baryon fraction in the intergalactic medium (IGM), offering a promising avenue to address the missing baryon problem. In this paper, we analyze constraints on the IGM baryon fraction ($f_\mathrm{IGM}$) using 92 localized FRBs, incorporating a corrected probability distribution function for the IGM dispersion measure within three different cosmological models. We find that variations in the underlying cosmological model have a negligible impact on the inferred values of $f_\mathrm{IGM}$. While the NE2001 Galactic electron density model yields slightly higher $f_\mathrm{IGM}$ values compared to the YMW16 model, the results are consistent within the 1$\sigma$ confidence level. Additionally, there is no statistically significant evidence for redshift evolution in $f_\mathrm{IGM}$. Our analysis constrains $f_\mathrm{IGM}$ to the range $0.8 \sim 0.9$, providing strong support for the idea in which the majority of the missing baryons reside in the diffuse IGM.

 - **Abstract**
 The low-frequency radio telescope of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA-Low), currently under construction in the remote Murchison shire in the Western Australia's outback, will observe the sky between 50 MHz and 350 MHz with unprecedented sensitivity and stringent requirements for polarization accuracy. In this work, we investigate the instrumental polarization purity of a SKA-Low prototype station by means of the Intrinsic Cross-Polarization Ratio (IXR) figure of merit. We derive all-sky experimental IXR maps using data from the Aperture Array Verification System 2 (AAVS2). The results are presented at three frequencies within the SKA-Low bandwidth (110, 160, and 230 MHz) with a quantitative comparison between observed and simulated all-sky IXR maps. Our findings show good agreement in IXR map distributions and promising consistency in their radial profiles, meeting SKA-Low's IXR specification overall. This study offers an empirical approach to verifying SKA-Low's polarization performance using all-sky observations from individual stations and will potentially support the telescope's early science commissioning phase.

          Do they repeat? Monitoring 36 non-repeating FRBs with FAST

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of fast radio bursts (FRBs), highly energetic, millisecond-duration radio pulses originating from beyond our galaxy, remains unknown. Observationally, FRBs are classified as non-repeating or repeating, however, this classification is complicated by limited observing time and sensitivity constraints, which may result in some repeating FRBs being misidentified as non-repeating. To address this issue, we adopt both empirical and machine-learning techniques from previous studies to identify candidates that may have been misclassified. We conducted follow-up observations of 36 such candidates, each observed for 10 minutes using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST). No radio bursts exceeding a signal-to-noise ratio of 7 were detected, with a typical 7 sigma fluence limit of ~0.013 Jy ms. We constrain the repetition rates of these sources using two statistical models of FRB occurrence. Combining our FAST non-detections with prior observations, we derive upper limits on the repetition rates of ~$10^{-2.6}$-$10^{-0.22}$ hr$^{-1}$ under a Poisson process, and ~$10^{-2.3}$-$10^{-0.25}$ hr$^{-1}$ under a Weibull process. This work presents one of the most stringent upper limits on FRB repetition rates to date, based on a sample size five times larger than those used in previous studies.

 - **Abstract**
 Evidence for a low-frequency gravitational-wave background using pulsar timing arrays has generated recent interest into its underlying contributing sources. However, multiple investigations have seen that the significance of the evidence does not change with choice of pulsar modeling techniques but the resulting parameters from the gravitational wave searches do. PSR J1455-3330 is one of the longest-observed pulsars in the array monitored by the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav) but showed no evidence for long-timescale red noise, either intrinsic or the common signal found among many pulsars in the array. In this work, we argue that NANOGrav's piecewise-constant function used to model variations in radio-frequency-dependent dispersive delay should not be used for this pulsar, and a much simpler physical model of a fixed solar wind density plus a linear trend in dispersion measure is preferred. When the original model is replaced, (i) the pulsar's timing parallax signal changes from an upper limit to a significant detection, (ii) red noise becomes significant, and (iii) the red noise is consistent with the common signal found for the other pulsars. Neither of these signals are radio-frequency dependent. While the same physical motivation will not apply to many of the pulsars currently used in pulsar timing arrays, we argue for careful physically-motivated timing and noise modeling of pulsars used in precision timing experiments.

          Peering through the veil: Investigating protoplanetary disk outer edges using backside visibility

 - **Abstract**
 Protoplanetary disks observed in scattered light reveal essential insights into the disk's three-dimensional architecture and dust properties. These disks, which play a crucial role in planet formation, have complex structures where the visibility of the disk's backside can vary significantly based on several parameters. This study aims to explore the factors impacting backside visibility in protoplanetary disks, particularly under variations in inclination, dust distribution, grain characteristics, and outer disk morphology. Using RADMC-3D radiative transfer simulations, we investigate how these variables influence the appearance of the backside in scattered light images. Tapered disk models with exponential tapers, frequently obscure the backside, which supports the rarity of observed backside features. In cases where backside features are visible at lower inclinations, they likely indicate cut-off disks, as backside detection is challenging in standard tapered models at these inclinations. Additionally, factors like dust mass, grain distribution, and disk material stratification play crucial roles in backside observability, affecting its potential detection in real observations. This study contributes to understanding the detectability of the backside in protoplanetary disks, with implications for refining observational strategies and interpreting backside features in scattered light images. These findings help frame backside visibility as a critical aspect of assessing disk structure and evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Several phenomenological aspects of low-luminosity neutron star transients, such as atolls, remain poorly understood. One such source, MAXI J1807+132, entered its latest outburst in July 2023. To thoroughly characterize this outburst, we conducted an extensive observational campaign spanning radio to X-ray wavelengths. Here, we present the results of this campaign, which covered the period from before the outburst to the return to quiescence. We detected a delay between the X-ray and optical rise times, which is consistent with the predictions of the disk instability model with a truncated disk. The color evolution and optical/X-ray correlations, along with infrared and radio detections, support the presence of jet synchrotron emission during the gradual decay phase following the peak. We also report for the first time in an X-ray binary a near-orthogonal rotation of the optical polarization just before a small flare, after which the jet is thought to be quenched. The main outburst is followed by several high-amplitude, rapid reflares in the optical, ultraviolet, and X-ray bands, the origin of which remains difficult to constrain.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive spectro-polarimetric and timing analysis of eleven black hole X-ray binaries, namely Cyg X-1, 4U 1630-47, Cyg X-3, LMC X-1, 4U 1957+115, LMC X-3, Swift J1727.8-1613, GX 339-4, Swift J151857.0-572147, IGR J17091-3624, and MAXI J1744-294, using quasi-simultaneous observations from {\it IXPE}, {\it NICER}, {\it NuSTAR}, and {\it AstroSat}. Timing analyses reveal characteristic type-B and type-C Quasi-periodic Oscillations (QPOs) across different spectral states, often associated with episodic radio ejections. Broadband ($0.7-60$ keV) spectral modelling, employing disc, Comptonization, and reflection components, reveals degeneracies in constraining disc-corona geometries. Polarimetric measurements in 2-8 keV band detect significant polarization degrees (PDs) ranging from $3-20.6\%$ ($1.2-21.4\%$) in harder (softer) states, with moderate to strong energy dependence, except for LMC X-1, Swift J151857.0-572147, and MAXI J1744-294, where no significant polarization is detected. We report the polarization detections of Cyg X-3 (PD $\sim 21.4\%$, SIMS), LMC X-3 (PD $\sim 2.4\%$, HSS) and IGR J17091-3624 (PD $\sim 9\%$, LHS) using the recent {\it IXPE} observations. A positive correlation is found between PD and the Comptonized photon fraction ($cov_{\rm frac}$), while an anti-correlation is observed with the disc-to-Comptonized flux ratio ($F_{\rm ratio}$) across spectral states. The combined timing, spectral, and polarimetric results, together with constraints from radio jet observations, suggest a radially extended corona within a truncated disc for Cyg X-1, Swift J1727.8-1613, IGR J17091-3624, and GX 339-4, whereas the disc-corona geometry remains unconstrained for 4U 1957+115, LMC X-3, and 4U 1630-47. We discuss the implications of these findings for understanding accretion geometries and highlight prospects for future X-ray polarimetric studies.

 - **Abstract**
 We have developed a novel methodology utilizing molecular dynamics simulations to evaluate the ionization yields of nuclear recoils in crystalline silicon. This approach enables analytical exploration of atomic-scale transport within the lattice without necessitating parameterization. The quenching factors across the nuclear recoil energy range from 20 eV to 10 keV have been thoroughly investigated. A remarkable agreement with experimental data is achieved, particularly for the minimal energy regime conducted to date, reaching the level of a single electron-hole pair. This work presents evidence of a crucial and fundamental distribution of the quenching factor, which can be associated to the collisional interactions underlying the transport phenomena. The region below 4 keV of the quenching factor, where discrepancies have been observed with the Lindhard's model, is found to be significantly attributed to the lattice binding effect and the specific crystal structure. In contrast, a gradual functional relationship is identified below approximately 100 eV, indicating that the quenching factor is influenced by the crystallographic orientation of the target material. From a distributional perspective, our analysis allows for the determination of the minimum exclusion mass for the dark matter nucleon elastic scattering channel at 0.29 $\mathrm{GeV}/c^2$, thereby significantly enhancing sensitivity for the sub-$\mathrm{GeV}/c^2$ mass region.

 - **Abstract**
 L-BASS is an instrument designed to make radiometric temperature measurements of the sky with an absolute accuracy of better than 0.1 K at 1.4 GHz. This will be achieved in two steps: first by measuring the sky temperature relative to that of the North Celestial Pole, using two horn-based antennas, and second with the sky antenna replaced with a calibrated cryogenic load to measure the absolute brightness temperature of the North Celesial Pole. Here we describe the design of the L-BASS two-antenna system and report on laboratory measurements to establish its performance at component and sub-system level.

 - **Abstract**
 A comprehensive analysis of the cosmological large-scale structure derived from galaxy surveys involves field-level inference, which requires a forward modelling framework that simultaneously accounts for structure formation and tracer bias. While structure formation models are well-understood, the development of an effective field-level bias model remains imprecise, particularly in the context of tracer perturbation theory within Bayesian reconstruction methods, which we address in this work. To bridge this gap, we have developed a differentiable model that integrates augmented Lagrangian perturbation theory, nonlinear, nonlocal, and stochastic biasing. At the core of our approach is the Hierarchical Cosmic-Web Biasing Nonlocal (HICOBIAN) model, which provides a positive definite description of tracer bias while incorporating a long- and short-range nonlocal framework via cosmic-web regions and deviations from Poissonity in the likelihood. A key insight of our model is that transitions between cosmic-web regions are inherently smooth, which we implement using sigmoid-based gradient operations. This enables a fuzzy, and, hence, differentiable hierarchical cosmic-web description, making the model well-suited for machine learning frameworks. Our approach accurately reproduces the primordial density field within associated error bars, as validated by two- and three-point statistics in Fourier space. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the methodology approaches the maximum encoded information consistent with Poisson noise. We introduce a Bayesian field-level inference algorithm that leverages the same forward modelling framework used in galaxy, quasar, and Lyman alpha forest mock catalog generation -- including nonlinear, nonlocal and stochastic bias with redshift space distortions -- providing a unified and consistent approach to the analysis of large-scale cosmic structure.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of the Galactic Center using Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs), such as H.E.S.S., MAGIC, and VERITAS, have revealed a very-high-energy (VHE, $\gtrsim 100$ GeV) gamma-ray source, HESS J1745$-$290, aligned with the dynamical center of the Milky Way. This source shows point-like emission ($\lesssim 0.1^\circ$) and a strong suppression in its energy-differential spectrum in the ten TeV energy regime, modeled well by a power-law with an exponential cutoff. The origin of this emission is debated, with candidate emission scenarios including dark matter annihilations, millisecond pulsars in the central stellar clusters, and hadronic interactions in the vicinity of Sagittarius A*. Deriving the sensitivity to these spectral models is key to discriminating the physical processes at work. We show that combining H.E.S.S., MAGIC, and VERITAS archival data can well described the observed emission by a power-law with an exponential energy cutoff within the present uncertainties. Given the near advent of the array of the Large-Sized Telescopes (LSTs) at CTAO-N, we timely simulate realistic upcoming observations of the central emission by the CTAO-N four-LST array, to derive the sensitivity to resolve the sharpness of the spectral energy cutoff. We find that 500 hours of four-LST observations taken at large zenith angles, possibly accumulated over several years, can significantly discriminate the dark-matter emission scenario from the leptonic and hadronic ones. Also, a preliminary 3$\sigma$ hint for such discrimination could emerge within the first year. We demonstrate, for the first time, that CTAO-N is able to provide new insights on differentiating among the above-mentioned emission scenarios in the next several years.

 - **Abstract**
 Ultra-light dark matter (ULDM) is a compelling candidate for cosmological dark matter. If ULDM interacts with ordinary matter, it can induce measurable, characteristic signals in pulsar-timing data because it causes the orbits of pulsars in binary systems to osculate. In this work, we investigate the potential of machine learning (ML) techniques to detect such ULDM signals. To this end, we construct three types of neural networks: an autoencoder, a binary classifier, and a multiclass classifier. We apply these methods to four theoretically well-motivated ULDM models: a linearly coupled scalar field, a quadratically coupled scalar field, a vector field and a tensor field. We show that the sensitivity achieved using ML methods is comparable to that of a semi-analytical Bayesian approach, which to date has only been applied to the linear scalar case. The ML approach is readily applicable to all four ULDM models and, in the case of the multiclass classifier, can distinguish between them. Our results, derived from simulated data, lay the foundation for future applications to real pulsar-timing observations.

          Dynamically derived morphology from the recurrence patterns of close binary stars using Kepler data

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we propose a novel method to classify close binary stars, derived from the dynamical structure inherent in their light curves. We apply the technique to light curves of binaries from the revised Kepler Eclipsing binary catalog, selecting close binaries which have the standard morphology parameter, $c$, $\gt 0.5$ corresponding to semi-detached, over-contact and ellipsoidal systems. Using the method of time delay embedding, we recreate the non-linear dynamics underlying the data and quantify the patterns of recurrences in them. Using two recurrence measures, Determinism and Entropy, we define a new Dynamically Derived Morphology (DDM) parameter and compute its values for the Kepler objects. While as expected, this metric is somewhat inversely correlated with the existing morphology parameter (Spearman $\rho= -0.32$), the method offers an alternate classification scheme for close binary stars that captures their nonlinear dynamics, an aspect often overlooked in conventional methods. Hence, the DDM parameter is expected to distinguish between stars with similar folded light curves, but are dynamically dissimilar due to nonlinear effects. Moreover, since the method can be easily automated and is computationally efficient it can be effectively used for future sensitive large data sets.

 - **Abstract**
 The unexpected finding of a ring system around the Centaur (10199) Chariklo opened a new window for dynamical studies and posed many questions about the formation and evolutionary mechanisms of Centaurs as well as the relationship to satellites and outbursting activity. As minor planets that cross the orbits of the giant planets, Centaurs have short dynamical lifetimes: Centaurs are supplied from the trans-Neptunian region and some fraction migrates inward to become Jupiter-family comets. Given these dynamical pathways, a comparison of attributes across these classifications provides information to understand the source population(s) and the processes that have affected these minor planets throughout their lifetimes. In this chapter we review the current knowledge of satellites, rings, and debris around Centaur-like bodies, discuss the observational techniques involved, place the information into context with the trans-Neptunian Objects, and consider what the results tell us about the outer solar system. We also examine open questions and future prospects.

 We report the delivery to the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST) of tables containing Root Mean Square (RMS) Combined Differential Photometric Precision (CDPP) values for all TESS 2-min cadence targets with Science Processing Operations Center (SPOC) light curves in Sectors 1-90. Each comma-separated values (CSV) file contains CDPP values for all 2-min light curves in the given sector. The tables include robust RMS CDPP values for the 15 trial transit pulse durations searched in the SPOC 2-min processing pipeline, ranging from 0.5-15.0 hr. For each pulse duration, CDPP is computed in the transit search for a trial transit centered on every cadence. The RMS value of the CDPP time series is a metric that may be employed to estimate signal-to-noise ratio for transits with the given duration and a specified depth. We will continue to deliver the RMS CDPP tables to MAST for each observing sector.

          The effective running Hubble constant in SNe Ia as a marker for the dark energy nature

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a new method that reveal the nature of dark energy (DE) evolution. Specifically, the method consists of studying the evolving trend regarding the effective running Hubble constant: when it increases, it indicates a quintessence nature, and when it decreases, it reveals a phantom behavior. Within the framework of the dark energy models we analyze three parameterizations: the $w$CDM model, a reduced Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) model and a new theoretical model based on the possible creation of dark energy by the time-varying gravitational field of the expanding Universe. For each DE model, we construct a theoretical effective running Hubble constant, i.e. a function of the redshift, which highlights the difference between modified dynamics and the $\Lambda$CDM-one. Furthermore, these dark energy models are compared to the phenomenological model of a decreasing trend of the Hubble constant as a function of the redshift, called the power-law model (PL) and the $\Lambda$CDM one. These three theoretical functions are fitted against the binned SNe Ia data samples, i.e. the Pantheon and the Master samples, the latter being a collection of SNe Ia from 4 catalogs: Dark Energy Survey (DES), PantheonPlus, Pantheon and Joint Lightcurve Analysis (JLA), without duplicated SNe Ia, called the Master sample. The main result of our study is that the phenomenological PL model is statistically favored compared to the other proposed scenarios, both for the Pantheon and the Master samples. At this stage, the SNe Ia data do not indicate that the evolution of dark energy models among the studied ones is favored respect to the $\Lambda$CDM. Nevertheless, the binned Pantheon sample allows for a discrimination of the nature of dark energy at least at the $1\,\sigma$ level via the fit of the effective running Hubble constant.

 - **Abstract**
 In the past two decades, transit surveys have revealed a class of planets with thick atmospheres -- sub-Neptunes -- that must have completed their accretion in protoplanet disks. When planets form in the gaseous disk, the gravitational interaction with the disk gas drives their migration and results in the trapping of neighboring planets in mean motion resonances, though these resonances can later be broken when the damping effects of disk gas or planetesimals wane. It is widely accepted that the outer Solar System gas giant planets originally formed in a resonant chain, which was later disrupted by dynamical instabilities. Here, we explore whether the early formation of the terrestrial planets in a resonance chain (including Theia) can evolve to the present configuration. Using N-body simulations, we demonstrate that the giant planet instability would also have destabilized the terrestrial resonance chain, triggering moon-forming giant impacts in 20--50\% of our simulated systems, dependent on the initial resonance architecture. After the instability, the eccentricity and inclination of the simulated planets match their present-day values. Under the proposed scenario, the current period ratio of 3.05 between Mars and Venus -- devoid of any special significance in traditional late formation models -- naturally arises as a relic of the former resonance chain.

 - **Abstract**
 The Vera Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) is expected to revolutionize time-domain optical astronomy as we know it. With its unprecedented depth, the LSST will survey the southern hemisphere sky, generating nearly 32 trillion observations over its nominal 10-year operation. Among these, approximately 10 million will be supernovae (SNe). These observations will uniquely characterize the SN population, enabling studies of known and rare SN types, detailed parameterization of their light curves, deep searches for new SN progenitor populations, the discovery of strongly lensed SNe, and the compilation of a large, well-characterized sample of superluminous SNe. We analyzed a sample of 22663 simulations of LSST light curves for core collapse SNe (CCSNe), modeled using the radiative transfer code STELLA. We analyzed this dataset with the software CASTOR, which enables the reconstruction of synthetic light curves and spectra via a machine learning technique that allows one to retrieve the complete parameter map of a SN. For each parameter we compared the observed and the true values, determining how LSST light curves alone will contribute to characterize the progenitor and the explosion. Our results indicate that LSST alone will not suffice for a comprehensive and precise characterization of progenitor properties and explosion parameters. The limited spectral coverage of LSST light curves (in most cases) does not allow for the accurate estimation of bolometric luminosity, and consequently, of the explosion energy and nickel yield. Additionally, the redshift-absorption degeneracy is difficult to resolve without supplementary information. These findings suggest that for the most interesting SNe, complementary follow-up observations using spectrographs and optical facilities (particularly in the infrared bands) will be essential for accurate parameter determination.

          Stellar distributions around supermassive black holes in gas-rich nuclear star clusters

 - **Abstract**
 We study the stellar distribution around supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in gas-rich nuclear star clusters (NSCs). NSCs could contain vast amounts of gas, which contribute significantly to shaping the stellar distribution, typically altering the stellar density cusp from the usual Bahcall \& Wolf 1976 solution and consequently affecting the dynamics in the NSC. The dense gaseous environment in NSCs gives rise to dynamical phenomena that are otherwise rare in other gas-free environments. Here we extend the derivation introduced in Bahcall \& Wolf 1976 to include an additional energy dissipation term associated with gas drag. We examine the effect of different forms of gas drag on the stellar density distribution. Finally, we discuss implications on the rates of tidal disruption events and other transients triggered by stellar interactions in gas-rich galactic nuclei.

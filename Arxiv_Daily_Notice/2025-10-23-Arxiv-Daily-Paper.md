#### Title:
          Intermediate-Mass Stripped Stars in the Magellanic Clouds: Forward Modeling the Observed Population Discovered Via UV Excess

- **Abstract**
 Stripped stars are hot, helium-rich stars formed when binary interactions remove a star's hydrogen envelope. While low-mass ($\lesssim 1\,M_\odot$) and high-mass ($\gtrsim 8\,M_\odot$) stripped stars are well studied as hot subdwarfs and Wolf-Rayet stars, their intermediate-mass counterparts ($1-8 \,M_\odot$) have only recently been discovered. The Stripped-Star Ultraviolet Magellanic Cloud Survey (SUMS) identified UV-excess sources in the Magellanic Clouds using Swift-UVOT photometry and selected 820 photometric stripped-star candidates. However, the selection function, completeness, and purity of this sample remain poorly understood. We forward model the population of stripped stars in the Magellanic Clouds using a binary population synthesis model combined with spatially resolved star formation histories and simulated UV photometry. To assess survey sensitivity, we inject simulated sources into real Swift-UVOT images and reproduce the SUMS selection process, including crowding, extinction, and photometric quality cuts. We recover $\sim 250$ simulated stripped stars with masses $\gtrsim 1\,M_{\odot}$, which corresponds to a recover rate of $9-13\,\%$. The rest are missed due to dilution by luminous companions, crowding, and high extinction. The observed population is biased toward systems with low-mass companions formed by common envelope evolution and toward systems with compact object companions. Of the stripped stars which show UV excess, $25-45\,\%$ are identifiable by SUMS; higher-resolution data or improved reddening corrections are needed to detect the rest. We predict contamination of the observed stripped star candidates by main-sequence stars with spurious UV excess due to crowding and provide guidelines for selecting higher-purity subsamples. These results enable tests of binary evolution models and realistic comparison of observed and simulated stripped-star populations.
#### Title:
          Modeling the Optical Colors of Galactic Cirrus Clouds in the Stripe 82 Region

- **Abstract**
 Observations have shown that the optical colors of Galactic cirrus clouds differ significantly from those of extragalactic sources; thus, they can be used to distinguish Galactic cirrus from extragalactic low surface brightness (LSB) features. To understand these properties, we calculate radiative transfer models in dust clouds, where photons are incident from the ambient interstellar medium (ISM). Dust clouds are modeled to mimic a turbulent medium using a fractional Brownian motion algorithm, resulting in a lognormal density distribution and a power-law power spectral density that are appropriate for the ISM. The results are compared with optical observations of cirrus clouds in the Stripe 82 region. The observed color--color ($g-r$, $r-i$, and $i-z$) diagrams of the cirrus clouds can be reproduced by scattered light if the interstellar radiation field (ISRF) of Mathis et al. (as updated by Draine) is modified, either by reducing the intensities in the $i$ and $z$ bands or by enhancing those in the $g$ and $r$ bands. Similar results can also be obtained by adjusting the scattering albedos at the corresponding wavelengths. This demonstrates that the color--color diagrams are effective not only for identifying extragalactic LSB features but also for studying the ISRF and the properties of interstellar dust.

- **Abstract**
 We report the discovery and characterization of three transiting giant planets in the TIC118798035 system. The three planets were identified as transiting candidates from data of the TESS mission, and confirmed with ground-based photometric transit observations along with radial velocity variations obtained with FEROS, HARPS and ESPRESSO. The three planets present transit timing variations (TTVs). We performed a N-body orbital fitting to the TTVs and radial velocities finding that TIC118798035 b is as warm low-density Neptune with a mass of 0.0250$\pm$0.0023 $M_J$, a radius of 0.655$\pm$0.018 $R_J$, and an orbital period of 11.507 d; TIC118798035 c is a warm Saturn with a mass of 0.403$\pm$0.024 $M_J$, a radius of 0.973$\pm$0.023 $R_J$, and an orbital period of 22.564 d; and TIC118798035 d is a warm Jupiter with a mass of 0.773$\pm$0.052 $M_J$, a radius of 0.923$\pm$0.044 $R_J$, and an orbital period of 48.925 d. The bulk metallicities of the three planets don't fully follow the mass-metallicity correlation found for the giant planets of the solar system, which hints at a somewhat different formation history for the planets of the TIC118798035 system. TIC118798035 is the only system having more than two transiting planets larger than 0.5 $R_J$ with a precise orbital and physical characterization, amenable for future atmospheric studies.

          FAUST. XXVIII. High-Resolution ALMA Observations of Class 0/I Disks: Structure, Optical Depths, and Temperatures

- **Abstract**
 We present high-resolution (~7.5 au) ALMA observations at 1.3 and 3 mm of 16 disks around Class 0/I protostars across multiple star-forming regions and a variety of multiplicities, showing a range of disk sizes (~2-100 au) and including circumbinary disks (CBDs) in binaries with separations <100 au. The disk properties show similarities to Class II disks, including (a) low spectral index (SI) values (alpha=2.1) that increase with disk radius, (b) 3 mm disk sizes only marginally smaller than at 1.3 mm (<10%), and (c) radial intensity profiles well described by modified self-similar profiles. We also find key differences: (i) SI values increasing with radius, but exceeding 2 only at the disk edge (ii) higher brightness temperatures Tb, in some cases higher than the predicted temperatures due to irradiation, and (iii) ~10x higher luminosity at a given size compared to the Class II disks. These results confirm significant optical depth in the observed Class 0/I disks, at both 1.3 and 3 mm, helping to explain their higher luminosities, but higher temperatures are also required for the most compact (< 40 au) disks, suggesting additional viscous heating. Considering optical depth, most disk dust masses are estimated in the range 30-900 Mearth (0.01-0.3 Msun in gas), resulting in some disks reaching marginal gravitational instability. The median location of the water iceline is ~3 au, but it can extend beyond 10-20 au for the hottest disks. CBDs exhibit lower optical depths at both wavelengths and hence higher SI values (alpha=3.0), dust masses of 100 Mearth, and beta~1.5 (2 Class 0 CBDs) and beta~1 (1 Class I CBD), suggesting substantial grain growth only in the more evolved CBD. The inferred high optical depths provide a compelling explanation for the apparent scarcity of dust substructures in the younger disks at ~ 1 mm, despite mounting evidence for early planet formation (ABRIDGED).

- **Abstract**
 This perspective offers a viewpoint on how the challenges of molecular scattering investigations of astrophysical interest have evolved in recent years. Computational progress has steadily expanded collisional databases and provided essential tools for modeling non-LTE astronomical regions. However, the observational leap enabled by the JWST and new observational facilities has revealed critical gaps in these databases. In this framework, two major frontiers emerge: the characterization of collisional processes involving heavy projectiles, and the treatment of ro-vibrational excitation. The significant computational effort of these investigations emphasizes the need to test and develop robust theoretical methods and approximations, capable of extending the census of collisional coefficients required for reliable astrophysical modeling. Recent developments in these directions are outlined, with particular attention to their application and their potential to broaden the coverage of molecular systems and physical environments.

- **Abstract**
 The pre-main-sequence evolution of the chemically peculiar (CP) stars on the upper main sequence is still a vast mystery and not well understood. Our analysis of young associations and open clusters aims to find (very) young CP stars to try to put a lower boundary on the age of such objects. Using three catalogues of open clusters and associations, we determined membership probabilities using HDBSCAN. The hot stars from this selection were submitted to synthetic $\Delta a$ photometry, spectral, and light curve classification to determine which ones are CP stars and candidates. Subsequently, we used spectral energy distribution fitting and emission line analysis to check for possible PMS CP stars. The results were compared to the literature. We detected 971 CP stars and candidates {in 217 clusters and associations}. A relatively large fraction, $\sim$10\% of those, show characteristics of PMS CP stars. This significantly expands the known list of candidate PMS CP stars, bringing us closer to solving the mystery of their origin.

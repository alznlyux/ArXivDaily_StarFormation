- **Abstract**
 We investigated an isolated, globule-shaped object (0.37x0.11 pc), located near the centre of the Cygnus OB2 cluster and named proplyd #7 in optical observations. The source can be a massive star (with or without disc) with a HII region or a G-type T Tauri star with a photo-evaporating disc, embedded in a molecular envelope. We obtained a map of the OI line at 63 micron with 6" angular resolution and employed archival data of the CII 158 micron line (14" resolution), using the upGREAT heterodyne receiver aboard SOFIA. We also collected IRAM 30m CO data at 1mm (11" resolution). All the lines were detected across the whole object. The peak integrated OI emission of ~5 K km/s is located ~10" west of an embedded YSO. The OI and CII data near the source show bulk emission at ~11 km/s and a line wing at ~13 km/s, while the 12CO 2-1 data reveal additional blue-shifted high-velocity emission. The KOSMA-tau PDR model can explain the emissions in the tail with a low external UV field (<350 Go, mostly consistent with our UV field estimates), but not at the location of the YSO. There, the high line intensities and increased line widths for all lines and a possible bipolar CO outflow suggest the presence of a protostellar disc. However, the existence of a thermal HII region, revealed by combining existing and new radio continuum data, points towards a massive star - and not a T Tauri-type one. We derived molecular and atomic gas masses of ~20 Msun and a few Msun, respectively. The photo-evaporation (only considering external illumination) lifetime of 1.6x10^5 yrs is shorter than the free-fall lifetime of 5.2x10^5 yrs; thus, we find that proplyd #7 might not have had the time to produce many more stars.

          Effects of Resolution and Local Stability on Galactic Disks: I. Multiple Spiral Mode Formation via Swing Amplification

- **Abstract**
 We investigate the formation of multiple spiral modes in Milky Way-like disk-halo systems without explicitly exciting perturbations. We explore how numerical resolution, the level of local disk stability, and the presence of a live halo influence both the initial appearance and the subsequent evolution of these modes. To characterize spiral structure, we compute Fourier amplitudes for modes $m=1$-$6$. In marginally unstable, lower-resolution disks ($N_\star=5\times10^6$, $N_{\rm DM}=1.14\times10^7$), faint features appear within the first $0.5$ Gyr due to numerical noise, in contrast to high-resolution models where perturbations emerge later. Across all sufficiently resolved, live-halo models with $m_{\rm DM}/m_\star \le 10$, the spirals exhibit a cascading sequence in both mode number and radius: higher-$m$ modes form and decay first, followed by the delayed emergence of lower-$m$ modes, with an inward drift of the activity's epicenter. This behavior reflects a combination of local swing amplification, which explains the initial growth of short-wavelength modes, and interference between coexisting long-lived spiral modes, which accounts for the recurrent short-timescale amplitude modulations. In contrast, models with a fixed halo potential or coarse halo resolution ($N_{\rm DM}=1.14\times10^6$ and $m_{\rm DM}/m_\star=100$) show strong early spirals but lack this coherent cascading behavior, owing to excessive shot noise and insufficient halo responsiveness. The $m=3$ mode plays a transitional role, marking the onset of angular-momentum transport in the inner disk that precedes bar formation, a process absent in fixed-potential models. Our results show that a live halo with appropriate mass resolution provides the gravitational response needed to sustain and regenerate multi-mode spiral structure, even though the total angular-momentum exchange remains small.

          APEX survey of interstellar HCl: $^{35}$Cl/$^{37}$Cl isotopic ratios in dense cores and outflows

- **Abstract**
 Despite being only the 19th most abundant element in the interstellar medium, chlorine's reactivity and volatility give rise to a unique interstellar chemistry, favouring the formation of several chlorine-bearing hydrides. Further, the $^{35}\text{Cl}/ ^{37}$Cl ratio probes nucleosynthesis across the Galaxy. Yet, studies of Cl-bearing molecules have remained limited to a few sightlines due to observational challenges. We systematically investigated the Galactic distribution of HCl and the [H$^{35}$Cl]/[H$^{37}$Cl] ratio in high-mass star-forming regions. As a probe of a region's nucleosynthesis history, this ratio may constrain predictions of Galactic chemical evolution models. We observed the ground-state $J=1$$-$0 lines of H$^{35}$Cl and H$^{37}$Cl toward 28 high-mass star-forming regions with SEPIA660 on APEX, more than doubling the number of known HCl detections and revealing with XCLASS models emission from both cores and outflows. H$^{35}$Cl was detected in all sources, H$^{37}$Cl in all but two, with spectral line profiles ranging from those with only emission to complex emission-absorption mixtures. We find column densities of the order of $10^{13}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$ for H$^{35}$Cl and isotopic ratios between $1.6$ and $3.5$ in emission-only sources. The derived [H$^{35}$Cl]/[H$^{37}$Cl] aligns with Galactic chemical evolution models and shows no trend with Galactocentric radius. However, local variations may reflect recent nucleosynthesis. Overall, the results suggest that most Galactic chlorine was synthesized during epochs of lower average metallicity in the Galaxy. Notably, we detect H$^{35}$Cl emission arising from outflows - particularly explosive ones - hinting at its presence in a broader range of environments. The present single-dish observations cannot reveal the origin of HCl in outflows; necessitating interferometric follow-up observations.

- **Abstract**
 Through detailed modeling of all three stars, we show that HIP-44302 is a false positive triple-star system. While the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite initially designated the object as a planetary candidate, observing a 10-day transit and secondary eclipse in Sectors 8 and 35, we definitively exclude this scenario, finding instead that the transit comes from eclipsing stellar companions with $P = 9.599214$ days and $a = 0.1415$ AU. This binary orbits a single star at a wide separation of $\rho = 0.2946''$, determined through high-resolution AO and speckle imaging and corresponding to a $\sim$297 AU, $\sim$1886-year orbit at a distance of 1010 pc. Using transit data and photometry, we use EXOFASTv2 to fit the transit light curve, spectral energy distribution, and MIST evolutionary models of the three stars. We find that the isolated star and the larger binary star are massive A stars, with the single star having evolved off the main sequence, while the smaller companion is a G star. We also found an unusually low rotational velocity of 2.3 km/s from the single A star, observed from MINERVA and TRES RVs, implying a pole-on orientation. The triple-star architecture derived from multiple data sources made this target a complex system that required new capabilities within EXOFASTv2 to properly model. Our successful modeling demonstrates a new paradigm for false positive identification and classification that incorporates imaging, photometry, transits, and global modeling to definitively rule out false positives that may otherwise pollute candidate catalogs without extensive follow-up observations.

- **Abstract**
 Spectroscopic parameters of methane from many different studies were gathered to improve the HITRAN database towards its 2024 version. After a validation process using high-resolution FTS and CRDS spectra, about 60,000 lines of the four most abundant isotopologues were replaced from the dyad to the triacontad regions. These changes amount to 56,000 transition wavenumbers, 16,000 line intensities, 30,000 pressure-broadening half-widths, and 3500 assignments. 40,000 new lines were added, extending the database from 12,000 cm$^{-1}$ up to 14,000 cm$^{-1}$, and covering some gaps. A greater focus was brought on the pentad, octad, and tetradecad regions, targeted by several remote instruments. In these regions, comparisons of spectral fits from multiple line lists were performed, taking only the parameters that provide best fit for each line. In the $\nu _3$ band, in addition to replacing the previous values, gathered speed-independent pressure broadenings of $^{12}$CH$_4$ were used to fit Pade-approximant functions. These functions then replaced any outdated experimental data in $\nu _3$, missing data in the new lines, as well as the values that were determined to be outside their physical boundaries. The CH$_3$D broadenings were replaced in the same manner, for missing and low or high values, using a semi-empirical formula instead.

- **Abstract**
 We present the results of mapping and single-point spectral scans toward Orion-KL/OMC-1 performed as science demonstrations of a 2 mm SIS receiver, the Band 4 Receiver (B4R), installed on the 50 m Large Millimeter Telescope (LMT). To prove the capabilities of mapping and spectral scans with the B4R on the LMT, commissioning observations were conducted employing the on-the-fly mapping technique toward Orion-KL/OMC-1, which covers a map size of 5$'\times$5$'$. These mapping observations were performed with two frequency settings providing 10 GHz in total (131.4-133.9 GHz and 145.1-147.6 GHz; 136.2-138.7 GHz and 149.9-152.4 GHz) with a frequency resolution of 76.293 kHz. We conducted spectral line identification analysis for the hot core and compact ridge regions in the Orion-KL with a beam size of 11-12$''$. We detected nearly 400 emission lines and identified two recombination lines and 29 molecular species, including isotopologues, deuterated molecules, and vibrational excited states, despite the short integration time. These results are consistent with those of previous studies. The 29 molecular species include nitrogen (N)-bearing complex organic molecules (COMs) and oxygen (O)-bearing COMs. To demonstrate the capability of the B4R in astrochemistry, we conducted detailed analyses of column densities, rotational temperatures, and relative abundances with respect to H$_2$ on two representative COMs, N-bearing C$_2$H$_5$CN and O-bearing CH$_3$OCHO in the central 40$''\times$40$''$ area of the map. The wide bandwidth of 10 GHz enabled the use of 8 and 34 emission lines, respectively. The spatial differences in the physical and chemical properties between these molecules were derived at a spatial resolution of $\sim$12$''$. The B4R on the LMT was successfully demonstrated to be powerful for mapping and spectral scans and to have high potential for the study of interstellar chemistry.

- **Abstract**
 The WISE and NEOWISE missions have provided the only mid-infrared all-sky time-domain data, opening a unique observational window for variability studies. Yet, a comprehensive and systematic catalog of mid-infrared variable sources has remained unavailable. In this work, we construct the first large-scale mid-infrared variability catalog based on the unTimely coadded photometry, covering tens of millions of sources. By employing a Bayesian Gaussian mixture model with a Dirichlet process, we identified 8,256,042 variable sources in the W1 band and 7,147,661 in the W2 band, significantly expanding the landscape of known mid-infrared variables. In addition to robust variability metrics, our analysis highlights rare and extreme outliers through dedicated outlier-detection algorithms, enabling the discovery of unusual classes of objects such as eruptive young stellar objects, highly variable active galactic nuclei, and other rare transients. This unprecedented dataset provides a new foundation for time-domain astronomy in the mid-infrared, offering complementary insights to optical and near-infrared surveys, and opening the door to systematic investigations of stellar evolution, accretion processes, and dust-enshrouded astrophysical environments on a Galactic and extragalactic scale.

- **Abstract**
 In this paper, we construct a detailed circular velocity curve of the Milky Way out to 20 kpc based on the radial component of the Jeans equation in cylindrical coordinates, assuming an axisymmetric gravitational potential, and show its dependence on azimuth. We use only Gaia DR3 data and aim to minimize the use of model data and various assumptions. To build the rotation curves, we used a sample of 4,547,980 RGB stars with measured spatial velocities, covering the Galactic plane in the range of Galactocentric cylindrical coordinates $150^\circ < \theta < 210^\circ$ and 0 < R < 20 kpc. We exclude systematics in the data that may arise from neglecting higher-order moments of the velocity distribution and their dispersions, as well as due to random measurement errors in Gaia. At the distance of the Sun, the circular velocity $V_{\rm c}(R_0)$ turned out to be ($229.63\pm0.30$) km s$^{-1}$, which is in good agreement with many previous estimates. The average slope of the circular velocity is $(-2.29\pm0.05)$ km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$ obtained in the range of $R$ from 6 to 20 kpc and $\theta$ from 150 to 210 degrees. The determined circular velocity curve has some peculiarities in behavior near $R\sim$13 and 18 kpc, but in general it does not contradict the results of other authors up to distances where our statistics are reliable.

- **Abstract**
 A 50-mm balloon-borne white-light coronagraph (BBWLC) to observe whitelight solar corona over the altitude range from 1.08 to 1.50 solar radii has recently been indigenously developed by Yunnan Observatories in collaboration with Shangdong University (in Weihai) and Changchun Institute of Optics, Fine Mechanics and Physics, which will significantly improve the ability of China to detect and measure inner corona. On 2022 October 4, its first scientific flight took place at the Dachaidan area in Qinghai province of China. We describe briefly the BBWLC mission including its optical design, mechanical structure, pointing system, the first flight and results associated with the data processing approach. Preliminary analysis of the data shows that BBWLC imaged the Kcorona with three streamer structures on the west limb of the Sun. To further confirm the coronal signals obtained by BBWLC, comparisonswere made with observations of the Kcoronagraph of the High Altitude Observatory and the Atmospheric ImagingAssembly on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory. We conclude that BBWLC eventually observed the white-light corona in its first scientific flight.

- **Abstract**
 We introduce \textsc{Odisseo} (Optimized Differentiable Integrator for Stellar Systems Evolution of Orbits), a differentiable N-body code designed to constrain the gravitational potential of the Milky Way (MW) through dynamical modeling of accreted structures such as stellar streams. \textsc{Odisseo} is implemented in JAX, enabling just-in-time compilation, automatic differentiation, and hardware acceleration on GPUs and TPUs. The code features efficient, fully vectorized force calculations and exhibits near-linear scaling when distributing a single simulation across multiple GPUs, making it suitable for large scale optimization tasks. As a demonstration, we present a case study using a mock GD-1 stellar stream simulation, where we optimize four physical parameters via gradient descent: the accretion time and progenitor mass, as well as the masses of the host Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) halo and Miyamoto-Nagai (MN) disk. \textsc{Odisseo} accurately recovers stream morphology and underlying parameters in a differentiable and scalable framework, providing a powerful tool for dynamical studies of the Milky Way and its accreted substructures.

- **Abstract**
 Classical Cepheids (CCs) have long been considered excellent tracers of the chemical evolution of the Milky Way's young disk. We present a homogeneous, NLTE spectroscopic analysis of 401 Galactic CCs, based on 1,351 high-resolution optical spectra, spanning Galactocentric distances from 4.6 to 29.3 kpc. Using PySME with MARCS atmospheres and state-of-the-art grids of NLTE departure coefficients, we derive atmospheric parameters and abundances for key species tracing multiple nucleosynthetic channels. Our sample-the largest CC NLTE dataset to date-achieves high internal precision and enables robust modeling of present-day thin-disk abundance patterns and radial gradients. We estimate abundance gradients using three analytic prescriptions (linear, logarithmic, bilinear with a break) within a Bayesian, outlier-robust framework, and we also apply Gaussian Process Regression to capture non-parametric variations. We find that NLTE atmospheric parameters differ systematically from LTE determinations. Moreover, iron and most elemental abundance profiles are better described by non-linear behavior rather than by single-slope linear models: logarithmic fits generally outperform simple linear models, while bilinear fits yield inconsistent break radii across elements. Gaussian Process models reveal a consistent outer-disk flattening of [X/H] for nearly all studied elements. The [X/Fe] ratios are largely flat with Galactocentric radius, indicating coherent chemical scaling with iron across the thin disk, with modest positive offsets for Na and Al and mild declines for Mn and Cu. Comparison with recent literature shows overall agreement but highlights NLTE-driven differences, especially in outer-disk abundances. These results provide tighter empirical constraints for chemo-dynamical models of the Milky Way and set the stage for future NLTE mapping with upcoming large spectroscopic surveys.

- **Abstract**
 High-resolution, near-infrared observations have revealed prominent, two-armed spirals in a multitude of systems, such as MWC~758, SAO~206462, and V1247~Ori. Alongside the classical theory of disk-companion interaction, shadow-based driving has come into vogue as a potential explanation for such large-scale substructures. How might these two mechanisms be distinguished from one another in observations? To investigate this question, we ran a pair of hydrodynamical simulations with \texttt{PLUTO}. One, with full radiation hydrodynamics and gas-grain collision, was designed to develop shadow-driven spirals at the outer gap edge of a sub-thermal, Saturn-mass planet. The other, with parametrized $\beta$-cooling, was set up to capture the more standard view of spiral wave excitation by a super-thermal, multi-Jupiter-mass, exterior planetary companion. Post-processing of these simulations with the Monte Carlo radiative transfer (MCRT) code \texttt{RADMC3D} revealed that strong vertical velocities in the shadow-driven case create a prominent two-armed feature in the moment-1 CO maps, particularly when the disk is viewed face-on in optically thicker isotopologues; such a feature is not seen in the standard planet-driven case. Conversely, the presence or absence of such signatures in two-armed spiral systems would distinguish those potentially driven by exterior, multi-Jupiter-mass companions, and thus help identify promising targets for future direct-imaging campaigns.

- **Abstract**
 Sulfur-bearing molecules are central to interstellar chemistry, yet their observed abundances in the gas phase remain far below cosmic expectations in dense interstellar regions. Mixed N-S-O species such as thionylimide (HNSO) are particularly relevant, as they incorporate three key biogenic elements. The $cis$ conformer of HNSO has recently been detected in the Galactic Center cloud G+0.693-0.027, but no high-resolution data for the higher energy conformer ($trans$-HNSO) had been available until now. We report the first laboratory detection and rotational spectroscopic characterization of $trans$-HNSO. Spectra were recorded with the Center for Astrochemical Studies Absorption Cell (CASAC) free-space spectrometer employing a hollow-cathode discharge source, yielding 104 assigned transitions between 200 and 530 GHz. A Watson S-reduced Hamiltonian fit reproduced the data with an rms of 40 kHz, providing accurate rotational and centrifugal distortion constants in excellent agreement with CCSD(T) predictions. Although $trans$-HNSO lies only a few kcal/mol above the $cis$ form, it has larger dipole components, making its lines particularly intense (more than 5 times brighter, assuming equal abundances) and a very promising candidate for future astronomical detection. The new measurements enable reliable frequency predictions for astronomical searches and will be added to public databases. Combined with recent evidence for tunneling-driven $trans$-to-$cis$ isomerization at cryogenic temperatures, these results open the way to test directly whether quantum tunneling governs the interstellar distribution of HNSO isomers.

- **Abstract**
 Context: The streaming instability (SI) is a leading candidate for reaching solid densities sufficient to trigger the gravitational collapse needed for the formation of planetesimals. However, dust growth barriers appear to impede the ability to assemble sufficiently large dust particles to trigger strong clumping, providing a serious impediment to planetesimal formation. Aims: We aim to address the possibility to enhance dust clumping with dust growth in SI-produced structures, and to estimate the impact of the shift of the dust fragmentation threshold in regions where the SI has enhanced the dust density. Methods: We perform two-dimensional numerical simulations of the SI with a monodisperse description of dust growth, accounting for the impact of mass loading of the dust on the sound speed of the gas and dust mixture when computing dust collisional velocities. Results: Dust mass loading reduces collision velocities in high density regions, allowing dust particles to survive to larger sizes before shattering. In turn, dust clumping is boosted as particles grow in size, as long as they remain sufficiently coupled to the gas. Conclusions: This two-way synergy between dust growth and clumping, which depends on the initial dust-to-gas ratio and dust elastic properties, allows denser dust clumps to form and thus facilitates the onset of planetesimal formation.

- **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive photometric light curve and orbital period analysis of the W UMa-type contact binary EM Tuc. The O-C analysis constructed from all available eclipse timings exhibits a clear upward parabolic trend, indicating a continuous increase in the orbital period at a rate of \(dP/dt = (1.401 \pm 0.042)\times10^{-7}\,\mathrm{d\,yr^{-1}}\). This behavior is consistent with mass transfer from the less massive to the more massive star in the system, and the corresponding mass-transfer rate is estimated to be \(\dot{M} = -(4.62 \pm 1.54)\times10^{-8}\,M_\odot\,\mathrm{yr^{-1}}\). Light curve modeling with the PHysics Of Eclipsing BinariEs (PHOEBE) Python code, refined through MCMC sampling, confirms an overcontact configuration and yields a mass ratio of q=3.987. A cool photospheric starspot on the cooler component is required to reproduce the observed O'Connell asymmetry. Using Gaia DR3 parallax together with the photometric solution, the absolute masses of the components are derived as \(M_h = 0.24 \pm 0.05\,M_\odot\) and \(M_c = 0.97 \pm 0.19\,M_\odot\).

- **Abstract**
 We present spectroscopic and photometric observations of supernova (SN) 2021ukt, a peculiar short-plateau object that was originally identified as a Type IIn SN and later underwent an unprecedented transition to a Type Ib (possibly Type IIb) SN. The early-time light curves of SN 2021ukt exhibit a ~25 day plateau. Such a short phase of hydrogen recombination suggests a rather thin H-rich outer envelope of the progenitor star. The relatively narrow Balmer emission lines in spectra of SN 2021ukt during the first week indicate the interaction between the expanding ejecta and the immediate circumstellar material (CSM). This H{\alpha} line is observed throughout its helium-rich ejecta-dominated phase and nebular phase, suggesting persistent interaction with a radially extended CSM profile. We explore the synthetic light-curve model among grids of parameters generated by MESA+STELLA. We also compare the spectrophotometric evolution of SN 2021ukt with several well-sampled supernovae that exhibit a short plateau and persistent ejecta-CSM interaction. An estimate of the progenitor mass of SN 2021ukt is made based on the flux ratio between [Ca II] {\lambda}{\lambda} 7291, 7324 and [O I] {\lambda}{\lambda} 6300, 6364 during its nebular phase. Our analysis suggests that the progenitor star of SN 2021ukt has a zero-age main-sequence (ZAMS) mass of about 12 solar masses, a mass of radioactive nickel-56 synthesized in the SN ejecta of about 0.04 solar masses, and a mass of the H-rich envelope of about 0.5 solar masses. This study adds to the growing sample of transitional supernovae, reinforcing evidence for a continuum of underrepresented progenitors whose evolutionary pathways lie between those of standard SN models.

- **Abstract**
 We present a detailed analysis of Terz V 2513 (=2MASS J17334728-2719266), a poorly studied symbiotic star. Our motivation was a peculiar beating pattern in its light curves from all-sky surveys and our own observations. Using \textit{Gaia} DR3 and OGLE-IV photometry, we show that this variability arises from blending with a nearby, unrelated Mira variable (\textit{Gaia} DR3 406134544052580377 = OGLE-BLG-LPV-241930). Analysis of VPHAS+ and Pan-STARRS imaging, combined with optical and infrared spectroscopy from the Southern African Large Telescope and ESO New Technology Telescope, further reveals that the symbiotic star has been misidentified in the literature. We identify the correct counterpart as \textit{Gaia} DR3 4061345440488592896 (=OGLE-BLG-LPV-241932), a Mira with a 161-day period. Its infrared spectrum displays prominent emission lines and is remarkably similar to those of other symbiotic Miras. Based on our data and previous studies, Terz V 2513 likely experienced a symbiotic nova outburst in the past. This study highlights the importance of careful analysis of survey light curves in crowded fields and demonstrates how combining multi-wavelength photometry, spectroscopy, and high-precision \textit{Gaia} data can disentangle blended sources and accurately determine their nature.

- **Abstract**
 We present atmospheric retrievals of the benchmark brown dwarf binary Luhman 16AB using high-resolution VLT/CRIRES spectra and the differentiable framework ExoJAX. We derive elemental abundances and temperature-pressure ($T$-$P$) profiles while explicitly testing the robustness of the results against major sources of systematic uncertainty. We first perform retrievals with a power-law $T$-$P$ profile and assess the sensitivity of inferred molecular abundances and C/O ratios to different CO line lists (ExoMol, HITEMP with air- and H2-broadening). We then introduce a flexible Gaussian process-based $T$-$P$ profile, allowing a non-parametric characterization of the thermal structure and a more conservative treatment of uncertainties. For both components, we infer C/O ratios of about 0.67, slightly above solar, with line list systematics at the 7 percent level emerging as the dominant source of uncertainty, whereas assumptions about $T$-$P$ parameterization or photometric variability play a lesser role. The retrieved $T$-$P$ profiles and molecular abundances are broadly consistent with atmospheric models and equilibrium chemistry. Our results establish Luhman 16AB as a key anchor for substellar C/O measurements, demonstrate the utility of flexible $T$-$P$ modeling in high-resolution retrievals, and highlight the importance of systematic tests -- particularly line list uncertainties -- for robust comparisons between brown dwarfs and giant exoplanets.

- **Abstract**
 Context. Stellar flares can significantly influence the atmospheres and habitability of orbiting exoplanets, especially around young and active M dwarfs. Understanding the temporally and spectrally resolved activity of such stars is essential for assessing their impact on planetary environments. Aims. We aim to examine in detail state-of-the-art concepts of flare models to identify what is missing in our understanding of energy deposition during the flare event. By comparing synthetic and observed flare spectra, we seek to determine the modelling frameworks best suited to represent flare energetics and spectral far-ultraviolet features while providing a foundation for investigating flare impacts on exoplanet atmospheres. Methods. In this work, we built the Young M Dwarfs Flare (YMDF) model utilising the combination of radiative-hydrodynamic (RHD) stellar atmosphere models with a high and low-energy electron beam and corresponding synthetic observables. These models are based on physical principles and were validated with solar and stellar observations. Results. The newly developed YMDF model reproduces the observed continuum rise in both the TESS photometric band and the FUV-A spectral range. Furthermore, the flare distributions generated within this framework show consistency with those observed in our sample of stars. Conclusions. We have developed the YMDF model as a tool to reproduce the time-dependent spectra of flaring young M dwarfs, providing a physically motivated description of their spectral and temporal evolution during flare events.

- **Abstract**
 To date, the Galactic interstellar radial $^{32}$S/$^{34}$S gradient has only been studied with the CS isotopologs, which may be affected by uncertainties due to the use of a single tracer. As another abundant S-bearing molecules, SO and its isotopomer $^{34}$SO could be considered as tracers of the $^{32}$S/$^{34}$S ratio. We present the first systematic observations of SO and $^{34}$SO toward a large sample of molecular clouds with accurate distances, performed with the IRAM 30 m and the 10 m Submillimeter Telescope (SMT). With the IRAM 30 m, SO $2_2-1_1$ was detected in 59 of 82 sources ($\sim$82%), and $^{34}$SO $2_2-1_1$ in 8 sources ($\sim$10%). With the SMT 10 m, SO $5_5-4_4$ was detected in 136 of 184 sources ($\sim$74%), and $^{34}$SO $5_5-4_4$ in 55 of 77 strong SO sources ($\sim$72%). SO/$^{34}$SO ratios were derived for 8 ($2_2-1_1$) and 55 ($5_5-4_4$) sources. No correlation was found between the SO/$^{34}$SO ratio and heliocentric distance or $T_k$, suggesting negligible distance and fractionation effects. Both LTE and non-LTE analyses consistently suggest that the optical depth effect is also insignificant. $^{32}$S/$^{34}$S ratios from the $2_2-1_1$ transitions follow the increasing radial trend proposed by previous CS species measurements, while those from the $5_5-4_4$ lines are systematically lower. The lower transitions of SO and $^{34}$SO may be suitable tracers of $^{32}$S/$^{34}$S, though the detections are rare. Comparisons between measurements and Galactic chemical evolution model suggest that the nucleosynthesis prescriptions need to be revised in the low-metallicity regime, but more data for the outermost Galactic regions are crucial for drawing strong conclusions.

- **Abstract**
 Blue straggler stars (BSSs) are exotic objects which, being the results of processes such as mass transfer, mergers or collisions, are considered key-objects to study the dynamics of their host clusters. While many studies on astrometric, spectroscopic, and photometric properties of BSSs in clusters have been conducted, there are few works in the literature regarding their pulsations and internal structure, which indeed can retain traces of their origin. In this work we computed and analysed a grid of collisional BSSs at low metallicity ($Z = 0.01\; Z_\odot$), finding that collision products present a peculiar chemical stratification that leads to periodicities in the period spacing pattern of high-order gravity modes. These seismic fingerprints provide a unique opportunity to constrain the formation pathways of BSSs in globular clusters.

- **Abstract**
 Core collapse supernovae (CCSNe) impact many areas of astrophysics, including compact object formation and gravitational waves, but many uncertainties remain in our understanding of the evolution of their progenitors. We use the binary population synthesis code COSMIC to simulate populations of CCSNe across a wide range of metallicities and binary evolution assumptions. Our models vary the prescriptions for mass transfer stability, common envelope ejection efficiency, natal kick strength, and remnant mass-limited explodability to assess their impact on the resulting population of CCSNe. We find that reproducing the observed Type I to Type II rate requires either low common envelope efficiency or modified prescriptions for common envelope survival, highlighting the importance of stellar mergers in shaping the CCSN population. We further classify our synthetic CCSNe into subtypes and present their relative abundances using several different sets of classification criteria, highlighting the large uncertainties that persist in mapping progenitor properties to spectral classes. Finally, we present delay time distributions (DTDs) for our overall populations, separated into Type I and II, and into the full set of observed subtypes. Our DTDs show that models reproducing the observed Type I to Type II rate produce a larger fraction of late CCSNe than is expected under standard assumptions.

 Molecules harbouring sulfur are thought to have played a key role in the biological processes of life on Earth. We report the first astronomical detection of a six-membered sulfur-bearing cyclic hydrocarbon in interstellar space. Observations of the Galactic center molecular cloud G+0.693-0.027 reveal the presence of 2,5-cyclohexadien-1-thione - a structural isomer of thiophenol ($c$-C$_6$H$_6$S). To allow the astronomical identification, we first performed precise laboratory measurements of the thiophenol discharge products system. These measurements, conducted in the radio band using a chirped-pulse Fourier transform microwave spectrometer, enabled us to characterize this highly polar molecular species and provided unambiguous fingerprints needed to identify this organosulfur compound in space, which now ranks as the largest interstellar sulfur-bearing molecule. These results herald the discovery of a new family of prebiotically relevant sulfur-bearing species, potentially acting as a bridge between the chemical inventory of the interstellar medium and the composition of the minor bodies of the Solar System.

- **Abstract**
 Photospheric and high-velocity features (PVFs and HVFs) of Si II $\lambda$6355 and Ca II IR3 lines in supernova Ia (SN Ia) spectra provide insights into ejecta structure, energetics, and circumstellar interaction, yet their interplay remains poorly understood. We analyse a representative sample of 145 nearby SNe Ia observed within $\pm$5 days of B-band maximum light, including normal, 91T-, and 91bg-like events with measured light-curve decline rates ($\Delta m_{15}$) and Si II and Ca II line properties from the literature. We model PVF and HVF velocity distributions using Gaussian Mixture Models, compare Si II and Ca II PVF velocity distributions, assess Ca II HVF properties, and test correlations between Si II PVF velocities and $\Delta m_{15}$, with emphasis on HVF effects. For the first time, we show that the Ca II PVF velocity distribution, measured for the same events at the same phases as Si II, is predominantly unimodal, in contrast to the well-known bimodal Si II PVF distribution that supports the high-velocity/normal-velocity division. This contrast likely reflects a subclass-dependent formation depth of the Ca II line, as supported by a positive correlation ($>3.3\sigma$) between $\Delta m_{15}$ and the velocity offset between Ca II and Si II PVFs, particularly in faster-declining SNe Ia. Importantly, HVFs do not significantly bias PVF velocity distributions. A significant negative correlation ($>3.3\sigma$) between Si II PVF velocity and $\Delta m_{15}$ is found only for HVF-weak SNe Ia, consistent with more energetic explosions yielding faster ejecta, while this trend vanishes in HVF-strong events, likely due to circumstellar interaction. These results underscore the critical role of HVFs and SN Ia subclass in interpreting ejecta kinematics in both models and observations.

- **Abstract**
 Context: The VISTA Variables in the Via Lactea (VVV) and its extension (VVVX) are near-infrared surveys mapping the Galactic bulge and adjacent disk. These data have enabled the discovery of numerous star clusters obscured by high and spatially variable extinction. Most previous searches relied on visual inspection of individual tiles, which is inefficient and biased against faint or low-density systems. Aims: We aim to develop an automated, homogeneous algorithm for systematic cluster detection across different surveys. Here, we apply our method to VVVX data covering low-latitude regions of the Galactic bulge and disk, affected by extinction and crowding. Methods: We introduce the Consensus-based Algorithm for Nonparametric Detection of Star Clusters (CANDiSC), which integrates kernel density estimation, the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN), and nearest-neighbour density estimation within a consensus framework. A stellar overdensity is classified as a candidate if identified by at least two of these methods. We apply CANDiSC to 680 tiles in the VVVX PSF photometric catalogue, covering approximately 1100 square degrees. Results: We detect 163 stellar overdensities, of which 118 are known clusters. Cross-matching with recent catalogues yields five additional matches, leaving 40 likely new candidates absent from existing compilations. The estimated false-positive rate is below 5 percent. Conclusions: CANDiSC offers a robust and scalable approach for detecting stellar clusters in deep near-infrared surveys, successfully recovering known systems and revealing new candidates in the obscured and crowded regions of the Galactic plane.

- **Abstract**
 A question that continues to perplex astronomers is the formation of tight stellar binaries. There is too much angular momentum in a collapsing and fragmenting protostellar cloud to form a stellar binary in situ with a separation less than an AU, yet thousands of these short-period binaries have been discovered. One indication of a binary's formation is the angle between the stellar spin and orbital axes -- its obliquity. The classical method for determining projtected stellar obliquity is the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect. This method has been applied to over 100 hot Jupiters, yet only a handful of stellar binaries. Of the binary systems with measured projected obliquities, even fewer have measured 3D obliquities. In this paper, we add five more short-period binary 3D obliquity measurements to the sample that previously consisted of a single system. We present Rossiter-McLaughlin measurements for EBLM J0239-20, EBLM J0941-31, EBLM 1037-25, EBLM 1141-37, and EBLM J2025-45. These systems consist of an M-dwarf eclipsing an F/G type primary. We combined CORALIE and HARPS spectroscopy with TESS photometry of primary and secondary eclipses. We show that even though the sky-projected obliquities seem to be aligned, there is modest but non-zero spin-orbit misalignment ($\psi$ between 5 and 20$^{\circ}$). Our primary stars straddle the Kraft break at $\sim 6250K$. Finally, we derive the M-dwarf masses and radii to precisions better than 3\%. With the exception of EBLM J0941-31, each system has an inflated radius greater than $5\sigma$ from the expected radius from stellar models.

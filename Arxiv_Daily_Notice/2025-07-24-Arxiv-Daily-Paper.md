 - **Abstract**
 Enabled by planarized phase engineering, metalenses based on metasurfaces offer compact and scalable solutions for applications such as sensing, imaging, and virtual reality. They are particularly attractive for multi-pixel, large-scale heterodyne focal plane arrays in space observatories, where a flat metalens array on a silicon wafer can replace individual lenses, greatly simplifying system integration and beam alignment. In this work, we demonstrate, for the first time, a superconducting niobium nitride (NbN) hot electron bolometer (HEB) mixer coupled with a silicon-based metalens operating at terahertz frequencies. The metalens phase profile was derived from a finite-size Gaussian beam source using the Rayleigh-Sommerfeld diffraction integral, and its focusing behavior was validated through 2D simulation. Experimentally, the metalens-coupled NbN HEB receiver exhibited a noise temperature of 1800 K at 1.63 THz. The power coupling efficiency from free space to the mixer via the metalens was measured to be 25 %. Measured far-field beam profiles are Gaussian-like with sidelobes below -14 dB. These results demonstrate the feasibility of integrating metalenses with HEB mixers for THz detection, offering a scalable path for compact focal plane arrays in space-based THz instrumentation.

          The Effects of Linear Matter Power Spectrum Enhancement on Dark Matter Substructure

 - **Abstract**
 We present cosmological dark matter (DM)--only zoom-in simulations of a Milky Way (MW) analog originating from enhanced linear matter power spectra $P(k)$ relative to the standard cold, collisionless DM (CDM) cosmology. We consider a Gaussian power excess in $P(k)$ followed by a cutoff in select cases; this behavior could arise from early-universe physics that alters the primordial matter power spectrum or DM physics in the radiation-dominated epoch. We find that enhanced initial conditions (ICs) lead to qualitative differences in substructure relative to CDM. In particular, the subhalo mass function (SHMF) resulting from ICs with both an enhancement and cutoff is amplified at high masses and suppressed at low masses, indicating that DM substructure is sensitive to features in $P(k)$. Critically, the amplitude and shape of the SHMF enhancement depend on the wave number of the $P(k)$ excess and the presence or absence of a cutoff on smaller scales. These alterations to the SHMF are mainly imprinted at infall rather than during tidal evolution. Additionally, subhalos are found systematically closer to the host center and their concentrations are increased in scenarios with $P(k)$ enhancement. Thus, nonlinear mode coupling must be captured to enable $P(k)$ reconstruction using DM substructure.

          Super-Eddington accretion onto black holes and its application to fallback accretion

 - **Abstract**
 We study the problem of steady-state spherical accretion onto a black hole, in which the internal energy of the flow is governed by radiation and photon diffusion dominates the energy flux at large radii. In the free-fall limit, the fluid equations can admit two types of solutions for a given accretion rate: (1) accretion flows that become isothermal at large radii and (2) solutions in which the temperature at infinity vanishes as a power law of the radius. Using boundary layer theory, we obtain analytic solutions for the two cases and apply our results to fallback accretion onto a black hole following a failed supernova explosion. We give predictions for the observational signature of fallback accretion using realistic progenitor properties from MESA, both for a fully ionized inflow and for the more realistic case in which recombination/ionization take place due to low photospheric temperatures. The observed fading sources coincident with the failed-supernova candidates in NGC 6946 and M31 are too luminous to be powered by spherical accretion onto newly formed black holes; the observed sources are instead likely due to accretion of the turbulent, convective envelope of the supergiant progenitor.

 - **Abstract**
 The X-SHYNE library is a homogeneous sample of 43 medium-resolution (R=8000) infrared (0.3-2.5um) spectra of young (<500Myr), low-mass (<20Mjup), and cold (Teff=600-2000K) isolated brown dwarfs and wide-separation companions observed with the VLT/X-Shooter instrument. To characterize our targets, we performed a global comparative analysis. We first applied a semi-empirical approach. By refining their age and bolometric luminosity, we derived key atmospheric and physical properties, such as Teff, mass, surface gravity (g), and radius, using the evolutionary model COND03. These results were then compared with the results from a synthetic analysis based on three self-consistent atmospheric models. To compare our spectra with these grids we used the Bayesian inference code ForMoSA. We found similar Lbol estimates between both approaches, but an underestimated Teff from the cloudy models, likely due to a lack of absorbers that could dominate the J and H bands of early L. We also observed a discrepancy in the log(g) estimates, which are dispersed between 3.5 and 5.5 dex for mid-L objects. We interpreted this as a bias caused by a range of rotational velocities leading to cloud migration toward equatorial latitudes, combined with a variety of viewing angles that result in different observed atmospheric properties (cloud column densities, atmospheric pressures, etc.). Finally, while providing robust estimates of [M/H] and C/O for individual objects remains challenging, the X-SHYNE library globally suggests solar values, which are consistent with a formation via stellar formation mechanisms. This study highlights the strength of homogeneous datasets in performing comparative analyses, reducing the impact of systematics, and ensuring robust conclusions while avoiding over-interpretation.

          Strong scale-dependence does not enhance the kinematic boosting of gravitational wave backgrounds

 - **Abstract**
 Existing expressions in the literature appear to indicate that Doppler boosting, due to our proper motion with respect to the isotropic frame of the universe, can amplify stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds whose energy spectra exhibit strong scale dependence, for example, those generated by large scalar perturbations in models of primordial black holes or by astrophysical populations with broken power-law behaviour. It has been suggested that this enhancement could increase the signal-to-noise ratio of such backgrounds in pulsar timing measurements, as well as in ground- and space-based observatories. We show that the reported enhancement is an artefact of a Taylor expansion of the boosted signal, typically performed in the literature under the assumption of a small boosting parameter. This approximation fails to reproduce the correct result for signals with strong scale dependence. When Doppler boosting is treated exactly, the apparent amplification disappears. Using representative spectra, we demonstrate that Doppler motion induces only blue- and red-shifting by the expected amount; it does not lead to additional amplification or introduce new spectral features. The exact expression for the kinematic boost can and should be easily applied in analysing such backgrounds.

          A unified spin-harmonic framework for correlating pulsar timing, astrometric deflection, and shimmering gravitational wave observations

 - **Abstract**
 We present a unified spin-weighted harmonic framework that delivers analytic, diagonal expressions for the overlap (correlation) functions of three low frequency gravitational wave observables-pulsar timing redshifts, astrometric deflections, and time-dependent image distortions (``shimmering''). Writing each response in spin-$s$ spherical harmonics and rotating to a basis in which the wave tensor has definite helicity, we obtain compact closed-form series for every auto- and cross-correlation, recovering the Hellings-Downs curve as the $s=0$ limit and deriving its astrometric ($s=\pm 1$) and shimmering ($s=\pm 2$) analogues. The formalism naturally extends to non-standard scalar-breathing, longitudinal, and vector polarisation modes, clarifying when higher-spin observables are (and are not) sourced and providing a complete set of harmonic spectra $C_\ell$ ready for parameter estimation pipelines. These results supply the common theoretical language needed to combine upcoming pulsar timing, Gaia-class astrometric, and high resolution imaging data sets, enabling coherent, multi probe searches for stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds, tests of general relativity and its alternatives across the nano- to micro-hertz gravitational wave band.

          Premature Ignition: Why the Single-Degenerate Channel Leads to Type Iax and Not Type Ia Supernovae

 - **Abstract**
 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are pivotal for the origins of the elements, the understanding of galactic chemical evolution, and serve as crucial cosmological distance indicators, yet their progenitor systems remain a central enigma in astrophysics. While both the growth of white dwarfs to near-Chandrasekhar mass and their explosion (the single-degenerate; SD) and mergers of two WDs leading to explosions (double-degenerate; DD) scenarios have been proposed, neither explains the observed diversity of thermonuclear transients and their properties, including the fainter Type Iax supernovae (SNe Iax). Here we show, through comprehensive three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations, that as accreting WDs grow towards the Chandrasekhar mass (the SD channel), premature carbon ignition at sub-Chandrasekhar densities can trigger partial deflagrations that eject substantial mass in low-energy Iax outbursts. Such a process effectively serves as a self-limiting feedback loop, which stalls further mass growth. It naturally explains why the SD channel is precluded from producing standard, normal SNe Ia, and instead predominantly yields SNe Iax. Our findings significantly reframe the SD versus DD debate, with important implications for supernova rates, galactic chemical enrichment, and cosmological measurements.

 - **Abstract**
 A star destroyed by the tidal field of a supermassive black hole (SMBH) in a tidal disruption event (TDE) gives rise to a luminous flare. TDEs are being detected at an ever-increasing rate, motivating the need for accurate models of their lightcurves. The ``maximum gravity'' (MG) model posits that a star is completely destroyed when the tidal field of the SMBH exceeds the maximum self-gravitational field within the star, $g_{\rm max}$, and predicts the peak fallback rate $\dot{M}_{\rm peak}$ and the time to peak $t_{\rm peak}$. Here we perform hydrodynamical simulations of the complete disruption of 24 stars with masses ranging from $0.2-5.0 M_\odot$, at different stages of their main sequence evolution, to test the predictions of this model. We find excellent agreement between the MG model predictions and our simulations for stars near the zero-age main sequence, while the predictions are less accurate (but still within $\sim 35-50\%$ of the simulation results) for highly evolved stars. We also generalize the MG model to incorporate the Paczy{ń}ski-Wiita potential to assess the impact of strong-gravity effects -- which are especially important for deep encounters that are required to completely destroy evolved and centrally concentrated stars -- and find good agreement with recent works that include relativistic gravity. Our results demonstrate that this model provides accurate constraints on the peak timescale of TDE lightcurves and their correlation with black hole mass.

          Polarisation as a probe of neutrino emission from blazars

 - **Abstract**
 The source of extragalactic neutrinos in the TeV-PeV range is a matter of very active research, with blazar jets having been postulated to be the origin of at least some of the detections. The blazar PKS 0735+178 is a prominent example; during its multi-band flare in late 2021 a neutrino event was reported by four observatories, with its origin consistent with the direction of that source. While no new jet component was observed to be ejected during that narrow time-frame, our analysis shows that a propagating shock front originating from the core region was the likely source of the multi-band flare, using very-long-baseline interferometry images of PKS 0735+178 in polarised light. Taken together, our findings are suggestive of a coherent scenario in which the shock may contribute to the acceleration of protons, with the target photons potentially originating either from the ambient medium surrounding the jet or from proton synchrotron radiation. The necessary conditions for neutrino emission via proton-photon interactions are, hence, present in this jet.

          Tidal adaptive softening and artificial fragmentation in cosmological simulations

 - **Abstract**
 Traditional N-body methods introduce localised perturbations in the gravitational forces governing their evolution. These perturbations lead to an artificial fragmentation in the filamentary network of the Large Scale Structure, often referred to as "beads-on-a-string." This issue is particularly apparent in cosmologies with a suppression of the matter power spectrum at small spatial scales, such as warm dark matter models, where the perturbations induced by the N-body discretisation dominate the cosmological power at the suppressed scales. Initial conditions based on third-order Lagrangian perturbation theory, which allow for a late-starting redshift, have been shown to minimise numerical errors contributing to such artefacts. In this work, we investigate whether the additional use of a spatially adaptive softening for dark matter particles, based on the gravitational tidal field, can reduce the severity of artificial fragmentation. Tidal adaptive softening significantly improves force accuracy in idealised filamentary collapse simulations over a fixed softening approach. However, it does not substantially reduce spurious haloes in cosmological simulations when paired with such optimised initial conditions. Nevertheless, tidal adaptive softening induces a shift in halo formation times in warm dark matter simulations compared to a fixed softening counterpart, an effect not seen in cold dark matter simulations. Furthermore, initialising the initial conditions at an earlier redshift generally results in z=0 haloes forming from Lagrangian volumes with lower average sphericity. This sphericity difference could impact post-processing algorithms identifying spurious objects based on Lagrangian volume morphology. We propose potential strategies for reducing spurious haloes without abandoning current N-body methods.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Astrochemical modeling requires, as input, the effective column density of gas (or extinction) that attenuates an external, isotropic, far-ultraviolet radiation field. In three-dimensional simulations, this can be calculated through ray-tracing schemes, while in 0D chemical models it is often treated as a free parameter. Aims. We aim to produce an analytic, physically motivated formalism to predict the average relationship between the effective hydrogen-nuclei column density, $N_{\rm eff}({\rm H})$, and the local hydrogen-nuclei number density, $n_{\rm H}$. Methods. We construct an analytic model utilizing characteristic length scales that connects the turbulence-dominated regime and the gravitational-dominated regime at high-density. Results. The model well-reproduces a previous analytic fit to simulation results and is consistent with the high-density power-law indices, e.g., $N_{\rm eff}(H) \propto n^{\gamma}$, of $\gamma \approx 0.4 - 0.5$ found in previous numerical simulations utilizing ray-tracing. Conclusions. We present an analytic model relating the average effective column density, $N_{\rm eff}$, to the local number density, $n_{\rm H}$, which reproduces the behaviors found in three-dimensional simulations. The analytic model can be utilized as a sub-grid prescription for shielded molecular gas or in astrochemical models for a physically motivated estimation of the attenuating column density.

          Detection of a dark matter sub-halo near the Sun from pulsar timing

 - **Abstract**
 Using pulsar accelerations, we identify and constrain the properties of a dark matter sub-halo in the Galaxy for the first time from analyzing the excess, correlated power in the acceleration field of binary pulsars. We find that this sub-halo has a mass of $1.02^{+3.47}_{-0.90} \times 10^{7}~M_{\odot}$ and is located at Galactic coordinates $d = 0.93^{+0.32}_{-0.38}$ kpc, $b=36.78^{+17.59}_{-23.55}$, $l=30.16^{+19.36}_{-23.82}$, or equivalently at Galactocentric coordinates $X = 7.52^{+0.34}_{-0.38}~\rm$ kpc, $Y = 0.36^{+0.39}_{-0.43} ~\rm kpc$, $Z = 0.53^{+0.41}_{-0.45} ~\rm kpc$. We examine \textit{Gaia} data and the atomic and molecular hydrogen data of our Galaxy and show that this excess power cannot arise from the gas or the stars in our Galaxy. Additionally, by analyzing the full sample of binary pulsars with available acceleration measurements that span 3.4 kpc in Galactocentric radius from the Sun and 3.6 kpc in vertical height, we find that massive (with mass $>10^{8}~M_{\odot}~$) sub-halos are disfavored for the Milky Way within several kiloparsec of the Sun. The detection of a $10^{7}~M_{\odot}$ sub-halo within a few kpc of the Sun is potentially consistent with the expected number counts of sub-halos in the prevailing $\Lambda$CDM paradigm, for a substantial sub-halo mass fraction. The pulsar accelerations are however better fit by a compact object, such as arising from a primordial black hole or a sub-halo having a steep density profile, as in self-interacting dark matter. As the number and precision of direct acceleration measurements continues to grow, we will obtain tighter constraints on dark matter sub-structure in our Galaxy. These measurements now open a new avenue for studying dark matter and have implications across many fields of astrophysics - from understanding the nature of dark matter to galaxy formation.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a unified theory of linear spiral structure in stellar disks. We begin by identifying the characteristic scales involved in the spiral structure problem and listing some quantitative requirements of a successful theory. We then write down the general linear response theory for thin disks, making clear the equivalence between different representations (e.g., Volterra, Landau, van Kampen) of the theory. Next, using the asymptotic expansions developed in our previous galactokinetics paper, we consider spiral structure on different spatial scales and thereby show how several classic results - including Lindblad-Kalnajs density waves, swing amplification, Lin-Shu-Kalnajs modes, and groove instabilities - emerge as limiting cases. In addition, many of our asymptotic results connect smoothly when extrapolated to intermediate regimes, rendering the analytic theory valid over a larger range of scales than naively expected. Finally, we identify situations in which nonlinear physics is unavoidable. Though many nonlinear questions remain unanswered, we hope that the theoretical synthesis developed here will allow us to both connect and distinguish the plethora of ideas that have accumulated over the last six decades of spiral structure studies, and will provide a foundation upon which a comprehensive theory might ultimately be built.

 - **Abstract**
 At any given scale, 3$\times$2-point statistics extract only three numbers from the joint distribution of the cosmic matter density and galaxy density fluctuations: their variances and their covariance. It is well known that the full shape of the PDF of those fluctuations contains significantly more information than can be accessed through these three numbers. But the study of the PDF of cosmic density fluctuations in real observational data is still in its infancy. Here we present \verb|CosMomentum|, a public software toolkit for calculating theoretical predictions for the full shape of the joint distribution of a line-of-sight projected tracer density and the gravitational lensing convergence. We demonstrate that an analysis of this full shape of the PDF can indeed disentangle complicated tracer bias and stochasticity relations from signatures of cosmic structure growth. Our paper also provides back-drop for an upcoming follow-up study, which prepares PDF analyses for application to observational data by incorporating the impact of realistic weak lensing systematics.

          Impact of 3D macro physics and nuclear physics on the p nuclei in O-C shell mergers

 - **Abstract**
 O-C shell mergers in massive stars are a site for producing the p nuclei by the $\gamma$ process, but 1D stellar models rely on mixing length theory, which does not match the radial velocity profiles of 3D hydrodynamic simulations. We investigate how 3D macro physics informed mixing impacts the nucleosynthesis of p nuclei. We post-process the O-shell of the $M_\mathrm{ZAMS} = 15~\mathrm{M}_\odot$, $Z = 0.02$ model from the NuGrid stellar data set. Applying a downturn to velocities at the boundary and increasing velocities across the shell as obtained in previous results, we find non-linear, non-monotonic increase in p-nuclei production with a spread of 0.96 dex, and find that isotopic ratios can change. Reducing C-shell ingestion rates as found in 3D simulations suppresses production, with spreads of 1.22-1.84 dex across MLT and downturn scenarios. Applying dips to the diffusion profile to mimic quenching events also suppresses production, with a 0.51 dex spread. We analyze the impact of varying all photo-disintegration rates of unstable n-deficient isotopes from Se-Po by a factor of 10 up and down. The nuclear physics variations for the MLT and downturn cases have a spread of 0.56-0.78 dex. We also provide which reaction rates are correlated with the p nuclei, and find few correlations shared between mixing scenarios. Our results demonstrate that uncertainties in mixing arising from uncertain 3D macro physics are as significant as nuclear physics and are crucial for understanding p-nuclei production during O-C shell mergers quantitatively.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration have renewed interest in dynamical dark energy models, particularly those that cross the "phantom divide" ($w_{\rm DE} = -1$). We present the first observational constraints on monodromic k-essence, a physically motivated scalar field dark energy scenario capable of realizing rapid oscillations about the phantom divide. Using cosmic microwave background (CMB) information, DESI DR2 BAO measurements, and Type Ia supernovae observations, we constrain the amplitude, frequency, phase, and power-law index describing the monodromic k-essence scenario at the background level. We find that the monodromic dark energy scenario can fit these datasets with a $\chi^2$ that is comparable to the phenomenological $w_0$-$w_a$ parametrization. While the CMB and BAO data alone are consistent with the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, the inclusion of DESY5 supernovae shows a preference for a non-zero amplitude, $A=0.44^{+0.16}_{-0.12}$ (fully marginalized 68% C.L.). Conversely, inclusion of the Pantheon-Plus supernovae provides no evidence for monodromic k-essence, with $A<0.43$ (95% C.L.). We show that constraints on both monodromic dark energy and $w_0$-$w_a$ models are sensitive to the DESI DR2 LRG2 BAO distance, especially in the absence of supernovae data.

 - **Abstract**
 Massive stars lose a significant fraction of their mass through stellar winds at various stages of their lives, including on the main sequence, during the red supergiant phase, and as evolved helium-rich Wolf--Rayet stars. In stellar population synthesis, uncertainty in the mass-loss rates in these evolutionary stages limits our understanding of the formation of black holes and merging compact binaries. In the last decade, the theoretical predictions, simulation, and direct observation of wind mass-loss rates in massive stars have improved significantly, typically leading to a reduction in the predicted mass-loss rates of massive stars. In this paper we explore the astrophysical implications of an updated treatment of winds in the COMPAS population synthesis code. There is a large amount of variation in predicted mass-loss rates for massive red supergiants; some of the prescriptions we implement predict that massive red supergiants are able to lose their hydrogen envelopes through winds alone (providing a possible solution to the so-called missing red supergiant problem), while others predict much lower mass-loss rates that would not strip the hydrogen envelope. We discuss the formation of the most massive stellar-mass black holes in the Galaxy, including the high-mass X-ray binary Cygnus X-1 and the newly discovered Gaia BH3. We find that formation rates of merging binary black holes are sensitive to the mass-loss rate prescriptions, while the formation rates of merging binary neutron stars and neutron-star black hole binaries are more robust to this uncertainty.

          Secular Resonances in Planet-Hosting Binary Stars. I. General Theory

 - **Abstract**
 Motivated by the diversity of circumstellar planets in binary stars and the strong effects of the secular resonances of Jupiter and Saturn on the formation and architecture of the inner solar system, we have launched an expansive project on studying the effects of secular resonances on the formation of terrestrial planets around a star of a moderately close binary. As the first phase of our project, we present here the general theory of secular resonances in dual-star systems where the primary hosts two giant planets. Using the concept of generalized disturbing function, we derive the formula for the locations of secular resonances and show that in systems where the perturbation of the secondary star is stronger, the locations of secular resonances are farther way from the primary and closer to the giant planets. The latter implies that in such systems, terrestrial planet formation has a larger area to proceed with more of the protoplanetary disk being available to it. To demonstrate the validity of our theoretical results, we simulated the evolution of a protoplanetary disk interior to the inner giant planet. Results, in addition to confirming our theoretical predictions, pointed to an important finding: In binary stars, the perturbation of the secondary suppresses the secular resonances of giant planets. Simulations also show that as the disk loses material, secular resonances move inward, scattering objects out of the disk and/or facilitating their collisional growth. We present results of our study and discuss their implications for the simulations of terrestrial planet formation.

 - **Abstract**
 Continuing our study of the effects of secular resonances on the formation of terrestrial planets in moderately close binary stars, we present here the results of an extensive numerical simulations of the formation of these objects. Considering a binary with two giant planets and a protoplanetary disk around its primary star, we have simulated the late stage of terrestrial planet formation for different types of the secondary, and different orbital elements of the binary and giant planets. Results demonstrate that terrestrial planet formation can indeed proceed constructively in such systems; however, as predicted by the general theory, secular resonances are suppressed and do not contribute to the formation process. Simulations show that it is in fact the mean-motion resonances of the inner giant planet that drive the dynamics of the protoplanetary disk and the mass and orbital architecture of the final bodies. Simulations also show that in the majority of the cases, the final systems contain only one terrestrial planet with a mass of 0.6-1.7 Earth masses. Multiple planets appear on rare occasions in the form of Earth-Mars analogs with the smaller planet in an exterior orbit. When giant planets are in larger orbits, the number of these double-planet systems increases and their planets become more massive. Results also show that when the orbits of the giant planets carry inclinations, while secular resonances are still suppressed, mean-motion resonances are strongly enhanced, drastically reducing the efficacy of the formation process. We present the results of our simulations and discuss their implications.

 - **Abstract**
 Many extreme velocity candidate stars have been found based on \textit{Gaia} astrometry, but need spectroscopic confirmation. We select late-type hypervelocity star (HVS) candidates from the \textit{Gaia} DR3 catalog with a $1\sigma$ lower limit of the tangential velocity of 800 km\,s$^{-1}$. J1903-0023, one of the brightest targets, stands out as high priority candidate for follow-up spectroscopy using the X-shooter instrument at ESO-VLT. We determine its atmospheric parameters and abundances utilizing synthetic spectral grids and a global $\chi^2-$minimization procedure, and its stellar parameters with the help of evolutionary tracks and the spectral energy distribution. The star shows variability in its light curve and follow-up spectroscopy confirms that the star is radial-velocity variable. The spectroscopic distance of J1903-0023 is lower than that based on the parallax, indicating that the star is not a hypervelocity binary star but bound to the Galaxy. The star turned out to be of spectral type F, very similar to the extreme-velocity star J0725-2351, which we analyse in the same way as the target. Apparently, both stars are very metal poor and old halo main-sequence (sdF) stars with masses slightly below the halo turn-off mass, and share the low metallicity ([Fe/H]=-2.3,-2.6) and strong alpha enhancement ([$\alpha$/Fe]$\sim0.44$). While J0725-2351 is non-rotating ($v\sin\,i<3$\,km\,s$^{-1}$), J1903-0023 is a fast rotator ($v\sin i=42.3\pm2.0$ km\,s$^{-1}$). The Gaia, and ZTF light curves show an eclipse at a 1.179 day period, similar to the rotation period of J1903-0023. We therefore conclude that J1903-0023 is a high-velocity tidally-synchronised binary most likely with a metal-poor M dwarf companion.

          Quantifying the Impact of 2D and 3D BAO Measurements on the Cosmic Distance Duality Relation with HII Galaxy observation

 - **Abstract**
 The cosmic distance duality relation (CDDR) is a fundamental and practical condition in observational cosmology that connects the luminosity distance and angular diameter distance. Testing its validity offers a powerful tool to probe new physics beyond the standard cosmological model. In this work, for the first time, we present a novel consistency test of CDDR by combining HII galaxy data with a comprehensive set of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) measurements. The BAO measurements include two-dimensional (2D) BAO and three-dimensional (3D) BAO, as well as the latest 3D BAO data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 2 (DR2). We adopt four different parameterizations of the CDDR parameter, $\eta(z)$, to investigate possible deviations and their evolution with cosmic time. To ensure accurate redshift matching across datasets, we reconstruct the distance measures through a model-independent Artificial Neural Network (ANN) approach. Our analysis uniquely examines two distinct approaches: $i)$ marginalization over the BAO sound horizon $r_d$, and $ii)$ fixing $r_d$ to specific values. We find no significant deviation from the CDDR (less than 68% confidence level) in either the marginalized $r_d$ or the $r_d=147.05$ Mpc scenario. However, a slight deviation at the 68% confidence level is found when applying 2D-BAO data with $r_d=139.5$ Mpc. Furthermore, our analysis shows that all BAO data considered in this work support the validity of the CDDR, where 3D-DESI BAO provides the tightest constraints. We find no tension between 2D and 3D BAO measurements, which confirms their mutual consistency. In addition, the treatment of the sound horizon $r_d$ significantly impacts $\eta(z)$ constraints, which proves its importance in CDDR tests. Finally, the consistency of our results supports the standard CDDR and demonstrates the robustness of our analytical approach.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of the lunar exosphere provide valuable insights into dynamic processes affecting the Moon, such as meteoroid bombardment. The Chamberlain model was employed to estimate the zenith column density and temperature of Na atoms on August 13/14, 2009, after the peak of the Perseid meteor shower. Additionally, the column density and temperature of Na atoms delivered to the lunar exosphere by gradual processes during the peak on August 12/13, 2009, were estimated. Expected ratios of line-of-sight column densities of Na atoms at three observed altitudes on August 12/13, 2009, were obtained using the Chamberlain model and Monte Carlo simulations. The heightened intensities of Na emission lines on August 12/13, 2009, are attributed to the onset of the third short-term peak in Perseid activity predicted by celestial mechanics. The best agreement between observations and theoretical models was achieved with a theoretical temperature of 3000 K for impact-produced Na atoms. This third peak of Perseids began between 23:29 and 23:41 UT on August 12, 2009, lasting approximately 83 minutes, with a mass flux attributed to the Perseids ranging between 1.6 x 10^-16 and 5 x 10^-16 g cm^-2 s^-1. Additionally, depletion of Li content compared to Na content in the lunar exosphere was detected. A model predicting Perseid meteoroid stream activity on the Moon was developed and compared with spectral observations of the lunar exosphere. By modeling 25,000 years of comet 109P/Swift-Tuttle's orbits, 175 cometary trails likely to have generated meteoroids near Earth and the Moon during the Perseid 2009 meteor shower were identified. Our results reveal annual maxima inducing filament trail structures, one of which closely aligned with the observed peak of increased Na content in the lunar exosphere.

 - **Abstract**
 The radio detection of very inclined air showers offers a promising avenue for studying ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) and neutrinos. Accurate reconstruction methods are essential for investigating the properties of primary particles. Recently, we developed an analytical least-squares method to reconstruct the electric field using three polarization components. The reconstruction yields no bias, with a 68\% confidence interval of [-0.02, 0.02], and a standard deviation of 0.04. Using this reconstructed electric field, we perform a realistic reconstruction of the the properties of primary particles. We employ a spherical wave model combined with an angular distribution function (ADF) for arrival direction reconstruction, achieving an angular resolution of 0.04$^\circ$. This paper also presents an energy reconstruction in which we account for the effects of geosynchrotron radiation in inclined air showers, we implement an air density correction in the energy reconstruction, resulting in a 10\% resolution in energy estimation. These findings demonstrate the reliability and effectiveness of our reconstruction methodology, paving the way for future detection experiments using sparse antenna arrays.

 - **Abstract**
 The oscillation in primordial power spectrum (PPS), a fingerprint of not only a wide class of models of inflation but new physics, is of significant theoretical interest, and can be imprinted on the cosmic microwave background (CMB). In this work, we present constraints on periodic oscillations in the PPS using the latest ACT DR6 and SPT-3G D1 CMB data with the precise measurements at high multipoles beyond the Planck angular resolution and sensitivity. It is found that the combination of SPT and ACT with Planck CMB dataset significantly tightens the upper bound to $A_\mathrm{log,lin}\lesssim 0.029$ at 95\% C.L., showing no hint for primordial oscillations, where $A_\mathrm{log,lin}$ are the amplitudes of logarithmic and linear oscillation in the PPS, respectively. Our work presents state-of-the-art CMB constraints on primordial oscillations, highlighting the power of the ground-based CMB experiments in constraining physics beyond the simplest slow-roll models.

 - **Abstract**
 The solar wind, accelerated within the solar corona, sculpts the heliosphere and continuously interacts with planetary atmospheres. On Earth, high-speed solar-wind streams may lead to severe disruption of satellite operations and power grids. Accurate and reliable forecasting of the ambient solar-wind speed is therefore highly desirable. This work presents an encoder-decoder neural-network framework for simultaneously forecasting the daily averaged solar-wind speed for the subsequent four days. The encoder-decoder framework is trained with the two different modes of solar observations. The history of solar-wind observations from prior solar-rotations and EUV coronal observations up to four days prior to the current time form the input to two different encoders. The decoder is designed to output the daily averaged solar-wind speed from four days prior to the current time to four days into the future. Our model outputs the solar-wind speed with Root-Mean-Square Errors (RMSEs) of 55 km/s, 58 km/s, 58 km/s, and 58 km/s and Pearson correlations of 0.78, 0.66, 0.64 and 0.63 for one to four days in advance respectively. While the model is trained and validated on observations between 2010 - 2018, we demonstrate its robustness via application on unseen test data between 2019 - 2023, yielding RMSEs of 53 km/s and Pearson correlations 0.55 for a four-day advance prediction. Our encoder-decoder model thus produces much improved RMSE values compared to the previous works and paves the way for developing comprehensive multimodal deep learning models for operational solar wind forecasting.

          Prospects for searching for sterile neutrinos in dynamical dark energy cosmologies using joint observations of gravitational waves and $γ$-ray bursts

 - **Abstract**
 In the era of third-generation (3G) gravitational-wave (GW) detectors, GW standard siren observations from binary neutron star mergers provide a powerful tool for probing the expansion history of the universe. Since sterile neutrinos can influence cosmic evolution by modifying the radiation content and suppressing structure formation, GW standard sirens offer promising prospects for constraining sterile neutrino properties within a cosmological framework. Building on this, we investigate the prospects for detecting sterile neutrinos in dynamical dark energy (DE) models using joint observations from 3G GW detectors and a future short gamma-ray burst detector, such as a THESEUS-like telescope. We consider three DE models: the $w$CDM, holographic DE (HDE), and Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) models. Our results show that the properties of DE can influence the constraints on sterile neutrino parameters. Moreover, the inclusion of GW data significantly improves constraints on both sterile neutrino parameters and other cosmological parameters across all three models, compared to the current limits derived from CMB+BAO+SN (CBS) observations. When GW data are included into the CBS dataset, a preference for $\Delta N_{\rm eff} > 0$ emerges at approximately the $1\sigma$ level in the $w$CDM and CPL models, and reaches about $3\sigma$ in the HDE model. Moreover, the upper limits on $m_{\nu,{\rm sterile}}^{\rm eff}$ are reduced by approximately 13%, 75%, and 3% in the $w$CDM, HDE, and CPL models, respectively.

 - **Abstract**
 In the context of the ASTRI MiniArray project (9 dual-mirror air Cherenkov telescopes being installed at the Observatorio del Teide in the Canary Islands), the ASTRI- Horn prototype was previously implemented in Italy (Sicily). It was a crucial test bench for establishing observation strategies, hardware upgrades, and software solutions. Specifically, during the winter 2022/2023 observing campaign, we implemented significant enhancements in using the so-called Variance mode, an auxiliary output of the ASTRI Cherenkov camera able to take images of the night sky background in the near UV/visible band. Variance data are now processed online and on site using a dedicated pipeline and stored in tech files. This data can infer possible telescope mis-pointing, background level, number of identified stars, and point spread function. In this contribution, we briefly present these quantities and their importance together with the algorithms adopted for their calculation. They provide valuable monitoring of telescope health and sky conditions during scientific data collection, enabling the selection of optimal time sequences for Cherenkov data reduction.

 - **Abstract**
 This study presents a general alternative scheme of the procedure and necessary conditions for solving the $n$-body problem. The presented solution is not a solution of the classical problem, where the initial conditions of positions and initial velocities/momenta of the bodies are known. Starting from the standard initial condition the procedure treats contributions to momentum from particular pair-wise interactions as independent variables from which the total momentum and velocity of a given mass is then reproduced. Initial values of those contributions are arbitrary as long as the resulting velocities match the initial condition. The obtained solutions take into account the gravitational interactions between each pair of bodies, as a result of which they are characterized by higher stability than the solutions of the classical problem. The presented procedure was used to calculate the positions and mutual velocities of three bodies: the Sun, the Earth and the Moon. It has also been tested for our entire planetary system (8 planets) with the Sun and the Moon. For these types of systems, the method allows obtaining solutions that are stable. The procedure was also tested on the example of the Pythagorean system of bodies.

 The Single-Mirror Small Size Cherenkov Telescope (SST-1M) was developed by a consortium of institutes in Switzerland, Poland, and the Czech Republic. The SST-1M design is based on the Davies-Cotton concept, featuring a 4-meter mirror and an innovative SiPM-based camera. It is most sensitive to gamma rays in the TeV and multi-TeV energy bands. Since 2022, two SST-1M prototypes have been commissioned at the Ondrejov Observatory in the Czech Republic, where their performance in both mono and stereo observation modes is being tested. During the commissioning phase, several galactic and extragalactic gamma-ray sources have been observed, resulting in multiple detections. In this contribution, we present preliminary results from this observation campaign.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations of cosmic rays increasingly point to the existence of nearby sources - so-called "local tevatrons", capable of accelerating particles to TeV energies. In this study, we examine the potential of a typical main-sequence star, represented by the Sun, to act as a source of TeV cosmic rays (CRs). We focus on identifying plausible mechanisms through which a quiescent star can accelerate charged particles to relativistic energies. We show that shock-drift acceleration processes operating within the chromospheres of the Sun and similar stars can accelerate particles to energies reaching the TeV scale. Additionally, we provide quantitative estimates of both the maximum achievable particle energies, spectral index of energy spectrum and the resulting cosmic-ray fluxes that such stellar environments could realistically produce. Our results indicate that ordinary stars could potentially contribute to the fine structure observed in the cosmic-ray spectrum at TeV energies and may help explain the local excess of TeV-scale electrons and positrons detected by H.E.S.S. and other observatories.

          On the origin and dynamical evolution of Jupiter's moon Amalthea

 - **Abstract**
 Interior to the orbits of Jupiter's iconic Galilean moons are four small satellites with individual mean radii, $R\lesssim 84$ km. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that these bodies formed at a more distant location in Jupiter's circumplanetary disk before coming to reside at their current short-period orbits. Nonetheless, how these moons dynamically evolved to such a location has yet to be explained in the emerging paradigm of Jovian satellite formation. Here, we present a quantitative model for the origin of the largest of these inner moons, Amalthea, that can be extended to its neighbor, Thebe, and to other small bodies in astrophysical disks. We propose that Amalthea's anomalous features are due to it having formed alongside the Galileans in a reservoir of satellitesimals located at a large jovian-centric distance. As the innermost Galilean, Io, migrated inward from this reservoir, it captured the satellitesimal, Amalthea, into resonance and shepherded the small body to its modern neighborhood. During migration through the disk, dissipative forcing from aerodynamic drag induces overstable librations in the Io-Amalthea resonance, such that only a narrow range of nebular parameters can accommodate the requisite long-range transport. In particular, the disk-aspect ratio, $h/r$, emerges as the key variable. Our calculations indicate that the circumjovian disk had a scale height of at least $h/r\gtrsim0.08$, implying a relatively hot, actively accreting disk during the epoch of satellite formation. These results thus shed light on the evolution of the Jovian system, along with the more general phenomenon of satellite-disk interactions.

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce a new photometric mapping method for the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to measure the spatial distribution of carbonaceous dust, siliceous dust and water ice by using absorption features arising from the grains in the dense interstellar medium (ISM). Employing NIRCam and MIRI imaging filters, low-resolution spectroscopic data can be obtained to measure the optical depths of the 3.0-$\mu$m water ice -OH feature, the 3.4-$\mu$m aliphatic hydrocarbon -CH feature, and the 10-$\mu$m silicate -SiO feature for large fields of view. This method provides extensive statistical data of the grains across wide fields in the ISM at minimal observing cost. In this study, we present its application on observational data from the literature to validate the measured optical depths and simulations to assess the accuracy of the method under various conditions. We showed that the photometric method can be employed to obtain reasonably accurate measurements of optical depth. We demonstrate that JWST optical depth maps enable the independent exploration of abundance distributions of major grain components across a wide spatial coverage in the ISM.

 - **Abstract**
 GW231123 is an exceptionally massive binary black hole (BBH) merger with unusually high component spins. Such extreme properties challenge conventional stellar evolution models predicting a black hole mass gap due to pair-instability supernovae. We analyze GW231123 using population-informed priors on BH mass and spin distributions to test possible formation scenarios: first-generation stellar collapse, hierarchical (multi-generation) mergers, and primordial origin. Our analysis strongly prefers scenarios where at least one component is a higher-generation BH. Both components are favored to have high spins, which rules out scenarios in which they are both first-generation (low spin) or primordial (nearly non-spin). We conclude that GW231123 is a hierarchical merger, with components plausibly originate from the successive mergers of $\sim 6$ and $\sim 4$ first-generation BHs, respectively. This suggests that repeated mergers can be frequent and even more massive intermediate-mass black holes may be produced. Thus mechanisms that can efficiently harden the BBHs' orbits are required, e.g., gas dynamical fraction in the disks of active galactic nucleus.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigated three fan-shaped jets observed above sunspot light bridges or nearby sunspot regions. The study aimed to explore the dynamics and physical properties of jets' features that appear as blob-like structures at the tips of the jets, which we call `dark blobs'. A transparent region is observed beneath the dark blobs, creating a visible gap between the dark blobs and the trailing body of the jets. These phenomena were studied in chromospheric and transition region imaging and spectral high-resolution co-observations from the Visible Imaging Spectrometer of the Goode Solar Telescope at the Big Bear Solar Observatory and the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS), together with data from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory. We analyzed the jets' morphology and fine structure. We obtained the spatial scale and the dynamics of the dark blobs that are seen mostly in the wings of the H$\alpha$ line and have a cross-section of about $0.2^{\prime\prime}-0.3^{\prime\prime}$. The dark blobs and the transparent regions are seen bright (in emission) in the IRIS slit-jaw 1330 $\unicode{0x212B}$, 1400 $\unicode{0x212B}$, and AIA 304 $\unicode{0x212B}$ images. The IRIS Si IV 1394 $\unicode{0x212B}$ spectrum of the brightenings showed blue-shifted emission of about $16$ km s$^{-1}$ with non-thermal velocities of up to $40$ km s$^{-1}$. We also estimated the electron density of the blue-shifted brightenings to be $10^{12.1\pm0.2}$ cm$^{-3}$. Our findings likely suggest that we detect the observational signatures of shock waves that generate and/or contribute to the evolution of fan-shaped jets.

 This work presents numerical results of a computer simulation performed with six centroiding algorithms targeting a star tracker in development at INPE, including readout noise and considering a Gaussian point spread function. Five of the tested algorithms are light-weight centroiding algorithms with low computational costs. These were compared to a shape fitting algorithm based on the lsqnonlin function available in Matlab and GNU Octave. The algorithms studied here are also applicable for astrometry and adaptive optics.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work we provide the missing link between two approaches aimed at characterizing the effect of long perturbation modes in Inflation. We consider the Inflationary Fossils' approach (arXiv:1203.0302 and related works) that characterizes the power-spectrum of the inflaton field in presence of other long and non dynamical fossil fields, and a technique, appeared in arXiv:2103.09244, that computes, beyond perturbation theory, the power-spectrum of a scalar field in presence of a large fluctuation of a second field. We clarify a few points on the applicability of the non-perturbative technique. We prove in five distinct cases that the non-perturbative approach, once expanded to first order in the coupling, matches the perturbative result following the Fossils' approach. We believe that this non-perturbative technique extends to all orders the Fossils' approach, resumming infinitely many diagrams of standard in-in perturbation theory.

 - **Abstract**
 An understanding of the energy dependence of gamma-ray sources can yield important information on the underlying emission mechanisms. However, despite the detection of energy-dependent morphologies in many TeV sources, we lack a proper quantification of such measurements. We introduce an estimation tool within the Gammapy landscape, an open-source Python package for the analysis of gamma-ray data, to quantify the energy-dependent morphology of a gamma-ray source. The proposed method for this estimation tool fits the spatial morphology in a global fit across all energy slices (null hypothesis) and compares this to separate fits for each energy slice (alternative hypothesis). These are modelled using forward-folding methods, and the significance of variability is quantified by comparing the test statistic between the two hypotheses. We present a general tool to probe changes in the spatial morphology with energy, employing a full forward folding approach with 3D likelihood. We present its usage on a real dataset from H.E.S.S., and also on a simulated dataset to quantify the significance of energy dependence for sources of different sizes. In the first example, which utilises a subset of data from HESSJ1825-137, we observe extended emission at lower energies that becomes more compact at higher energies. The tool indicates very significant variability (9.8{\sigma}) in the case of the largely extended emission. In the second example, a source with a smaller extent (~0.1°), simulated using the CTAO response, shows the tool can still provide a statistically significant variation (9.7{\sigma}), despite the small scale.

 The evolution history of the Milky Way disk is imprinted in the ages, positions, and chemical compositions of individual stars. In this study, we derive the intrinsic density distribution of different stellar populations using the final data release of the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) survey. A total of 203,197 red giant branch stars are used to sort the stellar disk ($R \leq 20$ kpc) into sub-populations of metallicity ($\Delta$[M/H]$= 0.1$ dex), age ($\Delta \log(\frac{\textrm{age}}{\textrm{yr}})= 0.1$), and $\alpha$-element abundances ([$\alpha$/M]). We fit the present-day structural parameters and density distribution of each stellar sub-population after correcting for the survey selection function. The low-$\alpha$ disk is characterized by longer scale lengths and shorter scale heights, and is best fit by a broken exponential radial profile for each population. The high-$\alpha$ disk is characterized by shorter scale lengths and larger scale heights, and is generally well-approximated by a single exponential radial profile. These results are applied to produce new estimates of the integrated properties of the Milky Way from early times to the present day. We measure the total stellar mass of the disk to be $5.27^{+0.2}_{-1.5} \times 10^{10}$ M$_\odot$ and the average mass-weighted scale length is $R_{d} = 2.37 \pm 0.2$ kpc. The Milky Way's present-day color of $(g-r) = 0.72 \pm 0.02$ is consistent with the classification of a red spiral galaxy, although it has only been in the "green valley" region of the galaxy color-mass diagram for the last $\sim 3$ Gyr.

 - **Abstract**
 Double pulsar systems offer unrivaled advantages for the study of both astrophysics and fundamental physics. But only one has been visible: PSR J0737$-$3039; and its component pulsar B has now rotated out of sight due to the general-relativistic effect of geodetic precession. We know, though, that these precession cycles can also pivot pulsars into sight, and that this precession occurs at similar strength in PSR J1906+0746. That source is a young, unrecycled radio pulsar, orbiting a compact object with mass $\sim $1.32 M$_{\odot}$. This work presents a renewed campaign to detect radio pulsations from this companion, two decades after the previous search. Two key reasons driving this reattempt are the possibility that the companion radio beam has since precessed into our line of sight, and the improved sensitivity now offered by the FAST radio telescope. In 28 deep observations, we did not detect a credible companion pulsar signal. After comparing the possible scenarios, we conclude the companion is still most likely a pulsar that is not pointing at us. We next present estimates for the sky covered by such systems throughout their precession cycle. We find that for most system geometries, the all-time beaming fraction is unity, i.e., observers in any direction can see the system at some point. We conclude it is still likely that PSR J1906+0746 will be visible as a double pulsar in the future.

 - **Abstract**
 A few ground-based solar coronagraphs have been installed in western China for observing the low-layer corona in recent years. However, determining the Helioprojective Coordinates for the coronagraphic data with high precision is an important but challenging step for further research with other multi-wavelength data. In this paper, we propose an automatic coronal image registration method that combines local statistical correlation and feature point matching to achieve accurate registration between ground-based coronal green-line images and space-based 211 Å images. Then, the accurate field of view information of the coronal green-line images can be derived, allowing the images to be mapped to the Helioprojective Cartesian Coordinates with an accuracy of no less than 0.1''. This method has been extensively validated using 100 days of coronal data spanning an 11-year period, demonstrating its broad applicability to ground-based coronagraphs equipped with green-line observations. It significantly enhances the scientific value of ground-based coronal data, enabling comprehensive studies of coronal transient activities and facilitating the joint analysis of data from multiple instruments. Additionally, it holds potential for future applications in improving the pointing accuracy of coronagraphs.

 - **Abstract**
 Current measurements of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Survey (DESI DR2), when combined with data from Type Ia supernovae (SNe), challenge the observational viability of the $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model, motivating combinations of independent datasets to estimate cosmological quantities. In a previous communication, we presented a cosmological independent method to constrain the baryon fraction in the IGM ($f_{\mathrm{IGM}}$), where we derived relevant expressions for the dispersion measure ($\mathrm{DM}$) in terms of luminosity distance, allowing us to estimate $f_{\mathrm{IGM}}$ combining directly measurements of 17 well-localized FRBs and 1048 SNe from the Pantheon catalog. Here we revisit this method to constrain $f_{\mathrm{IGM}}$, considering two parameterizations for the $f_{\mathrm{IGM}}$: constant and time-dependent. We expand our sample by combining 107 well-localized Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) with BAO measurements from DESI DR2 and SNe observations from DESY5, and the Pantheon+ catalog. We find through a Bayesian model selection analysis that a conclusive answer about the evolution of $f_{\mathrm{IGM}}$ cannot be achieved from the current FRBs observational data. In particular, our results show weak evidence in favor of the constant case.

 - **Abstract**
 Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are short-duration radio transients with mysterious origins. Since its uncertainty, there are very few FRBs that are observed by different instruments, simultaneously. This study presents a detailed analysis of a burst from FRB 20190520B observed by FAST and Parkes at the same time. The spectrum of this individual burst ended at the upper limit of the FAST frequency band and was simultaneously detected by the Parkes telescope in the 1.5-1.8 GHz range. By employing spectral energy distribution (SED) and spectral sharpness methods, we confirmed the presence of narrowband radiation in FRB 20190520B, which is crucial for understanding its radiation mechanisms. Our findings support the narrowband characteristics that most repeaters exhibit. This work also highlights the necessity of continued multiband observations to explore its periodicity and frequency-dependent properties, contributing to an in-depth understanding of FRB phenomena.

 - **Abstract**
 We present updated results from our near-infrared long-baseline interferometry (LBI) survey to constrain the multiplicity properties of intermediate-mass A-type stars within 80 pc. Previous adaptive optics surveys of A-type stars are incomplete at separations $<$ 20au. Therefore, a LBI survey allows us to explore separations previously unexplored. Our sample consists of 54 A-type primaries with estimated masses between 1.44-2.93 M$_{\odot}$ and ages 10-790 Myr, which we observed with the MIRC-X and MYSTIC instruments at the CHARA Array. We use the open source software CANDID to detect two new companions, seven in total, and we performed a Bayesian demographic analysis to characterize the companion population. We find the separation distribution consistent with being flat, and we estimate a power-law fit to the mass ratio distribution with index -0.13$^{+0.92}_{-0.95}$ and a companion frequency of 0.25$^{+0.17}_{-0.11}$ over mass ratios 0.1-1.0 and projected separations 0.01-27.54au. We find a posterior probability of 0.53 and 0.04 that our results are consistent with extrapolations based on previous models of the solar-type and B-type companion population, respectively. Our results suggest that the close companion population to A-type stars is comparable to that of solar-types and that close companions to B-type stars are potentially more frequent which may be indicative of increased disk fragmentation for stars $\gtrsim$ 3M$_{\odot}$.

 - **Abstract**
 Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration transient events that are typically observed at radio wavelengths and cosmological distances but their origin remains unclear. Furthermore, most FRB origin models are related to the processes at stellar scales, involving neutron stars, blackholes, supernovae, etc. In this paper, our purpose is to determine whether multi-structural one-off FRBs and repeaters share similarities. To achieve this, we focus on analyzing the relationship between the FRB event rate and the star formation rate, complemented by statistical testing methods. Based on the CHIME/FRB Catalog 1, we calculate the energy functions for four subsamples, including apparent non-repeating FRBs (one-offs), repeaters, multi-structural one-offs, and the joint repeaters and multi-structural events, respectively. We then derive the FRB event rates at different redshifts for all four subsamples, all of which were found to share a similar cosmological evolution trend. However, we find that the multi-structural one-offs and repeaters are distinguishable from the KS and MWW tests.

          Prediction of Apophis's deformation-driven rotational evolution during its closest encounter to the Earth in 2029

 - **Abstract**
 In 2029, the near-Earth asteroid (99942) Apophis approaches the Earth within six Earth radii. This opportunity is one of the rarest natural experiments that we can use to better characterize a small body through telescopic observations and space missions. Earlier geological investigations consistently suggested that major geological processes might not occur on Apophis during this closest encounter, including surface processing and interior deformation. However, minor resurfacing may occur, depending on local geological conditions. A critical finding is that the rotational evolution occurs due to the tidal effect from the Earth. The present study offers an additional perspective on the rotational evolution, which may vary due to variations in interior properties. Namely, possible deformation processes may change the spin state variation from the rigid body state, even if deformation is not measurable. The effort in this work is to explore this issue using a simplified model, motivated by earlier studies by Hirabayashi (2023) and Taylor et al. (2023). The results show that the deformation-driven spin state change may be possible, depending on Young's modulus. If this asteroid's Young's modulus is ~1 MPa or higher, the spin state only deviates a few degrees from the rigid body state over one year. However, if it is ~10 kPa or less, the spin state deviation may reach a few degrees, even a few days after the closest encounter. Both telescopic observations and space missions can provide strong insights into this phenomenon.

          Inflation from a generalized exponential plateau: towards extra suppressed tensor-to-scalar ratios

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate a standard minimally-coupled scalar-field inflationary scenario, which is based on a new potential, with suitably generalized plateau features, that leads to extra small tensor-to-scalar ratios. In particular, we consider a specific three-parameter potential, which has a flatter plateau and a steeper well compared to the Starobinsky potential in the Einstein frame. We study the inflationary realization and we show that it guarantees a prolonged period of slow-roll inflation and a successful exit. Additionally, the steeper minimum leads to significantly suppressed tensor perturbations, and thus to an extra-small tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$, and we show that we are able to obtain $r$ values less than $10^{-5}$. Moreover, we calculate the reheating temperature showing that in order to be in agreement with observations one of the potential parameters should remain within specific bounds. Finally, performing an inverse conformal transformation to the Jordan frame we show that the considered potential corresponds to higher-order corrections to Starobinsky potential in the Einstein frame, and these corrections are the reason for the improved behavior of the tensor-to-scalar ratio.

          Reassessing the ZTF Volume-Limited Type Ia Supernova Sample and Its Implications for Continuous, Dust-Dependent Models of Intrinsic Scatter

 - **Abstract**
 The ZTF DR2 includes light curves of 3628 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), making it the largest low-redshift SNe Ia sample available. One central question for analyses of SNe Ia is whether the remaining diversity of standardized luminosities arises in part from an intrinsic or extrinsic effect; characterized by the color-independent bimodality in progenitor population or color- and host- dependent diversity in dust extinction, respectively. In the initial analyses of the volume-limited subset (z < 0.06; 945 SNe) of this sample from the ZTF collaboration, the authors reported evidences for the former hypothesis, in contrast to many of the previous evidences for the dust hypothesis found across other largest high- and low- redshift SNe Ia samples. We re-analyze the volume-limited ZTF SNe Ia in the same manner that previous samples were analyzed and report consistency with trends seen in literature samples and in support of the dust hypothesis. We find the following: 1. a color dependency in the canonical `mass-step' size for SNe, with red SNe having a larger host-dependent residual step than blue SNe by 0.18 $\pm$ 0.09 mag; 2. a color-dependent difference in the Hubble residual scatter, with red SNe having a $\sim$ 33% larger scatter than blue SNe at > 3$\sigma$ significance; 3. data's preference of a model that accounts for color-dependency over a simple `step' model at $\sim$ 3$\sigma$; 4. the strongest evidence to date (3.5$\sigma$) that the relationship between SN color, host-galaxy properties, and luminosity is continuous rather than characterized by a discrete step. Accounting for 3 and 4 with our new model, Host2D, yields a 4.0$\sigma$ improvement over the mass-step model. We trace the difference in reported findings to the fitting and analysis methods, in particular the model complexity allowed for the color-luminosity relation, rather than a difference in the sample itself.

 - **Abstract**
 Young supernova remnants (SNRs) provide crucial insights into explosive nucleosynthesis products and their velocity distribution soon after the explosion. However, these velocities are influenced by the dynamics of the circumstellar medium (CSM), which originates from the progenitor's late-phase mass loss. Cas A, the youngest known Galactic core-collapse SNR, was studied to analyze the spatial distribution of Si and S radial velocities using two high-spectral resolution observations from the XRISM-Resolve imaging this http URL's capabilities enabled the detailed characterization of Si XIII, Si XIV, S XV, and S XVI lines, whose line shapes can be resolved and modeled using Gaussian radial-velocity components. The radial velocities measured generally align with previous CCD-based results, confirming that they were not artifacts caused by blended lines or ionization variations. Modeling line profiles with two-component Gaussians improved fits in some regions, revealing distinct redshifted (backside) and blueshifted (frontside) components only in a few specific areas. In most regions, however, both components were either both redshifted (northwest) or both blueshifted (southeast), consistent with the patchy ejecta shell morphology seen in optically emitting fast-moving knots. The individual line components revealed a line broadening ranging from $\sigma_v \approx 200$ to $\sigma_v \approx 2000$ km/s. Components with $1000 \lesssim \sigma_v \lesssim 2000$km/s are consistent with previously determined reverse shock velocities, suggesting non-equilibrated or partially equilibrated ion temperatures. Narrow components with small radial velocities found near Cas A's projected center likely originate from shocked CSM plasma. But the low radial velocity and small $\sigma_v$ defies identifying these components with either the frontside or backside of the SNR, or both.

 - **Abstract**
 After its discovery in 2016, the white dwarf binary AR Scorpii (AR Sco) remained for several years the only white dwarf system to show pulsed radio emission associated with a fast-spinning white dwarf. The evolutionary origin and the emission mechanism for AR Sco are not completely understood, with different models proposed. Testing and improving these models requires observational input. Here we report the results of a targeted search for other binary white dwarf pulsars like AR Sco. Using data from Gaia and WISE, we identified 56 candidate systems with similar properties to AR Sco, of which 26 were previously uncharacterised. These were subject to spectroscopic and photometric follow-up observations. Aside from one new binary white dwarf pulsar found, J191213.72-441045.1, which was reported in a separate work, we find no other systems whose characteristics are akin to AR Sco. The newly characterised systems are primarily young stellar objects (with 10 found) or cataclysmic variables (7 identifications), with the remaining being either blended or non-variable on short timescales.

 - **Abstract**
 We present analysis of the plateau and late-time phase properties of a sample of 39 Type II supernovae (SNe II) that show narrow, transient, high-ionization emission lines (i.e., "IIn-like") in their early-time spectra from interaction with confined, dense circumstellar material (CSM). Originally presented by Jacobson-Galán et al 2024a, this sample also includes multicolor light curves and spectra extending to late-time phases of 35 SNe with no evidence for IIn-like features at <2 days after first light. We measure photospheric phase light-curve properties for the distance-corrected sample and find that SNe II with IIn-like features have significantly higher luminosities and decline rates at +50 days than the comparison sample, which could be connected to inflated progenitor radii, lower ejecta mass, and/or persistent CSM interaction. However, we find no statistical evidence that the measured plateau durations and $^{56}$Ni masses of SNe II with and without IIn-like features arise from different distributions. We estimate progenitor zero-age main sequence (ZAMS) masses for all SNe with nebular spectroscopy through spectral model comparisons and find that most objects, both with and without IIn-like features, are consistent with progenitor masses <12.5 M$_{\odot}$. Combining progenitor ZAMS masses with CSM densities inferred from early-time spectra suggests multiple channels for enhanced mass loss in the final years before core collapse such as a convection-driven chromosphere or binary interaction. Finally, we find spectroscopic evidence for ongoing ejecta-CSM interaction at radii $>10^{16}$ cm, consistent with substantial progenitor mass-loss rates of $\sim 10^{-4}$--$10^{-5}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ ($v_w < 50$ km/s) in the final centuries to millennia before explosion.

 - **Abstract**
 Accretion rates from protoplanetary disks onto forming stars are a key ingredient in star formation and protoplanetary disk evolution. Extensive efforts surveying individual star forming regions with spectroscopy and narrow-band photometry have been performed to derive accretion rates on large populations of young stellar objects (YSOs). We use Gaia DR3 XP spectra to perform the first all-sky homogeneous analysis of YSO accretion within 500 pc. We characterise the H$\alpha$ line emission of YSOs by using the H$\alpha$ pseudo-equivalent widths and XP spectra from Gaia DR3. We derive accretion luminosities, mass accretion rates and stellar parameters for 145 975 candidate YSO H$\alpha$ emitters all-sky. We describe filtering strategies to select specific sub-samples of YSOs from this catalogue. We identify a large population of low-accreting YSO candidates untraced by previous surveys. The population of low accreting YSOs is mostly spatially dispersed, away from star forming regions or more clustered environments of star formation. Many YSOs appear disconnected from young populations, reminiscent of 'Peter Pan' YSOs. We find $L_{acc}\propto L_\star^{1.41\pm0.02}$ and $\dot M_{acc}\propto M_\star^{2.4\pm0.1}$ for the purest all-sky sample of YSO candidates. By fitting an exponential to the fraction of accreting stars in clusters of different ages in the Sco-Cen complex, we obtain an accretion timescale of 2.7$\pm$0.4 Myr. The percentage of accretors found by fitting a power-law is 70% at 2 Myr and 2.8% at 10 Myr. With this new catalogue of H$\alpha$ emitters we significantly increase the number of YSO candidates with accretion rate estimations in the local neighbourhood. This allows us to study accretion timescales and the spatial and physical properties of YSO accretion from a large, all-sky, and homogeneous sample for the first time. [abridged]

 - **Abstract**
 We present an analysis of the H$\alpha$-emitting ionized gas in the warm phase of the NGC 253 outflow using integral field spectroscopy from the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE). In each spaxel, we decompose H$\alpha$, [N II], and [S II] emission lines into a system of up to 3 Gaussian components, accounting for the velocity contributions due to the disk and both intercepted walls of an outflow cone. In the approaching southern lobe of the outflow, we find maximum deprojected outflow velocities down to ~ -500 km/s. Velocity gradients of this outflowing gas range from ~ -350 to -550 km/s/kpc with increasing distance from the nucleus. Additionally, [N II]/H$\alpha$ and [S II]/H$\alpha$ integrated line ratios are suggestive of shocks as the dominant ionization source throughout the wind. Electron densities, inferred from the [S II] doublet, peak at 2100 cm$^{-3}$ near the nucleus and reach $\lesssim 50 $cm$^{-3}$ in the wind. Finally, at an uncertainty of 0.3 dex on the inferred mass of $4\times10^{5}$ M$_{\odot}$, the mass-outflow rate of the H$\alpha$-emitting gas in the southern outflow lobe is ~ 0.4 M$_{\odot}$/year. This yields a mass-loading factor of $\eta$ ~ 0.1 and a ~ 2% starburst energy efficiency.

 - **Abstract**
 We revisit the problem of the capture of a primordial black hole (PBH) by a neutron star, accounting for the tidal perturbation from a nearby star or planet. For asteroid-mass PBHs, which could constitute all of the dark matter in the universe, a weakly bound post-capture orbit could be tidally disturbed to the point of preventing the PBH from settling in the neutron star and consuming it within a cosmologically short timescale. We show how this effect depends on environmental parameters and can weaken the proposed constraints based on observations of old neutron stars in high-density dark matter environments for PBH masses $\lesssim 10^{22}\,$g. We also provide approximate analytical formulae for the capture rates.

 - **Abstract**
 The cosmological redshift drift promises to be the first observable directly measuring the cosmic expansion rate and should be detectable with upcoming surveys by the Square Kilometre Array and the Extremely Large Telescope. To prepare for these upcoming measurements we study the redshift drift in detail using the relativistic N-body code $\texttt{gevolution}$ focusing on inhomogeneity-induced fluctuations. Using a ray-tracer, we calculate the redshift drift directly from the light cone at two different time steps. To investigate observer-dependent biases we consider 10 different observers. We find that inhomogeneity-induced fluctuations in the redshift drift can in extreme cases be of the same order as the cosmic signal for $z\lesssim0.15$. By comparing our results to first-order perturbation theory, we find that the extreme outliers are due to peculiar motion in over-densities and can be described by first-order perturbation theory to percent precision. We calculate angular power spectra that fit very well with our theoretical predictions based on perturbation theory at linear scales and show a surprisingly large non-linear signal. This shows that redshift drift not only has the power to measure the background expansion, but could also deliver information about the velocity and acceleration fields in clusters.

          First Detection of Molecular Activity in the Largest Known Oort Cloud Comet: ALMA Imaging of C/2014 UN271 (Bernardinelli-Bernstein) at 16.6 au from the Sun

 - **Abstract**
 We report observations of comet C/2014 UN271 (Bernardinelli-Bernstein) carried out on UT 2024 March 8 and 17 at a heliocentric distance ($r_{\mathrm{H}}$) of 16.6 au using the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA). The CO ($J$=2-1) line at 230 GHz was detected along with continuum emission from its dust coma and large ($\sim$140 km) nucleus, revealing the nature of the activity drivers and outgassing kinematics of the largest Oort cloud comet discovered to date. This work presents spectrally integrated flux maps, autocorrelation spectra, production rates, and parent scale lengths for CO and a stringent upper limit for the H$_2$CO production rate. CO outgassing displays multiple active jets which evolve from one epoch to the next. The continuum emission is compact and spatially unresolved, and is consistent with thermal emission from the large nucleus and a tentative detection of a dust coma. Complementary optical observations provided activity context for the ALMA epochs, indicating that UN271 underwent an outburst in late February before returning to a quiescent brightness in mid--late March. These results represent the first secure detection of molecular activity reported in the literature for C/2014 UN271 and highlight the dynamic nature of this distantly active small world.

 - **Abstract**
 Double Neutron Stars (DNSs) are unique probes to study various aspects of modern astrophysics. Recent discoveries have confirmed direct connections between DNSs and supernova explosions. This provides valuable information about the evolutionary history of these systems, especially regarding whether the second-born Neutron Star (NS) originated from either a Core-Collapse ($CC$) or Electron-Capture Supernovae ($ECSNe$) event. The provided scale diagram illustrates the distribution of different types of DNSs on the basis of their orbital parameters and other factors, including mass loss. As a result, the physical processes in DNSs vary depending on the formation mechanisms of the second-born NS and characteristics of the systems. $ECSNe$ processes are typically associated with merging systems ($e\times{P_{orb}}< 0.05$), while $CC$ processes are more commonly linked to non-merging systems ($e\times{P_{orb}}> 0.05$). Our results suggest a critical mass threshold of 1.30$M_\odot \pm 0.22M_\odot$ (critical value) for the $ECSNe$ process to form an NS, while $CC$ processes might occur at higher masses. Examining the orbital parameters of DNSs in a known gravitational potential can enhance our understanding of the theoretical predictions for DNS progenitor characteristics. It turns out that the $ECSNe$ process predominantly produces DNS systems with short orbital ($P_{orb} \leq 0.25 d$), nearly circular orbits ($e\simeq 0.2$), accompanied by minimal kick velocities imparted on the proto-NS and significant mass loss. In contrast, their orbital dynamics in a known gravitational potential plays a crucial role in enhancing our understanding of the SNe geometry and the formation and evolution processes among different NS samples.

          Data-driven radiative hydrodynamics simulations of the solar photosphere using physics-informed neural networks: proof of concept

 - **Abstract**
 Current, realistic numerical simulations of the solar atmosphere reproduce observations in a statistical sense; they do not replicate observations such as a movie of solar granulation. Inversions on the other hand reproduce observations by design, but the resulting models are often not physically self-consistent. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) offer a new approach to solving the time-dependent radiative hydrodynamics equations and matching observations as boundary conditions. PINNs approximate the solution of the integro-differential equations with a deep neural network. The parameters of this network are determined by minimizing the residuals with respect to the physics equations and the observations. The resulting models are continuous in all dimensions, can zoom into local areas of interest in space and time, and provide information on physical parameters that are not necessarily directly observed such as horizontal velocities. Here we present the first proof of concept of this novel approach, explain the underlying methodology in detail, and provide an outlook to the many applications that PINNs enable.

 - **Abstract**
 Given the incomplete sampling of spatial frequencies by radio interferometers, achieving precise restoration of astrophysical information remains challenging. To address this ill-posed problem, compressive sensing(CS) provides a robust framework for stable and unique recovery of sky brightness distributions in noisy environments, contingent upon satisfying specific conditions. We explore the applicability of CS theory and find that for radio interferometric telescopes, the conditions can be simplified to sparse representation. {Building on this insight, we develop a deep dictionary (realized through a convolutional neural network), which is designed to be multi-resolution and overcomplete, to achieve sparse representation and integrate it within the CS framework. The resulting method is a novel, fully interpretable unsupervised learning approach that combines} the mathematical rigor of CS with the expressive power of deep neural networks, effectively bridging the gap between deep learning and classical dictionary methods. {During the deconvolution process, the model image and the deep dictionary are updated alternatively.} This approach enables efficient and accurate recovery of extended sources with complex morphologies from noisy measurements. Comparative analyses with state-of-the-art algorithms demonstrate the outstanding performance of our method, i.e., achieving a dynamic range (DR) nearly 45 to 100 times higher than that of multiscale CLEAN (MS-CLEAN).

 - **Abstract**
 Because Cepheid variable stars have long been used as a cosmic benchmark, the accuracy of stellar evolution models for Cepheids have wide-reaching effects. Our goal is to provide a detailed multi-dimensional picture of hydrodynamic convection and convective boundary mixing in the interior of Cepheids. We perform 2D hydrodynamic simulations of six stars with the fully compressible Multidimensional Stellar Implicit Code (MUSIC). Our simulations do not model the radial pulsations but focus on the interior structure of Cepheids, which involves an interior convective shell and a convective envelope. We develop a new statistical analysis to examine overshooting in this inner convection zone. Using the extreme value theory, we find that overshooting above the convective shell fills the space between these convectively unstable layers. We develop a new statistical analysis that provides a clearer picture of how overshooting fills this layer, and also allows us to formulate a detailed comparison between overshooting above and below the convective shell. Our analysis effectively decomposes the overshooting layer into two layers: a weak and a strong overshooting layer. Statistically, this is accomplished by decomposing the strongly non-Gaussian probability density function into a mixture of Gamma distributions. Using our mixture model, we show that the ratio of overshooting lengths above and below the convective shell depends directly on the radial extent of the convective shell as well as its depth in the star. We propose a new form for the diffusion coefficient, which addresses the need for overlapping overshooting layers between convective shells. We introduce the idea of super-mixing layer where overshooting from both the convective shell and the convective envelope results in efficient mixing and could be viewed as merging the two adjacent convective zones.

 - **Abstract**
 The gamma-ray burst (GRB) GRB 211211A and GRB 060614, believed to originate from the merger of compact objects, exhibit similarities to the jetted tidal disruption event (TDE) Sw J1644+57, by showing violent variabilities in the light-curve during the decay phase. Previous studies suggest that such fluctuations in TDE may arise from the fallback of tidal disrupted debris. In this paper, we introduce the fluctuations of the mass distribution ${\rm d}M/{\rm d}E$ for the debris ejected during the tidal disruption (with energy $E$) and study their impact on jet power. Turbulence induced by tidal force and the self-gravity of the debris may imprint variabilities in ${\rm d}M/{\rm d}E$ during fallback. We model these fluctuations with a power density spectrum $\propto f_{\rm E}^{\beta}$, where $f_{\rm E} = 1/E$ and $\beta$ is the power-law index. We find that the resulting light curve can preserve the fluctuation characteristics from ${\rm d}M/{\rm d}E$. In addition, the observed fluctuations in the light-curves can be reproduced for a given suitable $\beta$. Based on the observations, we find that the value of $\beta$ should be around $-1$.

          On the polarimetric response of the Nançay Radio Telescope and its impact on precision pulsar timing

 - **Abstract**
 In \citet{Guillemot2023} we presented a new method for calibrating pulsar observations conducted with the Nançay decimetric Radio Telescope (NRT), which significantly improved NRT polarimetric measurements and pulsar timing quality for data taken after this method was developed, in November 2019. Results hinted at a dependence of the polarimetric response of the NRT on the observed direction. We investigated this potential dependence, since unaccounted variations of the instrumental response could degrade polarimetric measurements. Additionally, we aimed to develop a method for properly calibrating NRT pulsar observations conducted before November 2019. We conducted three series of observations of bright pulsars over wide declination ranges, in a special observation mode in which the feed horn rotates by $\sim$ 180$^\circ$ degrees across the observation, enabling us to determine the full polarimetric response of the NRT while modeling potential variations of calibration parameters with hour angle and declination. In addition, we used the METM technique to improve the calibration of pre-November 2019 data. From the analysis of the series of observations of bright pulsars with horn rotation, we found that the polarimetric response of the NRT does not appear to vary with hour angle or declination. On the other hand, the new METM-based calibration method appears to significantly improve the calibration of pre-November 2019 data. By analyzing NRT data on a selection of millisecond pulsars we found that the new polarimetric profiles are more homogeneous, they generally have larger signal-to-noise ratios, and found that the TOA data for these MSPs are more accurate and contain lower levels of noise, especially when combining the new calibration method with the \textit{Matrix Template Matching} (MTM) method for extracting TOAs from pulsar observations.

 Using data from the SRG/eROSITA all-sky X-ray survey and the GAIA-based catalog of 2,209 members of the Pleiades open star cluster, we found 850 X-ray sources associated with the cluster stars. Over 650 of them were detected in X-rays for the first time. At the distance of the Pleiades, the nominal sensitivity of eROSITA corresponds to a luminosity of $L_X \sim 1.6 \cdot 10^{28}$ erg/s in the 0.3-2.3 keV band. The eROSITA sources associated with Pleiades stars have a total luminosity of $L_{X,tot} \sim 1.3 \cdot 10^{32}$ erg/s , a million times greater than the X-ray luminosity of the quiet Sun. Strong X-ray variability, more than 10 times, was recorded for 27 sources. Most of them are known as eruptive optical variables of the dM class. The value of $R_X=log(L_X/L_{bol})$ increases with decreasing effective temperature of the star from $R_X\approx -5$ to $R_X\approx -2$. The distribution of stars over $R_X$ is bimodal, with the left peak at $R_X\sim-4.3$ being formed by stars of FGK classes, and the right peak at $R_X\sim-3.1$ being mainly populated by M-stars. The relation between $R_X$ and the Rossby number $Ro$ depends on the spectral class. For K- and M- stars, at low Rossby numbers $R_X\sim -3$ and depends weakly on $Ro$. At $Ro \gt 0.25$, a rapid drop in $R_X$ is observed for K stars, while in our sample there are no M stars with large Rossby number. Most of F- and G- stars appear to have smaller $R_X\sim -4.5$, however, our sample size is insufficient for a more detailed characterization of their $R_X-Ro$ dependence.

 - **Abstract**
 We employed the Fast Folding Algorithm (FFA) on L-Band Globular Cluster (GC) observations taken with Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) to search for new pulsars, especially those with a long rotational period. We conducted a search across 16 GCs that collectively host 93 known pulsars, as well as 14 GCs that do not contain any known pulsars. The majority of these known pulsars were successfully re-detected in our survey. The few non-detections could be attributed to the high accelerations of these pulsars. Additionally, we have discovered a new binary millisecond pulsar, namely M13I (or PSR J1641+3627I) in GC M13 (or NGC 6205), and obtained its phase-coherent timing solution using observations spanning 6 years. M13I has a spin period of 6.37 ms, and an orbital period of 18.23 days. The eccentricity of the binary orbit is 0.064, with a companion mass range of approximately 0.45 to 1.37 M$_{\odot}$. The orbital properties of M13I are remarkably different from those of the other known pulsars in M13, indicating that this pulsar has undergone a different evolutionary path compared to the rest.

 - **Abstract**
 Metal-poor stars are a rare and ancient type of stars; Carbon-Enhanced Metal-Poor (CEMP) stars are a subset of these celestial bodies that show an enrichment of carbon relative to iron. They are believed to be formed from gas polluted by the first generation of stars after the Big Bang and are important objects for studying the early universe, galaxy evolution, and nucleosynthesis. Due to their rarity, the search for metal-poor stars and CEMP stars is a valuable task. This study investigates the search for CEMP stars based on the low-resolution stellar spectra from LAMOST DR8, and proposes a deep learning scheme. From the LAMOST DR8 spectral library, this work discovered 12,766 CEMP star candidates. For ease of reference and use, we provide the estimated parameters $T_\texttt{eff}$, $\log~g$, [Fe/H] and [C/H] for them.

 - **Abstract**
 Swift J1727.8-1613 went into outburst in August 2023 and was one of the brightest black hole X-ray binaries (BHXRBs) in recent years, leading to extensive observing campaigns by NICER and Insight-HXMT. The source exhibited strong X-ray variability and showed type-C quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) on a wide range of frequencies. The high data quality over a broad range of X-ray energies (0.5-150 keV) enables us to study the energy-dependence of the QPO waveform and the phase lags at the QPO fundamental and second harmonic frequencies. Using the biphase, we find that the QPO waveform is strongly energy-dependent, with energy bands below and above 15-20 keV showing opposite waveform evolution. We interpret the energy-dependence of the waveform as being due to a pivoting spectral component at the second harmonic frequency, with a pivot energy around 15-20 keV. Using the cross-spectrum, we find that the phase lags between energy bands above 7 keV at the QPO fundamental are small, while those at the harmonic frequency are dominated by a separate lag component that extends over a broader range of frequencies and relates to the broadband noise variability. Comparing the energy-dependent results obtained with the bispectrum and the cross-spectrum, we show that these two Fourier products extract different variability components, e.g. the QPO and the broadband noise, at the same frequencies. Finally, we compare Swift J1727.8-1613 to BHXRB MAXI J1535-571 and find that their spectral-timing properties are similar, indicating that these QPO properties may represent a subset of sources.

 - **Abstract**
 EXO 2030+375 is a peculiar high-mass X-ray binary that has been exhibiting Type-I outburst activities consistently over the past decades. The phases of outburst peaks are generally stable and occur near the orbital this http URL, significant orbital phase shifts have occasionally been observed in 1995, 2006, and 2016. In this paper, we report another orbital phase shift triggered by a giant outburst in 2021. During this event, the orbital phase of Type-I outburst peaks changed dramatically, moving from near periastron to 20 days after periastron, followed by a gradual recovery. Additionally, for several cycles after the 2021 giant outburst, some Type-I outbursts were missing, with subsequent outbursts occurring every two orbits. We discuss our observations in the frame of the precession of an eccentric Be disk.

 - **Abstract**
 Published radial velocity (RV) measurements of the K giant star 42 Dra reveal variations consistent with a 3.9 M_Jup mass companion in a 479-d orbit. This exoplanet can be confirmed if these variations are long-lived and coherent. Continued monitoring may also reveal other companions. We have acquired additional RV measurements of 42 Dra spanning fifteen years. Periodogram analyses were used to investigate the stability of the planet RV signal. We also investigated variations in the spectral line shapes using the bisector velocity span as well as infrared photometry from the COBE mission. The new RV measurements do not follow the published planet orbit. An orbital solution using the 2004 - 2011 data yields a period and eccentricity consistent with the published values, but the RV amplitude has decreased by a factor of four from the earlier measurements. Including some additional RV measurements taken between 2014 and 2018 reveal the presence of a second period at 530 d. The beating of this period with the one at 479-d may account for the observed amplitude variations. The planet hypothesis is conclusively ruled out by COBE/DIRBE 1.25 micron photometry that shows variations with the planet orbital period as well as an additional 170 d period. The amplitude variations in the RV as well the COBE/DIRBE photometry firmly establish that there is no giant planet around 42 Dra. The presence of multi-periodic variations suggests that these may be stellar oscillations, most likely oscillatory convection modes. These oscillations may account for some of the long period RV variations attributed to planets around K giant stars. This may skew the statistics of planet occurrence around intermediate mass stars. Long-term monitoring with excellent sampling is required to exclude amplitude variations in the long-periods found in radial velocity of K giant stars.

 - **Abstract**
 The ionized interstellar medium disperses pulsar radio signals, resulting in a stochastic time-variable delay known as the dispersion measure (DM) noise. In the wideband paradigm of pulsar timing, we measure a DM together with a time of arrival from a pulsar observation to handle frequency-dependent profile evolution, interstellar scintillation, and radio frequency interference more robustly, and to reduce data volumes. In this paper, we derive a method to incorporate arbitrary models of DM variation, including Gaussian process models, in pulsar timing and noise analysis and pulsar timing array analysis. This generalizes the existing method for handling DM noise in wideband datasets.

 - **Abstract**
 We design an uncertainty-aware cost-sensitive neural network (UA-CSNet) to estimate metallicities from dereddened and corrected Gaia BP/RP (XP) spectra for giant stars. This method accounts for both stochastic errors in the input spectra and the imbalanced density distribution in [Fe/H] values. With a specialized architecture and training strategy, the UA-CSNet improves the precision of the predicted metallicities, especially for very metal-poor (VMP; $\rm [Fe/H] \leq -2.0$) stars. With the PASTEL catalog as the training sample, our model can estimate metallicities down to $\rm [Fe/H] \sim -4$. We compare our estimates with a number of external catalogs and conduct tests using star clusters, finding overall good agreement. We also confirm that our estimates for VMP stars are unaffected by carbon enhancement. Applying the UA-CSNet, we obtain reliable and precise metallicity estimates for approximately 20 million giant stars, including 360,000 VMP stars and 50,000 extremely metal-poor (EMP; $\rm [Fe/H] \leq -3.0$) stars. The resulting catalog is publicly available at this https URL. This work highlights the potential of low-resolution spectra for metallicity estimation and provides a valuable dataset for studying the formation and chemo-dynamical evolution of our Galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) is a network of antennas across the globe currently used to image super-massive black holes (SMBHs) at a frequency of 230 GHz. Since the release of the image of M87$^\ast$ in 2019 and, subsequently, that of Sgr A$^\ast$ in 2022 by the EHT collaboration, the focus has shifted to dynamically imaging SMBHs. This has led to a search for potential sites to extend and fill in the gaps within the EHT network. The Gamsberg Mountain and the H.E.S.S. site are both located within the Khomas highlands and have been identified as potential sites for the Africa Millimetre Telescope (AMT). Precipitable water vapour (PWV) in the atmosphere is the main source of opacity and noise from atmospheric emissions when observing at millimetre to sub-millimetre wavelengths. This study aims to establish the PWV content and the atmospheric transmission at 86, 230, and 345 GHz at the AMT potential sites using Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) derived PWV data. Results show both sites have potential for observations at 86 and 230 GHz, with 345 GHz possible at the Gamsberg Mountain during winter. The overall median PWV of 14.27 mm and 9.25 mm was calculated at the H.E.S.S. site and the Gamsberg Mountain, respectively. The EHT window had PWV medians of 16.62 mm and 11.20 mm at the H.E.S.S. site and Gamsberg Mountain, respectively. Among the two sites, the Gamsberg Mountain had the lowest PWV conditions, therefore making it the most suitable site for the AMT.

 - **Abstract**
 The High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) site and the Gamsberg Mountain have been identified as potential sites for the Africa Millimetre Telescope (AMT). The AMT is poised to observe at millimetre and possibly at submillimetre wavelengths. At these wavelengths, precipitable water vapour (PWV) in the atmosphere is the main source of opacity during observations and therefore needs to be accurately assessed at the potential sites for the AMT. In order to investigate the PWV conditions for the AMT, identical Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) stations were installed and used to assess the PWV at the two potential sites. In this study, the accuracy of those PWV measurements by the GNSS stations was assessed by comparing the H.E.S.S. installed GNSS station PWV measurements to that from a 210 GHz Water Vapour Radiometer (WVR) also installed at the H.E.S.S. site. A correlation of 98% and an offset of 0.34 mm was found between the GNSS station and the 210 GHz WVR PWV data when on-site pressure and the Nevada Geodetic Laboratory (NGL) weighted mean temperature ($\mathrm{T_m}$) were used calculate the GNSS station PWV data. In comparison, the offset reduces to 0.15 mm when on-site derived $\mathrm{T_m}$ and pressure were used to calculate the GNSS station PWV. The results show that the GNSS station with on-site meteorological data can be used with high accuracy to reliably determine the PWV conditions at the H.E.S.S. site.

 - **Abstract**
 The ACT data shows an enhancement in the value of the scalar spectral index, as $n_s = 0.9743 \pm 0.0034$, leading to disfavoring many inflationary models, including the Starobinsky model. To satisfy the constraint made by ACT, we will investigate the Starobinsky potential within the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet(EGB) gravity theory. EGB gravity is motivated by the higher-dimensional theory, which includes quadratic curvature correction terms and a coupling between the scalar field and the GB term that modifies the dynamical equations. The model is considered by using the slow-roll approximation method and the exact numerical approach for two different coupling functions. The results indicate that the model is in good agreement with the data and the results stand in $1\sigma$ of the ACT $r-n_s$ plane. Considering the running of the scalar spectral index also implies the consistency of the model with data. In addition, the parametric space of the free parameters of the EGB coupling is explored, where we find the acceptable region of the parameters in which the resulting $n_s$ and $r$ stay in $1\sigma$ of the ACT data. Next, the reheating phase is considered. It is determined that the model can simultaneously satisfy the constraint of ACT data and the reheating temperature constraints.

 We present the combined 2.5$-$30$\mu$m spectra of four protostars acquired with the infrared camera and the infrared spectrograph on board the AKARI and Spitzer space telescopes, respectively. To analyze the ice absorption features in the 8$-$22$\mu$m, we first performed a continuum determination process on mid-infrared spectra and applied a method to subtract the silicate absorption. We conducted a global fitting process to the absorption features in the combined infrared spectra using the experimental ice absorbance data to identify the intrinsic absorption of each ice component. We first derived the H$_{2}$O ice column densities of both stretch and libration modes at 3.05$\mu$m and 13.6$\mu$m simultaneously. We also identified the absorption features containing NH$_{3}$, CH$_{3}$OH, CO$_{2}$, and CO and decomposed their mixed components and compared their ice abundances at different evolutionary stages of the protostars. We explored possible absorptions of the organic ice species such as HCOOH, CH$_{3}$CHO, and CH$_{3}$CH$_{2}$OH in the mid-infrared ranges. The ice analysis method developed in this study can be applied to the ice spectra obtained by the James Webb Space Telescope.

 - **Abstract**
 X-Ray Flashes (XRFs) are fast X-ray transients discovered by the BeppoSAX satellite, showing an isotropic sky distribution and a prompt emission duration between 10-1000 seconds. The observed prompt X-ray spectrum is similar to Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs), but with a softer peak energy of the spectrum. Several pieces of evidence indicate that XRFs are connected to GRBs and likely represent their softer analogues, but their origin is still unclear. Several models have been proposed to explain the observed properties of XRF, mostly in the context of collapsar scenario, similar to GRBs but with different geometrical or physical conditions of the progenitor. These include off-axis GRBs and baryon-loaded explosions, that either produce a low Lorentz factor jet or a spherical mildly (or non-) relativistic ejecta, known as cocoons. In this paper, we present multi-wavelength observations of the afterglow of EP241021a, a soft X-ray transient detected by EP, consistent with being an XRF. We present the results of our multiwavelength campaign from radio (uGMRT, ATCA, e-MERLIN, ALMA), optical (LBT, GTC, CAHA) and X-rays (EP-FXT). EP241021a afterglow is characterized by multiple components. They represent the imprints of the interaction of a jet with the complex environment of the pre-existing progenitor, that is likely shaping its structure from a highly relativistic narrow cone to much broader and mildly relativistic cocoon components.

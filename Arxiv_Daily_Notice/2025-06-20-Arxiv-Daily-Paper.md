          Astronomical Cardiology: A Search For Heartbeat Stars Using $\textit{Gaia}$ and $\textit{TESS}$

 - **Abstract**
 Heartbeat stars are a subclass of binary stars with short periods, high eccentricities, and phase-folded light curves that resemble an electrocardiogram. We start from the $\textit{Gaia}$ catalogs of spectroscopic binaries and use $\textit{TESS}$ photometry to identify 112 new heartbeat star systems. We fit their phase-folded light curves with an analytic model to measure their orbital periods, eccentricities, inclinations, and arguments of periastron. We then compare these orbital parameters to the $\textit{Gaia}$ spectroscopic orbital solution. Our periods and eccentricities are consistent with the $\textit{Gaia}$ solutions for 85$\%$ of the single-line spectroscopic binaries but only 20$\%$ of the double-line spectroscopic binaries. For the two double-line spectroscopic binary heartbeat stars with consistent orbits, we combine the $\textit{TESS}$ phase-folded light curve and the $\textit{Gaia}$ velocity semi-amplitudes to measure the stellar masses and radii with $\texttt{PHOEBE}$. In a statistical analysis of the HB population, we find that non-giant heartbeat stars have evolved off the main sequence and that their fractional abundance rises rapidly with effective temperature.

 - **Abstract**
 Revealing the nature of the nanoHz gravitational wave (GW) signal recently reported by Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) collaborations around the world is the next goal of low-frequency GW astronomy. The signal likely originates from the incoherent superposition of GWs emitted by a cosmological population of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs). Those binaries can be highly eccentric and/or strongly coupled to their nuclear environment, resulting in an attenuation of the overall GW signal at low frequencies. In this paper, we propose to use the correlation properties of the distributed GW power in the sky across the frequency spectrum as a smoking gun for eccentric SMBHBs thus allowing to break the spectral degeneracy between eccentricity and environmental effect. The simple underlying idea is that, contrary to circular binaries, eccentric ones emit a broadband spectrum thus resulting in similar sky maps at different frequencies. We first demonstrate the applicability of this simple concept on sky maps constructed directly from the theoretical sky distribution of the GWB power induced by realistic populations of SMBHBs. We then demonstrate the viability of this analysis on simulated SKA-like PTA data. By statistically comparing sky maps reconstructed from hundreds injected circular and highly eccentric SMBHB populations, we find that eccentricity can be detected at $3\sigma$ in more than $50\%$ of cases.

          A NICER view of the 1.4 solar-mass edge-on pulsar PSR J0614--3329

 - **Abstract**
 Four neutron star radius measurements have already been obtained by modeling the X-ray pulses of rotation-powered millisecond pulsars observed by the Neutron Star Interior Composition ExploreR (NICER). We report here the radius measurement of PSR J0614$-$3329 employing the same method with NICER and XMM-Newton data using Bayesian Inference. For all different models tested, including one with unrestricted inclination prior, we retrieve very similar non-antipodal hot regions geometries and radii. For the preferred model, we infer an equatorial radius of $R_{\rm eq}=10.29^{+1.01}_{-0.86}\,$km for a mass of $M=1.44^{+0.06}_{-0.07} \, M_{\odot}$ (median values with equal-tailed $68\%$ credible interval), the latter being essentially constrained from radio timing priors obtained by MeerKAT. We find that, for all different models, the pulse emission originates from two hot regions, one at the pole and the other at the equator. The resulting radius constraint is consistent with previous X-ray and gravitational wave measurements of neutron stars in the same mass range. Equation of state inferences, including previous NICER and gravitational wave results, slightly soften the equation of state with PSR J0614$-$3329 included and shift the allowed mass-radius region toward lower radii by $\sim 300\,$m.

 - **Abstract**
 NGC 253, the Sculptor galaxy, is the southern, massive, star-forming disk galaxy closest to the Milky Way. In this work, we present a new 103-pointing MUSE mosaic of this galaxy covering the majority of its star-forming disk up to 0.75xR25. With an area of ~20x5 arcmin2 (~20x5 kpc2, projected) and a physical resolution of ~15 pc, this mosaic constitutes one of the largest, highest physical resolution integral field spectroscopy surveys of any star-forming galaxy to date. Here, we exploit the mosaic to identify a sample of ~500 planetary nebulae (~20 times larger than in previous studies) to build the planetary nebula luminosity function (PNLF) and obtain a new estimate of the distance to NGC 253. The value obtained is 17% higher than estimates returned by other reliable measurements, mainly obtained via the top of the red giant branch method (TRGB). The PNLF also varies between the centre (r < 4 kpc) and the disk of the galaxy. The distance derived from the PNLF of the outer disk is comparable to that of the full sample, while the PNLF of the centre returns a distance ~0.9 Mpc larger. Our analysis suggests that extinction related to the dust-rich interstellar medium and edge-on view of the galaxy (the average E(B-V) across the disk is ~0.35 mag) plays a major role in explaining both the larger distance recovered from the full PNLF and the difference between the PNLFs in the centre and in the disk.

 - **Abstract**
 A major issue in contemporary cosmology is the persistent discrepancy, known as the Hubble tension, between the Hubble constant ($H_0$) estimates from local measurements and those inferred from early-Universe observations under the standard $\Lambda$ cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) paradigm. Recent advances have identified fast radio bursts (FRBs), a class of extragalactic phenomena observable at considerable redshifts, as a promising observational tool for probing late-time cosmology. In this study, we incorporate two complementary methodologies, machine learning algorithms and Bayesian analysis, on a set of localized FRBs to rigorously test the consistency of the $\Lambda$CDM model at late cosmic epochs. Our results reveal a statistically significant redshift-dependent variation of $H_0$, which contradicts the core postulate of $\Lambda$CDM. We further validate that the redshift dependency of $H_0$ can be removed within the more flexible framework of $w_0w_a$CDM model. These findings highlight that the redshift evolution of $H_0$ is not merely an artifact of the standard model but an indication of a deeper inadequacy in the $\Lambda$CDM model, supporting the need for a more flexible cosmological framework.

 - **Abstract**
 This work revises the Brane World Theory known as Randall-Sundrum with the modification of an exponential, redshift-dependent brane tension. This model is studied in a scenario assuming no dark energy, with the aim of determining whether it can reproduce the universe's acceleration on its own, without the addition of a dark energy fluid. Bayesian statistical analysis is performed in order to constrain the free parameters of each scenario using SLS, SNIa, OHD, and BAO data samples, the last two considering newly added data points. Both Planck and Riess priors for h are used and compared. In both cases, we are able to reproduce the late-time accelerated expansion in agreement with observational data. Interesting consistencies at the transition redshift zt with LCDM are found, suggesting that this might be a suitable model for studying the evolution of the universe up to the present date. However, some pathologies are detected in this model, namely a "Big Rip" divergence of H(z) at z = 1, as well as a strong dependence between the functional form of the brane tension and the future evolution of the universe.

          The Orbit of WASP-4 b is in Decay

 - **Abstract**
 WASP-4 b is a hot Jupiter exhibiting a decreasing orbital period, prompting investigations into potential mechanisms driving its evolution. We analyzed 173 transit light curves, including 37 new observations, and derived mid-transit timings with EXOFAST, forming the most extensive TTV dataset for this system. Adding 58 literature timings and removing unreliable data, we constructed a TTV diagram with 216 points. Our analysis considered linear, quadratic, and apsidal motion models, with the quadratic model proving to be significantly superior in all model comparison statistics. We found no significant periodic signals in the data. The quadratic model allows us to infer a tidal quality factor of Q' ~ 80,000 from the orbital decay rate if this is due to stellar tides. Theoretical considerations indicate that such efficient dissipation is possible due to internal gravity waves in the radiative core of WASP-4, but only in our models with a more evolved host star, possibly near the end of its main-sequence lifetime, and with a larger radius than the observed one. Our main-sequence models produce only about a third of the required dissipation (Q' ~ 200,000 - 500,000). Therefore, the observed orbital decay can only be explained by a slightly larger or more evolved host, resembling the case for WASP-12. Our findings highlight the need for further stellar modeling and improvement in our current understanding of tidal dissipation mechanisms driving orbital decay in close-in exoplanetary systems.

 - **Abstract**
 We use the stellar intensity interferometry system implemented with the Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System (VERITAS) at Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory (FLWO) as a light collector to obtain measurements of the rapid rotator star $\gamma$ Cassiopeiae, at a wavelength of 416 nm. Using data from baselines sampling different position angles, we extract the size, oblateness, and projected orientation of the photosphere. Fitting the data with a uniform ellipse model yields a minor-axis angular diameter of $0.43\pm0.02$ mas, a major-to-minor-radius ratio of $1.28\pm0.04$, and a position angle of $116^\circ\pm5^\circ$ for the axis of rotation. A rapidly-rotating stellar atmosphere model that includes limb and gravity darkening describes the data well with a fitted angular diameter of $0.604^{+0.041}_{-0.034}$ mas corresponding to an equatorial radius of 10.9$^{+0.8}_{-0.6}~R_\odot$, a rotational velocity with a $1~\sigma$ lower limit at $97.7\%$ that of breakup velocity, and a position angle of $114.7^{+6.4}_{-5.7}$ degrees. These parameters are consistent with H$\alpha$ line spectroscopy and infrared-wavelength Michelson interferometric measurements of the star's decretion disk. This is the first measurement of an oblate photosphere using intensity interferometry.

 - **Abstract**
 ASASSN-14ko is a periodically repeating nuclear transient. We conducted high-cadence, multiwavelength observations of this source, revealing several recurrent early bumps and rebrightenings in its UV/optical light curves. The energy released during these bumps and rebrightenings shows a diminishing trend in recent UV/optical outbursts, which we monitored through multiwavelength observations. These features can be ascribed to the interaction between stream debris and the expanded disk in the repeated partial tidal disruption event. The X-ray light curve exhibits an inverse pattern compared to the UV/optical bands, displaying sporadic outbursts. Furthermore, our observations demonstrate that the blackbody temperature and radius in each outburst increase with the UV/optical luminosity, and such evolution resembles that observed in X-ray quasiperiodic eruptions, whereas distinguishing it from typical tidal disruption events.

          Galactic seismology: can the Gaia 'phase spiral' co-exist with a clumpy, turbulent interstellar medium?

 - **Abstract**
 The Gaia satellite revealed a remarkable spiral pattern ('phase spiral', PS) in the z-Vz phase plane throughout the solar neighbourhood, where z and Vz are the displacement and velocity of a star perpendicular to the Galactic plane. As demonstrated by many groups, the kinematic signature reflects the Galactic stellar disc's response to a dynamical disturbance in the recent past (~0.3-3 Gyr). However, previous controlled simulations did not consider the impact of the multiphase interstellar medium (ISM) on the existence of the PS. This is crucial because it has been suggested that this weak signal is highly susceptible to scattering by small-scale density fluctuations typical of the ISM. This has motivated us to explore the formation and fate of the PS in a high-resolution, N-body/hydrodynamical simulation of an idealised Galaxy analogue bearing a realistic ISM, which interacts impulsively with a massive perturber. In our models, high gas surface densities within the disc encourage vigorous star formation, which in turn couples with the gas via feedback to drive turbulence. We find that the PS is almost non-existent if the ISM has an excess of power on sub-kiloparsec scales compared to longer wavelengths. This can happen in the absence of star formation and feedback when the gas is allowed to cool. In the presence of turbulent gas maintained by stellar feedback, the PS has a patchy spatial distribution and a high degree of intermittency on kiloparsec scales. We anticipate that future studies of the phase-spiral behaviour on all scales will provide crucial information on star-gas dynamics.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a high-resolution radio-continuum view and a multi-frequency analysis of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) Supernova Remnant (SNR) J0450.4-7050, which we give the nickname Veliki. These high-resolution observations reveal a larger extent than previously measured, making J0450.4-7050 one of the largest SNRs that we know of. Additionally, we observe a higher than expected radio surface brightness and an unusually flat spectral index ($\alpha = -0.26 \pm 0.02$), with little spectral variation over the remnant. We observe a bright H$\alpha$ shell indicating significant cooling over the remnant, but also an excess of [Oiii] on the eastern shock front. We investigate several theoretical scenarios to explain the emission and radio evolution of J0450.4-7050 in the context of the LMC environment, and determine that this is most likely an older, predominantly radiative, SNR with a higher shock compression ratio, which gives a flatter non-thermal spectrum, in combination with a thermal (bremsstrahlung) emission contribution.

          Soft X-ray line emission from hot gas in intervening galaxy halos and diffuse gas in the cosmic web

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic hot gas emission is closely related to halo gas acquisition and galactic feedback processes. Their X-ray observations reveal important physical properties and movements of the baryonic cycle of galactic ecosystems. However, the measured emissions toward a target at a cosmological distance would always include contributions from hot gases along the entire line of sight to the target. Observationally, such contaminations are routinely subtracted via different strategies. In this work, we aim at answering an interesting theoretical question regarding the amount of soft X-ray line emissions from intervening hot gases of different origins. We tackle this problem with the aid of the TNG100 simulation. We generated typical wide-field lightcone and estimated their impacts on spectral and flux measurements toward X-ray-emitting galaxy-, group- and cluster-halo targets at lower redshifts. We split the intervening hot gases into three categories, that is, the hot gas that is gravitationally bound to either star-forming or quenched galaxy halos, and the diffuse gas which is more tenuously distributed permeating the cosmic web structures. We find that along a given line of sight, the diffuse gas that permeates the cosmic web structures produces strong oxygen and iron line emissions at different redshifts. The diffuse gas emission in the soft X-ray band can be equal to the emission from hot gases that are gravitationally bound to intervening galaxy halos. While the hot gas emission from the quiescent galaxy halos can be significantly less than that from star-forming halos along the line of sight. The fluxes from all of the line-of-sight emitters as measured in the energy band of 0.4--0.85 keV can reach ~20--200 % of the emission from the target galaxy, group, and cluster halos.

          Could We Be Fooled about Phantom Crossing?

 - **Abstract**
 Recent data from DESI Year 2 BAO, Planck CMB, and various supernova compilations suggest a preference for evolving dark energy, with hints that the equation of state may cross the phantom divide line ($w = -1$). While this behavior is seen in both parametric and non-parametric reconstructions, comparing reconstructions that support such behavior (such as the best fit of CPL) with those that maintain $w>-1$ (like the best fit algebraic quintessence) is not straightforward, as they differ in flexibility and structure, and are not necessarily nested within one another. Thus, the question remains as to whether the crossing behavior that we observe, suggested by the data, truly represents a dark energy model that crosses the phantom divide line, or if it could instead be a result of data fluctuations and the way the data are distributed. We investigate the likelihood of this possibility. For this analysis we perform 1,000 Monte Carlo simulations based on a fiducial algebraic quintessence model. We find that in $3.2 \% $ of cases, CPL with phantom crossing not only fits better, but exceeds the real-data $\chi^2$ improvement. This Monte Carlo approach quantifies to what extent statistical fluctuations and the specific distribution of the data could fool us into thinking the phantom divide line is crossed, when it is not. Although evolving dark energy remains a robust signal, and crossing $w=-1$ a viable phenomenological solution that seems to be preferred by the data, its precise behavior requires deeper investigation with more precise data.

 - **Abstract**
 Interstellar complex organic molecules (COMs) in solar-like young stellar objects (YSOs), particularly within protostellar disks, are of significant interest due to their potential connection to prebiotic chemistry in emerging planetary systems. We report the discovery of a rotating feature enriched in COMs, including CH3OH, CH3CHO, and NH2CHO, in the protostellar core G192.12-11.10. By constructing a YSO model, we find that the COM-rich feature is likely located within or near the boundary of the Keplerian disk. The image synthesis results suggest that additional heating mechanisms leading to a warm ring or a warm inner disk are required to reproduce the observed emission. We discuss possible origins of the COM-rich feature, particularly accretion shocks as a plausible cause for a warm ring. Additionally, molecules such as C18O, H2CO, DCS, H2S, and OCS exhibit distinct behavior compared to CH3OH, indicating a range of physical and chemical conditions within the region. The observed kinematics of H2S and OCS suggest that OCS resides in regions closer to the central protostar than H2S, consistent with previous experimental studies.

 - **Abstract**
 Classical novae are common cataclysmic events involving a binary system of a white dwarf and a main sequence or red giant companion star. In metal-poor environments, these explosions produce ejecta different from their solar counterparts due to the accretion of sub-solar metallicity material onto the white dwarf. In particular, it has been suggested that the nucleosynthesis flow in such low-metallicity nova explosions extends up to the Cu-Zn region, much beyond the expected endpoint, around Ca, predicted for solar-metallicity classical novae. This behavior resembles a weak rp-process, and such nuclear activity has never been observed in accreting white dwarf binaries with typical accretion flows. In this work, we study the characteristics of the weak rp-process for four nova models with metallicities $Z= 2\times 10^{-9}$, $10^{-7}$, $2\times 10^{-6}$, and $2\times 10^{-5}$, and explore the impact of the nuclear physics uncertainties via a Monte Carlo sensitivity study. We identify nuclear reactions whose uncertainties affect the production of intermediate-mass nuclei under these conditions. These reactions and relevant nuclear quantities are targets for measurements at stable or radioactive beam facilities to reduce their rate uncertainties.

          Evolutionary models for the Very Massive Stars in the R136 cluster of 30 Doradus in the Large Magellanic Cloud

 - **Abstract**
 The cluster R136 in the LMC contains a population of stars in excess of 100 M$_\odot$, including R136a1, the most massive star known. Very Massive Stars (VMSs) play an influential role in feedback processes and may potentially produce exotic supernova types and black holes of tens of solar masses. The evolutionary history and final fate of the three most luminous stars, R136a1, R136a2, and R136a3, has been a puzzling issue. We aim to resolve this by rotating single-star MESA models. We produce interpolated model grids and apply a Markov-Chain Monte Carlo analysis to compare our models with observations. The nature of supernova progenitors strongly depends on mass loss and the AM coupling schemes. We predict no pair-instability and no GRB progenitors from our fiducial model grid at LMC metallicity. The onset of Wolf-Rayet-type mass-loss rates on the main sequence leads to a rapid decrease in stellar mass and luminosity. The mass turnover implies that the evolutionary history can only be inferred if additional constraints are available. We utilise the surface helium abundance, which poses a conundrum: R136a1, the most luminous star, is less enriched in helium than R136a2 and R136a3. We propose that this can be explained if both R136a2 and R136a3 were initially more massive than R136a1. From a rigorous confrontation of our models to spectroscopically-derived observables, we estimate an initial mass of 346$\pm41$ M$_\odot$ for R136a1, and $\gtrsim$500 M$_\odot$ for R136a2 and R136a3. Even though VMSs are only present in the youngest clusters below 2 Myr of age, our study strengthens their role in local and galaxy evolution. At LMC metallicity, they will be observable as helium-enriched massive stars after their drastic mass loss, produced via single-star evolution. If the core collapse leads to a supernova, it will be of Type Ib/c. [abridged]

 - **Abstract**
 Correlations of fluctuations of the flux in Lyman-$\alpha$ forests of high-redshift quasars have been observed by the Baryonic Acoustic Oscillation Spectroscopy Survey (BOSS) and the Dark Energy Spectroscopy Instrument (DESI) survey where they have revealed the effects of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO). In order to fit the correlation functions to a physical model and thereby constrain cosmological parameters, it is necessary to take into account the effects of fitting the observed spectra to a template about which the fluctuations are measured. In this paper we use mock spectra to test the distortion matrix technique that has been used since the final BOSS data release to appropriately distort the models. We show that while percent-level effects on the derived forest bias parameters may be present, the technique works sufficiently well that the determination of the BAO peak position is not affected at the percent level. We introduce modifications in the technique used by DESI that were not in the original applications and suggest further possibilities for improvements.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. It is crucial to understand the interaction between globular clusters (GCs) and the Oort cloud, as close flybys of such massive objects can significantly disturb the cloud's structure and redirect comets towards the inner Solar System. This increases the risk of impacts on Earth. Studying such events can teach us about the evolution and stability of the Solar System, as well as the effect of external gravitational forces on its dynamics over time. Aims. In our study of the gravitational effects of the flyby of the NGC 7078 or M 15 GC on the Oort cloud, we focus on two types of approximation. First, we investigate the impact on the Sun's orbit during close passages, treating the GC as a point mass. At the second stage, we use a complete N-body system representation of the GC comprising over one million particles. Methods. We carried out a dynamical study of the gravitational interaction between Oort cloud particles and galactic GCs within the time-varying galactic external potential. Initially, the GCs are represented as point masses orbiting the Galaxy alongside the Sun and the Oort cloud system. Results. Our study reveals significant variations in the impact of NGC 7078 on the Oort cloud, depending on whether it is modelled as a point mass or a complete N-body system. The N-body system results in much greater stripping of Oort cloud particles, with over 52% stripped during a close pass, compared to a few percent in the point mass model for a flyby at a large distance (>200 pc) and 36% for a closer 10 pc point mass flyby. The N-body system also causes substantial expansion, with particles spreading over 50 pc from the Sun within 30 Myr after the GC's crossing. This creates a twisted and flattened cloud structure with extended outer tails. These stripped cloud particles (more than 10%) spread across the galaxy, reaching distances of up to 16 kpc from the Sun.

 - **Abstract**
 In the era of JWST, with its unprecedented sensitivity and spectral resolution, infrared spectral surveys have revealed a rich inventory of ices, including complex organic molecules (COMs), in young stellar objects (YSOs). However, robust methods to decompose and quantify these absorption features particularly across broad spectral ranges, are still under investigation. We present INDRA (Ice-fitting with NNLS-based Decomposition and Retrieval Algorithm), a fully Python-based tool that performs continuum and silicate removal, global ice fitting using Weighted Non-Negative Least Squares (NNLS), and estimates column densities and statistical significance. We apply INDRA to NGC 1333 IRAS 2A, a target from the JWST Observations of Young protoStars (JOYS+) program previously studied using local fitting. We derive optical depths via polynomial continuum subtraction and remove silicate absorption using a synthetic model, isolating ice features for global MIRI fitting. Our results are consistent with previous local fits, confirming simple species and COMs, and expand the inventory by identifying additional absorption features from CO2 and NH4+. We also propose the presence of organic refractories contributing up to 9.6% in the spectral region of 5-8 microns among the various ice components, whose inclusion significantly improves the global spectral fitting. These broad absorption features, extending across 5.5-11 microns, are likely produced by large, complex molecules containing carbonyl (C=O), hydroxyl (O-H), amine (N-H), and C-H bending modes. Our expanded inventory, now incorporating these organic residues, offers new insights into the chemical evolution of ices in star-forming regions and highlights the importance of global spectral fitting in constraining ice compositions.

 - **Abstract**
 The standard nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) multi-level radiative transfer problem only takes into account the deviation of the radiation field and atomic populations from their equilibrium distribution. We aim to show how to solve for the full non-LTE (FNLTE) multi-level radiative transfer problem, also accounting for deviation of the velocity distribution of the massive particles from Maxwellian. We considered, as a first step, a three-level atom with zero natural broadening. In this work, we present a new numerical scheme. Its initialisation relies on the classic, multi-level approximate Lambda-iteration (MALI) method for the standard non-LTE problem. The radiative transfer equations, the kinetic equilibrium equations for atomic populations, and the Boltzmann equations for the velocity distribution functions were simultaneously iterated in order to obtain self-consistent particle distributions. During the process, the observer's frame absorption and emission profiles were re-computed at every iterative step by convolving the atomic frame quantities with the relevant velocity distribution function. We validate our numerical strategy by comparing our results with the standard non-LTE solutions in the limit of a two-level atom with Hummer's partial redistribution in frequency, and with a three-level atom with complete redistribution. In this work, we considered the so-called cross-redistribution problem. We then show new FNLTE results for a simple three-level atom while evaluating the assumptions made for the emission and absorption profiles of the standard non-LTE problem with partial and cross-redistribution.

 - **Abstract**
 Accurate distance measurements to supernova remnants (SNRs) are essential for determining their physical parameters, such as size, age, explosion energy, and for constraining the properties of associated neutron stars (NSs). We present an extinction--distance method that combines precise Gaia DR3 photometry, parallax, and stellar parameters from the SHBoost catalog to homogeneously construct extinction--distance profiles for 44 NS-associated Galactic SNRs. Applying a statistical model, we identify clear extinction jumps along each sightline, corresponding to probable SNR distances. We classify the results into three reliability levels (A, B, and C), primarily based on comparisons with previously reported kinematic distances, supplemented by independent estimates from other methods. Our results show that the majority of reliable distances (17 Level A and 8 Level B) are located within 5 kpc, predominantly in the Local Arm. This study presents an independent and effective method for determining distances to SNRs, particularly for those with small angular sizes or located in the second and third Galactic quadrants. Although the current method is limited to within 5 kpc due to the precision constraints of Gaia parallax and photometry, the upcoming Gaia DR4 release, combined with complementary infrared data, will extend its applicability to more distant and heavily obscured SNRs, and help resolve kinematic distance ambiguities.

 - **Abstract**
 We compare the radii derived from the asteroseismic scaling relations with those from surface brightness-colour relations (SBCRs) combined with the Gaia DR3 parallaxes for main-sequence (MS) stars. The atmospheric and asteroseismic parameters were sourced from the recently released KEYSTONE catalogue and matched to Gaia DR3 and TESS Input Catalog v8.2. We computed SBCR-based radii using two different SBCRs, and estimated their relative differences with respect to radius estimates from asteroseismic grid-based methods. We find a good agreement between SBCR and asteroseismic radii, with mean relative differences in radii ($E_g$) in the range 2% to 3% and a standard deviation of about 3%. We find no dependence on parallax, and a mild dependence on [Fe/H] for one of the SBCRs tested. We find a negative correlation between $E_g$ and the stellar mass, with a slope varying from $-0.051\pm0.016$ to $-0.039\pm0.014$ per solar mass. This change in slope led to a roughly 1.5% larger discrepancy in the $E_g$ estimates for stars with masses below 1.0 $M_{\odot}$. This larger discrepancy at the low-mass end supports conclusions drawn from giant star studies. This result is independently corroborated by the LEGACY sample, which uses Kepler photometry. For the LEGACY sample we measure a mean relative offset in $E_g$ of -1.4% with a standard deviation of 2.3%, and a dependence of $E_g$ on mass with a slope of $-0.052\pm0.011$ per mass unit, both fully consistent with the KEYSTONE analysis. The [...] apparent mass dependence still requires closer examination. This result is reassuring as it demonstrates the great accuracy and reliability of the radius estimates obtained through SBCRs, which, moreover, offer the significant advantage of being applicable to a large sample of stars with substantially lower time and costs compared to what is required by asteroseismology.

 - **Abstract**
 One crucial aspect of planning any large scale astronomical survey is constructing an observing strategy that maximizes reduced data quality. This is especially important for surveys that are rather heterogeneous and broad-ranging in their science goals. The Sloan Digital Sky Survey V (SDSS-V), which now utilizes the Focal Plane System (FPS) to robotically place fibers that feed the spectrographs, certainly meets these criteria. The addition of the FPS facilities an increase in survey efficiency, number of targets and target diversity, but also means the positions of fibers must be constrained to allow for simultaneous observations of sometimes competing programs. The constraints on the positions of the fibers are clearly driven by properties of the science targets e.g., the type of target, brightness of the target, position of the target relative to others in the field, etc. The parameters used to describe these constraints will also depend on the intended science goal of the observation, which will vary with the types of objects requested for the particular observation and the planned sky conditions for the observation. In this work, we detail the SDSS-V data collection scenarios, which consist of sets of parameters that serve as the framework for constraining fiber placements. The numerical values of these parameters were set based on either past experiences or from a series of new tests, which we describe in detail here. These parameters allow a survey like SDSS-V to be algorithmically planned to maximize the science output, while guaranteeing data quality throughout its operation.

          Impeding Turbulence Decay in Self-gravitating Cloud Cores

 - **Abstract**
 Turbulence governs the fragmentation of molecular clouds and plays a pivotal role in star formation. The persistence of observed cloud turbulence suggests it does not decay significantly within the turnover timescale, implying a recurrent driving mechanism. Although ubiquitous self-gravity is a plausible driver, MHD simulations by \citet{ostriker2001density} demonstrated that self-gravity alone does not modify the global turbulence decay rate. In this study, we demonstrate that the dominant diffuse volume of a cloud dictates its overall decay rate, while individual dense cores can maintain near-zero decay rates. Crucially, this phenomenon is absent in control simulations excluding self-gravity. This discrepancy cannot be attributed to contamination of turbulent velocities by core contraction, as most cores in our simulations remain in a quasi-equilibrium state. Our analysis reveals that the gravitational potential energy released during core formation\textemdash not necessarily driven by self-gravity but also by turbulent compression\textemdash is sufficient to sustain the observed turbulence levels within cores.

 - **Abstract**
 In the interstellar medium (ISM), polycylic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are believed to be an important carbon reservoir, accounting for up to a quarter of all interstellar carbon in our galaxy. This makes the investigation of their potential formation precursors highly relevant in the context of ISM chemistry. This, in turn, includes knowing the abundance of the precursor species. One of the possible precursor molecules for PAHs is the recently detected cyanocyclopentadiene, c-C$_5$H$_5$CN. Given the physical conditions of the dense dark molecular cloud TMC-1 where the cyclic species was detected, it is crucial to consider that local thermodynamic equilibrium conditions may not be satisfied. In such case an accurate estimation of the molecular abundance involves taking into account the competition between the radiative and collisional processes, which requires the knowledge of rotational excitation data for collisions with the most abundant interstellar species - He or H$_2$. In this paper the first potential energy surface (PES) for the interaction of the most stable isomer of cyanocyclopentadiene (1-cyano-1,3-cyclopentadiene) with He atoms is computed using the explicitly correlated coupled-cluster theory [CCSD(T)-F12]. The obtained PES demonstrates a high anisotropy and is characterized by a global potential well of -101.8 cm$^{-1}$. Scattering calculations of the rotational (de-)excitation of 1-cyano-cyclopentadiene induced by He atoms are performed with the quantum mechanical close-coupling method for total energies up to 125 cm$^{-1}$. The resulting rotational state-to-state cross sections are used to compute the corresponding rate coefficients for temperatures up to 20 K. A propensity favoring the transitions with $\Delta k_a=0$ is observed.

 - **Abstract**
 Chemical clocks offer a powerful tool for estimating stellar ages from spectroscopic surveys. We present a new detailed spectroscopic analysis of 68 Kepler red giant stars to provide a suite of high-precision abundances along with asteroseismic ages with better than 10 percent precision from individual mode frequencies. We obtained several chemical clocks as ratios between s-process elements (Y, Zr, Ba, La, Ce) and alpha-elements (Mg, Ca, Si, Al, Ti). Our data show that [Ce/Mg] and [Zr/Ti] display a remarkably tight correlation with stellar ages, with abundance dispersions of 0.08 and 0.01 dex respectively and below 3 Gyr in ages, across the entire Galactic chronochemical history. While improving the precision floor of spectroscopic surveys is critical for broadening the scope and applicability of chemical clocks, the intrinsic accuracy of our relations -- enabled by high-resolution chemical abundances and stellar ages in our sample -- allows us to draw meaningful conclusions about age trends across stellar populations. By applying our relations to the APOGEE and Gaia-ESO surveys, we are able to differentiate the low- and high-alpha sequences in age, recover the age-metallicity relation, observe the disc flaring of the Milky Way, and identify a population of old metal-rich stars.

          Ultraviolet Spectra of Comets: Rejecting the Detection of Pentacene, Toluene, and Fe+

 - **Abstract**
 A recent study announced the detection of three bands in the ultraviolet emission spectra of more than a dozen comets, assigning two of them to pentacene (C$_{22}$H$_{14}$) and the third one to toluene (C$_7$H$_8$). The comparison of the spectra with the results of exploitable laboratorymeasurements on rare-gas-matrix-isolated pentacene and on jet-cooled toluene does not reveal elements that would justify the assignment, which is therefore unsubstantiated. The study also claimed the detection of an Fe II line in the gas of all but one comet. Yet, spectroscopic data on Fe II do not corroborate the attribution. Because spectroscopic measurements on the ultraviolet emission of pentacene in the gas phase are not available, this work also presents a synthetic spectrum of the S$_5$ $\rightarrow$ S$_0$ transition relevant to the wavelength range of the observations. Calculated using density functional theory and its time-dependent extension, the synthetic spectrum may facilitate the search for pentacene fluorescence in cometary spectra until laboratory measurements are accessible.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first high-resolution abundance study of ESO 280-SC06, one of the least luminous and most metal-poor gravitationally bound Milky Way globular clusters. Using Magellan/MIKE spectroscopy for ten stars, we confirm the cluster's low metallicity as [Fe/H] = $-2.54 \pm 0.06$ and the presence of a nitrogen-enhanced star enriched by binary mass transfer. We determine abundances or abundance upper limits for 21 additional elements from the light, alpha, odd-Z, iron peak, and neutron-capture groups for all ten stars. We find no spread in neutron-capture elements, unlike previous trends identified in some metal-poor globular clusters such as M15 and M92. Eight of the ten stars have light-element abundance patterns consistent with second-population globular cluster stars, which is a significantly larger second-population fraction than would be expected from the low present-day mass of $10^{4.1}$ Msun. We estimate the initial mass of the cluster as $10^{5.4 - 5.7}$ Msun based on its orbit in the Milky Way. A preferential loss of first-population stars could explain the high fraction of second-population stars at the present time. Our results emphasize the importance of considering mass loss when studying globular clusters and their enrichment patterns.

 - **Abstract**
 Globular clusters (GCs) host multiple stellar populations differing in their chemical and dynamical properties. A number of models for the formation of multiple populations predict that the subsystem of second generation (SG) stars is characterized by a more centrally concentrated spatial distribution and a more rapid rotation than the system of first generation (FG) stars. We present the results of N-body simulations exploring the long-term dynamical evolution of rotating multiple-population GCs. We study the evolution of systems starting with four different orientations of the GC's total internal angular momentum vector relative to the orbital angular momentum. We explore the evolution driven by two-body relaxation and the effects of the GC's interaction with the galactic tidal field. We focus on the kinematic differences between the two generations and we quantify them by exploring the FG and SG rotation velocity and angular momenta. We find that kinematic differences between the generations persist for most of the GCs' lifetimes, although the strength of these differences decreases after a few relaxation times. The differences can be seen most clearly in the lowest-mass stars. We find that the GCs' internal angular momentum gradually aligns with the orbital angular momentum, although there is little difference in this alignment between the FG and SG systems. We also find that stars in the GC's outer regions align with the orbital angular momentum vector more rapidly than those in the inner regions leading to a variation of the orientation of the internal angular momentum with the clustercentric distance. The alignment between internal angular momentum and orbital angular momentum occurs more rapidly for low-mass stars. We study the evolution of the anisotropy in the velocity distribution and find the SG to be characterized by a stronger radial anisotropy than the FG.(abridged)

 - **Abstract**
 Super-Earths and mini-Neptunes are missing from our Solar System, yet they appear to be the most abundant planetary types in our Galaxy. A detailed characterization of key planets within this population is important for understanding the formation mechanisms of rocky and gas giant planets and the diversity of planetary interior structures. In 2019, NASA's TESS satellite found a transiting planet candidate in a 17.6-day orbit around the star TOI-283. We started radial velocity (RV) follow-up observations with ESPRESSO to obtain a mass measurement. Mass and radius are measurements critical for planetary classification and internal composition modeling. We used ESPRESSO spectra to derive the stellar parameters of the planet candidate host star TOI-283. We then performed a joint analysis of the photometric and RV data of this star, using Gaussian processes to model the systematic noise present in both datasets. We find that the host is a bright K-type star ($d = 82.4$ pc, $\mathrm{T}_\mathrm{eff} = 5213 \pm 70$ K, $V = 10.4$ mag) with a mass and radius of $\mathrm{M}_\star = 0.80 \pm 0.01\; \mathrm{M}_\odot$ and $\mathrm{R}_\star = 0.85 \pm 0.03\; \mathrm{R}_\odot$. The planet has an orbital period of $P = 17.617$ days, a size of $\mathrm{R}_\mathrm{p} = 2.34 \pm 0.09\; \mathrm{R}_\oplus$, and a mass of $\mathrm{M}_\mathrm{p} = 6.54 \pm 2.04\; \mathrm{M}_\oplus$. With an equilibrium temperature of $\sim$600 K and a bulk density of $\rho_\mathrm{p} = 2.81 \pm 0.93$ g cm$^{-3}$, this planet is positioned in the mass-radius diagram where planetary models predict H$_2$O- and H/He-rich envelopes. The ESPRESSO RV data also reveal a long-term trend that is probably related to the star's activity cycle. Further RV observations are required to confirm whether this signal originates from stellar activity or another planetary body in the system.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an atlas of full-scan spectra from the Short-Wavelength Spectrometer (SWS) aboard the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) after reprocessing and improving an earlier version published 22 years ago. The SWS spectra cover the wavelength range from 2.35 to 45.3 {\mu}m. They include scans in 12 separate bands, and we have updated the methods used to combine those bands into a single continuous spectrum. The main improvement comes from applying multiple constraints, including new photometry and spectra from the Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) on the Spitzer Space Telescope that have become available since the release of the original products, and individualized attention to each spectrum, to renormalize the separate bands into a more consistent single spectrum. In particular this removed unphysical negative fluxes that were common in the original data products. The new database, with 1035 reprocessed spectra, will be available to the community at IRSA, which also hosts the original processing.

 - **Abstract**
 Multiplicity is ubiquitous among massive stars. While the stellar components usually display similar masses, some binaries with extremely low mass ratios were also observed. Some of them are primordial, while others arise from binary interactions. The identification of systems with extreme mass ratios brings valuable information, notably on the origin of fast rotation in massive stars. We identify new short-period systems with extreme mass ratios through the detection of eclipses and reflection effects. The physical properties of a dozen newly identified cases were precisely evaluated through high-quality photometry and spectroscopy. In addition to characterizing these binaries, we found a clear signature of apsidal motion in one system, and three other systems display long-term shifts in eclipse times. All systems we reported here are composed of a massive star and a cool low-mass companion. They are therefore primordial cases. This doubles the known number of these systems in the Galaxy. In this context, it is important to note that most massive stars in these systems, as well as in previous systems reported in the literature, rotate fast (supersynchronous compared to the orbital motion). The high incidence of fast rotation in these nascent binaries provides strong constraints for star formation models.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Cygnus OB2, in the Cygnus X complex -- one of the most active star-forming regions of the Galaxy -- hosts hundreds of O- and B-type stars at different evolutionary stages. This association provides a unique laboratory to study massive star evolution and dynamics. However, despite extensive studies, the absence of a fast-rotating group ($v\sin{i}>200\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$) among the O-type population of Cygnus OB2 challenges current models of massive star evolution. Aims. Stellar rotation strongly impacts spectral line shapes of O-type stars, and high rotation can potentially lead to misclassifications. We investigate whether some stars in Cygnus OB2, classified at low spectral resolution as B0, are actually rapidly rotating late-O types. Such cases could explain the observed lack of fast rotators in Cygnus OB2. Methods. Accounting for rotation, we reclassify the known B0 population in Cygnus OB2, using the MGB tool and both new and pre-existing optical spectroscopy. Finally, we compute projected rotational velocities using iacob-broad. Results. About $19\,\%$ of the initial B0 population in Cygnus OB2 are, in fact, late-O types. Only 6 stars in the entire dataset show $v\sin{i}>200\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$, with just 1 new O-type star exceeding this threshold. Conclusions. In our study of Cygnus OB2, we continue to find a notable lack of fast rotators among its O-type population. We propose a combination of three factors as the most likely explanation: (i) the young age of Cygnus OB2 may imply that fast rotators has not been produced yet due to binary interactions; (ii) fast rotators may have been dynamically ejected from the core as runaway stars; (iii) local star formation conditions may hinder binary formation (reducing spin-up interactions) or result in slower rotational velocities at birth.

          Molecular line emission from 1000 au scales outflows to <30 au compact structures in NGC1333 IRAS4A2

 - **Abstract**
 Aims. Studying protostellar objects in their earliest stages, particularly during the Class 0 phase, provides key insight into the beginnings of planet formation and dust evolution. Disentangling the various components, however, is particularly challenging. High spatial and spectral resolution observations of molecular line emission with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) are therefore crucial for probing their complex environments. Methods. In this work, we present high-resolution ($\sim$30 au) ALMA observations at 1.3 millimeters of the Class 0 protostellar system IRAS4A2. Results. We detected large, well-traced outflows in HCN (3-2), H$_{2}$CO$(2_{1~2}-1_{1~1})$, and HCO$^{+}$ (3-2), along with numerous complex organic molecules (COMs) tracing central, more compact regions. Using moment maps, we analyzed the kinematics and spatial distributions of the molecular emission, revealing a wide range of spatial scales, from compact structures within the IRAS4A2 core at $\sim$8 au in radius, to extended $\sim$5000 au outflow emission. Specifically, we find that CH$_{3}$CDO and CH$_{3}$OCHO could be both good tracers of the disk, possibly tracing its rotation. Lines of OCS (22-21), SO$_{2}~(13_{3~11}-13_{2~12})$, HCN, H$_{2}$CO, and HCO$^{+}$, show more extended structures around IRAS4A2, likely tracing the envelope, disk, accretion shocks, the base of an outflow, and the outflow itself. Conclusions. Most COMs appear to trace distinct inner regions near the central protostar, while other molecules trace more extended structures, such as the envelope or outflows. The kinematics, emission patterns, and position-velocity diagrams suggest that individual molecules trace multiple components simultaneously, making it challenging to disentangle their true origins. Altogether, these findings highlight the complex spatial distribution within the IRAS4A2 system. Abridged.

 - **Abstract**
 The question of whether genuinely young high-$\alpha$ stars exist has been discussed for over a decade since their discovery from asteroseismology of giant stars as it is challenging to break the degeneracy between the binary interaction and the genuinely young scenarios. Young high-$\alpha$ stars are hard to explain with traditional chemical evolution model as the high-$\alpha$ disk is typically associated with the early epoch of star formation in the Milky Way. Combined with recent advances of gyrochronology, and that $^7$Li can serve as an unambiguous indicator for identifying merger products in dwarfs thanks to its low burning temperature, we identified young high-$\alpha$ dwarf candidate stars through their fast rotation in a previous study. In this paper, we performed high-resolution spectroscopic follow-up of these candidates using Potsdam Echelle Polarimetric and Spectroscopic Instrument (PEPSI), and confirm 3 additional stars that are most likely genuinely young. Together with the star from the earlier paper, we find three out of four of them center around [Fe/H]=-0.5 dex, are ~5 Gyr old, and have a similar amount of elevated Li (~0.5 dex) and Al (~0.1 dex) compared to stars with matching $\log g$, $T_{\rm eff}$, Mg, and Fe within observational uncertainties, hinting at their common formation pathway.

          Glycolaldehyde and ethanol toward the L1157 outflow: resolved images and constraints on glycolaldehyde formation

 - **Abstract**
 Two main formation routes have been proposed for interstellar complex organic molecules (iCOMs): on dust grain surfaces and in the gas phase. Observing such molecules in protostellar outflow shock regions - provided that their ages are well-constrained - can help distinguish between these pathways by probing chemical evolution over time. This study focuses on the potential daughter-mother relationship of glycolaldehyde (CH$_2$OHCHO) and ethanol (C$_2$H$_5$OH), previously proposed in the literature. We test whether gas-phase reactions converting ethanol into glycolaldehyde derived in these works can explain the observed abundance of the latter in star-forming regions. We target the southern outflow of L1157, which hosts three shock regions, B0, B1 and B2, of increasing ages: about 900, 1500 and 2300 yr. We obtained high-resolution IRAM NOEMA maps of three lines of glycolaldehyde and one line of ethanol. We derived their abundances in the three shocks and used a pseudo time-dependent astrochemical model to simulate gas-phase and grain-surface formation scenarios for glycolaldehyde. Ethanol is assumed to form on grains and be released in the gas by shocks, where it is gradually converted into glycolaldehyde via the ethanol-tree reaction network. We present the first spatially resolved maps of glycolaldehyde and ethanol in the L1157 southern outflow, and more generally toward solar-like star forming regions. The abundance ratio [CH$_2$OHCHO]/[C$_2$H$_5$OH] increases from B1 to B2, consistent with model predictions. However, the model cannot reproduce all three shocked regions simultaneously, suggesting that one of the assumptions of our model, such as the same excitation temperature and grain composition in B0, B1 and B2, or gas temperature evolution, is wrong. Nonetheless, our modeling rules out the possibility that all the observed gaseous glycolaldehyde is a grain-surface product.

 - **Abstract**
 HD 100453 disk is a prototypical companion-disk interaction system hosting a pair of spirals and a substellar companion. We present new noncoronagraphic high-contrast imaging observations of HD 100453 with $V$ filter on SPHERE/ZIMPOL. We combined high-contrast imaging data of the reflected light from 0.55 to 2.2 $\mu m$ using the $V$, $I'$, $J$, and $Ks$ band data of ZIMPOL and IRDIS at VLT/SPHERE. For each observational epoch, we corrected for the smearing effect to derive the intrinsic disk-integrated polarized flux. We derived a steady increase with wavelengths from $\hat{Q}_{\varphi}/I_{\star}(V)=0.3\%$ to $\hat{Q}_{\varphi}/I_{\star}(K)=1.2\%$. We applied reference differential imaging to extract the disk intensity for the $V$ and $Ks$ bands using star hopping observations. We obtained the first $V$-band total intensity for HD 100453 with ZIMPOL star hopping. The integrated total flux $I_{\rm disk}/I_{\star}(V)=1.5\%$ increases to $I_{\rm disk}/I_{\star}(K)=4.8\%$. Both the total intensity and the polarization fraction show red colors, and the intrinsic maximum degree of polarization increases moderately from $40\%$ to $55\%$. We then used RADMC-3D radiative transfer modeling with a parametrized Henyey-Greenstein phase function to constrain the dust properties. From the $V$ to $Ks$ band, the dominating dust in the outer disk has an increasing scattering albedo and degree of polarization, while the asymmetry parameter slightly decreases. The outer disk of HD 100453 contains sub-micron-sized low porosity grains/aggregates. The cavity in scattered light is not empty and is replenished with optically thin dust with a maximum size of $\leq 0.1\mu m$. The linear polarization is higher in the spiral region than in the other regions, suggesting different dust properties in those regions.

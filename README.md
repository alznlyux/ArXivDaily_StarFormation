 - **Abstract**
 We propose a Roman Space Telescope survey to investigate fundamental properties of the distant solar system in the region of the Kuiper Belt where object characteristics and the size distribution are inaccessible from any other telescope. Our pointing is coincident with the search space accessible to NASA's New Horizons spacecraft meaning, that a discovered object sufficiently near the orbit of New Horizons would potentially be investigated by a close flyby. In addition, numerous objects expected to be discovered by this search can be observed in the distance by New Horizons allowing their surface properties and satellite systems to both be probed. As designed, this survey will discover and determine orbits for as many as 900 Kuiper Belt objects (KBOs), providing a unique opportunity for ground-breaking Kuiper Belt science. It will simultaneously: (1) Probe and characterize the deep Kuiper Belt by identifying objects as small as a few km and taking our understanding of the size distribution to a new level. This has implications for understanding the the standard model (the Streaming Instability) of KBO formation and elucidating crater formation physics on these icy bodies. (2) Open KBO rotation studies, in particular of those objects with long rotation periods,(3) Discover and characterize KBO binaries at large distances, important because their duplicity offers information about object densities at these distant locations from the Sun. (4) Shed light on the cratering history of KBOs and improving the dating of the surfaces of Arrokoth, Pluto and Charon in addition to helping to place the 32 distant KBOs New Horizons has observed in context. This project also has synergies with transiting exoplanet studies due to the stellar density of our search fields. Coupled with our timing requirements it is sensitive to discovery of hot Jupiters and hot Neptunes.

 - **Abstract**
 There is vast evidence from observations of multiple stellar populations (MPs) in globular clusters (GCs). To explore the issue theoretically, this work considers two subsolar metallicities, two ages, and two initial abundance patterns: a first population of standard $\alpha$-enhanced metal mixture stars and a second stellar population displaying C-N and Na-O anticorrelations chemical abundance patterns, along with an enhanced helium fraction. Analysing the predictions for these extreme compositions, we provide insights into the observability of not-resolved MPs into individual stars of GCs. We use colours and spectrophotometric indices measurable with modern facilities (e.g. Euclid, LSST, DES, JWST).

 - **Abstract**
 Co-moving groups of stars (streams) are well known in the velocity space of the disc near the Sun. Many are thought to arise from resonances with the Galactic bar or spiral arms. In this work, we search for similar moving groups in the velocity space of the halo, at low angular momentum. From the asymmetry of the radial velocity distribution $v_R$, we identify two inward-moving streams with $v_R<0$ and small $|v_\phi|$. These are projections of the `chevrons' previously discovered in radial phase space $(R,v_R)$. A test particle simulation in a realistic Milky Way potential with a decelerating bar naturally produces analogues of these features, and they are observed across a wide range of metallicity. They are therefore very likely to be dynamical streams created by trapping in the bar's resonances. Specifically, they occupy regions of phase space where orbits are trapped in the corotation and outer Lindblad resonances respectively. By tracing these streams across a range of radii in $(R,v_R)$ space, we fit resonant orbits to their tracks in a flexible potential with variable bar pattern speed. This allows us to simultaneously constrain the mass profile of the Milky Way for $r\lesssim20$ kpc and the pattern speed $\Omega_\mathrm{b}$. We estimate the mass enclosed within $r=20$ kpc to be $M_{20}=(2.17\pm0.21)\times10^{11}M_\odot$, and the pattern speed to be $\Omega_\mathrm{b}=31.9_{-1.9}^{+1.8}$ km/s/kpc. Our fitted potential is in excellent agreement with previous results, while we favour a slightly slower pattern speed than most recent estimates.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the impact of ionizing external ultraviolet (UV) radiation on low-mass haloes ($M_{h}<10^{10}M_\odot$) at high redshift using $1140M_\odot$ baryonic resolution zoom-in simulations of seven regions from the THESAN-ZOOM project. We compare three simulation sets that differ in the treatment of external UV radiation: one employing a uniform UV background initiated at z=10.6 in addition to radiation transport for local sources, another with the same background starting at z=5.5, and the default configuration in which the large-scale radiation field from the parent THESAN-1 simulation box acts as a boundary condition. The multi-phase interstellar medium (ISM) model, combined with its high mass resolution, allows us to resolve all star-forming haloes and capture the back-reaction of ionizing radiation on galaxy properties during the epoch of reionization. When present, external UV radiation efficiently unbinds gas in haloes with masses below $10^9M_\odot$ and suppresses subsequent star formation. As a result, in simulations with early reionization, minihaloes fail to form stars from pristine gas, leading to reduced metal enrichment of gas later accreted by more massive haloes. Consequently, haloes with masses below $10^{10}M_\odot$ at all simulated epochs (z>3) exhibit lower metallicities and altered metallicity distributions. The more accurate and realistic shielding from external UV radiation, achieved through self-consistent radiative transfer, permits the existence of a cold but low-density gas phase down to z=3. These findings highlight the importance of capturing a patchy reionization history in high-resolution simulations targeting high-redshift galaxy formation. We conclude that at minimum, a semi-numerical model that incorporates spatially inhomogeneous reionization and a non-uniform metallicity floor is necessary to accurately emulate metal enrichment in minihaloes.

          Understanding entropy in massive halos: The role of baryon decoupling

 - **Abstract**
 The goal of the work presented in this paper is to use observed entropy profiles to infer constraints on the accretion process in massive halos. We compare entropy profiles from various observational samples with those generated by an updated version of the semi-analytical models developed in the early 2000s, modified to reflect recent advancements in our understanding of large-structure formation. Our model reproduces the growing departure from self-similarity observed in data as we move inward in individual profiles and down in mass across different profiles. These deviations stem from a phase of extremely low gas content centered around $10^{13}$M$_\odot$. According to our model, halos at this mass scale are missing between 50% and 90% of their baryons, corresponding to a gas fraction ranging between 2% and 8%. Baryon decoupling, the mechanism at the heart of our model, proves effective in explaining much of the behavior we sought to understand.

 - **Abstract**
 The globular clusters (GCs) system of the Milky Way (MW) comprises a mixture of both in situ and accreted clusters. Tracing the origin of GCs provides invaluable insights into the formation history of the MW. However, reconciling diverse strands of evidence is often challenging: a notable example is NGC 288, where despite significant efforts in the literature, the available chrono-chemodynamical data have yet to provide a definitive conclusion regarding its origin. On one side, all post-Gaia dynamical studies indicate an accreted origin for NGC 288 from in the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE) dwarf galaxy. On the other, NGC 288 has been found to be 2.5 Gyr older than other GSE GCs at the same metallicity, this suggesting a different, possibly in situ origin. In this work, we address the unresolved question on the origin of NGC 288 by analyzing its chrono-chemical properties in an unprecedentedly homogeneous framework. First, we compare the location of NGC 288 in the age-metallicity plane with that of other two in situ GCs at similar metallicity, namely NGC 6218 and NGC 6362. The age estimates obtained within the homogeneous framework of the CARMA collaboration show that the three clusters are coeval, this reinforcing the contrast with the dynamical interpretation. Then, we compare the abundances with the sample of in situ and accreted clusters at similar metallicity presented in Ceccarelli et al. 2024, finding again consistency with the chemistry of in situ systems. To reconcile these results with its orbital properties, we propose a scenario where NGC 288 formed in the proto-disc of the MW, and then was dynamically heated by the interaction with the GSE merger, a fate similar to that of proto-disc stars experiencing the so-called Splash event. NGC 288 therefore demonstrates the importance of a homogeneous chrono-chemodynamical information in the interpretation of the origin of MW GCs.

 - **Abstract**
 Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration radio transients that serve as unique probes of extragalactic matter. We report on the discovery and localization of two FRBs piercing the Andromeda Galaxy (M31) by the realfast fast transient detection system at the Very Large Array. Their unique sightlines allow constraints on M31's electron density distribution. We localized FRB 20230903A to its host galaxy at a redshift $z=0.09$ and FRB 20230506C to a host galaxy at a redshift $z=0.39$. After accounting for the dispersion contribution from the Milky Way, the host galaxy and the intergalactic medium along the line of sight of the FRBs, we estimate that M31 alone will likely contribute between 21-217 $\mathrm{pc~cm^{-3}}$ along FRB 20230903A and between 43-338 $\mathrm{pc~cm^{-3}}$ along FRB 20230506C with a 90% confidence. We also modeled the M31 disk's contribution to the DM to determine the halo contribution. We find that the halo of M31 will contribute between 9-145 $\mathrm{pc~cm^{-3}}$ along FRB 20230903A and between 28-286 $\mathrm{pc~cm^{-3}}$ along FRB 20230506C with 90% confidence. The measured values of $\rm DM_{M31,halo}$ are consistent with the predictions from the modified Navarro-Frenk-White profile of M31's halo for a given impact parameter. The ions of the cool halo alone cannot account for the calculated $\rm DM_{M31,halo}$ and therefore this measurement presents indirect evidence of the hot halo of M31. We also suggest a possible intersection of the line of sight of FRB 20230506C with a hot baryon bridge between M31 and the Milky Way

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new processing of XP spectra for 220 million stars released in Gaia DR3. The new data model is capable of handling objects with Teff between 2000 and 50,000 K, and with log g between 0 and 10, including objects of multitude of masses and evolutionary stages. This includes for the first time ever robust processing of spectroscopic parameters for pre-main sequence stars, with log g sensitivity towards their age. Through this analysis we examine the distribution of young low mass stars with ages of up to 20 Myr in the solar neighborhood, and we identify a new massive (>1000 stars) population, Ophion, which is found east of Sco Cen. This population appears to be fully disrupted, with negligible kinematic coherence. Nonetheless, due its young age it appears to still persist as a spacial overdensity. Through improved determination of ages of the nearby stars, it may be possible to better recover star forming history of the solar neighborhood outside of the moving groups.

 - **Abstract**
 We present new Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations that, for the first time, detect hydrogen and helium radio recombination lines from a protoplanetary disk. We imaged the Orion Nebula Cluster at 3.1 mm with a spectral setup that covered the $n=42 \rightarrow 41$ transitions of hydrogen (H41$\alpha$) and helium (He41$\alpha$). The unprecedented sensitivity of these observations enables us to search for radio recombination lines toward the positions of ${\sim}200$ protoplanetary disks. We detect H41$\alpha$ from 17 disks, all of which are HST-identified `proplyds.' The detected H41$\alpha$ emission is spatially coincident with the locations of proplyd ionization fronts, indicating that proplyd H41$\alpha$ emission is produced by gas that has been photoevaporated off the disk and ionized by UV radiation from massive stars. We measure the fluxes and widths of the detected H41$\alpha$ lines and find line fluxes of ${\sim}30-800$ mJy km s$^{-1}$ and line widths of ${\sim}30-90$ km s$^{-1}$. The derived line widths indicate that the broadening of proplyd H41$\alpha$ emission is dominated by outflowing gas motions associated with external photoevaporation. The derived line fluxes, when compared with measurements of 3.1 mm free-free flux, imply that the ionization fronts of H41$\alpha$-detected proplyds have electron temperatures of ${\sim}6,000-11,000$ K and electron densities of ${\sim}10^6-10^7$ cm$^{-3}$. Finally, we detect He41$\alpha$ towards one H41$\alpha$-detected source and find evidence that this system is helium-rich. Our study demonstrates that radio recombination lines are readily detectable in ionized photoevaporating disks, providing a new way to measure disk properties in clustered star-forming regions.

 - **Abstract**
 While molecular outflows have been studied in details with radio interferometry, observations of the hotter gas in protostellar outflows at a comparable physical scale is often challenging. Combined with ALMA, JWST allows us to investigate the cold and hot gas with unprecedented spatial resolution and sensitivity. We present a detailed comparison between the gas distributions probed with ALMA and JWST in the primary outflow of IRAS 15398$-$3359. At 2000 au scale, the southwestern outflow shows four shell structures in 5--10 micron continuum, whereas the submillimeter H$_2$CO emission traces two of the four shells closest to the protostar. Submillimeter emission from CS, CCH, c-C$_3$H$_2$, and CH$_3$OH shows the same two shells, and the $^{12}$CO emission covers most of the outflow region. SO and SiO only trace a condensation at the edge of the shell closest to the protostar. None of these lines observed with ALMA show the outermost shell. At 500 au scale, we find hot H$_2$ gas inside the outflow cavity with JWST. The derived temperature of H$_2$ is 1147$\pm$198 K within a 0\farcs5 aperture at the protostar. The foreground mass column density of dust is (1.4--2.0)$\times$10$^{-3}$ g$\cdot$cm$^{-2}$ (A$_{\rm v}$ = 47--66 mag) in the outflow, using the dust model from Weingartner & Draine (2001). We also find an 8$^{\circ}$ difference between the directions toward the [Fe II] knot and the outermost shell in the MIRI image, which may be interpreted as the precession of the [Fe II] jet. The dynamical timescale of the [Fe II] knot is 10 yrs, suggesting a current event.

 - **Abstract**
 High angular resolution radio observations of relativistic jets are necessary to understand the causal connection between accretion and jet ejection in low mass X-ray binaries. Images from these observations can be difficult to reconstruct due to the rapid intra-observational motion and variability of transient jets. We have developed a time-dependent visibility model fitting and self-calibration procedure and applied it to a single four-hour VLBA observation of the low-mass X-ray binary Swift J1727.8-1613 during the bright flaring period of its 2023 outburst. This allowed us to detect and model a slightly resolved self-absorbed compact core, as well as three downstream transient jet knots. We were able to precisely measure the proper motion and flux density variability of these three jet knots, as well as (for the first time) their intra-observational expansion. Using simultaneous multi-frequency data, we were also able to measure the spectral index of the furthest downstream jet knot, and the core, as well as the frequency-dependent core shift between 2.3 and 8.3 GHz. Using these measurements, we inferred the ejection dates of the three jet knots, including one to within $\pm40$ minutes, which is one of the most precise ever measured. The ejection of the transient jet knots coincided with a bright X-ray flare and a drastic change in the X-ray spectral and timing properties as seen by HXMT, which is the clearest association ever seen between the launching of transient relativistic jets in an X-ray binary and a sudden change in the X-ray properties of the accretion inflow.

          A hidden quasi-periodic oscillation in Cygnus X-1 revealed by NICER

 - **Abstract**
 Cygnus X-1 is a high-mass black hole binary extensively studied since its discovery in 1964. Its rapid X-ray variability provides insights into accretion physics. Unlike other black hole X-ray binaries, its power spectra are generally featureless and modeled with two broad Lorentzians, without requiring narrow quasi-periodic oscillations. We investigate the possibility that some undetected variability components in power spectra may appear in the imaginary part of the cross spectra and the coherence function. Using NICER observations up to Cycle 6, we study the power, cross, and lag spectra, along with the coherence function, searching for these "imaginary" components. We simultaneously fit the power spectra in two energy bands, 0.3-2 keV and 2-12 keV, and the real and imaginary parts of the cross-spectrum with a multi-Lorentzian model. Assuming each Lorentzian is coherent between the two bands but incoherent with others, we predict intrinsic coherence and phase lags. he intrinsic coherence shows a narrow dip at a frequency increasing from ~1 Hz to ~6 Hz as the power-law index of the Comptonized component increases from ~1.8 to ~2.4. Simultaneously, the phase lags exhibit a steep increase (the "cliff") at the same frequencies. These features vanish when using energy bands similar to RXTE (e.g., 3-5 keV and 5-12 keV). A narrow Lorentzian component with low fractional rms and large phase lag is required to reproduce the coherence drop. Its rms and phase-lag spectra evolve systematically in the hardness-intensity diagram. This "imaginary" QPO behaves like a type-C QPO despite being undetectable in power spectra alone. Similar features in MAXI J1348-630 and MAXI J1820+070 support this interpretation, suggesting this may be the first detection of a type-C QPO in Cygnus X-1.

          New insight into the hard X-ray emission influenced by the type-\uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral1} bursts observed by Insight-HXMT during outburst of 4U 1636--536

 - **Abstract**
 By analyzing the data from Insight-HXMT and NICER, we can determine the evolution of the significance of the hard shortage in 4U 1636--536 with its spectral state, as well as the evolution of the fraction of deficit with energy. Additionally, we investigate the possible geometry and evolution of the corona in 4U 1636-536 by combining our findings with the results of spectral analysis. We find that during the soft state, the significance of possible hard X-ray shortage in bursts is almost zero. However, in the hard state, some bursts exhibit significant shortages (>3 $\sigma$), while others do not. We attempt to establish a correlation between the significance of the hard X-ray shortage and the spectral parameters, but the data quality and the limited number of bursts prevent us from finding a strong correlation. For bursts with insignificant shortages in the soft state, their fraction of the deficit remains small. However, in the hard state, the fraction of deficit for all bursts increases with energy, regardless of the significance of the shortage of individual bursts. For bursts during the hard state, we investigate the evolution of the fraction of deficit during the bursts by stacking the peaks and decays of the bursts, respectively, and find that as the flux of the bursts decreases, the energy corresponding to the maximum of the fraction of deficit becomes progressively higher. We explore the possible geometry and evolution of the corona clued by the evolution of the fraction of deficit, which is obtained from the spectral and temporal analysis.

 - **Abstract**
 Curvature perturbations induce gravitational waves (GWs) at second order, contributing to the stochastic gravitational wave background. The resulting gravitational wave spectrum is sensitive to the evolutionary history of the universe and can be substantially enhanced by early matter-dominated (eMD) epochs, particularly if they end rapidly. Such epochs can be caused by primordial black holes (PBHs) and non-topological solitons (Q-balls), for example. Prior analysis approximated the end of the eMD epoch as instantaneous or used a Gaussian smoothing. In this work, we present a complete analysis fully incorporating their time-evolving decay rates. We demonstrate that the resulting signal spectra from PBH, thin wall Q-ball, thick wall Q-ball, and delayed Q-ball eMD epochs are distinguishable for monochromatic distributions. We then consider log-normal mass distributions and discuss the distinguishability of the various GW spectra. Importantly we find that the change in the spectrum from a finite mass width is qualitatively different from the change arising from a slower transition to radiation domination.

 - **Abstract**
 Since the early reports of events beyond the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin (GZK) cutoff, the investigation of ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays has emerged as a fundamental method for testing Lorentz Invariance violation (LV) effects. Recent advances in observational capabilities have resulted in more stringent constraints on LV parameters. This study delves into the potentially anomalous phenomena arising from subluminal and superluminal LV effects, encompassing aspects such as proton decay and atypical threshold behavior of photo-pion production from protons within the GZK region. High-energy proton observations in cosmic rays have imposed stringent constraints on superluminal proton LV effects, while the confirmation of the GZK cutoff has established a robust boundary for the anomalous phenomena associated with subluminal proton LV effects. The research provides rigorously bilateral constraints on proton LV effects from both subluminal and superluminal standpoints.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the ages of stars is crucial for unraveling the formation history and evolution of our Galaxy. Traditional methods for estimating stellar ages from spectroscopic data often struggle with providing appropriate uncertainty estimations and are severely constrained by the parameter space. In this work, we introduce a new approach using normalizing flows, a type of deep generative model, to estimate stellar ages for evolved stars with improved accuracy and robust uncertainty characterization. The model is trained on stellar masses for evolved stars derived from asteroseismology and predicts the relationship between the carbon and nitrogen abundances of a given star and its age. Unlike standard neural network techniques, normalizing flows enable the recovery of full likelihood distributions for individual stellar ages, offering a richer and more informative perspective on uncertainties. Our method yields age estimations for 378,720 evolved stars and achieves a typical absolute age uncertainty of approximately 2 Gyr. By intrinsically accounting for the coverage and density of the training data, our model ensures that the resulting uncertainties reflect both the inherent noise in the data and the completeness of the sampled parameter space. Applying this method to data from the SDSS-V Milky Way Mapper, we have produced the largest stellar age catalog for evolved stars to date.

Detecting these signatures would confirm primordial gravitational waves and allow precise determination of the tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r$, which is crucial for distinguishing between inflationary models. This requires high-precision, full-sky observations from space-based platforms to avoid atmospheric fluctuations and windows. Since $B$-mode signatures are much fainter than CMB temperature anisotropies, their detection requires well-designed calibration and mitigation strategies. Next-generation space observatories such as LiteBIRD, which use Half-Wave Plate (HWP) modulation technology, represent a significant advance. This technology allows single-detector observations, eliminating the need for differential detection and its associated systematic complexities. The study begins with the optimization of scan strategy parameters for missions with HWP to improve in-flight calibration, suppress systematic effects, and develop robust null-test methods. In addition, we present a method for calculating the impact of systematic effects on the estimation of $r$ using the SBM software framework, which performs fast mapping in spin space. This method allows the decomposition and elimination of systematic effects in terms of spins, and we demonstrate the elimination of several systematic effects.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an M87 molecular line search from archival Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) imaging, covering the circumnuclear disk (CND) as well as ionized gas filaments and dusty cloud regions. We find no evidence for CO emission in the central ~kpc and place an upper limit of $M_{H_2} < 2.3\times 10^5$ $M_\odot$ in the atomic gas CND, a factor of 20$\times$ lower than previous surveys. During this search, we discovered extragalactic CO absorption lines in the J = 1-0, 2-1, and 3-2 transitions against the bright (Jy-scale) active nucleus. These CO lines are narrow (~5 km s$^{-1}$) and blueshifted with respect to the galaxy's systemic velocity by -75 to -84 km s$^{-1}$. This CO absorber appears to be kinematically distinct from outflowing atomic gas seen in absorption. Assuming a diffuse molecular phase, low integrated opacities ranging from $\tau_{CO} \sim 0.02-0.06$ km s$^{-1}$ and column density $N_{CO} = 1.16\times 10^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$ translate to $N_{H_2} \sim (1-2) \times 10^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$. CO excitation temperatures spanning $T_{ex} \sim 8$ K to ~30 K do not follow local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) expectations, and non-LTE radex radiative transfer modeling suggests the CO absorber has a number density $n_{H_2} \sim 5000$ cm$^{-3}$. Taken together, the observed CO absorption lines are most consistent with a thin, pressure-confined filament seen slightly off-center from the M87 nucleus. We also use these ALMA data to explore the impact of residual telluric lines and atmospheric variability on the identification and classification of narrow extragalactic lines. Additionally, we demonstrate how bandpass calibration limitations may introduce broad but very low S/N absorption and emission signatures near such a bright continuum source.

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce a novel logarithmic spectral estimation method for dark matter searches using gravitational-wave detectors, integrating established dark matter search techniques with insights from computer music analysis. By leveraging symmetries between the time and frequency domains, this method matches the computational efficiency of FFT based algorithms without, unlike such algorithms, compromising precision. We apply this approach to data from LIGO's third observing run, directly comparing its performance with that of a previous search. Our results show a consistent 15 percent improvement across nearly the entire frequency range, without additional computational costs. With potential for further refinements, this method already offers a solution capable of maximizing the scientific potential of current and future gravitational-wave observatories.

 - **Abstract**
 The Compton camera is a sensitive imaging detector for soft gamma-rays. Compton Reconstruction can not only give imaging capability but also remove background events to achieve good sensitivity. However, the angular resolution is in principle limited to several degrees. In this paper, we propose a novel concept of Compton camera incorporating shadow effects. We consider multi-column Compton camera (MCCC), consisting of stacked Si pixel sensors. Each of columns is separated each other to create shadow effects. This design achieves an angular resolution of less than 1 degree within around 1 degree from the center of the field-of-view by just modifying a conventional Si-stacked Compton camera and keeping advantages (wide field-of-view and good sensitivity) of conventional Compton camera. Here we validated the concept of proposed Compton camera through Monte-Carlo simulation. MCCC with 1 m column height, 0.5 mm pixel size, 100 layers, and 10 columns for the 1-D direction can distinguish two sources separated by 0.1 degree with 0.6M Compton-reconstructed events.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we explore the link between star formation, turbulence and the thermal state of the multi-phase interstellar medium (ISM). We analyse a suite of stratified box simulations modelling a realistic ISM that aims to probe environments similar to those found in the Milky Way. Turbulence is injected through stellar feedback and an external large-scale driving force. We find that star formation can be either boosted or reduced when increasing the external driving strength, depending on the environment. When the density is sufficiently high, warm neutral gas naturally transitions to the cold phase, leading to high cold neutral medium (CNM) fractions of around 40\%. Under these conditions, excessive large-scale driving leads to a slight reduction of the CNM fraction and an increase in the amount of gas that is thermally unstable. What limits the star formation in this regime is a reduced fraction of dense gas due to additional turbulent support against collapse. For low density regions, overdensities in which cooling is efficient are much rarer and we find that star formation is regulated by the formation of cold gas. In such cases, turbulence can significantly boost star formation by compressing gas in shocks and increasing the CNM fraction dramatically. In our simulations we see an increase from almost no CNM to up to a fraction of 15 \% when including external turbulence driving; leading to an associated increase in the star formation rate. We provide a model to quantify this behaviour and predict the CNM fraction by combining the standard ISM cooling/heating model with the density PDF generated by turbulence. The change in the dominant limiting process for star formation between low- and intermediate-density environments provides a natural explanation for the observed break in the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation around column densities of 9\,\Msun\, pc$^{-2}$.

 - **Abstract**
 Dust traps are the most promising mechanisms to explain the observed substructures in protoplanetary discs. In this work, we present high-angular resolution ($\sim$60 mas, 9.4\,au) and high-sensitivity Atacama Large Millimetre/submillimetre Array (ALMA) observations at 3 mm of the transitional disc around LkCa15. The new data, combined with previous high-resolution observations at $\lambda=0.87,1.3$ mm, make LkCa15 an ideal laboratory for testing the dust trapping mechanism. We found that the width of the three rings decreases linearly with frequency, and the spectral indices show local minima at the locations of the rings, consistent with dust trap models. Multi-wavelength modelling confirms that the dust surface density and maximum grain size peak at 69 and 101\,au, and suggestive peak at 42\,au. The estimated total dust mass is between 13-250 M$_{\oplus}$, depending on the chosen opacity. The inner disc shows bright and unresolved emission at 3 mm, exhibiting a spectral index of $\alpha_{1.3-3 \rm mm} = 0.3 \pm 0.37$, and $\alpha_{\rm 3mm-3cm}$ ranging from $-0.1$ to $0.0$. These properties are consistent with free-free emission from an ionised jet or disc wind. Dust evolution models and radiative transfer calculations suggest that a viscosity coefficient of $\alpha = 10^{-3}$, a fragmentation velocity of 10 m\,s$^{-1}$, and DSHARP opacities provide the best match to the observed properties.

 - **Abstract**
 We present subarcsecond-resolution ALMA mosaics of the Orion Bar PDR in [CI] 609 um, C2H (4-3), and C18O (3-2) emission lines, complemented by JWST images of H2 and aromatic infrared band (AIB) emission. The rim of the Bar shows very corrugated structures made of small-scale H2 dissociation fronts (DFs). The [CI] 609 um emission peaks very close (~0.002 pc) to the main H2-emitting DFs, suggesting the presence of gas density gradients. These DFs are also bright and remarkably similar in C2H emission, which traces 'hydrocarbon radical peaks' characterized by very high C2H abundances, reaching up to several x10^-7. The high abundance of C2H and of related hydrocarbon radicals, such as CH3, CH2, and CH, can be attributed to gas-phase reactions driven by elevated temperatures, the presence of C+ and C, and the reactivity of FUV-pumped H2. The hydrocarbon radical peaks roughly coincide with maxima of the 3.4/3.3 um AIB intensity ratio, a proxy for the aliphatic-to-aromatic content of PAHs. This implies that the conditions triggering the formation of simple hydrocarbons also favor the formation (and survival) of PAHs with aliphatic side groups, potentially via the contribution of bottom-up processes in which abundant hydrocarbon radicals react in situ with PAHs. Ahead of the DFs, in the atomic PDR zone (where [H]>>[H2]), the AIB emission is brightest, but small PAHs and carbonaceous grains undergo photo-processing due to the stronger FUV field. Our detection of trace amounts of C2H in this zone may result from the photoerosion of these species. This study provides a spatially resolved view of the chemical stratification of key carbon carriers in a PDR. Overall, both bottom-up and top-down processes appear to link simple hydrocarbon molecules with PAHs in molecular clouds; however, the exact chemical pathways and their relative contributions remain to be quantified.

          The Gaia Astrometric Catalogue and Secular Aberration Drift in Proper Motions

 - **Abstract**
 A recent paper demonstrated the existence of a secular aberration drift term in stellar proper motions that arises when transforming an astrometric catalogue defined for an observer at rest with respect to the solar system barycentre to some other reference frame in which, for example, the observer is at rest with respect to the Galactic centre. Such a transformation requires an accurate and precise estimate of the velocity of the solar system barycentre. It was argued that the Gaia catalogue construction should account for this effect and also for the aberrational effect due to acceleration of the solar system barycentre. We argue that these two effects should not be accounted for in the construction of the Gaia astrometric catalogue. We briefly review the Gaia catalogue reference frame, the concepts of stellar aberration and secular aberration drift, and their observable consequences. The Gaia catalogue is (and should be) constructed in the Barycentric Celestial Reference System: the reference system with the origin at the solar system barycentre as defined by the underlying solar system ephemerides. We explain that the Gaia catalogue is consistent with the International Celestial Reference System despite the presence of proper motion terms due to the acceleration of the solar system barycentre. We also explain why transformation of the astrometry to a frame in which the observer is at rest with respect to the Galactic centre or distant universe is not needed for the interpretation of stellar kinematics, and that there are practical concerns with such a transformation. The estimation of the velocity and acceleration of the solar system barycentre, although important as a matter of scientific investigation, are not needed for the construction of the Gaia astrometric catalogue.

 In this paper, we present the linear decomposition method (LDM), which we developed to detect and analyze pulsar profile variations and mode changing behaviour. We developed LDM utilizing the likelihood function approach assuming the Gaussian noise. The LDM projects pulse profiles onto significance-ordered orthonormal vector bases. We show that the method is similar to the principal component analysis (PCA), but LDM can handle more general situations. We use simulated dataset and data from the Kunming 40-m radio telescope to demonstrate the application of the LDM. We found that the LDM successfully identified mode changes for well-known mode-changing PSR B0329+54 and found a continuous pulse profile evolution for PSR B0355+54 . We also show that the LDM can be used to improve the timing precision for mode changing PSR B0329+54.

 - **Abstract**
 We use the neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) observations of the edge-on galaxy UGCA 250, taken as part of the MeerKAT HI Observations of Nearby Galactic Objects - Observing Southern Emitters (MHONGOOSE) survey to investigate the amount, morphology, and kinematics of extraplanar gas. The combination of high column density sensitivity and high spatial resolution of the survey over a large field of view is ideal for studying the underlying physics governing the extraplanar gas. These data reveal 9 additional detections within the field of view along with UGCA 250, with 8 of them being within $\sim$ 200 km s$^{-1}$ of the galaxy's systemic velocity. The galaxy seems to have a tail-like feature extending away from it in the southern direction up to $\sim$ 41 kpc (in projection). We also detect a cloud at anomalous velocities, but we did not find any optical counterpart. We construct a detailed tilted ring model for this edge-on galaxy to gain a deeper understanding of the vertical structure of its neutral hydrogen. The model that best matches the data features a thick disc with a scale height of $\sim$ 3$\pm$1 kpc and an HI mass of about 15$\%$ of the total HI mass. This extraplanar gas is detected for the first time in UGCA 250. Our analysis favours a mixed origin for the extraplanar gas in UGCA 250, likely arising from a combination of internal stellar feedback and external tidal interactions.

 We provide an overview of the latest advances in the study of phosphorus-rich stars, covering their detailed chemical abundance analyses and innovative mining approaches. Following the discovery of 16 low-mass and low-metallicity stars rich in P, we expanded this sample by demonstrating that a recently identified group of Si-rich giants is also P-rich. A detailed abundance analysis was conducted on the nearinfrared spectra from APOGEE-2 DR17, encompassing 13 elements. Subsequently, a similar analysis was performed on the optical UVES spectra of four P-rich stars, resulting in the abundance determination of 48 light and heavy elements. This comprehensive analysis further refined the chemical fingerprint of these peculiar stars, which was employed to evaluate the plausibility of various nucleosynthetic formation scenarios. In order to obtain a statistically more reliable chemical fingerprint in the future, we explored the use of unsupervised machine learning algorithms to identify additional P-rich stars in extensive spectroscopic surveys, such as APOGEE-2. The primary objective of this research is to identify the progenitor of these stars and determine whether current nucleosynthetic models require revision or if a completely new source of P in the Galaxy is responsible for the existence of the P-rich stars.

 - **Abstract**
 The IceCube Neutrino Observatory publishes "alert events", i.e. detections of high-energy neutrinos with a moderate-to-high probability of being of astrophysical origin. While some events are produced in the atmosphere, a fraction of alert events should point back to their astrophysical sources. We aim to identify multiple alert events possibly related to a single astrophysical counterpart by searching for spatial and temporal clusterings in 13 years of alert data. We identify spatial clusters ("multiplets") by checking for events overlapping within their uncertainty regions. In order to reduce chance coincidences and to improve the signal purity of our sample, we apply different thresholds. We investigate the weighted mean position of these multiplets for an over-fluctuation of gamma-ray counterparts. As a final step, we apply expectation maximization to search for temporal clusters around the identified weighted mean positions. We find no statistically significant clustering of alert events around a specific origin direction or in time. This could be because the selections are still dominated by atmospheric background. Another possibility is that we are not yet sensitive enough and only detect single events from sources. In this case, we need more data in order to observe a clustering of events around their origin.

 - **Abstract**
 Phosphorus plays an essential role in the chemistry of living organisms, being present in several fundamental biomolecules. The investigation of chemical reactions taking place in different astronomical environments involving phosphorus-containing molecules is essential for understanding how these species are produced and destroyed. Phosphorus monoxide (PO) and phosphorus nitride (PN) are key reservoirs of phosphorus in the Interstellar Medium (ISM). This work presents a computational study of the CPN system to identify viable reaction pathways involving atom-diatom collisions and to explore a potential destruction route for PN in the ISM. We explore the potential energy landscape of the C($\mathrm{^3P}$) + PN($^1\Sigma^+$), N($\mathrm{^4S}$) + CP($^2\Sigma^+$) and P($\mathrm{^4S}$) + CN($^2\Sigma^+$) reactions by performing high-accuracy ab initio calculations and provide their rate coefficients over a wide range of temperatures. The temperature-dependent rate coefficients were fitted to the modified Arrhenius equation: $k(T)=\alpha(T/300)^{\beta}\mathrm{exp}(-\gamma/T)$. An updated chemical network for P-bearing species was used to model the time-dependent abundances and reaction contributions of P, PO, PN, and PH during the chemical evolution of diffuse/translucent and dense clouds. The only neutral-neutral reaction capable of destroying PN without an activation energy seems to be the PN+C one. We have also shown that reactions between CP and N can yield CN and PN barrierless. Chemical models indicate that PO is a crucial species driving the gas-phase formation of PN. Typically, PO/PN ratios exceed 1, though their chemistry is influenced by photon- and cosmic-ray-induced processes. Over time in simulated dense clouds, neutral-neutral reactions such as PO + N, PH + N, P + OH, and PH + O play a significant role in determining the relative abundances of PO and PN.

          Optimal joint reconstruction from CMB observations: application to cosmic birefringence, patchy reionization and CMB lensing

 - **Abstract**
 Line-of-sight distortions of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), including gravitational lensing, cosmic birefringence, and patchy screening, encode crucial cosmological information. While quadratic estimators (QE) have been excellent tools for extracting these signals, they become suboptimal for current- and next-generation CMB surveys, failing to maximize signal-to-noise and suffering from bias contamination that standard bias-hardening techniques cannot mitigate. We present a joint maximum a posteriori framework that simultaneously reconstructs multiple distortion fields while explicitly accounting for their mutual contamination. For cosmic birefringence searches, our method achieves up to 2.5 improvement in reconstruction noise compared to the QE, while significantly reducing CMB lensing-induced biases up to a factor of 5. These gains in lensing biases manifest not only in deep polarization surveys like CMB-S4 and SPT-3G, but also in higher-noise experiments like Simons Observatory, where our method reduces lensing-induced biases by a factor of two thanks to the power of delensing. Our code provides a first step to robust analyses of CMB secondary anisotropies, their cross-correlations with large-scale structure, and ultimately enabling more sensitive searches for primordial $B$-modes.

          High-Energy Neutrinos by Hydrogen-rich Supernovae interacting with low-massive Circumstellar Medium: The Case of SN 2023ixf

 - **Abstract**
 In hydrogen-rich (H-rich) Supernova (SN) events, the collision between the H-rich ejecta and the Circum-Stellar Medium (CSM) can accelerate particles and produce high-energy neutrinos (HE-$\nu$, TeV-PeV) through proton-proton inelastic scattering. Despite understanding the production mechanism of these neutrinos, the lack of direct observations raises questions about particle acceleration efficiency and the involved astrophysical conditions. This study focuses on neutrino emission from H-rich SNe with low-mass CSM, such as SN 2023ixf. We developed a semi-analytical model to characterize the progenitor and CSM at the explosion time, allowing us to infer the expected neutrino flux at Earth during the SN's interaction phase. Our model shows that neutrino emission depends not only on shock velocity and CSM mass but also on the spatial matter distribution of the CSM. By analysing the bolometric light curve of SN 2023ixf beyond 100 days post-explosion, we find that its ejecta, consisting of $9\,\text{M}_{\rm \odot}$ (including $0.07\,\text{M}_{\rm \odot}$ of radioactive $^{56}$Ni) and having a kinetic energy of $1.8\,\text{foe}$, collides with a low-mass CSM of $0.06\,\text{M}_{\rm \odot}$ distributed according to a power-law density profile with an exponent of $s=2.9$. Through these parameters, we estimate that up to $4\pm1\times 10^{-2}$ muon (anti-)neutrino events could be detected by IceCube within 50 days post-explosion. Although the predicted flux ($\lesssim 3\times 10^{-9}\,\text{GeV} \, \text{cm}^{-2} \, \text{s}^{-1}$) is below current IceCube sensitivity, future telescopes like IceCube-Gen2 and KM3NeT could detect HE-$\nu$ from similar SN events.

          Can Hyperbolic Diffusion Help Explain Sharp Edges in the Gaps in Saturn's Rings?

 - **Abstract**
 We explore whether hyperbolic diffusion may help explain sharp edges in the gaps in Saturn's rings. Sharp edges are conventionally understood to be due to angular momentum flux reversal at gap edges. We do not dispute this finding, but investigate whether non-classical diffusion may amplify this finding. We explore a simple model of hyperbolic diffusion for the radial spread of material in planetary rings. The model arises by the introduction of a relaxation time in an advection equation for the radial diffusive angular momentum flux. We show that radial secular forcing, combined with a hyperbolic diffusion equation, leads to sharp gap edges, in which the density of ring material drops precipitously down to zero at some critical distance from the moon's orbit. Additionally, we show that our simple model can produce large ``spikes'' or ``horns'' in the density profile on either side of a ring gap, mirroring results of large N-body simulations. It remains to be seen how these results may be affected by the inclusion of the well-understood angular momentum flux reversal near tidally-induced gap edges.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first photometric population study of double-peaked Type IIb supernovae (SNe IIb). SNe IIb are produced from the core-collapse of massive stars whose outermost Hydrogen layer has been partially stripped prior to explosion. These double-peaked light curves, consisting of a shock-cooling emission peak (SCE) followed by the main nickel-powered peak, contain more crucial information about the progenitor system than the typical single-peaked light curves. We compiled and analyzed a sample of 14 spectroscopically confirmed SNe IIb -- including previously unpublished and re-classified -- with publicly available photometric observations, discovered between 2018--2022, from the ZTF and ATLAS surveys. We developed and fit a piecewise linear model, referred to as the ``lightning bolt model,'' to describe the early-time behavior of these objects to measure population statistics. Notably, we find the SCE peak lasts, on average, fewer than five days above half-maximum light with a mean rise time of $2.07\pm1.0$ and $1.1\pm0.8$ mags/day in the g- and r-band respectively. These SCE rise rates are over 10x faster than -- and last only a third the duration of -- the rise to the nickel-powered peak. These rise times are comparable to those of fast blue optical transient (FBOT) events and we discuss the implications in the text. Finally, we present a proof-of-concept alert filter, using the ANTARES broker, to demonstrate how to translate these population statistics into simple and effective filters to find potential double-peaked SNe IIb in large-scale survey alert streams, like the imminent Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (Rubin LSST).

 - **Abstract**
 A significant fraction of hot Jupiters have orbital axes misaligned with their host stars' spin axes. The large stellar obliquities of these giants have long been considered potential signatures of high-eccentricity migration, which is expected to clear out any nearby planetary companions. This scenario requires that only isolated hot Jupiters be spin-orbit misaligned while those with nearby companions, which must have more quiescent histories, maintain low-obliquity orbits, assuming they formed aligned within their primordial protoplanetary disks. Investigations of this stellar obliquity-companionship connection, however, have been severely limited by the lack of hot Jupiters found in compact multi-planet systems. Here we present the sky-projected stellar obliquity ($\lambda$) of a hot Jupiter with a nearby inner companion recently discovered by NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite: TOI-5143 c. Specifically, we utilize the Doppler shadow caused by the planet's transit, enabled by the Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect, to find that the planet is aligned with $\lambda=2.1 ^{+2.8}_{-2.7} \circ$. Of the exoplanets with RM measurements, TOI-5143 c becomes just the third hot Jupiter with a nearby companion, and is part of the 19th compact multi-planet single-star system, with an RM measurement. The spin-orbit alignment of these 19 systems provides strong support for primordial alignment, and thus implies that large obliquities are gained primarily due to post-disk dynamical interactions such as those inherent to high-eccentricity migration. As such, the observed spin-orbit alignment of hot Jupiters with nearby companions affirms that some fraction of these giants instead have quiescent origins.

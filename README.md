 - **Abstract**
 A small fraction of low-mass stars have been found to have anomalously high Li abundances. Although it has been suggested that mixing during the red giant branch phase can lead to Li production, this method of intrinsic Li production cannot explain Li-rich stars that have not yet undergone the first dredge-up. To obtain clues about the origin of such stars, we present a detailed chemical abundance analysis of four unevolved Li-rich stars with $-2.1 < [\mathrm{Fe/H}] < -1.3$ and $2.9<A({\rm Li})<3.6$, $0.7-1.4$ dex higher Li abundance than typical unevolved metal-poor stars. One of the stars, Gaia DR3 6334970766103389824 (D25_6334), was serendipitously found in the stellar stream ED-3, and the other three stars have been reported to have massive ($M\gtrsim 1.3\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$) non-luminous companions. We show that three of the four stars exhibit abundance patterns similar to those of known unevolved Li-rich stars, namely normal abundances in most elements except for Li and Na. These abundance similarities suggest a common origin for the unevolved Li-rich stars and low-mass metal-poor stars with massive compact companions. We also made the first detection of N abundance to unevolved Li-rich stars in D25_6334, and found that it is significantly enhanced ($[\mathrm{N/Fe}]=1.3$). The observed abundance pattern of D25_6334, spanning from C to Si, indicates that its surface has been polluted by an intermediate-mass former companion star or a nova system that involves a massive ONe white dwarf. Using a population synthesis model, we show that the nova scenario can lead to the observed level of Li enhancement and also provide an explanation for Li-rich stars without companions and those with massive compact companions.

 - **Abstract**
 Estimating the exoplanet scientific productivity of the Habitable Worlds Observatory requires estimating science exposure times. From exoplanet yields to spectral retrievals, exposure times are at the heart of our understanding of the capabilities of this future mission. As such, ensuring accuracy and consistency between different exposure time calculators (ETCs) is critical. We summarize the efforts of the Exoplanet Science Yield sub-Working Group's ETC Calibration Task Group, which conducted a calibration study from March 4 to June 30 of 2024. We compare three commonly-used coronagraphic exposure time calculators. We find that the ETCs use a broad variety of differing methods, assumptions, and inputs that produce variation in the final exposure times at the ~60% level. The causes for the disagreement have largely been identified, flagged for further development efforts, and in some cases retired since the conclusion of this effort. We expect that addressing the flagged efforts will bring the ETCs to within better than ~30% agreement.

          Transfer Learning for Transient Classification: From Simulations to Real Data and ZTF to LSST

 - **Abstract**
 Machine learning has become essential for automated classification of astronomical transients, but current approaches face significant limitations: classifiers trained on simulations struggle with real data, models developed for one survey cannot be easily applied to another, and new surveys require prohibitively large amounts of labelled training data. These challenges are particularly pressing as we approach the era of the Vera Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), where existing classification models will need to be retrained using LSST observations. We demonstrate that transfer learning can overcome these challenges by repurposing existing models trained on either simulations or data from other surveys. Starting with a model trained on simulated Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) light curves, we show that transfer learning reduces the amount of labelled real ZTF transients needed by 75\% while maintaining equivalent performance to models trained from scratch. Similarly, when adapting ZTF models for LSST simulations, transfer learning achieves 95\% of the baseline performance while requiring only 30\% of the training data. These findings have significant implications for the early operations of LSST, suggesting that reliable automated classification will be possible soon after the survey begins, rather than waiting months or years to accumulate sufficient training data.

          ELemental abundances of Planets and brown dwarfs Imaged around Stars (ELPIS): II. The Jupiter-like Inhomogeneous Atmosphere of the First Directly Imaged Planetary-Mass Companion 2MASS 1207 b

 - **Abstract**
 2MASS 1207 b, the first directly imaged planetary-mass companion, has been instrumental in advancing our understanding of exoplanets and brown dwarfs over the past 20 years. We have performed extensive atmospheric retrieval analyses of 2MASS 1207 b's JWST/NIRSpec spectrum using petitRADTRANS and a new atmospheric inhomogeneity framework, which characterizes homogeneous atmospheres, patchy clouds, cloud-free hot spots, or the combination of patchy clouds and spots. Among 24 retrieval runs with various assumptions, the most statistically preferred model corresponds to the patchy cloud scheme, with Teff$=1174^{+4}_{-3}$ K, log(g)=$3.62^{+0.03}_{-0.02}$ dex, and R$=1.399^{+0.008}_{-0.010}$ R$_{\rm Jup}$, along with near-solar atmospheric compositions of [M/H]$=-0.05\pm0.03$ dex and C/O$=0.440\pm0.012$. This model suggests ~9% of 2MASS 1207 b's atmosphere is covered by thin iron clouds, producing L-dwarf-like spectra, while the remaining 91% consists of thick silicate and iron clouds, emitting blackbody-like spectra. These thin-cloud and thick-cloud regions resemble Jupiter's belts and zones, respectively; this scenario is consistently supported by other retrieval runs incorporating inhomogeneous atmospheres. We demonstrate that 2MASS 1207 b's weak CO absorption can be explained by the veiling effects of patchy thick clouds; the absence of 3.3um CH4 absorption is attributed to its hot thermal structure, which naturally leads to a CO-dominant, CH4-deficient atmosphere. The retrieved atmospheric models also match the observed variability amplitudes of 2MASS 1207 b. Our analysis reveals that the inferred atmospheric properties show significant scatter in less statistically preferred retrieval runs but converge to consistent values among the preferred ones. This underscores the importance of exploring diverse assumptions in retrievals to avoid biased interpretations of atmospheres and formation.

 - **Abstract**
 The spectrum of a galaxy is a complicated convolution of many properties of the galaxy, such as the star formation history (SFH), initial mass function, and metallicity. Inferring galaxy properties from the observed spectrum via spectral synthesis modeling is thus challenging. In particular, a simple yet flexible model for the SFH is required to obtain unbiased inferences. In this paper, we use SFHs from the IllustrisTNG and EAGLE simulations to test SFH models in their capabilities of describing the simulated SFHs and the spectra generated from them. In addition to some commonly used SFH models ($\Gamma$, $\tau$, and non-parametric), we also examine a model developed from the principal component analysis (PCA) trained by a set of SFHs from IllustrisTNG. We find that when using the first 5 principal components (eigen-histories), the PCA-based model can achieve a good balance between simplicity and accuracy. Among all the SFH models, the PCA-based model is the best in matching the simulated SFHs. To accurately reproduce the spectra generated from the simulated SFHs, it is necessary to have a degree of freedom to describe the most recent SFH (e.g., a step function covering the age of 0 - 0.3 Gyr). Overall, the PCA+step model performs the best in covering the diversity of SFHs and in reproducing the input spectra, thus providing a reliable SFH model for spectral synthesis modeling.

          Halting the migration of super-Earths by efficient gap opening in radiative, low viscosity disks

 - **Abstract**
 While planet migration has been extensively studied for classical viscous disks, planet-disk interaction in nearly inviscid disks has mostly been explored with greatly simplified thermodynamics. In such environments, motivated by models of wind-driven accretion disks, even Earth-mass planets located interior to 1 au can significantly perturb the disk, carving gaps and exciting vortices on their edges. Both processes are influenced by radiative transfer, which can both drive baroclinic forcing and influence gap opening. We perform a set of high-resolution radiation hydrodynamics simulations of planet-disk interaction in the feedback and gap-opening regimes, aiming to understand the role of radiation transport in the migration of super-Earth-mass planets representative of the observed exoplanet population. We find that radiative cooling drives baroclinic forcing during multiple stages of the planet's migration in the feedback regime (~1.5 M_earth), significantly delaying the onset of vortex formation at the gap edge but ultimately resulting in type-III runaway migration episodes. For super-thermal-mass planets (~6.7 M_earth), radiative cooling is fundamentally linked to the gap opening process, with the planet stalling instead of undergoing vortex-assisted migration as expected from isothermal or adiabatic models. This stalling of migration can only be captured when treating radiative effects, and since it affects super-thermal-mass planets its implications for both the final configuration of planetary systems and population synthesis modeling are potentially huge. Combining our findings with previous related studies, we present a map of migration regimes for radiative, nearly-inviscid disks, with the cooling-mediated gap-opening regime playing a central role in determining the planet's orbital properties.

          "Frog-eyes" in Astronomy: Monitoring Binary Radial Velocity Variations Through A Pair of Narrow-Band Filters
 - **Authors:** Chuanjie Zheng, Yang Huang, Jifeng Liu, Hongrui Gu, Hong Wu, Youjun Lu, Yongkang Sun, Henggeng Han, Song Wang, Timothy C. Beers, Kai Xiao, Zhirui Li, Boweng Zhang, Yongna Mao, Zhengyang Li, Hangxin Ji

 - **Abstract**
 Spectroscopic observations are a crucial step in driving major discoveries in the era of time-domain surveys. However, the pace of current spectroscopic surveys is increasingly unable to meet the demands of rapidly advancing large-scale time-domain surveys. To address this issue, we propose the ``Frog-eyes" system, which employs a pair of narrow-band filters: one positioned near a strong absorption line to capture signals from Doppler shifts, and the other placed on the adjacent continuum to monitor intrinsic variations. The combination of observations from the two filters enables the extraction of radial velocity (RV) curves from a large sample of binary stars, and is particularly efficient for single-lined binaries (SB1), using photometric techniques. Comprehensive mock simulations on SB1 demonstrate that the binary orbital parameters can be precisely measured from the extracted RV curves for binary systems where the primary star has an effective temperature greater than 6000 K. With a typical ground-based photometric precision of approximately 0.3%, the uncertainties in the derived semi-amplitude K and eccentricity e are less than 10% and 0.1, respectively, for binary systems with K $\ge$ 30 km/s. These encouraging results are further validated by real observations of the hot subdwarf-white dwarf binary system HD 265435, using a non-specialized ``Frog-eyes" system installed on the Chinese 2.16m telescope. Once this system is properly installed on large-field-of-view survey telescopes, the rate of acquiring RV curves for binaries will approach their detection rate in leading time-domain photometric surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 Using radial velocity to estimate binary fraction and predict orbital parameter distribution laws is an important method in the studies of binary stars. However, the high dimensionality of the orbital parameters of the binary system pose challenges to this work, particularly in terms of sample size and the accuracy of the calculated results. We have proposed and implemented an algorithm called DVCD (Differential Velocity Cumulative Distribution) for the statistical analysis of binary properties. % On the basis of higher accuracy than previous methods, the running efficiency of the method is greatly improved. This method not only achieves higher accuracy than previous approaches but also significantly improves computational efficiency. The computing time for the same sample and the hardware environment was reduced to $10^{-4}$ to $10^{-5}$ of that of some previous methods. Red giant samples from APOGEE DR16 were analyzed using the DVCD method. Both the hyperparameter of the orbital period $\pi$ and the intrinsic binary fraction ($f_{bin}$) can be constrained. We divided the sample into 16 subsets based on log$g$ and $M/H$. Calculation results showed that the binary fraction decreases with the decrease of surface gravity and decreases with the increase of metallicity. This trend provides important constraints on the evolution of binary stars.

 - **Abstract**
 As part of the bulge Cluster APOgee Survey (CAPOS), high-resolution, high Signal-to-Noise Ratio Near-Infrared spectroscopy, we aim to conduct the most robust chemical study to date for NGC 6316, deriving abundances for a number of elements with a variety of nucleosynthetic origins, most of which have never been studied before in this cluster. We use the Brussels Automatic Code for Characterizing High accuracy Spectra (BACCHUS) with atmospheric parameters photometrically obtained in order to determine, for the first time, abundances for C, N, O, Mg, Al, Si, P, K, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni and Ce for this cluster. We obtained a mean metallicity [Fe/H] = -0.87 +- 0.02, finding no indication of an intrinsic metallicity spread. Our metallicity agrees with the most recent values from other studies, revising earlier values that were ~0.5 dex metal-richer. With this new value, this cluster, long believed to be a member of the classical metal-rich group of bulge GCs around -0.5, now falls in the dominant bulge globular cluster peak around [Fe/H] = -1. The cluster presents a clear C-N anticorrelation. We also found a [{\alpha}/Fe] = 0.3 +- 0.02. Our abundances show similar behaviour to other in situ globular clusters with comparable metallicity. We obtained E(B-V) = 0.71 and (M-m)_0 = 15.32 +- 0.05 by isochrone fitting, in good agreement with the recent determinations from other works. We derive an overall metallicity [M/H] = -0.6 +- 0.05 by isochrone fitting, in agreement with our abundance determination. According to the mean [Mg/Fe] and [Al/Fe] abundances from first population stars, NGC 6316 is an in-situ globular cluster, in accordance with various dynamical classifications.

 - **Abstract**
 We performed a large-scale spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting analysis for young stellar objects (YSOs) in the Orion star formation complex (OSFC) to derive key physical parameters; temperature, luminosity, mass, and age, using SED models. Our goal is to establish a statistically robust characterization of the stellar population and its evolutionary state across the entire complex. We utilize a set of new radiative transfer model SEDs that span a variety of geometries and parameter spaces. These SEDs are fitted to multi-wavelength photometric data from optical to submillimeter wavelengths. We conducted SED fitting on a sample of 15,396 sources. Among these, 5,062 have at least a reliable AllWISE W3 (12~$\mu$m) detection at longer wavelengths, and 63 have sub-millimeter detections in APEX/SABOCA at 350~$\mu$m or APEX/LABOCA at 870~$\mu$m. The resulting physical parameters are cross-referenced with stellar evolutionary tracks to ensure consistency with theoretical predictions. Sources placed on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram show distinct evolutionary sequences. The results are provided with varying levels of completeness and reliability, depending on the available data for each source. The catalog includes quality indicators such as the flux code, which represents the longest detected wavelength for each source, as well as Prob_W3 and Prob_W4 values that quantify the reliability of the AllWISE W3 and W4 detections. All results, including SED fitting outcomes, uncertainty estimates, and source metadata, are publicly available in a comprehensive CDS table. This dataset provides a statistically significant view of the evolutionary processes within the OSFC. The publicly accessible dataset offers a valuable resource for future studies on star and planet formation.

          Variability of Central Stars of Planetary Nebulae with the Zwicky Transient Facility. II. Long-Timescale Variables including Wide Binary and Late Thermal Pulse Candidates

 - **Abstract**
 In this second paper on the variability survey of central stars of planetary nebulae (CSPNe) using ZTF, we focus on the 11 long-timescale variables with variability timescales ranging from months to years. We also present preliminary analyses based on spectroscopic and/or photometric follow-up observations for six of them. Among them is NGC 6833, which shows a 980 day periodic variability with strange characteristics: 'triangle-shaped' brightening in $r$, $i$, and WISE bands but almost coincidental shallow dips in the $g$-band. We speculate this to be a wide but eccentric binary with the same orbital period. Long-period near-sinusoidal variability was detected in two other systems, NGC 6905 and Kn 26, with periods of 700 days and 230 days, respectively, making them additional wide-binary candidates. The latter also shows a short period at 1.18 hours which can either be from a close inner binary or pulsational origin. We present CTSS 2 and PN K 3-5 which show brightening and significant reddening over the whole ZTF baseline. A stellar model fit to the optical spectrum of CTSS 2 reveals it to be one of the youngest post-AGB CSPN known. Both show high-density emission-line cores. These appear to be late thermal pulse candidates, currently evolving towards the AGB phase, though alternative explanations are possible. We then present recent HST/COS ultraviolet spectroscopy of the known wide-binary candidate LoTr 1 showing that the hot star is a spectroscopic twin of the extremely hot white dwarf in UCAC2 46706450. We think that the long photometric period of 11 years is the binary orbital period. Finally, we briefly discuss the ZTF light curves of the remaining variables, namely Tan 2, K 3-20, WHTZ 3, Kn J1857+3931, and IPHAS J1927+0814. With these examples, we present the effectiveness of the von Neumann statistics and Pearson Skew-based metric space in searching for long-timescale variables.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a chemo-dynamical study conducted with 2dF$+$AAOmega of $\sim 6000$ Gaia DR3 non-variable candidate metal-poor stars that lie in the direction of the Galactic plane. Our spectral analysis reveals 15 new extremely metal-poor (EMP) stars, with the lowest metallicity at $\rm{[Fe/H]} = -4.0 \pm 0.2$ dex. Two of the EMP stars are also carbon enhanced, with the largest enhancement of $\rm{[C/Fe]} = 1.3 \pm 0.1$ occurring in a dwarf. Using our $\rm{[C/Fe]}$ results, we demonstrate that the number of carbon-depleted stars decreases with lower metallicities, and the fraction of carbon-enhanced stars increases, in agreement with previous studies. Our dynamical analysis reveals that the fraction of prograde and retrograde disk stars, defined as $z_{\rm max} < 3$ kpc, with $J_{\phi}/J_{\rm tot} > 0.75$ and $J_{\phi}/J_{\rm tot} < -0.75$ respectively, changes as metallicities decrease. Disk stars on retrograde orbits make up $\sim 10$% of all the stars in our sample with metallicities below $-2.1$ dex. Interestingly, the portion of retrograde disk stars compared with the number of kinematically classified halo stars is approximately constant at $4.6$% for all metallicities below $-1.5$ dex. We also see that $J_{\phi}$ increases from $380 \pm 50$ to $1320 \pm 90$ km s$^{-1}$ kpc across metallicity range $-1.5$ to $-1.1$, consistent with the spin-up of the Galactic disk. Over the metallicity range $-3.0 < \rm{[Fe/H]} < -2.0$, the slopes of the metallicity distribution functions for the prograde and retrograde disk stars are similar and comparable to that for the halo population. Detailed chemical analyses on high resolution spectra are needed to distinguish the different contributions. Finally, we show that our spectroscopic parameters reveal serious systematics in the metallicities published in recent studies that apply various machine learning techniques to Gaia XP spectra.

          FAUST-XXII. Deuteration in the VLA1623-2417 protostellar hot-corinos, cavities, and streamers

 - **Abstract**
 The study of deuterium fractionation is a valuable tool for reconstructing our chemical history from the early prestellar stages to the formation of planets. In the context of the ALMA Large Programme FAUST, we observed formaldehyde, H$_2$CO, and its singly and doubly deuterated forms, HDCO and D$_2$CO, towards the protostellar cluster VLA1623-2417, on scales of ~ 2000 - 50 au. Formaldehyde probes the inner envelopes of the protostars VLA1623A, B, and W, the rotating cavities opened by the VLA1623A outflow, and several streamers. The HDCO and D$_2$CO emissions are observed towards VLA1623A, in its outflow cavities, and in one of the streamers. We estimate the gas temperature from the HDCO lines: T~ 125 K towards VLA1623A, indicating hot-corino emission, lower temperatures in the outflow cavities (20 - 40 K), and in the streamers ($\le15$ K). The D$_2$CO lines also trace the flattened envelope of VLA1623A, where H$_2$CO and HDCO are fainter. This may be due to D$_2$CO formation on dust grains in the cold prestellar phase, and subsequent photodesorption caused by the enhanced UV flux from two nearby B stars. We inferred the molecular deuteration: [HDCO]/[H$_2$CO] ~ 0.16, ~ 0.07 - 0.13, and ~ 0.3; [D$_2$CO]/[H$_2$CO] ~ 0.003, ~ 0.05 - 0.13, and ~ 0.03 in the hot corino, in the outflow cavities, and in the streamer, respectively. The spatial distribution of D$_2$CO, which points to formation on dust grains, and the similar values of [HDCO]/[H$_2$CO] and [D$_2$CO]/[H$_2$CO] in the components of the system, suggest that deuterium fractionation occurs at the prestellar stage and is then inherited, mostly unaltered, in the protostellar phase.

 - **Abstract**
 A strong first-order phase transition in a dark sector may produce all or part of the low-frequency gravitational wave signal recently reported by the NANOGrav Collaboration and other pulsar timing arrays. Here we point out, with a simple toy model, that even if the amplitude of the gravitational wave background from the dark phase transition is insufficient to match the NANOGrav signal, a modified expansion rate at early times may considerably enhance the gravitational wave signal. In particular, a faster-than-standard expansion rate, triggered, for instance, by the presence of one or more additional sources of energy density redshifting with higher powers of temperatures than radiation, boosts upper limits on the gravitational wave signal from first-order cosmological phase transitions, enlarging the slate of possible dark sector scenarios matching the NANOGrav signal.

 - **Abstract**
 In active galactic nuclei, jet-driven feedback plays a significant role in influencing the properties of gas within their host galaxy and the circumgalactic medium. By combining observations from the Very Large Array Sky Survey, the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-cm, the LOFAR Two Metre Sky Survey, and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we assembled a sample of 3,141 radio-loud quasars, among which 418 exhibit \mgii\ associated absorption lines in their Sloan spectra. We classify these quasars into evolutionary stages based on their radio spectral shapes. Our analysis reveals that evolved quasars exhibit a significantly higher incidence of \mgii\ associated absorption lines compared to younger sources, particularly among quasars with ``non-peaked'' radio spectra, which show an incidence of \mgii\ associated absorbers approximately 1.7 times greater than that of gigahertz-peaked spectrum sources. This observation can be explained effectively by jet-driven feedback. As quasars age, their jets expand and expel substantial amounts of gas from small scales to larger scales, ultimately reaching the circumgalactic medium. The gas expelled from the inner regions and distributed over larger scales results in a greater coverage fraction of absorbing gas. Consequently, evolved quasars exhibit a higher incidence of \mgii\ absorption lines.

 - **Abstract**
 This study develops a robust framework for exoplanet characterization by leveraging asteroseismic constraints on host stars. Using precise photometric data from missions such as \textit{Kepler} and \textit{TESS}, we derive stellar parameters, including mass, radius, and age, with high accuracy through asteroseismic analysis. These stellar parameters are incorporated as priors in a Bayesian framework to refine planetary properties such as mass, radius, and orbital parameters. By applying Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, we extract posterior distributions of planetary parameters, achieving significant improvements in precision and reliability. This approach is particularly effective for systems with evolved host stars, where precise stellar properties are essential for resolving uncertainties in planetary characterization. The results demonstrate the importance of asteroseismology in bridging stellar astrophysics and exoplanet science, enabling detailed studies of planetary system architectures and their dependence on host star properties. Our methodology underscores the synergy between stellar and planetary studies, paving the way for future research on exoplanet populations. This work provides a foundation for utilizing data from upcoming missions like \textit{PLATO}, ensuring continued advancements in the precision and scope of exoplanet characterization.

 - **Abstract**
 Frequency Phase Transfer (FPT) is a technique designed to increase coherence and sensitivity in radio interferometry by making use of the non-dispersive nature of the troposphere to calibrate high-frequency data using solutions derived at a lower frequency. While the Korean VLBI Network has pioneered the use of simultaneous multi-band systems for routine FPT up to an observing frequency of 130 GHz, this technique remains largely untested in the (sub)millimeter regime. A recent effort has been made to outfit dual-band systems at (sub)millimeter observatories participating in the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) and to test the feasibility and performance of FPT up to the observing frequencies of the EHT. We present the results of simultaneous dual-frequency observations conducted in January 2024 on an Earth-sized baseline between the IRAM 30-m in Spain and the JCMT and SMA in Hawai`i. We performed simultaneous observations at 86 and 215 GHz on the bright sources J0958+6533 and OJ287, with strong detections obtained at both frequencies. We observe a strong correlation between the interferometric phases at the two frequencies, matching the trend expected for atmospheric fluctuations and demonstrating for the first time the viability of FPT for VLBI at a wavelength of $\sim$1 millimeter. We show that the application of FPT systematically increases the 215 GHz coherence on all averaging timescales. In addition, the use of the co-located JCMT and SMA as a single dual-frequency station demonstrates the feasibility of paired-antenna FPT for VLBI for the first time, with implications for future array capabilities (e.g., ALMA sub-arraying and ngVLA calibration strategies).

 - **Abstract**
 We identified blue straggler stars (BSSs) in 53 open clusters utilizing data from Gaia DR3. Most of these clusters are situated in the outer regions of the Galactic disc, encompassing structures such as the warp and the Outer arm. We analyzed their astrometric parameters and determined that 48 of them demonstrate high reliability in radial density profile. Furthermore, through manual isochrone fitting and visual inspection, we confirmed 119 BSS candidates and identified 328 additional possible candidates within these clusters. Our results contribute to a 46% increase in the sample size of BSSs in open clusters for regions of the Galactic disc where Rgc > 12 kpc. We observed that the new samples are fainter compared to those identified in the past. Additionally, we investigated the maximum fractional mass excess (Me) of the BSSs in open clusters, including previously published BSS samples. Our findings indicate a strong correlation between the capability to produce highest-Me BSSs and the mass of their host clusters. This observation appears to reinforce a fundamental principle whereby an increase in the mass of a star cluster correlates with a higher likelihood of stellar mergers. In contrast, we observe minimal correlation between maximum-Me and the cluster age. Among clusters containing BSSs, younger clusters (0.5 to 1 Gyr) display a scarcity of high-Me BSSs. This scarcity may be attributed to the absence of more massive clusters within this age range.

 - **Abstract**
 The detection of primordial B-modes, a key probe of cosmic inflation, is increasingly challenged by contamination from weak gravitational lensing B-modes induced by large-scale structure (LSS). We present a delensing pipeline designed to enhance the sensitivity to the inflationary parameter r, minimizing reliance on foreground mitigation during lensing reconstruction. Using simulations of Simons Observatory-like CMB observations and Euclid-like LSS surveys in the Northern hemisphere, we demonstrate that excluding low-l modes (l<200) effectively mitigates foreground biases, enabling robust lensing potential reconstruction using observed CMB polarization maps. We reconstruct the lensing potential with a minimum-variance (MV) quadratic estimator (QE) applied to CMB polarization data and combine this with external LSS tracers to improve delensing efficiency. Two complementary methods, the Gradient-order template and the Inverse-lensing approach, are used to generate lensing B-mode templates, which are cross-correlated with observed B-modes. This achieves a 40 percent reduction in the uncertainty of r with CMB-only reconstruction, improving to 60 percent when incorporating external LSS tracers. We validate our results using both the Hamimeche and Lewis likelihood and a Gaussian approximation, finding consistent constraints on r. Our work establishes a streamlined framework for ground-based CMB experiments, demonstrating that synergies with LSS surveys significantly enhance sensitivity to primordial gravitational waves.

 - **Abstract**
 From observations, column density ratios or integrated intensity ratios between some species exhibit monotonic increase or decrease along with the evolution of high-mass star-forming regions (HMSFRs). Such ratios are defined as chemical clocks, which can be used to constrain the evolutionary stage. We performed chemical simulations to reproduce the observed column density ratio of HC3N/N2H+ and the abundances of these two species across various evolutionary stages in HMSFRs. Simultaneously, we identified the chemical processes responsible for the observed time-dependent trends in these stages. Our simulations utilized the astrochemical code Nautilus and the existing 1D models of HMSFRs that cover four evolutionary stages, accompanied by variations in density and temperature throughout the entire evolution. When averaging over large spatial scales, the best model produced successfully matches the observed column density ratio of HC3N/N2H+ and the abundances of the species involved at specific times for each evolutionary stage; that is, the late high-mass starless core stage, the early high-mass protostellar object stage, and the early ultracompact HII stage. HC3N is mainly affected by the warm carbon-chain chemistry (WCCC) and its own thermal desorption, while N2H+ is primarily influenced by the thermal desorption of N2, CO, CH4, NH3, and H2O followed by dissociative recombination and ion-molecule reactions. The results obtained from the best-fitting model timescales broadly agree with statistical estimates. Based on our best-fit model, we further examined other 350 ratios involving 27 species, and 178 ratios exhibit an increasing or decreasing evolutionary trend around the best-fit timescales of HC3N/N2H+. Among them, 157 ratios are observable and could be considered as candidate chemical clocks.

 - **Abstract**
 Quasar feedback is routinely invoked as an indispensable ingredient in galaxy formation models. Galactic outflows are a crucial agent of quasar feedback that frequently manifest themselves in absorption and emission lines. Measuring the size and energetics of outflows based on absorption lines remains a challenge, and integral-field spectroscopy (IFS) mapping in emission lines is complementary. We present a VLT/SINFONI IFS mapping of quasar 3C 191 at $z \sim 2$, in which the outflow has been analyzed in absorption line spectroscopy. Three components are found based on the morphology and kinetics of [OIII]-emitting gas: a unshifted component which consistent with the systemic redshift and the location of the nucleus, a blueshifted in the north, and a redshifted in the south. The latter two components have velocities $\sim$ 600 km s$^{-1}$ and projected extents of 5 and 11 kpc, respectively, suggesting a biconical outflow structure. The blueshifted component's velocity is consistent with that derived from absorption lines. Using the electron density measured by the absorption lines and the luminosity and velocity of [OIII] outflow, we derive the mass outflow rate to be $\dot{M} \sim $ 9.5-13.4 M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ and kinetic luminosity $\dot{E}_{\rm kin}$ ~ 2.5-3.7 $\times 10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$, consistent with absorption line analyses with VLT/Xshooter spectrum. The kinetic luminosity is only 0.01% of the bolometric luminosity, rendering a relatively weak outflow compared to typical expectation for effective feedback.

          Origin of the lunar inclination from tidal interaction of multiple-moon system

 - **Abstract**
 According to the giant impact theory, the Moon formed through accreting the debris disk produced by Theia colliding with the early Earth and the predicted lunar inclination is about within one degree when Moon formed. However, the current lunar orbital inclination with five degrees requires the Moon's orbital inclination relative to the Earth's equator to be about ten degrees when traced back to the time of lunar formation. Since two moons are also a natural outcome of simulations of lunar formation from a protolunar disk produced a giant impact, here we show that, under solar perturbation, gravitational tidal interaction between Earth and two moons with orbital inclination of one degree relative to Earth's equatorial plane could lead to the merger of one moon with Earth, or the merger of the two moons or the ejection of one moon, resulting that the remaining moon's orbital inclination relative to Earth's equator could be up to 15 degrees. The theory proposed here may provide a way of explaining the initial large lunar inclination relative to the Earth's equator.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the properties of neutron stars with antikaon condensation in the framework of the Relativistic Mean-Field (RMF) model with a $\sigma$-cut potential. The well-known RMF models, TM1 and TM1e, are used to analyze the structure and composition of neutron stars. The antikaon condensation part of the equation of state (EoS) is constrained from the experimental data of K$^{-}$ atomic and kaon-nucleon scattering. The $\sigma$-cut potential, which is known to make the EoS stiffer at high densities, is modulated by a free parameter $f_{s}$. Our present analysis suggests that one can obtain neutron star configurations heavier than 2$M_{\odot}$ with antikaon condensates in most cases for $f_{s}$ = 0.6. The antikaon phase transition is a second-order for $f_{s}$ = 0.6 for both TM1 and TM1e parameter sets. The calculated global properties of neutron stars with antikaon condensates i.e., mass and radius seem to be in resonable agreement with other theoretical and observational data.

 - **Abstract**
 SN~2022pul gains special attention due to its possible origin of a super-Chandarsekhar-mass white dwarf explosion (or called a 03fg-like type Ia supernova), which shows prominent [O\,{\sc i}], [Ne\,{\sc i}], and [Ca\,{\sc ii}] lines in its late-time spectra taken at $\sim+$300 days after the peak brightness. In this paper, we present new optical observations for this peculiar object, extending up to over 500 days after the peak brightness. In particular, in the $t\approx+515$ days spectrum, we identified for the first time the presence of narrow emission from [C\,{\sc i}] $\lambda\lambda9824, 9850$, which appears asymmetric and quite similar to the accompanied [O\,{\sc i}] $\lambda6300$ line in strength and profile. Based on the violent merger model that accounts well for previous observations but leaves little carbon in the center of the ejecta, this carbon line can be reproduced by increasing the degree of clumping in the ejecta and setting the carbon mass the same as that of oxygen ($\sim$0.06 $M_{\odot}$) in the innermost region ($\lesssim 2000$ km s$^{-1}$). In principle, the central carbon could come from the secondary white dwarf (WD) if it is ignited when hit by the shockwave of the explosion of the primary WD and explodes as a Ca-rich supernova, whereas pure deflagration of a super-Chandarsekhar-mass WD can account for such unburnt carbon more naturally.

 "Fluffy" hydrogenated amorphouscarbon(a-C:H)wassynthesizedusingadielectric barrier discharge plasma, driven by nanosec ond high voltage pulses at 1 kHz frequency in a helium-butane mixture. The a-C:H samples were characterized by scanning and transmission electron microscopy, laser-assisted and secondary ion mass spectrometry, and Raman and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. We find that a-C:H samples exhibit infrared absorption features in good agreement with those observed for carbonaceous dust in IRAS 08572+3915 galaxy. We discuss their nano to microscale structure and derive their hydrogen to carbon (H/C) ratios from the results obtained by three distinct experimental characterization techniques. Relying on the average H/C value determined by mass spectrometry and Raman spectroscopy, we can then constrain the absorption strengths values to those best corresponding to our dust analogue, and calculate the H/C ratio from the infrared spectra. Altogether, we find that our dust analogue consists of a dominant hydrogen-rich aliphatic network, with small, isolated, aromatic regions. The a-C:H dust analogue was then irradiated with 3 MeV H+ and subsequently analyzed ex situ. Morphological and chemical changes, including the evolution of H/C, CH2/CH3, and sp2/sp3 ratios, were observed with increasing proton fluence, indicating dehydrogenation and graphitization. Proton bombardment shifted the initial location of a-C:H in the hydrocarbon ternary phase diagram toward the central region defined by IRAS 08572+3915 observations. The decay of the 3.4 {\mu}m band with proton fluence was used to calculate CH destruction cross-sections, results consistent with a direct effect of cosmic rays on the disappearance of the 3.4 {\mu}m band.

 - **Abstract**
 In recent years, afterglow emission in the very-high-energy (VHE) band above 100 GeV have been clearly detected for at least five gamma-ray bursts (GRBs 180720B, 190114C, 190829A, 201216C and 221009A). For some of these VHE GRBs, we previously proposed a two-component jet model, consisting of two uniform jets with narrow and wide opening angles to explain their multiwavelength afterglows including VHE gamma rays. In this paper, we show that the VHE emission from GRBs 201216C and 221009A can be also explained by our two-component jet model. We find that the collimation-corrected kinetic energy of the five VHE GRBs have typical values of 5\times10^{49} erg and 5\times10^{50} erg for the narrow and wide jets, respectively. We discuss the similarities and differences among the VHE GRBs, and the implications for the structure of their jets. In particular, the narrow jet of GRB 221009A has a smaller opening angle, which can explain why its isotropic-equivalent energy is unusually large.

 - **Abstract**
 Nulling interferometry is a promising technique for direct detection of exoplanets. However, the performance of current devices is limited by different perturbations sources and especially by its sensitivity to any phase aberrations. The work presented here attempts to overcome those limitations by using a four-telescopes nulling interferometer architecture, called Kernel-Nuller, which includes a recombiner that positions the four signals in phase quadrature. This architecture is based on an integrated optical component containing 14 electronically controlled phase shifters, used to correct optical path differences that would be induced by manufacturing defects. The first part of the study consists in the development of an algorithm providing the delays to be injected into the component to optimize the performance of that device. The next step of this study deals with the analysis of the intensity distributions produced at the output of the Kernel-Nuller through a series of observations. Then we apply statistical tests and data treatment techniques to detect the signature of an exoplanets.

 - **Abstract**
 Non-thermal particle acceleration in the solar corona is evident from both remote hard X-ray (HXR) sources in the chromosphere and direct in-situ detection in the heliosphere. Correlation of spectral indices between remote and in-situ energy spectra presents the possibility of a common source acceleration region within the corona, however the properties and location of this region are not well constrained. To investigate this we perform a parameter study for both the properties of the ambient plasma of a simulated acceleration region and the turbulent acceleration profile acting on an initially isotropic thermal electron population. We find that the independently varying the turbulent acceleration timescale $\tau_{acc}$, acceleration profile standard deviation ${\sigma}$ and acceleration region length L result in in-situ spectral index variation of between 0.5 and 2.0 at 1.0 AU for < 100 keV electrons. Short timescale turbulent scattering in the flaring corona steepens the spectra by $\sim$ 0.5. It was also found that the in-situ spectral index $\delta$ derived from the peak electron flux produces a spectral index $\sim$ 1.6 harder than that from a full-flare X-ray photon flux (of spectral index $\gamma$) simulated with the same intermediate parameters. Previous studies have indicated an approximate $\delta \approx \gamma$ relationship for selected flares with measured in-situ electron and X-ray photon observations, suggesting that an extended source region with non-uniform plasma and/or acceleration properties may be necessary to reproduce this relationship.

 Big bounce cosmology provides a solution to the Universe's initial singularity, and stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) searches offer a promising avenue for testing this paradigm. In this work, we establish an analytical relation between the bouncing energy scale, $\rho_{s\downarrow}^{1/4}$, and SGWB spectrum, $\Omega_\mathrm{GW}(f)h^2$, for big bounce cosmology. By combining sensitivities from major GW detectors (e.g., Planck/BICEP, PTA, and LIGO/Virgo across low, medium, and high frequencies, respectively), we provide the first systematic GW constraint on $\rho_{s\downarrow}^{1/4}$. Our results show that the region $-\tfrac{1}{3} < w_1 < -0.17$ is excluded by current SGWB searches, given the constraint $\rho_{s\downarrow}^{1/4} > 1~\mathrm{TeV}$, where $w_1$ is the contraction-phase equation of state parameter. Additionally, no detectable SGWB can be generated for $0.038 < w_1 < \infty$ with $\rho_{s\downarrow}^{1/4} < 10^{16}~\mathrm{TeV}$. We identify a window, $-0.17 < w_1 < 0.038$, in which a detectable SGWB can be produced, disfavoring nearly all big bounce models except for the matter-dominated contraction model ($w_1 \simeq 0$).

 - **Abstract**
 Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), a class of millisecond-scale, highly energetic phenomena with unknown progenitors and radiation mechanisms, require proper statistical analysis as a key method for uncovering their mysteries. In this research, we build upon the bias correction method using pulse injections for the first CHIME/FRB catalog, to include correlations between properties, and to analyze the FRB population spectrum. This model includes six FRB properties: dispersion measure (DM), pulse width, scattering timescale, spectral index, spectral running, and fluence. By applying the multidimensional weight function calculated by the model, we update the corrected distributions, suggesting that more low-DM, short and long-width, and short-scattering timescale events may exist. Using one-off events and the first bursts from repeaters, the derived intrinsic population spectrum has a best-fit power-law of $F(\nu)\propto\nu^{\alpha}$, where $\alpha=-2.29\pm0.29$. This confirms previous indications that FRBs are brighter or more numerous at low frequencies. Analysing non-repeaters only, we find $\alpha=-2.50\pm0.43$, while including all bursts from repeaters produces $\alpha=-1.91\pm0.20$. This hints that active repeaters, low-rate repeaters, and non-repeaters may have different progenitors, mechanisms, or evolutionary stage.

 Among the biogenic macroelements, phosphorus is the one bringing the most fascinating and unsolved mysteries for what concern its prebiotic history. It possibly landed on Earth as a metal phosphide (Schreibersite, (Fe,Ni)3P), throughout the Heavy Meteor Bombardment during the Archean Era. Its subsequent corrosion by water led to P-oxygenated compounds, which is the subject of this kinetic computational study, thus complementing our previous thermodynamic characterization. The reaction was studied at periodic DFT level, simulating the water corrosion reaction on the reactive Fe2NiP Schreibersite (001)2 surface. Results show that the timescale of the reaction at 350 K is of few hours.

 - **Abstract**
 The proposal for a sudden sign-switching cosmological constant $\Lambda$ in the local universe, emulating a phase transition from anti-de Sitter (AdS) to de Sitter (dS) space, has markedly revamped the fit to observational data and lays out a propitious framework for ameliorating major cosmological tensions, such as the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions. This proposal is widely known as $\Lambda_s$CDM. We investigate the possibility that $\Lambda$ does not only flip sign at the transition but has also different curvature radii in the AdS and dS phases. We show that the critical redshift of the transition $z_c$ is strongly correlated with the vacuum energy in the AdS phase $\Omega_{\Lambda_-}$, and that these two variables do not correlate strongly with the other cosmological parameters. We also show that the cost of adding an additional parameter to the $\Lambda_s$CDM cosmological model does not improve the goodness of fit. Armed with our findings, we demonstrate that for a proper choice of $z_c$, the vacuum energy in the dS phase may not necessarily be $-\Omega_{\Lambda_-}$, for comparable degree of conformity between the model prediction and experimental data.

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze the electron cosmic-ray spectrum from AMS-02, focusing on the spectral hardening around 42 GeV. Our findings confirm that this feature is intrinsic to the primary electron component rather than a byproduct of contamination from primary positron sources. Even under conservative assumptions, its significance remains at about $7\sigma$, strongly indicating a genuine spectral break. Accordingly, we introduce a new, more realistic parametric fit, which we recommend for the next round of AMS-02 analyses. Once the sources of systematic uncertainties are better constrained, this refined approach can either reinforce or refute our conclusions, providing a clearer understanding of the observed electron spectrum. If confirmed, we propose that this hardening most likely arises from interstellar transport or acceleration effects.

          A strike of luck: could the KM3-230213A event be caused by an evaporating primordial black hole?

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate whether the ultra high energy neutrino inferred by the recent KM3NeT observation could have originated from an evaporating black hole. Given the characteristics of black hole (BH) evaporation mechanism, any object capable of producing particles in the energy range of the detected event (around 100-800 PeV) must have a mass below 10^7 g. No known astrophysical mechanism can generate black holes of such low mass, leaving primordial black holes (PBHs)-potentially formed at the end of cosmic inflation-as the only viable candidates. Black holes with masses below 10^7 g have lifetimes shorter than 10^-5 seconds, meaning PBHs in this mass range should have fully evaporated by now. However, recent studies suggest that quantum effects, collectively referred to as the "memory burden", may slow down black hole evaporation, potentially extending the lifetimes of low-mass PBHs to timescales comparable to or exceeding the Hubble time. We systematically explore the parameter space of memory-burdened PBHs, assuming that they constitute a fraction of the dark matter (f-PBH) within current constraints, and identify viable regions that could explain the KM3-230213A event. We further predict the occurrence rate of similar events and find that KM3NeT's current configuration could test this scenario within a few years.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of stars other than the Sun are sensitive to oscillations of only low degree. Many are high-order acoustic modes. Acoustic frequencies of main-sequence stars, for example, satisfy a well-known pattern, which some astronomers have adopted even for red-giant stars. That is not wise, because the internal structures of these stars can be quite different from those on the Main Sequence, which is populated by stars whose structure is regular. Here I report on pondering this matter, and point out two fundamental deviations from the commonly adopted relation. There are aspects of the regular relation that are connected in a simple way to gross properties of the star, such as the dependence of the eigenfrequencies on the linear combination $n+\textstyle{\frac {1}{2}}l$ of the order $n$ and degree $l$, which is characteristic of a regular spherical acoustic cavity. That is not a feature of red-giant frequencies, because, as experienced by the waves, red-giant stars appear to have (phantom) singular centres, which substantially modify the propagation of waves. That requires a generalization of the eigenfrequency relation, which I present here. When fitted to the observed frequencies of the Sun, the outcome is consistent with the Sun being round, with no singularity in the core. That is hardly novel, but at least it provides some assurance that our understanding of stellar acoustic wave dynamics is on a sound footing.

 - **Abstract**
 Certain spiral density waves in Saturn's rings are generated through resonances with planetary normal modes, making them valuable probes of Saturn's internal structure. Previous research has primarily focused on the rotation rates of these waves. However, other characteristics of these waves also contain valuable information about the planet's interior. In this work, we investigate the amplitudes of the waves across the C-ring by analyzing high signal-to-noise profiles derived from phase-corrected averages of occultation profiles obtained by Cassini's Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS). By fitting these wave profiles to linear density wave models, we estimate the ring's surface mass density, mass extinction coefficient and effective kinematic viscosity at 34 locations in the C-ring, as well as the amplitude of the gravitational potential perturbations associated with 6 satellite resonances and 28 planetary normal mode resonances. Our estimates of the C-ring's mass extinction coefficient, indicate that the typical particle mass density is around 0.3 g/cm^3 interior to 84,000 km, but can get as low as 0.03 g/cm^3 exterior to 84,000 km. We also find the ring's viscosity is reduced in the outer C-ring, which is consistent with the exceptionally high porosity of the particles in this region. Meanwhile, we find the amplitudes of Saturn's normal modes are complex functions of frequency, l and m, implying that multiple factors influence how efficiently these modes are excited. This analysis identified two primary sources of these normal-mode oscillations: a deep source located close to Saturn's core, and a shallow source residing near the surface.

 - **Abstract**
 The preference for dynamical dark energy over the standard $\Lambda$CDM model has gained attention in recent cosmological studies, particularly with results from the DESI experiment. We investigate this claim by analysing tracker scalar field models, which can alleviate the cosmic coincidence problem and transition to a cosmological constant-like behaviour at late times. Focusing on the inverse axionlike and inverse steep exponential potentials, we study their background evolution and perturbations, finding a mild suppression in the matter power spectrum compared to $\Lambda$CDM but no distinguishing features in the bispectrum. Using a combined dataset of ${\rm CMB}+{\rm BAO}+{\rm Pantheon~Plus}+{\rm Hubble\; parameter}+{\rm RSD}$, we perform a statistical comparison based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). Our results indicate that standard $\Lambda$CDM model remains the most favoured model. While the inverse axionlike model is preferred over the inverse steep exponential model in terms of statistical evidence, neither provides compelling support for dynamical dark energy over the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm.

 - **Abstract**
 Recently discovered asteroid 2024 YR$_4$ has an orbital period of almost exactly 4 years, a descending node located almost exactly 1 au from the Sun, with a perihelion slightly less than that. Its combination of semi-major axis and perihelion renders it a 'Potentially Hazardous Object' (PHO) in the Apollo class. It now has a low chance of colliding with the Earth on 22 December 2032, yet there is the potential for many further close encounters with Earth into the distant future. This paper investigates the feasibility of missions to this object in the short term, up to and including its close encounter in 2032, and exploits the preliminary mission design software known as 'Optimum Interplanetary Trajectory Software' (OITS). Many flyby opportunities are found with launch windows virtually throughout 2028. Sample Returns are also eminently feasible over this period. Rendezvous missions with 'New Horizons' spacecraft (adopted as a convenient reference mission) are available, although these require launches around late 2028 and early 2029, and with much longer flight durations. In summary it is found that 2024 YR$_4$ represents an 'opportunity rich environment' and bodes well for any future attempts by humanity to either examine this object close up, or even to deflect it if necessary.

          The End of Easy Phenomenology for CMB Experiments: A Case Study in the Dark Sector

 - **Abstract**
 The precision of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) experiments, specifically its lensing reconstruction, has reached the limit where non-linear corrections cannot be ignored. Neglecting these corrections results in biased constraints on cosmological parameters. In this work, we use lensing data from Planck and the South Pole Telescope third generation camera (SPT-3G) taken in 2018 to highlight the impact of these biases in two ways. First, we estimate the shifts due to ignoring non-linear corrections in $\Lambda$CDM. We find 0.2-0.6$\sigma$ shifts in the Dark Matter (DM) fraction, the Hubble constant, and the amplitude of matter fluctuations at $8 h^{-1}$ Mpc. Second, we estimate the loss in constraining power for not including data sensitive to non-linear corrections. As a case study, we consider two interacting DM models, for which such corrections are not readily available in existing CMB Boltzmann codes. The first one is DM interacting with baryons, while the second is DM interacting with Dark Radiation (DR). For the former case, when we add primary CMB data from SPT-3G 2018 observations, we find that constraints on model parameters improve by 10-20% compared to previous studies. However, we forecast a further 50% improvement on these constraints if one could include current or upcoming SPT-3G lensing data. For the case of DM interacting with DR, no meaningful constraints on the model parameters are found without including information from CMB lensing. We also highlight that the codes used to calculate non-linear corrections in $\Lambda$CDM, specifically HaloFit and HMCode, provide unstable results when improperly used for these extended models. These outcomes constitute a reason for caution if using CMB lensing data when constraining such models, as well as a motivation for estimating their non-linear corrections.

          Limited hysteresis in the atmospheric dynamics of hot Jupiters

 - **Abstract**
 Over the past two decades, a coherent picture has emerged of the atmospheric dynamics of hot Jupiters from a combination of three-dimensional general circulation models (GCMs) and astronomical observations. This paradigm consists of hot Jupiters being spin-synchronized due to their close-in orbit, with a resulting large day-to-night irradiation gradient driving a day-to-night temperature contrast. This day-to-night temperature contrast in turn raises day-to-night pressure gradients that are balanced by a circulation with wind speeds on the order of km~s$^{-1}$. The dominant feature of this circulation is a superrotating equatorial jet, maintained by eddy-mean flow interactions that pump momentum into the jet. In this work, I explore the dependence of this circulation paradigm on the initial thermal and dynamical conditions in atmospheric circulation models of hot Jupiters. To do so, I conduct MITgcm simulations of the atmospheric circulation of hot Jupiters with both varying initial wind directions and initial temperature profiles. I find that the results are insensitive to the initial conditions, implying that the current paradigm of hot Jupiter circulation exhibits at most limited hysteresis. I demonstrate that there is a single characteristic wind speed of hot Jupiters for given planetary and atmospheric parameters using an idealized scaling theory, and discuss implications for the interpretation of hot Jupiter observations.

          Seimei KOOLS-IFU mapping of the gas and dust distributions in Galactic PNe: the origin and evolution of DdDm1

 - **Abstract**
 We conduct a detailed study of the planetary nebula (PN) DdDm1 in the Galactic halo field. DdDm1 is a metal-deficient and the most carbon-poor PN (C/O = 0.11 +/- 0.02) identified in the Galaxy. We aim to verify whether it evolved into a PN without experiencing the third dredge-up (TDU) during the thermal pulse asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase and to investigate its origin and evolution through accurate measurements of the physical parameters of the nebula and its central star. We perform a comprehensive investigation of DdDm1 using multiwavelength spectra. The KOOLS-IFU emission line images achieve ~0.9 arcsec resolution, resolving the elliptical nebula and revealing a compact spatial distribution of the [Fe III] line compared to the [O III] line, despite their similar volume emissivities. This indicates that iron, with its higher condensation temperature than oxygen, is easily incorporated into dust grains such as silicate, making the iron abundance estimate prone to underestimation. Using a fully data-driven approach, we directly derive ten elemental abundances, the gas-to-dust mass ratio, and the gas and dust masses based on our own heliocentric distance scale (19.4 kpc) and the emitting volumes of gas and dust. Our analysis reveals that DdDm1 is a unique PN evolved from a single star with an initial mass of ~1.0 Msun and a metallicity Z of 0.18 Zsun. Thus, DdDm1 is the only known PN that is confirmed to have evolved without experiencing TDUs. The photoionization model reproduces all observed quantities in excellent agreement with predictions from AGB nucleosynthesis, post-AGB evolution, and AGB dust production models. Our study provides new insights into the internal evolution of low-mass and metal-deficient stars like DdDm1 and highlights the role of PN progenitors in the chemical enrichment of the Galaxy.

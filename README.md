#### Title:
          Cosmological feedback from a halo assembly perspective

 - **Abstract**
 The impact of feedback from galaxy formation on cosmological probes is typically quantified in terms of the suppression of the matter power spectrum in hydrodynamical compared to gravity-only simulations. In this paper, we instead study how baryonic feedback impacts halo assembly histories and thereby imprints on cosmological observables. We investigate the sensitivity of the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (tSZ) power spectrum, X-ray number counts, weak lensing and kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) stacked profiles to halo populations as a function of mass and redshift. We then study the imprint of different feedback implementations in the FLAMINGO suite of cosmological simulations on the assembly histories of these halo populations, as a function of radial scale. We find that kSZ profiles target lower-mass halos ($M_{\rm 200m}\sim 10^{13.1}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$) compared to all other probes considered ($M_{200\mathrm{m}}\sim 10^{15}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$). Feedback is inefficient in high-mass clusters with $\sim 10^{15} \, \mathrm{M}_\odot$ at $z=0$, but was more efficient at earlier times in the same population, with a $\sim 5$-$10\%$ effect on mass at $2<z<4$ (depending on radial scale). Conversely, for lower-mass halos with $\sim10^{13}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$ at $z=0$, feedback exhibits a $\sim5$-$20\%$ effect on mass at $z=0$ but had little impact at earlier times ($z>2$). These findings are tied together by noting that, regardless of redshift, feedback most efficiently redistributes baryons when halos reach a mass of $M_{\rm 200m} \simeq {10^{12.8}}\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ and ceases to have any significant effect by the time $M_{\rm 200m} \simeq {10^{15}}\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. We put forward strategies for minimizing sensitivity of lensing analyses to baryonic feedback, and for exploring baryonic resolutions to the unexpectedly low tSZ power in cosmic microwave background observations.

          Addressing $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions within $f(Q)$ cosmology

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the viability of $f(Q)$ gravity as an alternative framework to address the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions in cosmology. Focusing on three representative $f(Q)$ models, we perform a comprehensive Bayesian analysis using a combination of cosmological observations, including cosmic chronometers, Type Ia supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, baryon acoustic oscillations, and redshift-space distortions. Our results demonstrate that most of these models can yield higher values of $H_0$ than those predicted by $\Lambda$CDM, offering a partial alleviation of the tension. In addition, one model satisfies the condition $G_{\mathrm{eff}} < G$ and predicts $S_8$ values consistent with weak lensing observations, making it a promising candidate for addressing the $S_8$ tension. However, these improvements are accompanied by mild internal inconsistencies between different subsets of data, which limit the overall statistical preference relative to $\Lambda$CDM. Despite this, $f(Q)$ gravity remains a promising and flexible framework for late-time cosmology, and our results motivate further exploration of extended or hybrid models that may reconcile all observational constraints.

          Minimal Plateau Inflation in light of ACT DR6 Observations

 - **Abstract**
 We explore a class of minimal plateau inflationary models constrained by the latest cosmological observations from ACT DR6, Planck 2018, BICEP/Keck 2018, and DESI, collectively referred to as P-ACT-LB-BK18. These models, characterized by a non-polynomial potential, are analyzed using both inflationary and post-inflationary reheating dynamics, and the limits on the viable model parameter space are obtained. Our results show that the minimal model with matter-like post inflationary reheating phase remains consistent with current data at both $1\sigma$ and $2\sigma$ levels. The inflaton potential's exponent $n$ and reheating epoch are intertwined in that upon its increase, corresponding to the stiffer reheating equation of state, the viable model parameter space in accordance with ACT shrinks, which is further facilitated by the primordial gravitational waves (PGWs) overproduction. We further explored a supergravity-inspired extension of the model under study with similar results, but with tighter constraints on the model parameters. These results emphasize the importance of jointly analyzing CMB data and reheating physics to test inflationary models.

 - **Abstract**
 Planetary nebulae (PNe) are pivotal for advancing our knowledge of stellar evolution and galactic chemical enrichment. Recent progress in surveys and data analysis has revolutionized PN research, leading to the discovery of new objects and deeper insights into their properties. We have devised a novel photometric selection method, integrating GAIA and Pan-STARRS photometry, to identify compact PN candidates. This approach utilizes color-color diagrams, specifically (G-g) versus (GBP-GRP) and (G-r) versus (GBP-GRP), as primary criteria for candidate selection. The subsequent verification step involves confirming these candidates through LAMOST spectroscopic data. By cross-referencing a comprehensive dataset of PNe, GAIA, Pan-STARRS, and LAMOST DR7 spectra, we explore the potential of our approach and the crucial role played by these surveys in PN research. The LAMOST spectra provide compelling evidence supporting our selection criteria, especially for compact PNe characterized by strong emission lines and low continuum. Applying these criteria to a catalog of emission line objects, we have selected a PN candidate. Detailed analysis of its LAMOST spectrum unveiled classical Balmer emission lines and high-ionization lines (He II, [Ar V], [Ar III], [Ne III]), characteristic of high-ionization PNe, without low-excitation lines. Using the photoionization code Cloudy, our modeling revealed parameters including an ionizing source temperature of 180x10^3 K, luminosity around 3400 Lsun, and gas abundances encompassing various elements. Comparing the PNe evolution track, the progenitor star was estimated to have a mass of 2 Msun. Our findings show strong promise for separating compact PNe from other objects and provide a robust framework for further exploration of these surveys in the context of planetary nebulae.
#### Title:
          Filling fractions for the formation of nuclear pasta in neutron stars: semiclassical vs liquid-drop predictions

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/
 - **Abstract**
 Historically, a sequence of nuclear pasta shapes was predicted to appear in the deepest region of the inner crust of a neutron star within the compressible liquid-drop picture, when the filling fraction $u$ exceeds some threshold values. However, later calculations showed that these values depend on the details of the liquid-drop model. Here we investigate the existence of pasta in neutron stars within the semiclassical extended Thomas-Fermi approach using various generalized Skyrme functionals. The filling fractions for the different transitions are found to be quasi-universal, unlike the pasta density ranges governed by the symmetry energy at relevant densities. In particular, pasta emerge at $u_\mathrm{sp}\approx0.13-0.15$. By applying a simplified stability criterion within the liquid-drop framework, we show that these values of $u_\mathrm{sp}$ can be explained by the nuclear curvature correction. In this way, the abundance of pasta can be easily estimated. This criterion can also be used to optimize the search of pasta within the more realistic extended Thomas-Fermi approach.

          V965 Cephei revisited: evidence for a binary system

 - **Abstract**
 We extended the $O-C$ diagram for V965 Cep with all currently available observations in the Johnson V filter and added unfiltered ones. The new, up-to-date $O-C$ diagram shows that the seeming period change previously revealed by the author does not occur uniformly. Instead, the near-parabolic part of the $O-C$ diagram can be a part of a periodic curve. This could be a sign of the second body in the system.

          Betelgeuse, Betelgeuse, Betelgeuse, Betel-buddy? Constraints on the dynamical companion to $α$ Orionis from HST

 - **Abstract**
 Recently, two independent analyses have asserted that the cause of the Long Secondary Period (LSP) observed in the variability spectrum of our nearest red supergiant, Betelgeuse ($\alpha$ Ori), is an as-yet undetected, low-mass binary companion dubbed $\alpha$ Ori B. In this paper, we present the results of a far-UV observational campaign using the STIS echelle spectrograph on the Hubble Space Telescope aimed at detecting spectral signatures of the companion. The four-quadrant tiling pattern and timing of the observations were optimized to isolate the companion, with observations taking place during a period of maximum angular and velocity separation between Betelgeuse and the putative companion. Spectral differencing between quadrants recovers no spectral features at the companion's velocity in excess of the background or Betelgeuse's chromosphere, i.e. a non-detection. Having determined that $\alpha$ Ori B is most likely a Young Stellar Object (YSO) thanks to constraints from a complementary X-ray campaign with the Chandra X-ray Observatory in a companion paper, comparison of our data against canonical spectra from YSOs in the ULLYSES database allows us to confidently exclude masses above $\gtrsim1.5M_\odot$ and companion continuum or line emission in excess of $\approx10^{-14}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ angstrom$^{-1}$ in the FUV ($\approx1200-1700$ angstroms). Future observational campaigns aware of the LSP phase are needed to place deeper constraints on the spectroscopic nature of $\alpha$ Ori B.

 - **Abstract**
 The $\sim$$2100$d Long Secondary Period of Betelgeuse's optical lightcurve and radial velocity motivated the prediction of a low-mass stellar companion, expected to be at maximal apparent separation from Betelgeuse around December 2024. We carried out Director's Discretionary Time observations with the Chandra X-ray Observatory to identify any X-ray emission from the companion and constrain its nature as either a compact object or young stellar object (YSO). Past X-ray observations occurred at the wrong phase of the companion's orbit for optimal detection prospects and/or lacked the deep exposure required to constrain the typical X-ray luminosities of YSOs. In our 41.85 ks exposure with Chandra, we do not detect an X-ray source at the position of Betelgeuse. For an estimated hydrogen column density $N_H$$=$$6\times10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$, we place a limit on the X-ray luminosity of $L_X$$\lesssim$$2\times10^{30}$ erg s$^{-1}$ ($\lesssim$$4.7\times10^{-4}L_\odot$) in $0.5$$-$$8$ keV for a 10 MK plasma temperature spectral model, or $L_X$$\lesssim$$5\times10^{29}$ erg s$^{-1}$ ($\lesssim$$1.2\times10^{-4}L_\odot$) for an absorbed power law with photon index $\Gamma$$=$$2$. These limits robustly exclude an accreting compact object (white dwarf or neutron star) as the companion. Solar mass YSOs with an age similar to Betelgeuse ($\sim$10 Myr) display a range of X-ray luminosities ($10^{28-32}$ erg s$^{-1}$), and we can place upper bounds within this range for most absorbing columns. Based on these considerations, we conclude that the companion to Betelgeuse is likely a low-mass YSO.

 - **Abstract**
 Old open clusters can constrain the chemical evolution of the Galactic disc through their metallicity gradients and age-metallicity relation but they suffer from low statistics. This work aims to determine precise and homogeneous metallicities for a number of old ($\geq$ 500 Myr) clusters from all-sky catalogues of stellar parameters leveraging Gaia spectrophotometry. Our purpose was to revisit the metallicity distribution of the oldest open clusters as a function of their Galactic position and age with improved statistics. Our sample includes ~600 old open clusters with a typical precision of 0.05 dex in metallicity. We identified metal-poor or metal-rich clusters never studied before, as well as moving groups as the remnants of dissolving clusters. Galactic maps show a smooth decrease of metallicity from inside to outside the disc. Metal-rich and metal-poor clusters exist at all ages but dominate respectively in the inner and the outer disc, with different scale this http URL radial metallicity gradient was found to have a knee shape with a steep value of -0.084$\pm$0.004 dex/kpc in the inner side and -0.018$\pm$0.004 dex/kpc outside the knee. The inner radial gradient flattens with age. Vertically, the metallicity gradient is -0.415$\pm$0.030 dex/kpc. The large scatter in the distribution of metallicity versus age is well explained by the superposition of OC populations standing at different Galactocentric distances, each with its own mean metallicity and small dispersion, less than 0.08 dex in radius bins of 1 this http URL results are consistent with a negative radial metallicity gradient of interstellar matter that was present in the disc when the clusters formed. The low metallicity dispersion in each radius bin reflects weak radial mixing.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first data release of the Hawaii Infrared Supernova Study (\textit{HISS}), consisting of a large sample of near-infrared (NIR) spectra, $0.7 - 2.5 \mathrm{\mu m}$, obtained with the Keck-II/NIRES and IRTF/SpeX spectrographs. This sample is comprised of 90 NIR spectra of 48 transient events, spanning from hours after explosion to $\geq + 350$ days. Acquired over three years (2021-2024), this data release includes 17 Type Ia SNe, 15 Type II SNe, 8 Stripped Envelope SNe, 6 interacting SNe, 1 TDE, and 1 SLSN-I. These spectra were all systematically reduced using either the \textsc{Python}-based reduction code \textsc{Pypeit} or the \textsc{IDL}-based \textsc{Spextool} and constitute one of the largest NIR samples of transients available to the astrophysical community. We show the utility of NIR spectra and identify the key spectral features across multiple types of SNe. We show how both early-time and nebular-phase NIR spectra can be used to investigate the physics of the explosion, and to reveal the properties of the progenitor. With the addition of this dataset, the number of publicly available NIR spectra spanning multiple transient types has been substantially increased. In its next phase, \textit{HISS} will leverage target-of-opportunity spectral observations and NIR imaging from telescopes on Maunakea. Expanding the NIR dataset of SNe is vital to the transient community, particularly in light of the increasing emphasis on the infrared regime following the recent launch of the \textit{James Webb Space Telescope} and the forthcoming launch of the \textit{Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope}.

          The Stripped-Star Ultraviolet Magellanic Cloud Survey (SUMS): The UV Photometric Catalog and Stripped Star Candidate Selection

 - **Abstract**
 Most massive stars will interact with a binary companion during their lifetimes. These interactions can remove the hydrogen-rich envelope, producing intermediate-mass ($\sim$2-8 M$_\odot$) and helium-rich stars. These "stripped stars" are predicted to emit predominantly in the ultraviolet (UV) and can therefore be identified via a UV excess provided they are not outshone by their companion. However, despite their importance to binary evolution, supernovae, and ionizing feedback, few stripped stars have been confirmed. This is likely due to the scarcity of wide-field, high angular resolution, UV surveys of stellar populations with reliable distances and extinction estimates. To address this, we present the Stripped-Star Ultraviolet Magellanic Clouds Survey (SUMS) catalog. We use the Tractor forward modeling software to perform PSF photometry on 2,420 Swift-UVOT images of the LMC and SMC. The resulting public catalog contains 734,869 sources in three UV filters to a depth of $\sim$20 Vega mag. We perform validation tests on the photometry pipeline and highlight the catalog's broad applicability. We then identify sources with excess UV light compared to main-sequence stars and apply a series of quality cuts. From this, we identify 522 candidate stripped stars in the LMC and 298 in the SMC. We assess the potential contamination from other UV excess systems and argue the dominant uncertainty to be dust: early main-sequence stars can mimic the colors of stripped star binaries when extinction is overcorrected. This survey lays the groundwork for the first systematic census of stripped stars and opens new windows into binary evolution and massive star populations.

 - **Abstract**
 Detecting anomalies in radio astronomy is challenging due to the vast amounts of data and the rarity of labeled anomalous examples. Addressing this challenge requires efficient methods capable of identifying unusual radio galaxy morphologies without relying on extensive supervision. This work introduces an innovative approach to anomaly detection based on morphological characteristics of the radio sources using trainable COSFIRE (Combination of Shifted Filter Responses) filters as an efficient alternative to complex deep learning methods. The framework integrates COSFIRE descriptors with an unsupervised Local Outlier Factor (LOF) algorithm to identify unusual radio galaxy morphologies. Evaluations on a radio galaxy benchmark data set demonstrate strong performance, with the COSFIRE-based approach achieving a geometric mean (G-Mean) score of 79%, surpassing the 77% achieved by a computationally intensive deep learning autoencoder. By characterizing normal patterns and detecting deviations, this semi-supervised methodology overcomes the need for anomalous examples in the training set, a major limitation of traditional supervised methods. This approach shows promise for next-generation radio telescopes, where fast processing and the ability to discover unknown phenomena are crucial.

          Cloud and Haze Parameterization in Atmospheric Retrievals: Insights from Titan's Cassini Data and JWST Observations of Hot Jupiters

 - **Abstract**
 Context: Before JWST, telescope observations were not sensitive enough to constrain the nature of clouds in exo-atmospheres. Recent observations, however, have inferred cloud signatures as well as haze-enhanced scattering slopes motivating the need for modern inversion techniques and a deeper understanding of the JWST information content. Aims: We aim to investigate the information content of JWST exoplanet spectra. We particularly focus on designing an inversion technique able to handle a wide range of cloud and hazes. Methods: We build a flexible aerosol parameterization within the TauREx framework, enabling us to conduct atmospheric retrievals of planetary atmospheres. The method is evaluated on available Cassini occultations of Titan. We then use the model to interpret the recent JWST data for the prototypical hot Jupiters HAT-P-18 b, WASP-39 b, WASP-96 b, and WASP-107 b. In parallel, we perform complementary simulations on controlled scenarios to further understand the information content of JWST data and provide parameterization guidelines. Results: Our results use free and kinetic chemistry retrievals to extract the main atmospheric properties of key JWST exoplanets, including their molecular abundances, thermal structures, and aerosol properties. In our investigations, we show the need for a wide wavelength coverage to robustly characterize clouds and hazes-which is necessary to mitigate biases arising from our lack of priors on their composition-and break degeneracies with atmospheric chemical composition. With JWST, the characterization of clouds and hazes might be difficult due to the lack of simultaneous wavelength coverage from visible to mid-infrared by a single instruments and the likely presence of temporal variability between visits (from e.g., observing conditions, instrument systematics, stellar host variability, or planetary weather).

          Emergence of new oscillation modes in dark matter admixed neutron stars

 - **Abstract**
 Dark matter admixed neutron stars provide a promising avenue for observationally probing the dark matter characteristic. In this study, we examine non-radial oscillations in neutron stars containing self-interacting dark matter, which interacts with normal matter exclusively via gravity. To achieve this, we derive a new set of perturbation equations for a multi-fluid system under the Cowling approximation. Using these equations, we analyze the oscillation spectra and identify additional modes associated with dark matter, alongside those of normal matter. We find that the frequency behavior becomes more intricate with increasing self-coupling strength of dark matter, particularly as the stellar structure transitions between dark core and dark halo configurations, depending on the total stellar mass. Nevertheless, we find that in the dark core structure, the fundamental ($f$) mode frequencies associated with dark matter exceed those of normal matter, at least when the central energy densities of both fluids are equal. Furthermore, we find that the $f$-mode frequencies associated with normal matter in dark core configurations adhere to a universal relation between the mass-scaled frequency and stellar compactness.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the dynamical properties of dark energy through a detailed analysis of its equation of state parameter $w(z)$ as a function of redshift. We derive a general expression for $w(z)$ from the Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) equations, establishing a direct relationship between the dark energy equation of state and the observable Hubble parameter $H(z)$ and its derivative. Using the relation $w(z) = -1 + \frac{2(1+z)}{3H(z)} \frac{dH}{dz}$, we develop an approximation method valid for $z \lesssim 1$ that accounts for the changing balance between matter and dark energy contributions to cosmic expansion. We compare our theoretical framework with recent observational data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) DR2, analysing how well the commonly used Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization $w(z) = -1 + w_a \frac{z}{1+z}$ captures the evolution of dark energy. Our results indicate that the dark energy equation of state exhibits a monotonic evolution with redshift, transitioning from deceleration to acceleration around $z \approx 0.7$. Notably, our predicted $w_{\mathrm{DE}}$ remains greater than $-1$ across all redshifts, avoiding phantom energy scenarios that would violate the null energy condition. This work demonstrates how precise measurements of the cosmic expansion history can constrain the nature of dark energy and provides a framework for testing dynamical dark energy models against current and future cosmological observations.

 - **Abstract**
 We examine data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration which has implications for the nature of dark energy. We consider classes of models that manifestly obey the null energy condition, with a focus on quintessence models. We find that hilltop potentials and exponential potentials provide modest improvement compared to a cosmological constant, but the statistical evidence is only marginal at this stage. We correct some analyses in the existing literature which attempted to compare some quintessence models to the data, giving an overly positive result.

 - **Abstract**
 We report on results of the on-ground X-ray calibration of the Wide-field X-ray Telescope (WXT) built from novel lobster-eye micro-pore optics, onboard the Einstein Probe (EP) satellite. To fully characterize the instrumental performance and properties, a series of tests and calibrations have been carried out at different levels of devices, assemblies and the complete module before the launch of EP. In this paper, we present the calibration results of three flight model modules (FM1, FM5 and FM11) obtained during their end-to-end module calibration experiments carried out at the 100-m X-ray Test Facility (100XF) of IHEP, CAS. Measurements of the Point Spread Function (PSF), effective area, and energy response were performed for multiple incident directions and several characteristic X-ray emission line energies. Specifically, the distributions of the PSF and effective areas are found to be roughly uniform across the FoV, in large agreement with the prediction of lobster-eye optics. Their energy dependence behavior aligns well with theoretical predictions and Monte Carlo simulations. At 1.25 keV, the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the focal spot is in range of 3-7 arcmin (a median of 4.2) and the effective area in range of 2-3 $cm^2$. Noticeably, the flight model instruments demonstrate a $\sim1.5$ arcmin spatial resolution improvement over the previously launched Lobster Eye Imager for Astronomy. The properties of the complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) sensors were also calibrated. The gain coefficients are in range of 6.4-6.9 eV/DN. The energy resolutions are in range of 120-140 eV at 1.25 keV, meeting design requirements. These calibration results have been ingested into the first version of calibration database (CALDB) and applied to the analysis of the scientific data acquired by WXT after the launch of EP.

 - **Abstract**
 TOI-2109b is the hot Jupiter with the shortest orbital period ($\sim16\,$hr). At this close distance, strong tidal interactions can produce a significant exchange of angular momentum with the star. Since the orbital period of this planet is shorter than the stellar rotation period, TOI-2109b may be an optimal candidate for studying orbital decay. This process depends on how efficiently the star and the planet dissipate energy, due mainly to interior mechanisms that are poorly constrained in exoplanet systems. In this work, we study for the first time the tidal evolution of TOI-2109b under a formalism of inertial waves (IWs) in convective envelopes and internal gravity waves (IGWs) in stellar radiative regions. We find that uncertainties in the age of TOI-2109 ($t_\mathrm{\star, age}$) significantly affect the rate of orbital evolution, as IWs and IGWs interact differently depending on $t_\mathrm{\star, age}$. For an 'old' host star, we find that TOI-2109b would undergo fast orbital decay. Conversely, if TOI-2109b orbits a 'young' host star, a rather slow decay rate for $Q_\star'>2.3\times10^7$ would suggest a constant-period orbit. Our calculated mid-transit times and transit-timing variations (TTVs) support a 'young' host star with $Q_\star'>3.7\times10^7$, suggesting a decay rate of $\dot{P}\sim4\,$ms yr$^{-1}$ that could lead to mid-transit-time shifts $\lesssim10\,$s over three years. Orbital decay and other TTV-inducing effects will be confirmed or ruled out with future higher-quality timing data. The results presented here aim at constraining the current modeling of tides and TTVs for TOI-2109b, helping us further understand those light-curve changes associated to the long-term evolution of ultra-short-period planets.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent space missions have provided substantial evidence of regolith movement on the surfaces of near Earth asteroids. To investigate this phenomenon, we present a continuum-based model that describes regolith motion on nearly spherical asteroids. The theoretical framework employs a depth averaged approach, traditionally used for simulating terrestrial landslides, and is extended to include additional terms that account for spherical geometry, shallow topography and the asteroids rotation. The governing equations couple the resurfacing process with the asteroids spin evolution through angular momentum conservation. The axisymmetric form of these equations is then employed to study the transition of an initially spherical asteroid into a top-shaped.

 - **Abstract**
 We present new simulations of the formation and evolution of the first star-forming cloud within a massive minihalo of mass of $1.05 \times 10^7\, M_{\odot}$, carried out using the GIZMO code with detailed modeling of primordial gas cooling and chemistry. Unlike previous studies that simulated the formation of the first stars within a smaller cosmological boxsize of $\sim 1-2$ Mpc, our work adopts initial conditions from the large-scale cosmological simulations, IllustrisTNG spanning $\sim 50$ Mpc to study the formation of primordial clouds that give birth to the first stars. We increase the original resolution of IllustrisTNG by a factor of $\sim10^5$ using a particle-splitting technique, achieving an extremely high resolution that allows us to resolve turbulence driven by gravitational collapse during early structure formation. We find that strong supersonic turbulence with a characteristic Mach number of $\sim 5.2$ naturally develops within the collapsing halo. This turbulence efficiently stirs the gas, promoting fragmentation of the star-forming cloud into multiple dense clumps. Among them, we identify a gravitationally bound core with a mass of $8.07\,M_{\odot}$ and a size of $0.03$ pc, which exceeds its local Jeans mass and is on the verge of collapsing into a star. Our results indicate that supersonic turbulence may be common in primordial halos and can play a crucial role in cloud-scale fragmentation, potentially lowering the characteristic mass scale of the first stars.

 - **Abstract**
 We continue scientific scrutiny of the DESI dynamical dark energy (DE) claim by explicitly demonstrating that the result depends on the analysis pipeline. Concretely, we define a likelihood that converts the $w_0 w_a$CDM model back into the flat $\Lambda$CDM model, which we fit to DESI constraints on the flat $\Lambda$CDM model from DR1 Full-Shape (FS) modelling and BAO. We further incorporate CMB constraints. Throughout, we find that $w_0$ and $w_a$ are within $1 \sigma$ of the flat $\Lambda$CDM Model. Our work makes it explicit that, in contrast to DR1 and DR2 BAO, there is no dynamical DE signal in FS modelling, even when combined with BAO and CMB. Moreover, one confirms late-time accelerated expansion today $(q_0 < 0)$ at $ \gtrsim 3.4 \sigma$ in FS modelling+BAO. On the contrary, DR1 and DR2 BAO fail to confirm $q_0 < 0$ under similar assumptions. Our analyses highlight the fact that trustable scientific results should be independent of the analysis pipeline.

 - **Abstract**
 Accurate measurements of fundamental cosmological parameters, especially the Hubble constant ($H_0$) and present-day matter density ($\Omega_{m0}$), are crucial for constraining dark energy (DE) evolution. We analyze the sensitivities of cosmological observables ($H(z)$, $D_L(z)$, $\EG$) to $\Omega_{m0}$, $\omega_0$, and $\omega_a$ under different parametrizations. Our results show observables are far more sensitive to $\Omega_{m0}$ than to DE equation of state parameters (e.g., at $z \sim 0.5$, $H(z)$'s $\Omega_{m0}$ sensitivity is $\sim 0.7$ vs. $\omega_a$'s $\sim 0.04$). This hierarchy mandates high-precision $\Omega_{m0}$ measurements to accurately constrain time-varying DE. We also find DE parameter sensitivity highly depends on parametrization; the standard CPL form shows low sensitivity to $\omega_a$, but $\omega(z) = \omega_0 + \omega_a \ln(1+z)$ significantly enhances it. Our analysis of DESI DR1/DR2 data confirms these theoretical limits: standalone DESI data primarily provides only upper limits for $\omega_a$, underscoring insufficient constraining power for a definitive time-varying DE detection. While combined datasets offer tighter constraints, interpretation requires caution due to parametrization influence. In conclusion, improving $\Omega_{m0}$ precision and adopting optimized parametrizations are imperative for future surveys like DESI to fully probe dark energy's nature.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observational analyses have revealed potential evidence for a preferred spatial direction in cosmological data. Such directional parameterization inherently places observers at a privileged spatial position, thereby conflicting with the Copernican principle and suffering from the look-elsewhere effect. To restore the Copernican principle which is the foundation of modern astronomy, we propose a stochastic framework for cosmological principle violations. The almost uniform temperature of cosmic microwave background suggests that the deviation of isotropy is negligible ($\lesssim 10^{-5}$ level) on the last scattering surface, which can be used as a zero boundary condition to construct an orthogonal basis below the redshift of recombination. The relative deviation from Hubble diagram of isotropic ($\Lambda$CDM or $w_0w_a$CDM) models is expanded with the orthogonal basis with a hierarchy of increasing resolution. Using this new approach, we test cosmological principle with type Ia supernovae, strong lens time delay, and gravitational-wave standard siren. The data sets are consistent with statistical isotropy on large scales.

 This study evaluates ejecta properties from multi-messenger observations to understand the absence of detectable KN associated to the four NSBH candidates from May 2023 to July 2024: we use GW public information and joint observations taken from 05.2023 to 07.2024 (LVK, ATLAS, DECam, GECKO, GOTO, GRANDMA, SAGUARO, TESS, WINTER, ZTF) in the followup of S230518h, GW230529, S230627c and S240422ed. First, our analysis on follow-up observation strategies shows that, on average, more than 50\% of the simulated KNe associated with NSBH mergers reach their peak luminosity around one day after merger in the $g,r,i$- bands, which is not necessarily covered for each NSBH GW candidate. We also analyze the trade-off between observation efficiency and the intrinsic properties of the KN emission, to understand the impact on how these constraints affect our ability to detect the KN, and underlying ejecta properties for each GW candidate.

 Novel studies are presented demonstrating that the data of ESA's XMM-Newton mission are efficiently used by an engaged and productive community. 87% of the available time budget during the reference period 2000-2024 of 556Ms was used in at least one of 8486 publications (84% of 16894 observations) with a re-use of a factor up to 15 in dedicated publications. The duration between observations and first publication peaks around 2 years with a second peak at 3 years. The publication rate remains stable at ~400 refereed articles per year. Since 2010, the annual number of first-time as well as last-time authors has remained constant at ~100 authors per year yielding ~4300 scientists engaged in research utilising XMM-Newton data including 570 lead (first) authors. We find 51% of first authors to have published for one year, 24% were active for up to six years, and 25% are permanently active yielding a core community of ~120 scientists. The considerable number of time-limited activities may indicate a high level of utilisation within the context of university education. All studied trends indicate a vital community with positive perspectives to continue their active interest in XMM-Newton for the future.

          Formation of supermassive stars in the first stellar clusters: Dependence on the gas temperature

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of supermassive black holes is an open question that has been explored considering gas- and collision-based formation channels to explain the high number of quasars observed in the early Universe. According to numerical simulations, supermassive stars can be formed in atomic cooling halos when protostars reach accretion rates greater than $\sim 10^{-2}~\mathrm{M_{\odot}~yr^{-1}}$ and fragmentation is inhibited on parsec scales. It remains uncertain, however, whether fragmentation on smaller scales leads to the formation of a star cluster instead of a supermassive star in the presence of possible cooling mechanisms. We explored the formation of a central massive object through collisions and the accretion of Population III stars in a primordial gas cloud in a gravitationally unstable system by varying the gas temperature and the degree of gravitational instability. We performed multiphysics simulations in the AMUSE framework with a hydrodynamical gas treatment through Smoothed-particle hydrodynamics and $N$-body dynamics for the protostars represented through sink particles. Our results show that central massive objects with masses $\sim 10^4~\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ can be formed by accretion and collisions at different temperatures and that the most massive object can reach efficiencies of $\sim 0.61$ for atomic cooling conditions and $\sim 0.95$ for more unstable conditions. We observe a quasi-disk formation for warmer temperatures and a higher contribution through collisions to the mass of a central massive object. Our results show that the embedded cluster is in a supercompetitive accretion regime in which it obtains mass by accretion that is regulated by self-gravity. Our results suggest that in more unstable conditions with lower gas temperatures, a more massive supermassive black hole seed can form.

 - **Abstract**
 Extensive radio frequency interference (RFI) monitoring is essential in the site selection process before constructing radio astronomy observatories, followed by mitigation strategies to minimize its adverse effects. Malaysia has an enormous prospect for radio astronomy due to its prominent location in the centre of Southeast Asia, but is challenged by its relatively high population density. In this research article, we perform high-cadence, low-frequency RFI monitoring at two sites, each representing an urban and a rural environment. Using modified generalized spectral kurtosis (GSK) as an RFI detection method, we ascertain the suitability of Glami Lemi, a rural area in the centre of Peninsular Malaysia previously assigned as a candidate radio notification zone (RNZ), as a potential site for radio astronomy observations due to its lower RFI contamination in our high-cadence monitoring, especially when compared with urban areas. We identified a number of persistent and transient RFI in our dataset, associate each of them with their potential origins and, if present, characterize their temporal evolution. A few types of RFI mitigation strategies were also tested and discussed. This study lays the groundwork for Malaysia's endeavours in establishing its first research-grade radio telescope, emphasizing the importance of robust RFI detection and mitigation strategies in optimizing observational outcomes.

 - **Abstract**
 Core-collapse supernovae undergoing a first-order quantum chromodynamics (QCD) phase transition experience the collapse of the central proto-neutron star that leads to a second bounce. This event is accompanied by the release of a second neutrino burst. Unlike the first stellar core bounce neutrino burst which consists exclusively of electron neutrinos, the second burst is dominated by electron antineutrinos. Such a condition makes QCD supernovae an ideal site for the occurrence of fast neutrino flavor conversion (FFC), which can lead to rapid flavor equilibration and significantly impact the related neutrino signal. In this work, we perform a detailed analysis of the conditions for fast flavor instability (FFI) around and after the second neutrino burst in a QCD phase transition supernova model launched from a 25~$M_\odot$ progenitor mass. We evaluate the relevant instability criteria and find two major phases of FFC. The first phase is closely associated with the collapse and the rapidly expanding shock wave, which is a direct consequence of the proto-neutron star collapse due to the phase transition. The second phase takes place a few milliseconds later when electron degeneracy is restored near the proto-neutron star surface. We also characterize the growth rate of FFI and estimate its impact on the evolution of the neutrino flavor content. The potential observational consequences on neutrino signals are evaluated by comparing a scenario assuming complete flavor equipartition with other scenarios without FFC. Finally, we investigate how FFC may influences $r$-process nucleosynthesis associated with QCD phase transition driven supernova explosions.

 - **Abstract**
 Eclipsing binaries are perfect laboratories to measure precise, accurate and model-independent stellar radii and stellar masses, so long as both components are spectroscopically resolved. Resolving both components is difficult in high-contrast binaries, for instance, those composed of an FGK main-sequence star with an M-type companion. In those cases, the secondary can contribute <1% of the total flux in optical wavelengths. This makes measuring dynamical masses challenging and has typically only been attempted with large-aperture telescopes (8-10-m). The High-Resolution Cross-Correlation Spectroscopy (HRCCS) method was developed to extract weak emission and transmission spectra for exoplanet atmospheres. This method was recently adapted and applied to measure dynamical masses in high-contrast binaries. In this work, we apply the HRCCS method to optical spectra of the high-contrast binary and circumbinary planet host Kepler-16AB, obtained with the SOPHIE spectrograph at the 1.93-m telescope at the Observatoire de Haute-Provence. The secondary, which has a contrast ratio of ~ 6 x 10-3, is resolved with a detection significance of 9.5-sigma. We derive dynamical masses with a precision of 1.5% and 0.9% for the primary and secondary respectively. These are comparable, but slightly higher (within 2-7%) to previous mass-measurements, which has -- within the uncertainties -- no implication for the mass of the known circumbinary planet. This work demonstrates that dynamical mass measurements of high-contrast binaries can be done with 2-m class telescopes. We also investigate different analysis protocols to ensure we derive robust uncertainties for dynamical masses.

 - **Abstract**
 Neutrinos from supernovae, especially those emitted during the late phase of core collapse, are essential for understanding the final stages of massive star evolution. We have been dedicated to developing methods for the analysis of neutrinos emitted during the late phase and observed at Super-Kamiokande (SK). Our previous studies have successfully demonstrated the potential of various analysis methods in extracting essential physical properties; however, the lack of background consideration has limited their practical application. In this study, we address this issue by incorporating a realistic treatment of the experimental signal and background events with the on-going SK experiment. We therefore optimize our analysis framework to reflect realistic observational conditions, including both signal and background events. Using this framework we study several long-time supernova models, simulating the late phase neutrino observation in SK and focusing in particular on the identification of the last observed event. We discuss the possibility of model discrimination methods using timing information from this last observed event.

 - **Abstract**
 New extragalactic measurements of the cloud population-averaged star formation (SF) efficiency per freefall time $\rm\epsilon_{\rm ff}$ from PHANGS show little sign of theoretically predicted dependencies on cloud-scale virial level or velocity dispersion. We explore ways to bring theory into consistency with observations, highlighting systematic variations in internal density structure that must happen together with an increase in virial level typical towards galaxy centers. To introduce these variations into conventional turbulence-regulated SF models we adopt three adjustments motivated by the host galaxy's influence on the cloud-scale: we incorporate self-gravity and a gas density distribution that contains a broad power-law (PL) component and resembles the structure observed in local resolved clouds, we let the internal gas kinematics include motion in the background potential and let this regulate the onset of self-gravitation, and we assume that the gas density distribution is in a steady-state for only a fraction of a freefall time. The combined result is a strong reduction to $\rm\epsilon_{\rm ff}$ predicted in multi-freefall (MFF) scenarios compared to purely lognormal probability density functions and variations that are tied to the PL slope $\alpha$. The $\alpha$ needed to match PHANGS $\rm\epsilon_{\rm ff}$'s vary systematically with environment in the sense that gas sitting furthest from virial balance contains more gas at high density. With this `galaxy regulation' behavior included, our `self-gravitating' sgMFF models function similar to the original, roughly `virialized cloud' single-freefall models. However, outside disks with their characteristic regulation, the flexible MFF models may be better suited.

 - **Abstract**
 The recently identified \textit{memory burden} effect has the potential to significantly decelerate the evaporation of black holes. Specifically, when approximately half of a black hole's initial mass has been radiated away, the evaporation process is halted. This mechanism allows very light primordial black holes (PBHs) with masses $m_{\rm PBH}<10^{15}$ g to persist until the present day and may contribute to the dark matter (DM) content of the universe. In this work, we focus on PBHs with masses $\lesssim 10^{9}$ g. Due to the memory burden effect, these PBHs emit high-energy gamma-rays, which in turn alter the corresponding observed energy spectra. To investigate the constraints on the masses and DM abundance of PBHs, we analyze data from four Galactic sources measured by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO), including the Crab Nebula, LHAASO J2226+6057, LHAASO J1908+0621, and LHAASO J1825-1326. Our findings indicate that the ultra-high-energy gamma-ray spectra from these Galactic sources provide crucial probes for light PBHs, thereby significantly constraining their potential contribution to DM.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar abundances, coupled with kinematics are a unique way to understand the chemo-dynamical processes that occurred to build the Milky Way and its local volume as we observe today. However, measuring abundances is challenging as one needs to properly address the effect of departure from the Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), as well as the commonly used 1-dimensional model atmosphere. In this work, we constrain the chemical evolution of [O/Fe] in FG stars of the RAVE survey with [O/Fe] abundances derived in non-LTE (NLTE) and with horizontally-temporally-averaged 3D (<3D>) model atmospheres. Using standard spectral fitting method, we determine for the first time LTE and NLTE [O/Fe] ratios from the O triplet at 8446A in turn-off and dwarf stars thanks to intermediate-resolution RAVE spectra, assuming both 1D and <3D> model atmosphere. NLTE effects play a significant role when determining oxygen even at a resolution of R= 7500. Typical NLTE-LTE corrections of the order of -0.12 dex are measured in dwarfs and turn-off stars using 1D MARCS models. In contrast to applying <3D> NLTE abundance corrections or the classical 1D LTE, the full <3D> NLTE spectral fitting yields improving the precision of abundances by nearly 10%. We show that the decrease of [O/Fe] in the super-solar [Fe/H] regime is rather characterised by a flat trend when [O/Fe] is computed in <3D> NLTE from full spectral fitting. We attribute this flattening at super-solar [Fe/H] to the interplay between locally born stars with negative [O/Fe] and stars migrated from the inner MW regions with super-solar [O/Fe], supporting the complex chemo-dynamical history of the Solar neighbourhood. Our results are key for understanding the effects of <3D> and NLTE when measuring [O/Fe]. This work is a test bed for the analysis of 4MOST low-resolution spectra that will share similar properties as RAVE in the red wavelength domain.

 - **Abstract**
 Cyanopolyynes, a family of nitrogen containing carbon chains, are common in the interstellar medium and possibly form the backbone of species relevant to prebiotic chemistry. Following their gas phase formation, they are expected to freeze out on ice grains in cold interstellar regions. In this work we present the hydrogenation reaction network of isolated HC_{3}N, the smallest cyanopolyyne, that consists over-a-barrier radical-neutral reactions and barrierless radical-radical reactions. We employ density functional theory, coupled cluster and multiconfigurational methods to obtain activation and reaction energies for the hydrogenation network of HC_{3}N. This work explores the reaction network of the isolated molecule and constitutes a preview on the reactions occurring on the ice grain surface. We find that the reactions where the hydrogen atom adds to the carbon chain at carbon atom opposite of the cyano-group give the lowest and most narrow barriers. Subsequent hydrogenation leads to the astrochemically relevant vinyl cyanide and ethyl cyanide. Alternatively, the cyano-group can hydrogenate via radical-radical reactions, leading to the fully saturated propylamine. These results can be extrapolated to give insight into the general reactivity of carbon chains on interstellar ices.

 - **Abstract**
 Several models based on General Relativity and Modified Gravity aim to reproduce the observed universe with precision comparable to the standard flat-$\Lambda$CDM model. In this study, we investigate the consistency of some of these models with current high-redshift cosmic data, assessing their ability to simultaneously describe both the background expansion and matter clustering, using measurements of the Hubble parameter $H(z)$, the luminosity distance $D_L(z)$, and the growth rate of structures $[f\sigma_8](z)$ through parametric and non-parametric methods. Our results indicate that background observables alone offer limited capacity to distinguish between models, while the inclusion of growth of structures data proves useful in revealing deviations, even if small. An $F(Q)$ model, the non-flat $\Lambda$CDM and the $\omega$CDM emerge as alternatives well supported by data, closely matching the growth data and showing performance comparable to $\Lambda$CDM, as revealed by the Akaike Information Criterion. In contrast, $F(R)$ models are strongly disfavored compared to $\Lambda$CDM and $F(Q)$. These analyses illustrate the usefulness of both parametric and non-parametric approaches to explore the observational viability of alternative cosmological models.

 - **Abstract**
 The Einstein Telescope (ET) is a proposed third-generation, wide-band gravitational wave (GW) detector which will have an improved detection sensitivity in low frequencies, leading to a longer observation time in the detection band and higher detection rate for binary neutron stars (BNSs). Despite the fact that ET will have a higher detection rate, a large fraction of BNSs will remain undetectable. We present a scheme to estimate accurate detection efficiency and to reconstruct the true merger rate density of the population of the BNSs, as a function of redshift. We show that with ET as a single instrumnet, for a population of BNSs with $R_{mer} \sim 100 (300)$ $\rm Gpc^{-3} yr^{-1}$ at $z\sim 0(2)$, we can reconstruct the merger rate density uptil $z \sim 2$ , with a relative error of $12\%$ at ($z \sim 2$), despite the loss in detection of the bulk of the BNS population.

 - **Abstract**
 High-resolution spectrographs with precise radial velocity (PRV) capabilities require careful considerations in instrumental design and data processing in order to reach the 10 cm/s-level precision, which is needed for detecting Earth-like planets. In this work, we investigate the impact of fiber cross contamination on the RV precision via simulations, as modern PRV spectrographs often have multiple fiber traces on their spectral images. We simulated extracted 1-D spectra under the preliminary design of CHORUS, short for the Canary Hybrid Optical high-Resolution Ultra-stable Spectrograph, a dual-arm PRV spectrograph under construction for the Gran Telescopio de Canarias. We considered two types of fiber cross contaminations: contamination from calibration traces to neighboring science traces (or cal-sci contamination) and between science traces (or sci-sci contamination). We present results in four different scenarios: photon noise only, cal-sci contamination only, sci-sci contamination only, and all effects combined. For the preliminary design of CHORUS, we estimated that the cal-sci contamination fraction is smaller than 0.0001% in flux across the whole CCD for either arm, resulting in a negligible impact on the RV precision. Assuming worst-case scenarios, we estimated the sci-sci contamination to be up to 0.1% in some traces, corresponding to an additional RV error of up to 10 cm/s. We demonstrate the importance of considering fiber-trace spacing and cross contamination in PRV spectrographs, and we recommend careful design, operation, and spectral extraction algorithms to minimize and mitigate cross contamination to achieve the best possible instrumental RV precision.

 - **Abstract**
 MAXI J1834-021 is a new X-ray transient that was discovered in February 2023. We analysed the spectral and timing properties of MAXI J1834-021 using NICER, NuStar and Swift data collected between March and October 2023. The light curve showed a main peak followed by a second activity phase. The majority of the spectra extracted from the individual NICER observations could be adequately fitted with a Comptonisation component alone, while a few of them required an additional thermal component. The spectral evolution is consistent with a softening trend as the source gets brighter in X-rays. We also analysed the broadband spectrum combining data from simultaneous NICER and NuStar observations on 2023 March 10. This spectrum can be fitted with a disc component with a temperature at the inner radius of $kT_{\rm in} \sim 0.4$ keV and a Comptonisation component with a power-law photon index of $\Gamma \sim 1.8$. By including a reflection component in the modelling, we obtained a 3$\sigma$ upper limit for the inner disc radius of 11.4 gravitational radii. We also detected a quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO), whose central frequency varies with time (from 2 Hz to $\sim$0.9 Hz) and anti-correlates with the hardness ratio. Based on the observed spectral-timing properties, MAXI J1834-021, can be classified as a low-mass X-ray binary in outburst. However, we are not able to draw a definitive conclusion on the nature of the accreting compact object, which at the moment could as well be a black hole or a neutron star.

 - **Abstract**
 Finding out whether there is any correlation between the presence of short-period small planets (SPs) with $P\lesssim100~d$ ($a \lesssim0.4~AU$) and $1<M_{p}<20~M_\oplus$ and that of outer cold Jupiters (CJs) with $a=1-10~AU$ and $M_{p}=0.5-20~M_{Jup}$ around solar-type stars may provide crucial constraints on the models of formation and/or migration of SPs. However, somehow discrepant results about the occurrence rates of CJs in SP systems have been reported in the literature, with a few recent works claiming a strong SP-CJ correlation but only at super-solar metallicity and/or mass of the host stars. Here we homogeneously recomputed the occurrence rates of CJs at average, sub-solar ($[Fe/H]<-0.1$), solar ($-0.1\le[Fe/H]\le0.1$), and super-solar ($[Fe/H]>0.1$) metallicity as well as at average and sub-intervals of stellar mass, namely 0.6-0.8, 0.8-1.0, and 1.0-1.2 $M_\odot$, with (i) a carefully-selected sample of 217 SP systems, and (ii) a large comparison sample of 1167 solar-type stars. We determined the integrated occurrence rate of CJs in SP systems to be $f_{CJ|SP}=11.1^{+2.5}_{-1.8}\%$; this is consistent with the estimated frequencies of CJs in both the comparison sample ($f_{CJ}=9.8^{+0.9}_{-0.8}\%$) and the HARPS-N survey of transiting SP systems. We found a possible correlation ($f_{CJ|SP}>f_{CJ}$) only at super-solar mass and metallicity, though with a statistical confidence less than $3\sigma$. To test some theoretical predictions, we also searched for possible SP-CJ relations as a function of SP and CJ multiplicity as well as SP composition, and found none. We show that the architectures of SP systems are not indifferent to the presence of CJs as the multiplicity of SPs strongly depends on the CJ eccentricity, as expected from planetary dynamics. A more comprehensive understanding of the relation between SPs and CJs requires larger samples of SP systems. [Abridged]

 - **Abstract**
 The early stages of planet formation, involving dust grain growth and planetesimals formation, remain shrouded in mystery. The analysis of the Scattering Phase Function (SPF) measured in disks surrounding young stars holds great potential for revealing crucial information about dust grain properties. Given the increasing number of high-quality datasets available, an efficient method to extract the SPF is required. DRAGyS is a tool designed for the quick and comprehensive analysis of ring-shaped protoplanetary disks. It directly estimates the disk geometry and extracts the total and polarized SPF from scattered light images, without requiring any radiative transfer modeling, a limitation of previous efforts. Key disk parameters (inclination, position angle, aspect ratio) are obtained by fitting ellipses to the disk intensity peaks from the ring surface, assuming the disks are circular. We validated the method using simulated disk images and then applied it to archival polarized-intensity images of nine images for six protoplanetary disks. DRAGyS provides a method to correct for the effect of limb brightening on the SPF. DRAGyS recovers well the injected geometry and the SPF from synthetic images where the parameters are known. When compared to previously published results extracted from images without considering limb brightening, DRAGyS yields similar results for the inclination, position angle, and SPF. We show that the effect of limb brightening on the SPF is significant, with consequences for the inference of dust properties. DRAGyS takes advantage of a fast and purely geometrical approach to estimate ringed-disk geometries. It allows the efficient extraction of SPF either globally or by sectors, allowing it to deal with disk asymmetries. By bypassing the need for a full modeling of the disk geometry before SPF extraction, DRAGyS is well suited to study large samples of disk images.

          On the chaos induced by the Galactic bar on the orbits of nearby halo stars

 - **Abstract**
 Many of the Milky Way's accreted substructures have been discovered and studied in the space of energy $E$, and angular momentum components $L_z$ and $L_{\bot}$. In a static axisymmetric system, these quantities are (reasonable approximations of) the integrals of motion of an orbit. However, in a galaxy like the Milky Way with a triaxial, rotating bar, none of these quantities are conserved, and the only known integral is the Jacobi energy $E_J$. This may result in chaotic orbits, especially for inner halo stars. Here, we investigate the bar's effect on the dynamics of nearby halo stars, and more specifically its impact on their distribution in $(E, L_z, L_{\bot})$ space. To this end, we have integrated and characterised the orbits of halo stars located within 1 kpc from the Sun. We computed their orbital frequencies and quantified the degree of chaoticity and associated timescales, using the Lyapunov exponent and the frequency diffusion rate. We find that the bar introduces a large degree of chaoticity on the stars in our sample: more than half are found to be on chaotic orbits, and this fraction is highest for stars on very bound and/or radial orbits. Such stars wander in $(E, L_z, L_{\bot})$ space on timescales shorter than a Hubble time. This introduces some overlap and hence contamination amongst previously identified accreted substructures with these orbital characteristics, although our assessment is that this is relatively limited. The bar also induces a number of resonances in the stellar halo, which are of larger importance for lower inclination, prograde orbits. Because the effect of the Galactic bar on the local halo is important for stars on very bound and/or radial orbits, clustering analyses in these regions should be conducted with care. Replacing the energy by $E_J$ in such analyses could be an improvement.

 - **Abstract**
 The Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf spheroidal galaxy is one of the most prominent satellites of the Milky Way (MW). It is currently undergoing tidal disruption, forming an extensive stellar stream that provides key insights into the assembly history of the MW halo. In this study we analyzed RR Lyrae stars (RRLs) in the Sgr stream provided in Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3), for which new estimates of photometric metallicities are available in the literature, and accurate distances were calculated using the reddening-free period-Wesenheit-metallicity ($PWZ$) relation. We determine the mean metallicity of RRLs in the Sgr stream to be ${\rm [Fe/H]}=-1.62 \pm 0.01$ dex. We measure a metallicity gradient as a function of stripping time from the Sgr progenitor of $0.05 \pm 0.02$ dex/Gyr, indicating that the metal-poor RRLs were stripped earlier during the accretion process. The far arm is found to be the most metal-poor structure of the Sgr stream, with a mean metallicity of ${\rm [Fe/H]}=-1.98 \pm 0.37$ dex, significantly lower than that of the leading ($-1.69\pm0.31$ dex) and trailing ($-1.64 \pm 0.28$ dex) arms. Our findings show that the RRLs in the far arm of the Sgr stream exhibit a bimodal metallicity distribution with peaks at [Fe/H]=$-2.4$ dex and $-1.7$ dex. The main body of the stream is the most metal-rich structure, with a mean metallicity of ${\rm [Fe/H]}=-1.58 \pm 0.31$ dex and a radial gradient of $-0.008 \pm 0.005$ dex/kpc. We find almost negligible metallicity gradients of $(-0.2 \pm 0.3)\times 10^{-3}$ dex/deg in the trailing arm and $(-1.0 \pm 0.5)\times 10^{-3}$ dex/deg in the leading arm, in agreement with previous studies. Finally, we investigate the bifurcation of the Sgr stream and conclude that the metallicity difference between the faint and bright branches is not confirmed based on the RRLs in our sample.

          On the detection of caustic crossing events associated with dark matter in the form of primordial black holes

 - **Abstract**
 The possibility that stellar mass primordial black holes may make up at least a significant fraction of dark matter has recently received much attention, partly as a result of gravitational wave observations, but more specifically from observations of microlensing in the Galactic halo and in quasar gravitational lens systems. If this is the case then a number of observable consequences are to be expected. This paper focusses on the prediction that dark matter in the form of primordial black holes will result in a web of caustics which when traversed by quasars will result in a complex but characteristic amplification of the accretion disc light source. Caustic crossings produce features in quasar light curves which are relatively straightforward to identify, and are hard to associate with any intrinsic mode of variation. Microlensing simulations are used to clarify the nature of the expected light curve features, and compared with observed light curves to demonstrate that caustic crossing features can be present. A further test of microlensing is based on the expected statistical symmetry of the light curves, which is not predicted for most models of intrinsic quasar variability, but is found in large samples of quasar light curves. The conclusion of the paper is that observations of quasar light curves are consistent with the expected microlensing amplifications from dark matter made up of stellar mass primordial black holes, but cannot easily be explained by intrinsic variations of the quasar accretion disc.

 - **Abstract**
 Decaying dark matter (DDM) has emerged as an interesting framework to extend the Lambda-cold-dark-matter (LCDM) model, as many particle physics models predict that dark matter may not be stable over cosmic time and can impact structure formation. In particular, a model in which DM decays at a rate $\Gamma$ and imprints a velocity kick $v$ onto its decay products leads to a low amplitude of fluctuations, as quantified by the parameter $S_8$, in better agreement with that measured by some past weak lensing surveys. Bayesian analyses have provided mixed conclusions regarding its viability, with a reconstructed clustering amplitude only slightly below the standard LCDM value. In this paper, we perform a frequentist analysis of Planck+BAO data. We find $1\sigma$ constraints on the half-life of $6.93^{+7.88}_{-2.85}$Gyr and a velocity kick of $1250^{+1450}_{-1000}$km/s which differ from their Bayesian counterparts, indicating the presence of volume effects. Moreover, we find that under the DDM model, the frequentist analysis predicts lower values of $S_8$, in agreement with those found by KiDS-1000 and DES-Y3 at $1.5\sigma$. We further show that previously derived KiDS-1000 constraints that appeared to exclude the best-fit model from Planck data were driven by priors on the primordial parameters $A_s$ and $n_s$. When those are removed from the analysis, KiDS-1000 constraints on the DDM parameters are fully relaxed. It is only when applying Planck-informed priors on $A_s$ and $n_s$ to the KiDS-1000 analysis that one can constrain the model. We further highlight that in the absence of such priors, the region of scales best-measured by KiDS-1000 does not exactly match the $S_8$ kernel, but rather a slightly smaller range of scales centered around $k\sim 0.3\, h/$Mpc. One must thus be careful in applying $S_8$ constraints to a model instead of the full data likelihood.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar oscillation codes are software instruments that evaluate the normal-mode frequencies of an input stellar model. While inter-code comparisons are often used to confirm the correctness of calculations, they are not suitable for characterizing the numerical error of an individual code. To address this issue, we introduce a set of tools -- 'error measures' -- that facilitate this characterization. We explore the behavior of these error measures as calculation parameters, such as the number of radial grid points used to discretize the oscillation equations, are varied; and we summarize this behavior via an idealized error model. While our analysis focuses on the GYRE code, it remains broadly applicable to other oscillation codes.

          Bursty or heavy? The surprise of bright Population III systems in the Reionization era

 - **Abstract**
 The nature of the first, so-called Population III (Pop III), stars has for long remained largely unconstrained. However, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) finally opened new concrete prospects for their detection during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR), notably providing promising observational constraints on the Pop III ultra-violet luminosity function (UVLF) at $z \sim 6.5$. These preliminary data hint towards an unexpected population of UV-bright Pop III sources, which challenges the prevailing view that Pop III star formation is confined to molecular-cooling mini-halos. Here we show that there are two families of models that can explain these surprising observations, either by allowing for late-time Pop III formation within massive, atomic-cooling halos (with halo masses up to $M_\mathrm{up}^\mathrm{III} \gtrsim 10^{10.5} ~\mathrm{M_\odot}$) or by invoking a highly bursty Pop III star-formation activity (with a stochasticity parameter $\sigma_\mathrm{UV}^\mathrm{III} \gtrsim 1.5$). In these scenarios Pop III systems would have to be either heavier or burstier than usually assumed, underscoring the need to reconsider common assumptions about Pop III star-formation sites, and the potential implications of JWST candidates for current and future observations.

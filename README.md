 - **Abstract**
 A Uranus orbiter would be well positioned to detect the planet's free oscillation modes, whose frequencies can resolve questions about Uranus's weakly constrained interior. We calculate the spectra that may manifest in resonances with ring orbits or in Doppler imaging of Uranus's visible surface, using a wide range of interior models that satisfy the present constraints. Recent work has shown that Uranus's fundamental (f) and internal gravity (g) modes have appropriate frequencies to resonate with Uranus's narrow rings. We show that even a single $\ell=2$ f or g mode detected in ring imaging or occultations can constrain Uranus's core extent and density. Fully fluid models typically have $\ell=2-7$ f mode frequencies slightly too high to resonate among the narrow rings. If Uranus has a solid core that f modes cannot penetrate, their frequencies are reduced, rendering them more likely to be observed. A single $\ell\gtrsim7$ f mode detection would constrain Uranus's unknown rotation period. Meanwhile, the different technique of Doppler imaging seismology requires specialized instrumentation but could deliver many detections, with best sensitivity to acoustic (p) modes at mHz frequencies. Deviations from uniform frequency spacing can be used to locate density interfaces in Uranus's interior, such as a sharp core boundary. Shallower nonadiabaticity and condensation layers complicate this approach, but higher-order frequency differences can be analyzed to disentangle deep and near-surface effects. The detection of normal modes by a Uranus orbiter would help to discern among the degenerate solutions permitted by conventional measurements of the planet's static gravity field.

          A Time-Resolved High-Resolution Spectroscopic Analysis of Ionized Calcium and Dynamical Processes in the Ultra-Hot Jupiter HAT-P-70 b

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first transmission spectroscopy study of an exoplanet atmosphere with the high-resolution mode of the new Gemini High-resolution Optical SpecTrograph (GHOST) instrument at the Gemini South Observatory. We observed one transit of HAT-P-70 b - an ultra-hot Jupiter with an inflated radius - and made a new detection of the infrared Ca II triplet in its transmission spectrum. The depth of the strongest line implies that a substantial amount of Ca II extends to at least 47% above the bulk planetary radius. The triplet lines are blueshifted between ~ 3 to 5 km/s, indicative of strong dayside-to-nightside winds common on highly irradiated gas giants. Comparing the transmission spectrum with atmospheric models that incorporate non-local thermodynamic equilibrium effects suggests that the planetary mass is likely between 1 to 2 $M_{\rm J}$, much lighter than the upper limit previously derived from radial velocity measurements. Importantly, thanks to the the high signal-to-noise ratio achieved by GHOST/Gemini South, we are able to measure the temporal variation of these signals. Absorption depths and velocity offsets of the individual Ca II lines remain mostly consistent across the transit, except for the egress phases, where weaker absorption and stronger blueshifts are observed, highlighting the atmospheric processes within the trailing limb alone. Our study demonstrates the ability of GHOST to make time-resolved detections of individual spectral lines, providing valuable insights into the 3D nature of exoplanet atmospheres by probing different planetary longitudes as the tidally locked planet rotates during the transit.

 - **Abstract**
 Binary population synthesis simulations allow detailed modelling of gravitational-wave sources from a variety of formation channels. These population models can be compared to the observed catalogue of merging binaries to infer the uncertain astrophysical input parameters describing binary formation and evolution, as well as relative rates between various formation pathways. However, it is computationally infeasible to run population synthesis simulations for all variations of uncertain input physics. We demonstrate the use of normalising flows to emulate population synthesis results and interpolate between astrophysical input parameters. Using current gravitational-wave observations of binary black holes, we use our trained normalising flows to infer branching ratios between multiple formation channels, and simultaneously infer common-envelope efficiency and natal spins across a continuous parameter range. Given our set of formation channel models, we infer the natal spin to be $0.04^{+0.04}_{-0.01}$, and the common-envelope efficiency to be $>3.7$ at 90% credibility, with the majority of underlying mergers coming from the common-envelope channel. Our framework allows us to measure population synthesis inputs where we do not have simulations, and better constrain the astrophysics underlying current gravitational-wave populations.

 - **Abstract**
 The impact of neutrino flavor conversion on the supernova mechanism is yet to be fully understood. We present multi-energy and multi-angle solutions of the neutrino quantum kinetic equations in three flavors, taking into account neutrino advection and non-forward collisions with the background medium. Flavor evolution is explored within a spherically symmetric shell surrounding the region of neutrino decoupling in the interior of a core-collapse supernova, relying on the outputs of a spherically symmetric core-collapse supernova model with a mass of $18.6 M_\odot$. We select two representative post-bounce times: $t_{\rm pb} = 0.25$ s (no angular crossings are present and flavor conversion is triggered by slow collective effects) and $t_{\rm pb} = 1$ s (angular crossings trigger fast flavor instabilities). We find that flavor equipartition is achieved in the antineutrino sector between $\bar\nu_e$ and $\bar\nu_x = (\bar\nu_\mu + \bar\nu_\tau)/2$ for both post-bounce times. In the neutrino sector, flavor equipartition between $\nu_e$ and $\nu_x$ seems more likely at later post-bounce times, where the neutrino emission properties among different flavors tend to approach each other, but it is not a generic feature. The exponential growth of the $\nu_\mu$--$\nu_\tau$ asymmetry due to three-flavor effects is responsible for differences between the quasi-steady configurations obtained in the three-flavor solution and in the two-flavor approximation. This has consequences on the neutrino heating rate, which is generally larger when all three flavors are taken into account and can increase up to $30\%$ with respect to the case where flavor conversion is neglected.

 - **Abstract**
 We have performed a detailed abundance analysis of 10 red giant members of the heavily obscured bulge globular cluster HP~1 using high-resolution, high S/N near-infrared spectra collected with the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment II survey (APOGEE-2), obtained as part of the bulge Cluster APOgee Survey (CAPOS). We investigate chemical abundances for a variety of species including the light (C,N), odd-Z (Al), $\alpha$ (O,Mg,Si,S,Ca and Ti), Fe-peak (Ni,Fe), and neutron-capture (Ce) elements. The derived mean cluster metallicity is [Fe/H]$=-1.15\pm0.03$, with no evidence for an intrinsic metallicity spread. HP~1 exhibits a typical $\alpha$-enrichment that follows the trend for similar metallicity Galactic GCs, such as NGC~288 and NGC~5904, although our [Si/Fe] abundances are relatively high. We find a significant nitrogen spread ($\sim 1$ dex), and a large fraction of nitrogen-enhanced ([N/Fe]$>+0.7$) stars that populate the cluster. We also detect intrinsic star-to-star spreads in [C/Fe], [O/Fe], [Al/Fe], and [Ca/Fe], which are (anti)correlated with several chemical species, indicating the prevalence of the multiple-population phenomenon in HP 1. We have uncovered for the first time a possible correlation between Ca and Al, although the sample is small. The mean $\langle$[Mg/Fe]$\rangle = +0.29$ and $\langle$[Al/Fe]$\rangle = +0.46$ place HP~1 into the region dominated by \textit{in-situ} GCs, supporting the \textit{in-situ} nature of this cluster.

 - **Abstract**
 Cislunar space is the volume between Earth's geosynchronous orbit and beyond the Moon, including the lunar Lagrange points. Understanding the stability of orbits within this space is crucial for the successful planning and execution of space missions. Orbits in cislunar space are influenced by the gravitational forces of the Sun, Earth, Moon, and other Solar System planets leading to typically unpredictable and chaotic behavior. It is therefore difficult to predict the stability of an orbit from a set of initial orbital elements. We simulate one million cislunar orbits and use a self-organizing map (SOM) to cluster the orbits into families based on how long they remain stable within the cislunar regime. Utilizing Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory's (LLNL) High Performance Computers (HPC) we develop a highly adaptable SOM capable of efficiently characterizing observations from individual events. We are able to predict the lifetime from the initial three line element (TLE) to within 10 percent for 8 percent of the test dataset, within 50 percent for 43 percent of the dataset, and within 100 percent for 75 percent of the dataset. The fractional absolute deviation peaks at 1 for all lifetimes. Multi-modal clustering in the SOM suggests that a variety of orbital morphologies have similar lifetimes. The trained SOMs use an average of 2.73 milliseconds of computational time to produce an orbital stability prediction. The outcomes of this research enhance our understanding of cislunar orbital dynamics and also provide insights for mission planning, enabling the rapid identification of stable orbital regions and pathways for future space exploration. As demonstrated in this study, an SOM can generate orbital lifetime estimates from minimal observational data, such as a single TLE, making it essential for early warning systems and large-scale sensor network operations.

 - **Abstract**
 Although Neptunian-sized (2 - 5 R$_{Earth}$) planets appear to be extremely common in the Galaxy, many mysteries remain about their overall nature. To date, only eleven Neptunian-sized planets have had their atmospheres spectroscopically characterized, and these observations hint at interesting diversity within this class of planets. Much of our understanding of these worlds and others derive from transmission spectroscopy with the Hubble Space Telescope's Wide Field Camera 3 (HST/WFC3). One key outcome of HST/WFC3 observations has been the consistent detection of water but no methane in Neptunian atmospheres, though recent JWST observations are potentially starting to overturn this "missing methane" paradigm. In this work, we present the transmission spectrum of the hot Neptune HD 219666 b from 1.1 - 1.6 $\mu$m from two transit observations using HST/WFC3 G141. Our fiducial atmospheric retrieval detects water at ~3-$\sigma$ in HD 219666 b's atmosphere and prefers no contribution from methane, similar to these previous observations of other planets. Motivated by recent detections of methane in Neptunian atmospheres by JWST, we explore additional models and find that a methane-only scenario could adequately fit the data, though it is not preferred and likely unphysical. We discuss the impact of this methane detection challenge on our understanding of planetary atmospheres based on HST/WFC3 observations alone, and where JWST observations offer a solution.

          The Effect of Massive Trans-Neptunian Objects in the Long-term Evolution and Leaking Rates of Neptune's 3:2 and 2:1 Mean Motion Resonances

 - **Abstract**
 The current populations trapped in Neptune's main mean motion resonances in the Kuiper belt, Plutinos in the 3:2 and Twotinos in the 2:1, contain some of the best-characterized minor objects in the Solar System, given their dynamical importance. In particular, Twotinos may hide evidence of Neptune's early migration. However, these populations vary in time, declining at a rate that has not been previously clearly established. In this work, we use numerical simulations to study the long-term evolution of the Plutino and Twotino populations. We use two data sources: the most up-to-date observations and the theoretical debiased model of the Kuiper belt known as L7. In addition to studying the giant planets' effect on these populations over 4 Gyr, we analyze the additional impact produced by the most massive trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) closest to these resonances. We find that the decay rate in each resonance can be modeled as a stochastic process well described by an exponential decay with an offset determined by an underlying long-term stable population. The most massive TNOs, particularly Pluto, influence this decay rate significantly, as expected for the 3:2 resonance. Still, despite its distance, Pluto also strongly influences the 2:1 resonance's evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 One of the most prolific methods of studying exoplanet atmospheres is transmission spectroscopy, which measures the difference between the depth of an exoplanet's transit signal at various wavelengths and attempts to correlate the depth changes to potential features in the exoplanet's atmosphere. Here we present reconnaissance observations of 21 exoplanet atmospheres measured with the Exoplanet Transmission Spectroscopy Imager (ETSI), a recently deployed spectro-photometer on the McDonald Observatory Otto Struve 2.1 m telescope. ETSI measurements are mostly free of systematics through the use of a novel observing technique called common-path multi-band imaging (CMI), which has been shown to achieve photometric color precision on-par with space-based observations (300ppm or 0.03%). This work also describes the various statistical tests performed on the data to evaluate the efficacy of the CMI method and the ETSI instrument in combination. We find that none of the 8 comparisons of exoplanet atmospheres measured with ETSI and other observatories (including the Hubble Space Telescope) provide evidence that the spectra are statistically dissimilar. These results suggest that ETSI can provide initial transmission spectroscopy observations for a fraction of the observational and monetary overhead previously required to detect an exoplanet's atmosphere. Ultimately these reconnaissance observations increase the number of planets with transmission spectroscopy measurements by ~10% and provide an immediate prioritization of 21 exoplanets for future follow-up with more precious observatories, such as the James Webb Space Telescope. The reconnaissance spectra are available through the Filtergraph visualization portal at the URL: this https URL.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new pipeline designed for the robust inference of cosmological parameters using both second- and third-order shear statistics. We build a theoretical model for rapid evaluation of three-point correlations using our fastnc code and integrate it into the CosmoSIS framework. We measure the two-point functions $\xi_{\pm}$ and the full configuration-dependent three-point shear correlation functions across all auto- and cross-redshift bins. We compress the three-point functions into the mass aperture statistic $\langle M_{\rm ap}^3\rangle$ for a set of 796 simulated shear maps designed to model the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 3 data. We estimate from it the full covariance matrix and model the effects of intrinsic alignments, shear calibration biases and photometric redshift uncertainties. We apply scale cuts to minimize the contamination from the baryonic signal as modeled through hydrodynamical simulations. We find a significant improvement of $83\%$ on the Figure of Merit in the $\Omega_{\rm m}$-$S_8$ plane when we add the $\langle M_{\rm ap}^3\rangle$ data to the $\xi_{\pm}$ information. We present our findings for all relevant cosmological and systematic uncertainty parameters and discuss the complementarity of third-order and second-order statistics.

 - **Abstract**
 In view of the great uncertainty of the equation of state (EOS) of high-density nuclear matter, establishing EOS-independent universal relations between global properties of neutron stars provides a practical way to constrain the unobservable or difficult-to-observe properties through astronomical observations. It is common to construct universal relations between EOS-dependent properties (e.g., moment of inertia, tidal deformation, etc.) or combined properties (e.g., compactness). Improving the precision of the universal relations may provide stricter constraint on the properties of neutron star. We find that in 3-dimensional space with mass and radius as the base coordinates, the points corresponding to a certain property of neutron star described by different EOSs are almost located in the same surface. Thus the universal relation between the property and the stellar mass-radius can be expressed through describing the surface. It is shown that the resulting universal relations have higher precisions. As an example, we construct high-precision universal relations for the moment of inertia, the $f$-mode frequency, and the dimensionless tidal deformation respect to the mass-radius. As the observational data of neutron star mass and radius from NICER grows in data and accuracy, these universal relations allow for more precise constraints on the unobservable or difficult-to-observe properties.

 - **Abstract**
 Modern Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs) generate a huge amount of data that must be classified automatically, ideally in real time. Currently, machine learning-based solutions are increasingly being used to solve classification problems. However, these classifiers require proper training data sets to work correctly. The problem with training neural networks on real IACT data is that these data need to be pre-labeled, whereas such labeling is difficult and its results are estimates. In addition, the distribution of incoming events is highly imbalanced. Firstly, there is an imbalance in the types of events, since the number of detected gamma quanta is significantly less than the number of protons. Secondly, the energy distribution of particles of the same type is also imbalanced, since high-energy particles are extremely rare. This imbalance results in poorly trained classifiers that, once trained, do not handle rare events correctly. Using only conventional Monte Carlo event simulation methods to solve this problem is possible, but extremely resource-intensive and time-consuming. To address this issue, we propose to perform data augmentation with artificially generated events of the desired type and energy using conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs), distinguishing classes by energy values. In the paper, we describe a simple algorithm for generating balanced data sets using cGANs. Thus, the proposed neural network model produces both imbalanced data sets for physical analysis as well as balanced data sets suitable for training other neural networks.

 - **Abstract**
 Supergiant Fast X-ray Transients (SFXT) are a sub-class of High Mass X-ray Binaries (HMXB) in which a compact object accretes part of the clumpy wind of the blue supergiant companion, triggering a series of brief, X-ray flares lasting a few kiloseconds. Currently, only about fifteen SFXTs are known. The EXTraS catalog provides the timing signatures of every source observed by the EPIC instrument on-board XMM-Newton. Among the most peculiar sources, in terms of variability, we selected 4XMM J181330.1-17511 (J1813). We analyzed all publicly available X-ray data pointed at the J1813 position to determine the source's duty cycle and to provide a comprehensive description of its timing and spectral behavior during its active phase. Additionally, we searched for the optical and infrared counterpart of the X-ray source in public databases and fitted its Spectral Energy Distribution (SED). The optical-to-MIR SED of J1813 is consistent with a highly-absorbed (A$_V\sim38$) B0 star at $\sim$10 kpc. During its X-ray active phase, the source is characterized by continuous $\sim$thousands seconds-long flares with peak luminosities (2-12 keV) ranging from $10^{34}$ to $4 \times 10^{35}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Its X-ray spectrum is consistent with a high-absorbed power-law model with N$_H \sim 1.8 \times 10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$ and $\Gamma \sim 1.66$. No spectral variability was observed as a function of time or flux. J1813 is in a quiescent state $\sim$60\% of the time, with an upper-limit luminosity of $8 \times 10^{32}$ erg s$^{-1}$ (at 10 kpc), implying an observed long-term X-ray flux variability $>$500. The optical counterpart alone indicates J1813 is a HMXB. Its transient nature, duty cycle, the amplitude of observed X-ray variability, the shape and luminosity of the X-ray flares -- and the lack of known X-ray outbursts ($>10^{36}$ erg s$^{-1}$) -- strongly support the identification of J1813 as an SFXT.

 - **Abstract**
 This study investigates polarimetric characteristics of the blazar 3C~454.3 at 22-129~GHz using decadal~(2011-2022) data sets. In addition, we also delve into the origin of the polarization flare observed in 2019. The data sets were obtained from the single-dish mode observations of the Korean VLBI Network~(KVN) and the 43-GHz Very Long Baseline Array~(VLBA). We compared the consistency of the measurements between milli-arcsecond and arcsecond scales. The Faraday rotation measure values were obtained via two approaches, model fitting to a linear function in all frequency ranges, and calculation from adjacent frequency pairs. We found that the linear polarization angle is preferred to be $\sim100^{\circ}$ when the source is highly polarized. At 43~GHz, we found that the polarized emission at scales of mas and arcsecond is consistent when we compare its flux density and polarization angle. The ratio of quasi-simultaneously measured polarized flux density is $1.02\pm0.07$, and the polarization angles display similar rotation. These suggest that the extended jet beyond the scale of VLBA 43~GHz has a negligible convolution effect on the polarization angle from the KVN. We found an interesting, notable flaring event in the KVN single-dish data from the polarized emission in 2019 in the frequency range of 22-129~GHz. During the flare, the observed polarization angles~($\chi_{\rm obs}$) rotate from $\sim150^{\circ}$ to $\sim100^{\circ}$ at all frequencies with a chromatic polarization degree~($m_{\rm p}$). Based on the observed $m_{\rm p}$ and $\chi_{\rm obs}$, and also the Faraday rotation measure, we suggest that the polarization flare in 2019 is attributed to the shock-shock interaction in the stationary jet region. The change in the viewing angle of the jet alone is insufficient to describe the increase in brightness temperature, indicating the presence of source intrinsic processes.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we numerically explore the dynamics of a point mass (e.g., a stellar-mass black hole) moving within a thin accretion disk of a massive object (i.e., a supermassive black hole) with three dimensional hydrodynamical simulations using \texttt{Athena++}. We are particularly interested in the regime that the Hill radius of the point mass is greater than the disk thickness, but the point mass is not sufficiently massive to open a ``gap" in a high viscosity disk. This parameter regime may be seen for stellar-mass objects moving within thin accretion disks of massive black holes, but less studied for the planet migration scenario in protoplanetary disks. We find that the disk migration may be significantly slower than the type I migration, depending on the surface density gradient of the disk. Furthermore, the circumsingle disk around the point mass plays an important role in damping the orbital eccentricity. If the gravitational interaction between the point mass and circumsingle disk material is turned off, the orbital eccentricity may be pumped to $\mathcal{O}(10^{-2})$ level. Because space-borne gravitational wave detectors such as LISA (Laser Interferometer Space Antenna) is able to measure the eccentricity of extreme mass-ratio inspirals to the level of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-5})$, this finding highlights the importance of understanding stellar-mass black hole feedback mechanisms which will modify the structures of the circumsingle disk, as they will impact LISA observables such as the eccentricity.

 - **Abstract**
 Swift J1727.8--1613 is a black hole X-ray binary that differs from other black hole X-ray binaries in that it has an extra hard component in addition to a reflection component. We perform spectral analysis with simultaneous Insight-HXMT, NICER and NuSTAR observations when the source was in the hard and hard intermediate states. For the presentation of the extra components, we investigate the correlation between the relxill parameters. We find that the correlation between the spectral index and the reflection fraction is consistent with MAXI J1820+070 when the jet dominates the reflection. This provides the second sample to have such a correlation during an outburst. Interestingly, when the reflection component is attributed to the corona, the spectral fit results in a small reflection fraction and the correlation between the spectral index and reflection fraction is in agreement with the overall trend built-in You et al. 2023 with a large sample of outbursts from other X-ray binaries. Hence Swift J1727.8--1613 turns out to be the first sample to bridge the MAXI J1820+070 to the majority of X-ray binaries according to the dual correlations observed between the spectral index and the reflection fraction. We speculate that a configuration of a jet plus a hot inner flow may account for this peculiar outburst behavior of Swift J1727.8--1613.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we discuss model-independent reconstruction of the expansion history of the late Universe. We use Gaussian Process Regression to reconstruct the evolution of various cosmological parameters such as H(z) and slow-roll parameter using observational data to train the GP model. We look at the GP reconstruction of these parameters using stationary and non-stationary kernel functions. We examine the effect of the choice of kernel functions on the reconstructions. We find that non-stationary kernels such as polynomial kernels might be a better choice for the reconstruction if the training data set is noisy (such as H(z) data) as it helps to avoid fitting the error in the data. We also look at the kernel dependence of other cosmological parameters such as the redshift of transition to the accelerated expansion. This has been achieved by reconstructing the derivatives of the expansion history (H(z)) such as the deceleration parameter/slow-roll parameter.

 - **Abstract**
 Axions are well-motivated dark matter particles. Many experiments are looking for their experimental evidence. For haloscopes, the problem reduces to the identification of a peak above a noisy baseline. Its modeling, however, may problematic. State-of-the-art analysis rely on the Savitzky-Golay (SG) filtering, which is intrinsically affected by any possible over fluctuation, leading to biased results. In this paper we study the efficiency that different extensions of SG can provide in the peak reconstruction in a standard haloscope-like experiment. We show that, once the correlations among bins are taken into account, there is no appreciable difference. The standard SG remains the advisable choice because of its numerical efficiency.

 - **Abstract**
 We present multiband observations and analysis of EP240801a, a low-energy, extremely soft gamma-ray burst (GRB) discovered on August 1, 2024 by the Einstein Probe (EP) satellite, with a weak contemporaneous signal also detected by Fermi/GBM. Optical spectroscopy of the afterglow, obtained by GTC and Keck, identified the redshift of $z = 1.6734$. EP240801a exhibits a burst duration of 148 s in X-rays and 22.3 s in gamma-rays, with X-rays leading by 80.61 s. Spectral lag analysis indicates the gamma-ray signal arrived 8.3 s earlier than the X-rays. Joint spectral fitting of EP/WXT and Fermi/GBM data yields an isotropic energy $E_{\gamma,\rm{iso}} = (5.57^{+0.54}_{-0.50})\times 10^{51}\,\rm{erg}$, a peak energy $E_{\rm{peak}} = 14.90^{+7.08}_{-4.71}\,\rm{keV}$, a fluence ratio $\rm S(25-50\,\rm{keV})/S(50-100\,\rm{keV}) = 1.67^{+0.74}_{-0.46}$, classifying EP240801a as an X-ray flash (XRF). The host-galaxy continuum spectrum, inferred using Prospector, was used to correct its contribution for the observed outburst optical data. Unusual early $R$-band behavior and EP/FXT observations suggest multiple components in the afterglow. Three models are considered: two-component jet model, forward-reverse shock model and forward-shock model with energy injection. Both three provide reasonable explanations. The two-component jet model and the energy injection model imply a relatively small initial energy and velocity of the jet in the line of sight, while the forward-reverse shock model remains typical. Under the two-component jet model, EP240801a may resemble GRB 221009A (BOAT) if the bright narrow beam is viewed on-axis. Therefore, EP240801a can be interpreted as an off-beam (narrow) jet or an intrinsically weak GRB jet. Our findings provide crucial clues for uncovering the origin of XRFs.

 We investigate the axially symmetric accretion of low angular momentum hydrodynamic matter onto a rotating black hole. The gravitational field under consideration is assumed to be described by a pseudo-Newtonian Kerr potential. The accreting matter consists of different species defined by a relativistic equation of state with a variable adiabatic this http URL construct and solve the hydrodynamical conservation equations governing such a flow, and find out the corresponding stationary integral solutions. We find that depending on the values of initial boundary conditions, accretion flow may exhibit multi-transonic behaviour, and a standing shock may form. We investigate, in minute detail, how the spin angular momentum of the black hole, as well as the composition of the accreting matter influence the dynamics of accretion flow and the astrophysics of shock formation in the aforementioned accreting black hole systems.

 - **Abstract**
 Numerical simulations of multidimensional astrophysical fluids present considerable challenges. However, the development of exascale computing has significantly enhanced computational capabilities, motivating the development of new codes that can take full advantage of these resources. In this article, we introduce HERACLES++, a new hydrodynamics code with high portability, optimized for exascale machines with different architectures and running efficiently both on CPUs and GPUs. The code is Eulerian and employs a Godunov finite-volume method to solve the hydrodynamics equations, which ensures accuracy in capturing shocks and discontinuities. It includes different Riemann solvers, equations of state, and gravity solvers. It works in Cartesian and spherical coordinates, either in 1-D, 2-D, or 3-D, and uses passive scalars to handle gases with several species. The code accepts a user-supplied heating or cooling term to treat a variety of astrophysical contexts. In addition to the usual series of benchmarking tests, we use HERACLES++ to simulate the propagation of a supernova shock in a red-supergiant star envelope, from minutes after core collapse until shock emergence. In 1-D, the results from HERACLES++ are in agreement with those of V1D for the same configuration. In 3-D, the Rayleigh-Taylor instability develops and modifies the 1-D picture by introducing density and composition fluctuations as well as turbulence. The focus on a wedge, rather than the full solid angle, and the ability of running HERACLES++ with a large number of GPUs allow for long-term simulations of 3-D supernova ejecta with a sub-degree resolution. Future development is to extend HERACLES++ to a radiation-hydrodynamics code.

 - **Abstract**
 The study of the atmosphere of exoplanets orbiting white dwarfs is a largely unexplored field. With WD\,0806-661\,b, we present the first deep dive into the atmospheric physics and chemistry of a cold exoplanet around a white dwarf. We observed WD 0806-661 b using JWST's Mid-InfraRed Instrument Low-Resolution Spectrometer (MIRI-LRS), covering the wavelength range from 5 -- 12~$\mu \rm{m}$, and the Imager, providing us with 12.8, 15, 18 and 21\,$\mu$m photometric measurements. We carried the data reduction of those datasets, tackling second-order effects to ensure a reliable retrieval analysis. Using the \textsc{TauREx} retrieval code, we inferred the pressure-temperature structure, atmospheric chemistry, mass, and radius of the planet. The spectrum of WD 0806-661 b is shaped by molecular absorption of water, ammonia, and methane, consistent with a cold Jupiter atmosphere, allowing us to retrieve their abundances. From the mixing ratio of water, ammonia and methane we derive $\rm{C/O} = 0.34 \pm 0.06$, $\rm{C/N} = 14.4 ^{+2.5}_{-1.8}$ and $\rm{N/O} = 0.023 \pm 0.004$ and the ratio of detected metals as proxy for metallicity. We also derive upper limits for the abundance of CO and $\rm{CO_2}$ ($1.2\cdot10^{-6} \rm{\,and\,} 1.6\cdot10^{-7}$ respectively), which were not detected by our retrieval models. While our interpretation of WD\,0806-661\,b's atmosphere is mostly consistent with our theoretical understanding, some results -- such as the lack of evidence for water clouds, an apparent increase in the mixing ratio of ammonia at low pressure, or the retrieved mass at odds with the supposed age -- remain surprising and require follow-up observational and theoretical studies to be confirmed.

 - **Abstract**
 Oph-S1 is the most luminous and massive stellar member of the nearby Ophiuchus star-forming region. Previous Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) observations have shown it to be an intermediate-mass binary system ($\sim 5\,{\rm M}_\odot$) with an orbital period of about 21 months, but a paucity of radio detections of the secondary near periastron could potentially have affected the determination of its orbital parameters. Here, we present nine new VLBA observations of Oph-S1 focused on its periastron passage in early 2024. We detect the primary in all observations and the secondary at five epochs, including three within about a month of periastron passage. The updated orbit, determined by combining our new data with 35 previous observations, agrees well with previous calculations and yields masses of $4.115 \pm0.039 \,{\rm M}_\odot$ and $0.814\pm0.006 \,{\rm M}_\odot$ for the two stars in the system.

 Ultralight Dark Matter (ULDM) offers an alternative to cold dark matter, characterized by wavelike behavior on galactic scales. This contribution summarizes our work~\cite{Blas:2024duy} on how solitonic cores induced by ULDM affect gravitational waves (GWs), enabling their detection through next-generation observatories like LISA, Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer. We show that continuous GWs from spinning neutron stars near the Galactic Center (GC) can probe solitons for \(m \lesssim 10^{-22}\, \mathrm{eV}\) and surpass current constraints on the ULDM couplings to the Standard Model for masses \(m \lesssim 10^{-20}\, \mathrm{eV}\). Additionally, GW modulation could reveal solitons in extragalactic systems, particularly in more massive halos, highlighting the broad potential of GW-based methods for uncovering ULDM properties.

 - **Abstract**
 Blazars are interesting source candidates for astrophysical neutrino emission. Multi-messenger lepto-hadronic models based on proton-photon (p-gamma) interactions result in predictions for the neutrino spectra which are typically strongly peaked at high energies. In contrast, statistical analyses looking to associate blazars and neutrinos often assume a power-law spectral shape, putting the emphasis at lower energies. We aim to examine the impact of such spectral modelling assumptions on the associations of neutrinos with blazars. We use hierarchical_nu, a Bayesian framework for point source searches, and incorporate the theoretical predictions for neutrino spectra through a dedicated spectral model and priors on the relevant parameters. Our spectral model is based on the predictions presented in Rodrigues et al. (2024) for a selection of intermediate and high synchrotron peaked blazars that have been connected with IceCube neutrino alert events. We apply our model to the 10 years of publicly available IceCube data, focusing on the Northern hemisphere. Out of 29 source candidates, we find five sources, including TXS 0506+056, that have an association probability greater than 0.5 to at least one event. The p-gamma spectra typically lead to a lower overall number of associated events compared to the power-law case, but retain or even enhance strong associations to high-energy events. Our results demonstrate that including more information from theoretical predictions can allow for more interpretable source-neutrino connections.

 - **Abstract**
 The birth of giant planets in protoplanetary disks is known to alter the structure and evolution of the disk environment, but most of our knowledge focuses on its effects on the observable gas and dust. The impact on the evolution of the invisible planetesimal population is still limitedly studied, yet mounting evidence from the Solar System shows how the appearance of its giant planets played a key role in shaping the habitability of the terrestrial planets. We investigate the dynamical and collisional transport processes of volatile elements by planetesimals in protoplanetary disks that host young giant planets using the HD163296 system as our case study. HD163296 is one of the best characterised protoplanetary disks that has been proposed to host at least four giant planets on wide orbits as well as a massive planetesimal disk. The formation of giant planets in the HD163296 system creates a large population of dynamically excited planetesimals, the majority of which originate from beyond the CO snowline. The excited planetesimals are both transported to the inner disk regions and scattered outward beyond the protoplanetary disk and into interstellar space. Existing solid planets can be enriched in volatile elements to levels comparable or larger than those of the Earth, while giant planets can be enriched to the levels of Jupiter and Saturn. The formation of giant planets on wide orbits impacts the compositional evolution of protoplanetary disks and young planetary bodies on a global scale. The collisional enrichment of the atmospheres of giant planets can alter or mask the signatures of their formation environments, but can provide independent constraints on the disk mass. Protoplanetary disks with giant planets on wide orbits prove efficient factories of interstellar objects.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the cosmological signatures of new light relics that are collisionless like standard neutrinos or are strongly interacting. We provide a simple and succinct rephrasing of their physical effects in the cosmic microwave background, as well as the resulting parameter degeneracies with other cosmological parameters, in terms of the total radiation abundance and the fraction thereof that freely streams. In these more general terms, interacting and noninteracting light relics are differentiated by their respective decrease and increase of the free-streaming fraction, and, moreover, the scale-dependent interplay thereof with a common, correlated reduction of the fraction of matter in baryons. We then derive updated constraints on various dark-radiation scenarios with the latest cosmological observations, employing this language to identify the physical origin of the impact of each dataset. The "PR4" reanalyses of Planck CMB data prefer a larger primordial helium yield and therefore also slightly more radiation than the 2018 analysis, whose origin we identify in a number of poorly fit polarization measurements. Smaller free-streaming fractions are disfavored by the excess lensing of the CMB measured in lensing reconstruction data from Planck and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope. On the other hand, baryon acoustic oscillation measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument drive marginal detections of new, strongly interacting light relics due to that data's preference for lower matter fractions. Finally, we forecast measurements from the CMB-S4 experiment.

 - **Abstract**
 White dwarfs (WD) with main-sequence (MS) companions are crucial probes of stellar evolution. However, due to the significant difference in their luminosities, the WD is often outshined by the MS star. The aim of this work is to find hidden companions in Gaia's sample of single WD candidates. Our methodology involves applying an unsupervised machine learning algorithm for dimensionality reduction and clustering, known as Self-Organizing Map (SOM), to Gaia BP/RP (XP) spectra. This strategy allows us to naturally separate WDMS binaries from single WDs from the detection of subtle red flux excesses in the XP spectra that are indicative of low-mass MS companions. We validate our approach using confirmed WDMS binary pairs from the SDSS and LAMOST surveys, achieving a precision of $\sim 90\%$. Applying our SOM to 90,667 sources, we identify 993 WDMS candidates, 801 of which have not been previously reported in the literature. If confirmed, our sample will increase the known WDMS binaries by $20\%$, making it a valuable source for stellar evolution studies. Additionally, we use the Virtual Observatory Spectral Energy Distribution Analyzer (VOSA) tool to further refine and parameterize a "golden sample" of 136 WDMS candidates through multi-wavelength photometry and a two-body Spectral Energy Distribution fitting. These high-confidence WDMS binaries are composed by low-mass WDs ($\sim 0.41 M_{\odot}$), with cool MS companions ($\sim 2800$ K). Finally, 13 systems exhibit periodic variability consistent with eclipsing binaries, making them prime targets for further follow-up observations.

 - **Abstract**
 The level and uncertainty of the particle induced background in CCD detectors plays a crucial role for future X-ray instruments, such as the Wide Field Imager (WFI) onboard Athena. To mitigate the background systematic uncertainties, which will limit the Athena science goals, we aim to understand the relationship between the energetic charged particles interacting in the detector and satellite, and the instrumental science background to an unprecedented level. These particles produce easily identified "cosmic-ray tracks" along with less easily identified signals produced by secondary particles, e.g., X-rays generated by particle interactions with the instrument and indistinguishable from genuine sky X-rays. We utilize the Small Window Mode of the PN camera onboard XMM-Newton to understand the time, spatial and energy dependence of the various background components, particularly the particle induced background. While the distribution of particle events follows expected detector readout patterns, we find a particle track length distribution inconsistent with the simple, isotropic model. We also find that the detector mode-specific readout results in a shifted Cu fluorescent line. We illustrate that on long timescales the variability of the particle background correlates well with the solar cycle. This 20-year lightcurve, can be reproduced by a particle detector onboard Chandra, the HRC anti-coincidence shield. We conclude that the self-anti-coincidence method of removing X-ray-like events near detected particle tracks in the same frame can be optimized with the inclusion of additional information, such as the energy of the X-ray. The results presented here are relevant for any future pixelated X-ray imaging detector, and could allow the WFI to probe to truly faint X-ray surface brightness.

          Inferring kilonova ejecta photospheric properties from early blackbody spectra

 - **Abstract**
 We present simple analytic corrections to the standard blackbody fitting used for early kilonova emission. We consider a spherical, relativistically expanding shell that radiates thermally at a single temperature in its own rest frame. Due to relativistic effects, including Doppler boosting, time delay, and temperature evolution -- the observed temperature is smeared across different polar angles by approximately $\sim10\%$. While the observed spectrum remains roughly consistent with a single-temperature blackbody, neglecting relativistic effects leads to significant systematic inaccuracies: the inferred photospheric velocity and temperature are overestimated by up to $\sim50\%$ for mildly relativistic velocities. By applying our analytic corrections, these deviations are reduced to within $10\%$, even in cases where the photosphere is receding and cooling is considered. Applying our corrections to observed kilonovae (AT2017gfo and the thermal component of GRB211211A) reveals that standard blackbody fitting overestimated the inferred velocities and temperatures by $10\%-40\%$.

 - **Abstract**
 The increasing precision of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) observations has unveiled significant tensions between different datasets, notably between Planck and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), as well as with the late-Universe measurements of the Hubble constant. In this work, we explore a variety of $\Lambda$CDM extensions to assess their ability to reconcile these discrepancies. The statistical preference for these extensions remains moderate, and imposing $n_s=1$ often worsens model performance. Our findings highlight the limitations of incremental modifications to $\Lambda$CDM and suggest that either more complex new physics or, more likely, improved systematic understanding in the CMB sector may be required to fully address the observed tensions. While CMB experiments are often considered the gold standard of precision cosmology, our results reinforce that these measurements are not immune to systematic uncertainties, which may be underestimated in current analyses.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a study on using delensing to enhance cosmic birefringence measurements based on full-sky, map-based simulations. In our analysis, we neglect foreground contamination and instrumental systematics to isolate the intrinsic impact of delensing on both isotropic and anisotropic birefringence. For the isotropic case, assuming a constant rotation angle of $\beta = 0.35^\circ$, delensing reduces the lensing-induced variance in the EB power spectrum, yielding an improvement in sensitivity of approximately 10% at 6 $\mu$K-arcmin noise and 25-40% at lower noise levels. For the anisotropic case, using simulations at 1 $\mu$K-arcmin noise, we reconstruct the birefringence angle for a scale-invariant spectrum and mitigate lensing bias by delensing, achieving a 50% reduction in the leading $N_{(0)}$ bias and a 30% improvement in the constraints on the amplitude $A_{CB}$. Our results demonstrate that delensing is an effective tool for enhancing the detectability of subtle parity-violating signals in the cosmic microwave background with forthcoming experiments such as the Simons Observatory, CMB-S4, and LiteBIRD.

 - **Abstract**
 Based on the iron and hydrogen similar elliptical morphologies of the type Ia supernova (SN Ia) remnant (SNR) 0509-67.5, I suggest that the ambient gas shaped the SN ejecta, that it is a remnant of an old planetary nebula, and that the explosion was more or less spherical. Adding that there is no observed stellar survivor in this SNR, I conclude that the SN Ia scenarios that best account for the explosion of this SN inside a planetary nebula (SNIP), are the lonely white dwarf scenarios, i.e., the core-degenerate (CD) and the double degenerate (DD) with merger to explosion delay (MED) time, i.e., the DD-MED scenario. Other scenarios encounter challenges, but I cannot completely rule them out. If true, the suggestion of SNR~0509-67.5 being a SNIP implies that the fraction of SNIPs might be higher than the previously estimated 50 percent of all normal SNe Ia. In the frame of the CD and the DD-MED scenarios, I attribute the observed double-shell structure in calcium to Rayleigh-Taylor instability during the explosion process: the caps of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability mushrooms form the outer shell. Instabilities during the explosion process might form clumps of some elements moving much faster than their mean velocity, possibly explaining fast-moving intermediate-mass elements.

 - **Abstract**
 It has been known for many years that there is an apparent trend for the spectral index ({\alpha}) of radio sources to steepen with redshift z, which has led to attempts to select high-redshift objects by searching for radio sources with steep spectra. In this study we use data from the MeerKAT, LOFAR, GMRT, and uGMRT telescopes, particularly using the MIGHTEE and superMIGHTEE surveys, to select compact sources over a wide range of redshifts and luminosities. We investigate the relationship between spectral index, luminosity and redshift and compare our results to those of previous studies. Although there is a correlation between {\alpha} and z in our sample for some combinations of frequency where good data are available, there is a clear offset between the {\alpha}-z relations in our sample and those derived previously from samples of more luminous objects; in other words, the {\alpha}-z relation is different for low and high luminosity sources. The relationships between {\alpha} and luminosity are also weak in our sample but in general the most luminous sources are steeper-spectrum and this trend is extended by samples from previous studies. In detail, we argue that both a {\alpha}-luminosity relation and an {\alpha}-z relation can be found in the data, but it is the former that drives the apparent {\alpha}-z relation observed in earlier work, which only appears because of the strong redshift-luminosity relation in bright, flux density-limited samples. Steep-spectrum selection should be applied with caution in searching for high-z sources in future deep surveys.

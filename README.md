#### Title:
          Evidence for an Instability-Induced Binary Merger in the Double-Peaked, Helium-Rich Type IIn Supernova 2023zkd

 - **Abstract**
 We present ultraviolet to infrared observations of the extraordinary Type IIn supernova 2023zkd (SN 2023zkd). Photometrically, it exhibits persistent and luminous precursor emission spanning $\sim$4 years preceding discovery ($M_r\approx-15$ mag, 1,500~days in the observer frame), followed by a secondary stage of gradual brightening in its final year. Post-discovery, it exhibits two photometric peaks of comparable brightness ($M_r\lesssim-18.7$ mag and $M_r\approx-18.4$ mag, respectively) separated by 240 days. Spectroscopically, SN 2023zkd exhibits highly asymmetric and multi-component Balmer and He I profiles that we attribute to ejecta interaction with fast-moving ($1,\!000-2,\!000\;\mathrm{km}\;\mathrm{s}^{-1}$) He-rich polar material and slow-moving ($\sim$$400\;\mathrm{km}\;\mathrm{s}^{-1}$) equatorially-distributed H-rich material. He II features also appear during the second light curve peak and evolve rapidly. Shock-driven models fit to the multi-band photometry suggest that the event is powered by interaction with $\sim$$5-6\;M_{\odot}$ of CSM, with $2-3\;M_{\odot}$ associated with each light curve peak, expelled during mass-loss episodes $\sim$$3-4$ and $\sim$$1-2$ years prior to explosion. The observed precursor emission, combined with the extreme mass-loss rates required to power each light curve peak, favors either super-Eddington accretion onto a black hole or multiple long-lived eruptions from a massive star to luminosities that have not been previously observed. We consider multiple progenitor scenarios for SN 2023zkd, and find that the brightening optical precursor and inferred explosion properties are most consistent with a massive ($M_{\mathrm{ZAMS}}\geq30\;M_{\odot}$) and partially-stripped He star undergoing an instability-induced merger with a black hole companion.

 - **Abstract**
 The recent astrometric discovery of the nearby (590 pc) massive ($33 M_\odot$) dormant black hole candidate Gaia BH3 offers the possibility to angularly resolve the black hole from its companion star by using optical interferometry. Our aim is to detect emission in the near-infrared K band from the close-in environment of Gaia BH3 caused by accretion. Gaia BH3 was observed with the GRAVITY instrument using the four 8-meter Unit Telescopes of the VLT Interferometer. We searched for the signature of emission from the black hole in the interferometric data using the CANDID, PMOIRED, and exoGravity tools. With a present separation of 18 mas, the Gaia BH3 system can be well resolved angularly by GRAVITY. We did not detect emission from the black hole at a contrast level of $\Delta m = 6.8$ mag with respect to the companion star, that is, $f_\mathrm{BH}/f_* < 0.2\%$. This corresponds to an upper limit on the continuum flux density of $f_\mathrm{BH} < 1.9 \times 10^{-16}$ W m$^{-2}$ ${\mu}$m$^{-1}$ in the K band. In addition, we did not detect emission from the black hole in the hydrogen Br{\gamma} line. The non-detection of near-infrared emission from the black hole in Gaia BH3 indicates that its accretion of the giant star wind is presently occurring at most at a very low rate. This is consistent with the limit of $f_\mathrm{Edd} < 4.9 \times 10^{-7}$ derived previously on the Eddington ratio for an advection-dominated accretion flow. Deeper observations with GRAVITY may be able to detect the black hole as the companion star approaches periastron around 2030.

 - **Abstract**
 White dwarf stars are the most common final stage of stellar evolution. Since the serendipitous discovery of the first white dwarf by William Herschel and the first physical models by Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar and Arthur Eddington, there have been a lot of advances in the field fueled by new observational data. With new astrometric measurements enabling us to identify hundreds of thousands of white dwarf candidates, and spectroscopic surveys revealing a plethora of chemical elements in white dwarf atmospheres pointing at spectral evolution and interaction with planetary bodies, there is a lot we can learn from the characterization of observed white dwarfs. Here we provide an observational overview of white dwarf stars, describing how they are identified and characterized, and the main properties of the observed population.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the impact of neutrino emission via Hawking radiation from primordial black holes (PBHs) on the cosmological effective number of neutrino species, $N_{\mathrm{eff}}$, after neutrino decoupling. By comparing this effect with observational limits, we derive bounds on the abundance of light PBHs. Our analysis incorporates two previously unaccounted-for effects: the emission of secondary neutrinos from unstable particles, which increases $N_{\mathrm{eff}}$, and the modification of the neutrino-photon temperature ratio due to particle emission heating the photon plasma, which lowers $N_{\mathrm{eff}}$. Overall, including these effects allows us to impose constraints on PBH masses with initial masses in the range $10^9~{\rm g}\lesssim M_{\rm ini} \lesssim 10^{13}~{\rm g}$. However, our limits remain less stringent than those derived from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis.

 - **Abstract**
 Current and future surveys rely on machine learning classification to obtain large and complete samples of transients. Many of these algorithms are restricted by training samples that contain a limited number of spectroscopically confirmed events. Here, we present the first real-time application of Active Learning to optimise spectroscopic follow-up with the goal of improving training sets of early type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) classifiers. Using a photometric classifier for early SN Ia, we apply an Active Learning strategy for follow-up optimisation using the real-time FINK broker processing of the ZTF public stream. We perform follow-up observations at the ANU 2.3m telescope in Australia and obtain 92 spectroscopic classified events that are incorporated in our training set. We show that our follow-up strategy yields a training set that, with 25% less spectra, improves classification metrics when compared to publicly reported spectra. Our strategy selects in average fainter events and, not only supernovae types, but also microlensing events and flaring stars which are usually not incorporated on training sets. Our results confirm the effectiveness of active learning strategies to construct optimal training samples for astronomical classifiers. With the Rubin Observatory LSST soon online, we propose improvements to obtain earlier candidates and optimise follow-up. This work paves the way to the deployment of real-time AL follow-up strategies in the era of large surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 Since the recent discovery of the directly imaged super-Jovian planet AF Lep b, several studies have been conducted to characterize its atmosphere and constrain its orbital parameters. AF Lep b has a measured dynamical mass of $3.68 \pm 0.48$ MJup, a radius of $1.3 \pm 0.15$ RJup, a nearly circular orbit in spin-orbit alignment with the host star, a relatively high metallicity, and a near-solar to super-solar C/O ratio. However, key parameters such as the rotational velocity and radial velocity could not be estimated as they require high-resolution spectroscopic data that is impossible to obtain with classical spectrographs. AF Lep b was recently observed with the new HiRISE visitor instrument at the VLT, with the goal of obtaining high-resolution (R~140,000) spectroscopic observations to better constrain the orbital and atmospheric parameters of the young giant exoplanet. We compare the extracted spectrum of AF Lep b to self-consistent atmospheric models using ForMoSA. We then use our measurements of the radial velocity of the planet to provide new constraints on the orbit of the planet. From the forward modeling, we find a C/O ratio that aligns with previous low-resolution analyses, and we confirm the super-solar metallicity. We also confirm unambiguously the presence of methane in the atmosphere of the companion. Based on all available relative astrometry and radial velocity measurements of the host star, we show that two distinct orbital populations are possible for the companion. We derive the radial velocity of AF Lep b to be $10.51 \pm 1.03$ km/s, and show that this value agrees well with one of the two orbital solutions, allowing us to rule out an entire family of orbits. Additionally, assuming that the rotation and orbit are coplanar, the derived planet's rotation rate is consistent with the observed trend of increasing spin velocity with higher planet mass.

          Stellar Models Also Limit Exoplanet Atmosphere Studies in Emission

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar contamination has long been recognized as a major bottleneck in transmission spectroscopy, limiting our ability to accurately characterize exoplanet atmospheres, particularly for terrestrial worlds. In response, significant observational efforts have shifted toward emission spectroscopy as a potentially more robust alternative, exemplified by initiatives such as the 50 hour JWST "Rocky Worlds" Director's Discretionary Time (DDT) program. However, the extent to which emission spectroscopy may be affected by stellar effects remain mostly unexplored, in stark contrast with exploration and mitigation work for transmission spectroscopy. In this study, we assess the impact of imperfect knowledge of stellar spectra on exoplanet atmospheric retrievals from emission spectroscopy. For TRAPPIST-1, a 29 ppm precision on the 15 um eclipse depth is required to differentiate surface albedo with precision of 0.1 at 3 sigma confidence. Yet, we find that current 15 um eclipse depth estimations using different stellar models introduce a 40 to 80 ppm uncertainty. Moreover, such model precision should not be mistaken for a model accuracy, as we also find that JWST MIRI photometric observations of the star in-eclipse at 12.8 and 15 um, acquired with a 90 ppm 1 sigma precision, fall outside the range defined by existing models by 7 to 21 %. This lack of precision and accuracy leads to a degeneracy in retrievals of planetary albedo and impacts the search for atmospheres, effects that could be solved by acquiring the true mid-IR spectrum of the star. We therefore recommend a revised observation design for JWST secondary eclipse measurements in which mid-IR stellar spectra should be systematically acquired alongside eclipse data.

          The Non-Uniform Expansion of the Crab Nebula

 - **Abstract**
 We present extensive proper motion measurements of the Crab Nebula made from Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope MegaPrime/MegaCam images taken in 2007, 2016, and 2019. A total of 19974 proper motion vectors with uncertainty $<10$\,mas\,yr$^{-1}$ located over the majority of the Crab Nebula are used to map the supernova remnant's two-dimensional expansion properties that reflect the dynamics of the original explosion, acceleration of ejecta imparted by spin-down energy from the pulsar, and interaction between the ejecta and surrounding cicumstellar material (CSM). The average convergence date we derive is 1105.5 $\pm$ 0.5 CE, which is 15-35 yr earlier compared to most previous estimates. We find that it varies as a function of position angle around the nebula, with the earliest date and smallest proper motions measured along the equator defined by the east and west bays. The lower acceleration of material along the equatorial plane may be indicative of the supernova's interaction with a disk-like CSM geometry. Comparing our measurements to previous analytical solutions of the Crab's expansion and our own numerical simulation using the moving mesh hydrodynamics code \texttt{Sprout}, we conclude that the ejecta have relaxed closer to homologous expansion than expected for the commonly adopted pulsar spindown age of $\tau \sim 700$ yr and a pulsar wind nebula (PWN) still evolving inside the flat part of the ejecta density profile. These findings provide further evidence that the PWN has broken out of the inner flat part of the supernova ejecta density profile and has experienced ``blowout''.

          Elemental Abundances at Coronal Hole Boundaries as a Means to Investigate Interchange Reconnection and the Solar Wind

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of the slow solar wind is not well understood, unlike the fast solar wind which originates from coronal holes. In-situ elemental abundances of the slow solar wind suggest that it originates from initially closed field lines that become open. Coronal hole boundary regions are a potential source of slow solar wind as there open field lines interact with the closed loops through interchange reconnection. Our primary aim is to quantify the role of interchange reconnection at the boundaries of coronal holes. To this end, we have measured the relative abundances of different elements at these boundaries. Reconnection is expected to modulate the relative abundances through the first ionization potential (FIP) effect. For our analysis we used spectroscopic data from the extreme ultraviolet imaging spectrometer (EIS) on board Hinode. To account for the temperature structure of the observed region we computed the differential emission measure (DEM). Using the DEM we were able to infer the ratio between coronal and photospheric abundances, known as the FIP bias. By examining the variation of the FIP bias moving from the coronal hole to the quiet Sun, we have been able to constrain models of interchange reconnection. The FIP bias variation in the boundary region around the coronal hole has an approximate width of 30-50 Mm, comparable to the size of supergranules. This boundary region is also a source of open flux into interplanetary space. We find that there is an additional ~30% open flux that originates from this boundary region.

          Insight-HXMT observations on thermonuclear X-ray bursts from 4U~1608--52 in the low/hard state: the energy-dependant hard X-ray deficit and cooling saturation of the corona

 - **Abstract**
 During thermonuclear bursts, it is suspected that {\bf the cooling of the corona by the burst emission} may be the cause of hard X-ray {\bf deficits}. Although this {\bf deficit} has been observed in nine sources, it has not been observed {\bf from} 4U~1608--52, a nearby prolific burster. Therefore, the authenticity and universality of the hard X-ray {\bf deficit} may be in question. To investigate this suspicion, Insight-HXMT performed cadence observations during the low/hard state of 4U~1608--52 in September 2022 and detected 10 thermonuclear X-ray bursts. Two of these bursts show a double-peaked structure in the soft X-ray band, which could be caused by the high temperature of the burst emission and a marginal photospheric radius expansion (PRE) around the burst peak time. This is indicated by their peak fluxes being up to the Eddington limit and having a large color factor at the peak of the bursts. The hard X-ray deficit is significantly observed during bursts at $>$ 30 keV. Furthermore, the fraction of this deficit shows saturation at 50\% for the first 8 bursts. This saturation may indicate that the corona is layered and only a part of the corona is cooled by the bursts. For example, the part close to the NS surface is cooled while the rest remains intact during bursts. This result provides a clue to the geometry of the corona, e.g., a possible scenario is that the corona has two forms: a quasi-spheric corona between the NS and the disk, and a disk-corona on both surfaces of the disk.

 - **Abstract**
 IceCube has observed a diffuse astrophysical neutrino flux over the energy region from a few TeV to a few PeV. At PeV energies, the spectral shape is not yet well measured due to the low statistics of the data. This analysis probes the gap between 1 PeV and 10 PeV by using high-energy downgoing muon neutrinos. To reject the large atmospheric muon background, two complementary techniques are combined. The first technique selects events with high stochasticity to reject atmospheric muon bundles whose stochastic energy losses are smoothed due to high muon multiplicity. The second technique vetoes atmospheric muons with the IceTop surface array. Using 9 years of data, we found two neutrino candidate events in the signal region, consistent with expectation from background, each with relatively high signal probabilities. A joint maximum likelihood estimation is performed using this sample and an independent 9.5-year sample of tracks to measure the neutrino spectrum. A likelihood ratio test is done to compare the single power-law (SPL) vs. SPL+cutoff hypothesis; the SPL+cutoff model is not significantly better than the SPL. High-energy astrophysical objects from four source catalogs are also checked around the direction of the two events. No significant coincidence was found.

 - **Abstract**
 Solar flares are regularly observed in extreme ultraviolet (EUV), soft X-rays (SXR), and hard X-rays (HXR). However, those in near and mid-UV are sparse. The Solar Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (SUIT) onboard the Aditya-L1, launched on 2nd September, 2023 provides regular observations in the 200-400 nm wavelength range through eleven filters. Here, we report the observation of the X6.3 flare on Feb 22, 2024 using eight narrow band (NB) filters of SUIT. We have also used co-spatiotemporal observations from SDO/AIA, Solar Orbiter/STIX, GONG H$\alpha$, Aditya-L1/SoLEXS and GOES. We obtained light curves over the flaring region from AIA 1600, 1700 Å and GONG H$\alpha$ and compared them with the disk-integrated lightcurve obtained from GOES and SoLEXS SXR and STIX HXR. We find that the flare peaks in SUIT NB01, NB03, NB04, and NB08 filters simultaneously with HXR, 1600, and 1700 Å along with the peak temperature obtained from SoLEXS. In contrast, in NB02 and NB05, the flare peaks $\sim$ 2 minutes later than the HXR peak, while in NB06 and NB07, the flare peaks $\sim$ 3 minutes after the GOES soft X-ray peak. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first observation of a flare in these wavelengths (except in NB03, NB04 and NB05). Moreover, for the first time, we show the presence of a bright kernel in NB02. These results demonstrate the capabilities of SUIT observations in flare studies.

 - **Abstract**
 The sensitivity of axion dark matter searches depends on the signal window that results from the velocity dispersion of axion dark matter. Since the ratio of signal windows is about 6500 between the standard halo and the big flow axion dark matter, each axion dark matter search usually uses a separate data acquisition (DAQ) channel with a different frequency resolution bandwidth (RBW). In this work, we demonstrate axion dark matter searches covering the standard halo, the tidal stream, and the big flow employing a DAQ channel starting with a single high resolution RBW, without sacrificing the DAQ efficiency, where the DAQ process includes online fast Fourier transforms and writing the outputs to disk. Assuming the total amount of data is sensitive to Dine-Fischler-Srednicki-Zhitnitskii (DFSZ) axion dark matter that follows the standard halo model and makes up 100\% of the local dark matter density, the same data can also be used for the tidal stream and the big flow axion dark matter searches that would be sensitive to DFSZ axion dark matter that constitute 19.2\% and 12.4\% of the local dark matter densities, respectively, at a 90\% confidence level. We also report that the filtering of the individual power spectra acquired with a relatively high resolution RBW e.g., for the big flow search can prevent a possible significant degradation in the signal to noise ratio from the searches in the lower resolution RBW's, i.e., the standard halo and tidal stream searches.

          Insight-HXMT observations on thermonuclear X-ray bursts from 4U~1608--52 in 2022: the accretion rate dependent anisotropy of burst emission

 - **Abstract**
 Thermonuclear X-ray bursts occur on the surface of an accreting neutron star (NS), and their characteristics and interplay with the surrounding circumstance could be a clue to understand the nature of the NS and accretion process. For this purpose, Insight-HXMT has performed high cadence observations on the bright thermonuclear X-ray burster--4U~1608--52 during its outburst in July and August 2022; nine bursts were detected, including seven bursts with the photospheric radius expansion (PRE). Time-resolved spectroscopy of the bright PRE bursts reveals that an enhancement of accretion rate or the Comptonization of the burst emission by the corona could reduce the residuals when fitting their spectra with the conventional model--blackbody. The inferred energy increment rate of the burst photon gained from the corona is up to $\sim$40\%, even though the bursts have different peak fluxes and locate at different accretion rates. Moreover, the flux shortage of the rising PRE is observed in the bursts at a high mass accretion rate, but not for the burst with a faint persistent emission, which has been predicted theoretically but first observed in this work. If the flux shortage is due to the disk obscuration, i.e., the burst emission is anisotropic, the phenomenon above could indicate that the anisotropy of the burst emission is accretion rate dependent, which could also be evidence of the truncated disk in the low/hard state.

 Context. When leaving the main sequence (MS) for the red-giant branch (RGB), subgiant stars undergo fast structural changes. Consequently, their observed oscillation spectra mirror these changes, constituting key tracers of stellar structure and evolution. However, the complexity of their spectra makes their modelling an arduous task, which few authors have undertaken. Gemma (KIC11026764) is a young subgiant with $45$ precise oscillation modes observed with Kepler, making it the ideal benchmark for seismic modelling. Aims. This study is aimed at modelling the subgiant Gemma, taking advantage of most of the precise seismic information available. This approach enables us to pave the way for the seismic modelling of evolved solar-like stars and provide the relevant insights into their structural evolution. Methods. Using our Levenberg-Marquardt stellar modelling tool, we built a family of models representative of Gemma's measured seismic indicators obtained via our seismic tool, EGGMiMoSA. We studied the structural information these indicators hold by carefully varying stellar parameters. We also complemented the characterisation with information held by \who indicators and non-seismic data. Results. From the extensive set of models we built and using most of the seismic information at hand, including two $\ell=1$ and one $\ell=2$ mixed modes, we were able to probe the chemical transition at the hydrogen-burning shell. Indeed, we have demonstrated that among our models, only the ones with the sharpest chemical gradient are able to reproduce all the seismic information considered. One possibility to account for such a gradient is the inclusion of a significant amount of overshooting, namely $\alpha_{\textrm{ov}}=0.17$, which is unexpected for low-mass stars such as Gemma (expected mass of about $1.15~M_{\odot}$).

 - **Abstract**
 Machine learning is a useful tool for identifying radio pulses from cosmic-ray air showers and for cleaning such pulses from radio background. This can lower the detection threshold and increase the accuracy for the pulse time and amplitude. We have trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) using CoREAS simulations and background recorded by a prototype station at the IceTop surface array at the South Pole and have applied them to air-shower measurements by this station. The station consists of 3 SKALA antennas and 8 scintillators, which are used to trigger the readout of the antennas upon a sixfold coincidence. Afterwards, the radio signal is filtered to the band of 70-350 MHz. By applying neural networks to search for radio signals in about four months of data, we find about five times more events than by a traditional method based on a signal-to-noise ratio cut after filtering for radio frequency interferences. Despite the lower threshold, the purity of the selected events seems to improve, and the angular resolution of the radio measurements does not deteriorate, which we have confirmed by a comparison of the reconstructed shower direction with IceTop. This analysis thus provides experimental confirmation that neural networks can indeed be used to clean air-shower radio signals from background and to lower the radio detection threshold of hybrid arrays combining particle and radio detectors.

 - **Abstract**
 With a mass, radius, and mean density similar to Earth's, the rocky planet GJ 1132 b is the first truly small planet for which an atmosphere detection was proposed. If confirmed, ultra-reduced magma outgassing is the only mechanism capable of producing HCN and H$_2$O in large enough quantities to match the HST observations. The proposed atmosphere detection, however was challenged by reanalysis of the same HST data by different teams. Recent JWST observations returned ambiguous results due to the unaccounted for variability seen between two different visits. Here we report the analysis of three CRIRES+ transit observations of GJ 1132 b in order to determine the presence or absence of He I, HCN, CH$_4$, and H$_2$O in its atmosphere. We are unable to detect the presence of any of these species in the atmosphere of GJ 1132 b assuming a clear, H$_2$-dominated atmosphere, although we can place upper limits for the volume mixing ratios of CH$_4$, HCN, and H$_2$O using injections tests and atmospheric retrievals. These retrieved upper limits show the capability of CRIRES+ to detecting chemical species in rocky exoplanets, if the atmosphere is H$_2$ dominated. The detection of the atmospheres of small planets with high mean molecular weight, and the capability to distinguish between the variability introduced by stellar activity and/or the planetary atmosphere will require high-resolution spectrographs in the upcoming extremely large telescopes.

 - **Abstract**
 We use the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) to observe the bright millisecond pulsar (MSP) PSR B1937+21 (J1939+2134) and record the data in the band from 1.0 GHz to 1.5 GHz. We measure the neutral hydrogen (HI) emission and absorption lines near 1420 MHz ($\lambda \simeq 21$ cm). We derive the kinematic distance of the pulsar with the HI observation, and update the upper bound of kinematic distance from the previous $14.8\pm 0.9$ npc in the Outer Arm to the nearer $9.4\pm 0.5$ kpc in the Perseus Arm. By comparing with the archival absorption spectra observed decades ago, we notice possible variations in the absorption spectra towards this pulsar, which corresponds to a possible tiny-scale atomic structure (TSAS) of a few AU in size. We also verify the apparent faster-than-light anomalous dispersion at the HI absorption line of this pulsar previously reported.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of a transiting brown dwarf orbiting a low-mass star, TOI-6508b. Today, only ~50 transiting brown dwarfs have been discovered. TOI-6508b was first detected with data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) in Sectors 10, 37, and 63. Ground-based follow-up photometric data were collected with the SPECULOOS-South and LCOGT-1.0m telescopes, and RV measurements were obtained with the Near InfraRed Planet Searcher (NIRPS) spectrograph. We find that TOI-6508b has a mass of Mp=72.5+7.6-5.1MJup and a radius of Rp=1.03+/-0.03RJup. Our modeling shows that the data are consistent with an eccentric orbit of 19day and an eccentricity of e=0.28+0.09-0.08. TOI-6508b has a mass ratio of M_BD/Ms=0.40, makes it the second highest mass ratio brown dwarf that transits a low-mass star. The host has a mass of Ms=0.174+/-0.004M_Sun, a radius of Rs=0.205+/-0.006R_Sun, an effective temperature of Teff=2930+/-70K, and a metallicity of [Fe/H]=-0.22+/-0.08. This makes TOI-6508b an interesting discovery that has come to light in a region still sparsely populated.

 - **Abstract**
 The Enhanced Resolution Imager and Spectrograph (ERIS) is the new Adaptive-Optics (AO) assisted Infrared instrument at the Very Large Telescope (VLT). Its refurbished Integral Field Spectrograph (IFS) SPIFFIER leverages a new AO module, enabling high-contrast imaging applications and giving access to the orbital and atmospheric characterisation of super-Jovian exoplanets. We test the detection limits of ERIS and demonstrate its scientific potential by exploring the atmospheric composition of the young super-Jovian AF Lep b and improving its orbital solution by measuring its radial velocity relative to its host star. We present new spectroscopic observations of AF Lep b in $K$-band at $R\sim 11000$ obtained with ERIS/SPIFFIER at the VLT. We reduce the data using the standard pipeline together with a custom wavelength calibration routine, and remove the stellar PSF using principal component analysis along the spectral axis. We compute molecular maps by cross-correlating the residuals with molecular spectral templates and measure the radial velocity of the planet relative to the star. Furthermore, we compute contrast grids for molecular mapping by injecting fake planets. We detect a strong signal from H$_{2}$O and CO but not from CH$_{4}$ or CO$_{2}$. This result corroborates the hypothesis of chemical disequilibrium in the atmosphere of AF Lep b. Our measurement of the RV of the planet yields $\Delta v_{\mathrm{R,P\star}} = 7.8 \pm 1.7$ km s$^{-1}$. This enables us to disentangle the degeneracy of the orbital solution, namely the correct longitude of the ascending node is $\Omega=248^{+0.4}_{-0.7}$ deg and the argument of periapsis is $\omega=109^{+13}_{-21}$ deg. Our results demonstrate the competitiveness of the new ERIS/SPIFFIER instrument for the orbital and atmospheric characterisation of exoplanets at high contrast and small angular separation.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the spectroscopic confirmation of the background source of the most distant Einstein ring known to date, the COSMOS-Web ring. This system consists of a complete Einstein ring at $z=5.1$, lensed by a massive early-type galaxy at $z\sim2$. The redshift $z=5.1043\pm0.0004$ is unambiguously identified with our NOEMA and Keck/MOSFIRE spectroscopy, where the NOEMA observations reveal the CO(4-3) and CO(5-4) lines at $>8\,\sigma$, and the MOSFIRE data detect [O\textsc{ii}] at $\sim 6\,\sigma$. Using multi-wavelength photometry spanning near-infrared to radio bands, we find that the lensed galaxy is a dust-obscured starburst ($M_{\star} \sim 1.8\times10^{10}\,{\rm M_{\odot}}$, ${\rm SFR_{IR}\sim 60\,{\rm M_{\odot}} ~yr^{-1}}$) with high star-formation efficiency (gas depletion time $\tau_{\rm dep}<100~$Myr) as indicated by the [C\textsc{i}](1-0) non-detection. The redshift confirmation revalidates that the total lens mass budget within the Einstein radius is fully accounted for by the stellar and dark matter components, without the need of modifying the initial mass function or dark matter distribution profile. This work paves the way for detailed studies and future follow-ups of this unique lensing system, providing an ideal laboratory for studying mass distribution at $z\sim2$ and physical conditions of star formation at $z\sim5$.

 - **Abstract**
 We show that the merger tree of dark matter halos is approximately self-similar by investigating the universality of the subhalo peak mass function (PMF) describing the mass distribution of progenitor halos. Using a set of cosmological simulations and identifying subhalos of different merger levels with HBT+, we verify that the level-1 subhalo PMF is close to universal across halo mass, redshift, and cosmology. This approximate self-similarity allows us to analytically derive the subhalo PMF for subhalos accreted at any level (i.e., for sub-sub...halos) through self-convolutions of the level-1 PMF, and the resulting model shows good agreement with simulation measurements. We further derive a number of analytical properties on the hierarchical origin of subhalos, including the level distribution, accretion rate at each level, initial merger ratio distribution, and accretion redshift distribution. We find that higher-level subhalos dominate at progressively lower peak mass in the PMF and are more likely to originate from major mergers than lower-level ones. At a given mass ratio at accretion time, the subhalo accretion rates at each level track the growth rate of the host halo. At a fixed final mass ratio, however, the accretion redshift distribution of subhalos depends on the subhalo level, peak mass, and host mass. Higher-level and higher-mass-ratio subhalos tend to be accreted more recently, and more massive halos also accrete their subhalos more recently. Our model provides a concise summary of simulation results and can serve as a basis for further theoretical understanding of the hierarchical structure formation.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper we study the behavior of test particles on top of a galactic-type of Fuzzy Dark Matter (FDM) structure, characterized by the core-halo density profile found in simulations. Our workhorse structure is an anisotropic, time-dependent, virialized core-tail FDM clump resulting from a multicore merger. For our analysis we allow this structure to keep evolving, which implies that the core oscillates and accretes matter from the halo, while the halo dynamics is dominated by its characteristic high kinetic energy. On top of this time-dependent structure that in turn has a time-dependent gravitational potential, we solve the motion equations of test particles with initial conditions associated to circular orbits at different radii. Our results indicate that: 1) no trajectory remains circular, 2) the trajectories are sensitive to initial conditions and 3) the departure of initially near trajectories has always a positive Lyapunov exponent. A qualitative result is that the motion of test particles is more erratic with a bigger Lyapunov exponent within and near the core than in the halo region, which can be understood in terms of the random motion of the core within the core-halo structure. We expect these results warn on the importance of the anisotropic and time-dependent nature of FDM clumps when studying the motion of test particles.

          Discovery of WINERED-HVS1: A metal-rich hyper-velocity star candidate ejected from the Galactic center

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of a metal-rich red giant star, WINERED-HVS1, which is a candidate for a hyper-velocity star (HVS). Its past trajectory suggests that this star may have been ejected by the Galactic supermassive black hole (SMBH; Sgr A*) about 14 Myr ago, with a modest ejection velocity of at least 500 km/s. Since WINERED-HVS1 is gravitationally bound to the Milky Way and is not necessarily young, it is not an unambiguous HVS candidate from a kinematic perspective, unlike the previously confirmed A-type main-sequence HVS known as S5-HVS1. Therefore, the chemical characterization of this star is essential for understanding its origin. Through a spectroscopic follow-up observation with Magellan/WINERED, we determined its metallicity [Fe/H]=$-0.136^{+0.040}_{-0.038}$, as well as the abundances for Na, Mg, Si, S, K, Ca, Ti, Cr, Ni, and Sr. The high metallicity value suggests that this star was ejected from the Galactic center and is unlikely to be a halo star with a radial orbit. The abundance pattern of this star -- including the pattern of [$\alpha$/Fe], [Mg/Fe], [Si/Mg], and [Ca/Mg] -- is consistent with that of the nuclear star cluster surrounding the SMBH, further supporting our view. This discovery opens a new window to look through the Galactic center environment without the hindrance of dust extinction, by using the HVSs moving in the halo region where dust extinction is minimal.

          Inferring Black Hole Spin from Interferometric Measurements of the First Photon Ring: A Geometric Approach

 - **Abstract**
 Accurately inferring black hole spin is crucial for understanding black hole dynamics and their astrophysical environments. In this work, we outline a geometric method for spin estimation by using the interferometric shape of the first photon ring ($n=1$) as an approximation to the critical curve, which, given an assumed value of the black hole inclination, is then mapped to a spin value. While future space-based missions will capture a wealth of data on the first photon ring--including the full angle-dependent diameter, angular brightness profile, and astrometric offset from the $n=0$ ring--our analysis is restricted to using only two angle-dependent diameters to compute its shape asymmetry and infer spin. Focusing on low inclinations and moderate-to-high spins, we test the method across various emission models, baselines, and noise sources, including a mock space-based observation. Although the size of the $n=1$ ring depends on the emission model, its interferometric shape remains a robust spin probe at low inclinations. We find that the inferred asymmetry of the $n=1$ image may be biased by the critical curve morphology, and it can be heavily skewed by the presence of noise, whether astrophysical or instrumental. In low-noise limits at low viewing inclination, significant contributions from the n=0 image at short baselines may lead to a downward bias in asymmetry estimates. While our method can estimate high spins in noise-free time-averaged images, increasing the noise and astrophysical variability degrades the resulting constraints, providing only lower bounds on the spin when applied to synthetic observed data. Remarkably, even using only the ring's asymmetry, we can establish lower bounds on the spin, underscoring the promise of photon ring-based spin inference in future space-based very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) missions, such as the proposed Black Hole Explorer (BHEX).

          Observational Signatures of a Previous Dynamical Instability in Multi-planet M-Dwarf Systems

 - **Abstract**
 We identify observational signatures suggesting a history of dynamical instability in 26 out of 34 M-dwarf multi-planet systems containing no large planets. These systems may have primarily formed in a gas-rich environment, potentially hosted more planets and were more compact. We extend previous simulations of the formation of the TRAPPIST-1 system to 100 Myr to test the stability of these systems without gas. We find the absence of a strong mean motion resonance in the innermost planet pair and the absence of three body resonances throughout the system are likely to result in the merging and ejection of planets after the gas disk disperses. The runs that experience such an instability tend to produce final systems with lower multiplicities, period ratios larger than two, increased orbital spacings, higher planetary angular momentum deficits, and slightly smaller mass ratios between adjacent planets. Remarkably, we find these same trends in the observations of M-dwarf multi-planet systems containing no large planets. Our work allows us to identify specific systems that may have experienced an instability and suggests that only ~25% of these systems formed in their current observed state while most systems were likely more compact and multiplicitous earlier in time. Previous research indicates that systems that have experienced a late stage giant impact may host planets potentially more habitable than the systems that did not. With this in mind, we suggest systems around M-dwarfs that contain period ratios larger than two be given priority in the search for habitable worlds.

          Investigating the influence of the radiative torque disruption on the size evolution of dust in the heliosphere

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we conduct a detailed study on the effect of Radiative Torque Disruption (RATD) mechanism on the fragmentation of micrometer-sized dust grains into nanoparticles within the heliosphere. We start by estimating the disruption timescales for dust grains under various centrifugal stresses. Our numerical calculations demonstrate that RATD is a highly effective mechanism for breaking down micrometer-sized grains, producing nanoparticles more efficiently than other fragmentation processes. RATD also prevents micrometer-sized grains from being expelled by radiation pressure. Our findings indicate that the location of the present water snow line depends not only on temperature but also on the size of dust grains. For smaller grains, the snow line can shift outward beyond the position defined by thermal sublimation. Furthermore, we model the size distribution of dust grains modified by the RATD mechanism using a simplified model, showing that rotational disruption significantly decreases the number density of micrometer-sized grains while substantially increasing the number density of sub-micrometer-sized grains. However, the fraction of dust grains aligned at high-$J$ attractors by radiative torques less than 80\% can considerably weaken the effect of RATD on the grain size distribution. Finally, we suggest several experiments that could potentially test the RATD mechanism and discuss the uncertainties of our model in more realistic applications to heliospheric dust.

          Linear matter density perturbations in the $Λ_{\rm s}$CDM model: Examining growth dynamics and addressing the $S_8$ tension

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate linear matter density perturbations in the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM, in which the $\Lambda$ is replaced by late-time ($z\sim2$) mirror AdS-dS transition, resulting in distinct growth dynamics. We use two complementary approaches: (i) determining the initial density contrast and its evolution rate for a given collapse scale factor, (ii) computing the collapse scale factor for a specified initial density contrast and evolution rate. We derive analytical solutions for the growth rate $f=\Omega_{\rm m}^\gamma$ and growth index $\gamma$ in both models. Prior to the transition, the AdS-like $\Lambda$ reduces cosmic friction, causing linear matter density perturbations to grow more rapidly than in $\Lambda$CDM; this effect is most pronounced just before the transition, with a growth rate around $15\%$ higher than $\Lambda$CDM around $z\sim2$. After the transition, $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM behaves similarly to $\Lambda$CDM but features a larger cosmological constant, leading to higher $H(z)$ and greater cosmic friction that more effectively suppresses growth. Before the transition, $\gamma$ remains below both the $\Lambda$CDM and EdS values ($\gamma\approx6/11$); during the transition, it increases rapidly and then grows gradually, paralleling $\Lambda$CDM while remaining slightly higher in the post-transition era-though overall, it stays near $\gamma\sim0.55$. Using the Planck best-fit values, $\Omega_{\rm m0}=0.28$ for $\Lambda_{\mathrm{s}}$CDM and $\Omega_{\rm m0}=0.32$ for $\Lambda$CDM, we find $f=0.49$ and $f=0.53$, respectively. $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM predicts a value of $f=0.48$, recently obtained from LSS data when $\gamma$ is treated as a free parameter in $\Lambda$CDM. This suggests that $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM may resolve the structure growth anomaly, without deviating from $\gamma \sim 0.55$.

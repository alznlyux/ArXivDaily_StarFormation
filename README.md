- **Abstract**
 We present the first stellar stream discovered with the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, around spiral galaxy M61 (NGC 4303) in Virgo First Look imaging. The stream is narrow, radially-oriented in projection, and ~50 kpc long. It has g-band surface brightness (SB) mu_g ~ 28 AB mag arcsec^-2, color g-z ~ 1.0, and stellar mass M_* ~ 2x10^8 M_Sun. This dwarf galaxy interaction may have provoked the M61 starburst, and foreshadows the bounty of accretion features expected in the ten-year Rubin Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST).

- **Abstract**
 The amount of surface water is thought to be critical for a planet's climate stability and thus habitability. However, the probability that a rocky planet may exhibit surface water at any point its evolution is dependent on multiple factors, such as the initial water mass, geochemical evolution, and interior composition. To date, studies have examined the influence of interior composition on the water inventory of the planet or how surface oceans may be impacted by planet topography individually. Here, we provide the first exploration on the impact of interior composition, topography, and planet radius on the water inventory of rocky planets using a sample of 689 rocky planets with spectroscopically derived stellar abundances from APOGEE and GALAH. We find that the oxidation state of the mantle (FeO content) significantly impacts the mantle water storage capacity and potential for surface flooding. For an FeO ~11 wt%, the water storage capacity of a 1 M$_\oplus$ is 2 times that of Earth, indicating that the oxidation state may reduce the amount of surface water. We quantify the impact of topography on seafloor pressures, showing that flat topographies are more likely to be flooded for all planet compositions and radii. We also find that Mars-like topographies are more likely to have seafloor pressures that may form high-pressure ice, reducing seafloor weathering. Thus, for the first time, we show that the composition and topography of the mantle influence the water inventory of rocky planets.

          Numerical Studies on the Radio Afterglows in TDE: Bow Shock

- **Abstract**
 The origin of radio afterglows or delayed radio flares in tidal disruption events (TDEs) is not fully understood. They could be generated either by a forward shock (FS) propagating into diffuse circumnuclear medium (CNM), or a bow shock (BS) around a dense cloud, each of which is fundamentally different. To elucidate the distinctions between these two scenarios, we conducted two-fluid simulations incorporating relativistic electrons to investigate the spatial evolution of these electrons after being accelerated by shock. Based on their spatial distribution, we performed radiative transfer calculations to obtain the synchrotron spectra. In Paper I (Mou 2025), we reported the results for the FS scenario; in this article, we focus on the BS scenario. Compared to that from the FS, the radio emission from the BS exhibits a higher peak frequency, and its flux shows a much steeper rise and a more rapid decline. The radio flux from the BS also responds to fluctuations in the outflow. The combined effects of the BS and FS substantially alter radio spectra, causing significant deviations from the single-zone emission model, and in some cases producing double-peaked or flat-top features in spectra. This study highlights the importance of the BS, and inspires a novel approach for probing dense gas on sub-parsec scales in galactic nuclei by decomposing the BS radio spectrum to reveal the conditions of circumnuclear dense gas.

- **Abstract**
 Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has been approaching its 2025 October 29 perihelion while opposite the Sun from Earth, hindering ground-based optical observations over the preceding month. However, this geometry placed the comet within the fields of view of several space-based solar coronagraphs and heliospheric imagers, enabling its continued observation during its final approach toward perihelion. We report photometry from STEREO-A's SECCHI HI1 and COR2, SOHO's LASCO C3, and GOES-19's CCOR-1 instruments in 2025 September--October, which show a rapid rise in the comet's brightness scaling with heliocentric distance r as r^(-7.5+/-1.0). CCOR-1 also resolves the comet as an extended source with an apparent coma ~4' in diameter. Furthermore, LASCO color photometry shows the comet to be distinctly bluer than the Sun, consistent with gas emission contributing a substantial fraction of the visible brightness near perihelion.

- **Abstract**
 Observational studies of HII region-molecular cloud interactions constrain models of feedback and quantify its impact on the surrounding environment. A recent hypothesis proposes that a characteristic spectral signature in ground state hyperfine lines of hydroxyl (OH) -- the OH flip -- may trace gas that is dynamically interacting with an expanding HII region, offering a new means of probing such interactions. We explore this hypothesis using dedicated Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) observations of three Galactic HII regions, G049.205$-$0.343, G034.256+0.145 and G024.471+0.492, in 1--2 GHz continuum emission, all four 18-cm ground-state OH lines, and multiple hydrogen radio recombination lines. A Gaussian decomposition of the molecular gas data reveals complex OH emission and absorption across our targets. We detect the OH flip towards two of our sources, G049.205$-$0.343 and G034.256+0.145, finding agreement between key predictions of flip hypothesis and the observed multi-wavelength spectra, kinematics and morphology. Specifically, we demonstrate a strong spatial and kinematic association between the OH flip and the ionized gas of the HII regions -- the first time this has been demonstrated for resolved sources -- and evidence from $^{13}$CO(1--0) data that the expected OH component originates from the non-disturbed gas of the parent cloud. While we detect no flip in G024.471+0.492, we do find evidence of interacting molecular gas traced by OH, providing further support for OH's ability to trace HII region-molecular cloud interactions.

- **Abstract**
 Circumbinary configurations offer a test of planet formation in an altered environment, where the inner binary has perturbed a protoplanetary disc. Comparisons of the physical and orbital parameters between the circumbinary planet population and the population of exoplanets orbiting single stars will reveal how these disc perturbations affect the assembly of planets. Circumbinary exoplanets detected thus far typically have masses $< 3 \,\rm M_{jup}$ raising the question of whether high-mass circumbinary planets are possible, and also whether population features such as the brown dwarf desert would appear in circumbinary configurations like for single star systems. Here, we report observations taken with the SOPHIE high-resolution spectrograph. These observations reveal an $m_{\rm b}\,\sin i_{\rm b} = 20.9 \,\rm M_{jup}$ outer companion, on an eccentric ($e = 0.43$), $1800\,\rm d$ orbit, which we call BEBOP-4 (AB) b. Using dynamical arguments we constrain the true mass $m_{\rm b}< 26.3 \,\rm M_{jup}$. The inner binary's two eclipsing stellar components have masses $M_{\rm A} = 1.51\,\rm M_\odot$, and $M_{\rm B} = 0.46\,\rm M_\odot$. Their orbital period is $72\,\rm d$, and their eccentricity is $0.27$. This system contains the longest period binary surveyed by the BEBOP project. BEBOP-4b is expected to be detectable using Gaia DR4 single epoch astrometric measurements. Despite a large period ratio of $\sim 25:1$, the substantial eccentricities of both orbits mean that the outer orbit is on the edge of orbital stability, and located in between two destabilising secular resonances. Should the outer companion survive, the BEBOP-4 system appears like a precursor to several post-common envelope binaries exhibiting eclipse timing variations where very massive circumbinary companions have been proposed.

- **Abstract**
 We present a statistical framework that establishes an accelerating star formation scenario for dense clumps using ATLASGAL and ALMAGAL samples. By employing the cumulative distribution function of dust temperature as a monotonic evolutionary indicator, we linearize clump evolution into a normalized timescale, enabling direct comparison across different samples. The virial mass of clumps increases exponentially with this normalized time, revealing an accelerating buildup of star-forming gas within protoclusters. The evolution of the maximum core mass further shows that the growth timescales of protoclusters and their embedded most massive protostars are comparable, implying a self-similar acceleration of star formation from the stellar to the protocluster scale. This unified framework naturally reproduces the observed evolution of luminosity, the core mass function, the mass growth of the most massive protostars, and the dense gas star formation law on clump scales, establishing a coherent picture of accelerating star formation across scales.

- **Abstract**
 The distribution of the coronal electron density at different distances from the Sun strongly influences the physical processes in the solar corona and is therefore a very important topic in solar physics. Most methods, including radio observations, used for estimating coronal electron density were not fully validated due to the absence of in situ observations closer to the Sun. Consequently, space weather forecasting models that simulate coronal density lacked proper validation. Newly available PSP in situ observations at distances close to the Sun provide an opportunity to study plasma properties near the Sun and to compare observational and modeling results. This work studies type III bursts, estimates their propagation path, and validates coronal electron density obtained from radio, in situ observations, and modeling with EUHFORIA. Type III bursts observed during the second PSP perihelion are analyzed using radio triangulation and modeling. We determine 3D positions of radio sources and use EUHFORIA to estimate electron densities at various locations. The electron densities derived from radio observations and EUHFORIA modeling are inter-validated with in situ PSP measurements. We studied 11 type III bursts during the second PSP perihelion, with radio triangulation showing propagation paths southward from the solar ecliptic plane. Radio source sizes ranged from 0.5 to 40 deg (0.5 to 25 Rs) with no clear frequency dependence, indicating that scattering of radio waves was not very significant. Comparison of electron densities from radio triangulation, PSP data, and EUHFORIA modeling showed a large range of values, influenced by different propagation paths and model limitations. Despite these variations, EUHFORIA identified high-density regions along type III burst paths.

- **Abstract**
 The astrophysical origin of the rapid neutron-capture process (r-process), which produces about half of the elements heavier than iron, remains uncertain. The oldest, most metal-poor stars preserve the chemical signatures of early nucleosynthesis events and can reveal the nature of the r-process sites. We present a homogeneous chemical abundance analysis of ten r-process-enhanced, metal-poor stars that show strong enrichment in r-process elements with minimal contamination from other nucleosynthetic sources. Using high-resolution, high signal-to-noise spectra, we examined over 1400 absorption lines per star through equivalent width measurements and spectral synthesis under one-dimensional LTE assumptions with the MOOG radiative transfer code. Abundances for 54 chemical species were derived, including 29 neutron-capture elements spanning the full r-process pattern. We quantified the cosmic scatter of elemental ratios relative to Zr (light) and Eu (heavy) and found remarkably small dispersions for the rare-earth and third-peak elements, {\sigma}[La/Eu] = 0.08 dex and {\sigma}[Os/Eu] = 0.11 dex, while the light-to-heavy ratio shows slightly larger variation, {\sigma}[Zr/Eu] = 0.18 dex. A kinematic study indicates that the stars likely originated from ten distinct progenitor systems, allowing us to probe the intrinsic variation between independent r-process events. These results imply that the main r-process operates under highly uniform conditions across diverse astrophysical sites.

- **Abstract**
 The scope of this paper is focused on the question if gas is transported to dense clumps inside high-mass star-forming regions through filamentary structures on a scale of several parsecs to the sub-parsec scale. We quantify the gas flows from a scale of up to several parsecs down to the sub-parsec scale along filamentary structures. In this work the accretion flow mechanisms based on gas kinematic data in the three high-mass star-forming regions G75.78, IRAS21078+5211 and NGC7538 are studied with data obtained from the IRAM 30 m telescope. The analysis is carried out using the surface density derived from 1.2 mm continuum emission and velocity differences estimated from HCO+ and H13CO+ molecular line data.

- **Abstract**
 Aims. eROSITA on board of the Spectrum Roentgen Gamma (SRG) spacecraft performed its first X-ray all-sky survey (eRASS1) between December 2019 and June 2020. It detected about 930000 sources, providing us with an unprecedented opportunity for a detailed blazar census. We present the properties of blazars and blazar candidates in eRASS1 and the compilation of the eROSITA blazar catalog. Methods. We compile a list of blazar and blazar candidates from the literature and match it with the eRASS1 catalog, creating the Blazars in eRASS1 (BlazEr1) catalog. For sources with more than 50 counts we obtain their X-ray spectral properties. We compile multiwavelength data from the radio to the gamma-ray regimes for all sources, including multiwavelength spectral indices and redshifts. The full catalog is available online. Results. We present the BlazEr1 catalog, containing 5865 sources, of which 2106 are associated with confirmed blazars. For 3668 sources, eROSITA provides the first X-ray data. The contamination from non-blazar sources of the entire sample is less than 11%. Most candidates exhibit properties typical for blazars. We present properties of the entire X-ray detected blazar population, including the distributions of X-ray luminosities and photon indices, multiwavelength properties, and the blazar log N-log S distribution. Our catalog provides follow up targets, such as potential MeV and TeV blazars. Conclusions. The BlazEr1 catalog provides a compilation of X-ray detected blazars and blazar candidates. The catalog serves as a starting point for exploiting further eROSITA surveys using the same methodology, enabling us to study the X-ray variability and a large number of spectral energy distributions of blazars in the future.

          Tidal dissipation and spin-orbit alignment due to the precessional instability in convection zones in rotating giant planets and stars

- **Abstract**
 Tidal dissipation in star-planet systems occurs through various mechanisms, including the precessional instability. This is an instability of laminar flows (``Poincaré flows") forced by axial precession of a rotating, oblate, spin-orbit misaligned fluid planet or star, which excites inertial waves in convective regions if the dimensionless precession rate (``Poincaré number" $\mathrm{Po}$) is sufficiently large. We constrain the contribution of the precessional instability to tidal dissipation and heat transport, using Cartesian hydrodynamical simulations in a small patch of a planet, and study its interaction with turbulent convection, modelled as rotating Rayleigh-Bénard convection. The precessional instability without convection results in laminar flow at low values and turbulent flow at sufficiently high values of $\mathrm{Po}$. The associated tidal dissipation rate scales as $\mathrm{Po}^2$ and $\mathrm{Po}^3$ in each regime, respectively. With convection, the Poincaré number at which turbulent flow is achieved shifts to lower values for stronger convective driving. Convective motions also act on large-scale tidal flows like an effective viscosity, resulting in continuous tidal dissipation (scaling as $\mathrm{Po}^2$), which obfuscates or suppresses tidal dissipation due to precessional instability. The effective viscosities obtained agree with scaling laws previously derived using (rotating) mixing-length theory. By evaluating our scaling laws using interior models of Hot Jupiters, we find that the precessional instability is significantly more efficient than the effective viscosity of convection. The former drives alignment in 1 Gyr for a Jupiter-like planet orbiting within 23 days. Linearly excited inertial waves can be even more effective for wider orbits, aligning spins for orbits within 53-142 days.
